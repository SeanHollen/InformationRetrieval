   Iran recalled all its ambassadors from European Common Market
nations Tuesday and Britain expelled an Iranian envoy as the
diplomatic battle grew over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death
threats against author Salman Rushdie.
   In Washington, President Bush said he supported the retaliatory
moves by the European countries.
   However offensive Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' may be
to Moslems, ``inciting murder and offering rewards for its
perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized
behavior,'' Bush said.
   The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.
Bush noted existing economic sanctions against Iran and said: ``I
don't know where we'll go from there.''
   In Ottawa, Foreign Minister Joe Clark said Tuesday that Canada is
withdrawing its charge d'affaires from Tehran for consultations on
the death threats issue, but is leaving one diplomatic
representative in Iran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran's
diplomatic recall was in response to Monday's decision by the 12
nations of the European Economic Community to withdraw their envoys
from Tehran for consultations.
   Iranian parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani called the EEC move
``a big mistake.''
   ``The EEC decision ... is a clear sign which proves claims that
the issue of this blasphemous book ... is a plot designed by Western
imperialism to fight true Islam,'' IRNA quoted him as saying.
   ``We do not fear such threats. ... We are prepared to follow our
own path at a cost,'' said Rafsanjani.
   The confrontation over Rushdie appeared to be eroding efforts by
some Iranian officials, including Rafsanjani, to strengthen ties
with more nations despite opposition by fundamentalist hard-liners.
   Although Rafsanjani was not quoted as endorsing the death
sentence, his comments indicated Iranian leaders were closing ranks
in the face of retaliation for Khomeini's death call.
   President Ali Khamenei, a Rafsanjani ally, said Friday that
Rushdie might be pardoned if he repented and apologized. Rushdie, a
Moslem himself, apologized the next day, but Khomeini ignored the
overture and renewed the death threat.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Larijani, said
Tuesday that although Iran stood by its statements on Rushdie, it
had not dispatched death squads to kill the author.
   ``We have not closed the door on negotiations nor have we opened
the door for confrontation,'' Larijani said in an interview with
IRNA.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
appealed to Iran to spare the lives of Rushdie and his publishers.
   The 41-year-old Indian-born author has been in hiding with his
wife in Britain, where he lives.
   The Common Market nations stoppe short of breaking relations with
Iran but said that in addition to recalling top diplomats, they
would suspend high-level visits to and from Iran.
   Britain, a market member, went a step further by recalling its
entire embassy staff. On Tuesday, it announced it was expelling the
Iranian charge d'affaires and his aide.
   ``It is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal
relationship with Iran,'' Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told
the House of Commons.
   Sweden and Norway followed the Common Market and recalled their
ambassadors, and Sweden threatened to cancel a trade mission to
Tehran next month unless the death warrant were rescinded.
   Finland and Austria summoned the Iranian ambassadors to their
nations to express disapproval of Iran's actions.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it from God.
   The novel was met with critical acclaim when Viking published the
547-page book in Britain in September.
   It was not until last week, on the eve of its publication in the
United States, that Khomeini ordered Moslems to track down Rushdie
and kill him.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey then
canceled plans to publish the book. Bookstores in Japan and many in
the United States pulled the novel from their shelves.
   Many independent booksellers continued to stock the novel,
however. The New York Times reported that based on last week's sales
``The Satanic Verses'' will be listed as the second best-selling
hardcover fiction book in the March 5 issue of The New York Times
Book Review.
   A full-page advertisement Wednesday in the Times announcing
publication of the book proclaimed: ``Free people write books, free
people publish books, free people sell books, free people buy books,
free people read books.'' The ad was signed by the Association of
American Publishers, the American Booksellers Association and the
American Library Association.
   In a letter Tuesday to Premier Michel Rocard of France, the more
than 500 authors in the French chapter of the international Pen Club
called for publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' and said they were
confident authorities could assure the publishers' safety.
   In West Germany, internationally acclaimed novelist Guenter Grass
said a group of 24 writers will publish the book under an agreement
with the publisher, which said last week it feared for its employees.
   In Yugoslavia, the Belgrade daily Borba stopped printing excerpts
from the novel after anonymous callers threatened ``violent
reprisals,'' according to a newspaper employee who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Former Israeli lawmaker Shmuel Flatto-Sharon invited Rushdie to
stay in his 27-room home in a Tel Aviv suburb, and offered to buy
the rights to the novel in the countries where publishers have
balked.
   ``We have a lot of problems here but security is not one of
them,'' Flatto-Sharon said.
   In the British House of Lords, Lord Paget raised the possibility
of a nuclear strike against Iran if Rushdie were murdered.
   ``Is there nothing we can do when the ayatollah is going around
saying `who's afraid of the big bad bomb?''' he asked.
   Speaking for the government, Lord Trefgarne replied: ``We seek an
improvement in our relations with Iran and not a descent to the
jungle.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sultan Ali Kishtmand, a ranking member
of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo and a hard-liner, Tuesday
took over many of the duties of prime minister, government sources
said.
   Moslem guerrillas, meanwhile, fired a salvo of rockets into the
Afghan capital, killing one person and injuring three others on the
ninth anniversary of an uprising against the Soviet-backed
government.
   Mohammad Hasan Sharq stepped down as prime minister Monday, and a
21-member Supreme Military Council took power.
   State-run Kabul Radio said Kishtmand, who served as prime
minister for seven years until May 1988, is in charge of supervising
the government's council of ministers.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonyumity, said
this means the 52-year-old Kishtmand will effectively be the prime
minister.
   The return to power of of Kishtmand, the only prominent Shiite
Moslem in President Najib's government, is seen as another move by
Najib to consolidate the power of his communist government.
   Shiites make up only 17 percent of Afghanistan's population, but
they account for about 40 percent of the refugees from which many of
the guerrillas are drawn.
   Najib appointed Sharq, a non-communist, as prime minister last
May in an unsucessful bid to seek a power-sharing agreement with the
Moslem guerrillas.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a committee of Afghan field commanders
and scholars sought to reach a consensus Tuesday on the makeup of an
interim government for Afghanistan. More than 400 delegates to a
special Afghan council or ``shura'' cancelled Tuesday's session
while the committee wrestled with a blueprint for a provisional
government.
   The commanders and scholars took over the job of nominating an
interim government after guerrilla leaders, paralyzed by differences
between moderates and fundamentalists, failed to break a deadlock
Monday.
   The guerrillas' rocket attack on Kabul was the first since
Thursday, when at least seven people were killed.
   The Foreign Ministry said the fatal rocket in Tuesday's assault
hit near a government refugee office in northern Kabul. Three other
rockets hit southeastern Kabul, but there were no reports of
casualties.
   The guerrillas hold most of the countryside and are trying to
close in on the cities, which mainly are held by government troops.
   At the headquarters of the secret police, the Foreign Ministry
displayed a huge cache of arms and explosives and said the
guerrillas had planned to use them Tuesday to attack buildings and
bazaars.
   Many had markings from the United States, Britain, Egypt, Sweden,
China and Italy. Officials said others were made in Pakistan, where
the most powerful guerrilla groups are based.
   Moammad Omar, a state security agent, said the weapons were
seized Monday in a well in eastern Kabul.
   Business was brisk at some shops in Kabul Tuesday, but others
were closed to mark the anniversary of the anti-Soviet uprising.
   The 1980 revolt occurred two months after Soviet troops entered
Afghanistan to bolster a Marxist government. Soviet soldiers fired
on Moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting ``God is
Great!''
   Dozens of people were reported killed.
   Among the weapons displayed by the government were plastic
explosives that agents said came from Pakistan, Chinese-made hand
grenades, British mortar shells, Egyptian rockets, Italian fuses for
mines, Swedish circuit testers and Chinese rifles.
   There also were political pamphlets. One, printed in English and
the local language Dari, said: ``We will contine our Jihad (holy
war) until the withdrawal of the last Soviet soldier.''
   The final Soviet troops, once estimated at more than 100,000 in
Afghanistan, withdrew last Wednesday under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   Over the weekend, Najib declared a state of emergency and shook
up his government to consolidate control.
   In Geneva Tuesday, an investigator appointed by the United
Nations said both sides in the civil war continue to violate the
human rights of Afghans.
   Austrian law professor Felix Ermacora said reliable reports
suggest dfghan police still widely use torture and mistreatment as
part of interrogations.
   His report also listed alleged incidents, cited by ``a variety of
corroborating sources,'' in which rebels had killed more than 100
Afghan soldiers and civilians since September.

<HEAD>Massive Conversion of Grain to ``Gasohol'' Still a Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old dream of wiping out grain surpluses by
turning corn into fuel-grade alcohol is a long way from coming true,
but progress continues, according to industry and farm officials.
   The National Corn Growers Association, for example, says ethanol
blends will be introduced this fall in the Phoenix, Ariz., area to
comply with the state's new clean air law.
   Blended fuels, basically 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent
gasoline, are said to cut automobile carbon monoxide emissions by as
much as 25 percent. Another alternative is petroleum-based MTBE, or
methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, which can reduce emissions by 10
percent.
   The corn producers said Denver initiated the nation's first fuels
program using ethanol and MTBE blends a year ago and that ``the
success of the Denver program was instrumental'' in passage of
Arizona's clean air law.
   An estimated 340 million bushels of corn were used to produce 800
million gallons of ethanol for fuel blending last year, with blends
representing 8 percent of all gasoline sales in 1988, the
association said.
   The Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade
association representing the ethanol industry, said more than 8.4
billion gallons of ethanol-gasoline blends were sold in 42 states
last year. The association said more than 60 ethanol plants are
operating in 23 states, representing a private investment of more
than $2.5 billion.
   Ethanol use in gasoline to make ``gasohol'' was spurred by the
second oil embargo by OPEC countries in the late 1970s, the
association said, and by a rush of subsidies from the federal and
state governments.
   The fervor at the time also prompted hopes that burdensome grain
surpluses could be used as feed stock, thus bolstering the nation's
farm economy as well as contributing to the fuel supply.
   ``What is even more significant is that this superior record of
growth has been sustained through good economic conditions and
bad,'' the association said. ``This past year, unusually high grain
prices caused by the drought and near-record low oil prices
threatened to severely weaken this industry.''
   But while three plants were forced to shut down temporarily,
``little production capacity was lost and sales have remained quite
strong.''
   The Agriculture Department has not viewed ethanol possibilities
with the enthusiasm of the corn and industry associations. There are
economic problems that won't go away simply because ethanol sounds
like a good idea, says the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Ethanol gained support as it also promised environmental
benefits and new markets and uses for corn and other surplus
crops,'' the agency said in a recent background paper. ``But the
sense of urgency over the need to develop alternative fuels
dissipated as petroleum prices declined.''
   But public attention once again is being drawn to alcohol fuels
to help reduce pollution, ease dependence on foreign oil and to
provide a greater market for farm crops.
   ``Compliance deadlines of the Clean Air Act passed and the
standards are still unmet,'' the report said. ``U.S. petroleum
imports have increased to the high levels of the early 1970s.''
   As to the future, USDA analysts said ethanol's success will
depend on energy, environmental, agricultural and trade policies.
Those are factors that will determine the prices, costs and
competitiveness of the ethanol industry.
   ``The U.S. fuel ethanol industry was created by a mix of federal
and state subsidies, loan programs and other incentives,'' the
report said.
   A handful of large plants produce most of the U.S. ethanol, the
report said. The eight largest, owned by five companies, accounted
for nearly 75 percent of the operating capacity in 1986.
   ``Ethanol is exempt from 6 cents of the 9-cent (federal excise)
tax through September 1993,'' the report said. ``At the 10 percent
blending rate ... that exemption is effectively a 60-cent-per-gallon
subsidy. Many states provide similar financial incentives averaging
20 to 30 cents per gallon.''
   The federal government also helps with loan guarantees to
encourage plant construction, but ``most of these plants have not
been successful,'' the report said. Only one of the three plants
with loans guaranteed by the Energy Department was operating and
paying off its loans by early 1988.
   At USDA's Farmers Home Administration, spokesman Marlyn Aycock
said loan guarantees for 11 plants were initially obligated but that
only three are currently in operation.
   Aycock said FmHA has made no ethanol loans since 1984 and that
the maximum had been reduced by half, from $20 billion per plant to
$10 million.
   The USDA background report said the production of ethanol so far
has ``not significantly affected income for farmers participating in
government commodity programs.
   ``Moderate levels of ethanol production would only slightly
affect total farm revenue and income,'' the report said. ``It is
unlikely that modest increases in ethanol production would drive
market prices for corn to exceed current target price levels (in the
federal commodity programs) within the next 8 to 10 years.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-American protesters are
challenging South Korea's policies toward the United States and
sparking more U.S. criticism here than at any time in four decades.
   From student radicals yelling ``Yankee Go Home'' to farmers
denouncing U.S. agriculture imports, South Koreans are venting their
frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies.
   When President Bush visits Seoul next Monday, he will find what
one newspaper warns is a society ``quite different'' from the one he
saw as vice president in April 1982.
   ``Don't Come to Korea, Bush!'' yell radical students, punctuating
the words with raised, clenched fists.
   Criticism of the United States is no longer relegated to private
conversation. American flags are torched and effigies of Uncle Sam
or Bush are burned.
   Some 12,000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with
clubs and firebombs outside the National Assembly this month and
denounced the United States for trying to force open South Korea's
agricultural market.
   Radical students staged a series of attacks on U.S. facilities to
demand an end to American influence. They vowed to hold nationwide
anti-government, anti-U.S. demonstrations to coincide with the
president's visit.
   ``Arson, violence, destruction and lawlessness cannot be
tolerated,'' said President Roh Tae-woo in demanding an end to
protests.
   Every U.S. president since the Korean War except Richard Nixon
has visited Seoul but none has come during a time of more public
animosity against Washington policies.
   Businessmen, laborers, and students who have never thrown a
firebomb are heard to complain that South Korea is victimized by
unfair trade pressures and rude, Yankee arrogance.
   When asked their nationality by a Korean, U.S. citizens rarely
acknowledge that they are American. The U.S. embassy and the U.S.
military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which
labels them from the U.S.A.
   ``The United States is no longer a sacred cow,'' said a western
diplomat, requesting anonymity. ''America is no longer the patron
saint of South Korea.''
   ``The United States has played roles in past dictatorial
governments and we oppose the visit of U.S. President Bush,'' claims
a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human
rights abuses of the past U.S.-supported authoritarian government.
   A few weeks ago, the United States said it was considering
closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of Kwangju,
180 miles south of Seoul, because of repeated violent attacks and
concern for the safety of its staff.
   Kwangju was the scene of a bloody nine-day civil uprising in
1980. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United States
shared responsibility for the Kwangju incident by acquiescing in a
military-backed South Korean government plan to quell the uprising.
The United States denied the charge.
   Although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on
relations and radicals have little public support, government
leaders warn that growing anti-American sentiment could endanger
South Korea's interests in Washington.
   The government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the
Kwangju center attacks and appealed to radical students ``not to
damage traditional Korea-U.S. friendship.''
   The assistant foreign minister, Kim Suk-kyu, reflects the
thinking of many when he says anti-Americanism ``is a minority view
and a passing phenomenon, despite loud voices and anti-American
activists.''
   More than half of South Korea's 40 million people have been born
since the Korean War ended 35 years ago, and long time observers
link the intensity of anti-American feeling to the age of the
participant. The younger the person, the more likely he or she is to
feel the United States has taken its relationship with South Korea
for granted.
   The Korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south
and the communist north since the end of World War II in 1945. The
United States helped South Korea fight the 1950-53 Korean War
against the north and keeps 42,000 troops stationed in the south
under a mutual defense pact.
   Radical students and dissidents feel the presence of U.S. troops
stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have
demanded the withdrawal of all U.S. forces. They also demand the
halt to this year's joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises called
``Team Spirit.''
   A more realistic relationship is needed between the two
governments, say both protesters and some politicians, a
relationship which recognizes South Korea's economic potential and
place in global politics.
   The United States is Seoul's leading trade partner. Korea sold
America goods worth $8 billion more than it bought from the United
States last year. Considerable pressure has been placed on the
Koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the
deficit.
   Anti-American comment became acceptable socially after last
fall's Olympic Games when South Koreans of all ages had their
frustration and resentment against the United States stoked by what
they regarded as unruly behavior of U.S. athletes and biased
coverage by NBC.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   When the oil and the good times were flowing,
Louisiana's populist system of government seemed to make sense. Give
the people a free ride and let the businesses pay. Now oil has
crashed, Louisiana has suffered through four years of economic
depression, and economists say recovery isn't possible without a new
system. A reformist governor is trying to do just that, but breaking
with the populist past doesn't come easy. This second of two parts
of ``Bad Times On The Bayou'' explores this Louisiana revolution.

<TEXT>
   The 34-story Louisiana state capitol
casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of Huey Long, but
these days, it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow.
   ``An unconquered friend of the poor,'' the inscription on Long's
adjacent tomb says, ``who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the
land would be spread among the people.''
   The populist ideas of ``the Kingfish,'' who governed from
1928-1932, still influence the fiscal structure of the state.
   Spread the wealth, protect the poor.
   Homeowners receive a $75,000 property tax exemption, making the
average home tax free. Automobile license plates cost only $3 a
year. City councils can't raise taxes without a vote of the people.
Businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees.
   But the way of doing business that Huey Long helped build is
crippling the state now, economists say. Without the oil windfall,
state and local budgets can't be balanced. Schools and hospitals are
suffering. Unemployment has soared. And new businesses are scared
away by the tax structure.
   ``It's ironic. What is supposed to be good for the people now
acts to their detriment,'' said University of New Orleans economist
Tim Ryan.
   Added business leader Eugene Schreiber, director of New Orleans'
World Trade Center: ``We've got to change. We cannot do business in
the old ways. ... Painful as it is, it's forced us to wake up.''
   But waking up isn't easy in the land of ``The Big Easy,'' as New
Orleans is called.
   After a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of
budget cutting and borrowing, Gov. Buddy Roemer's initial attempt at
overhauling the tax structure failed in the state House.
   The Harvard-educated conservative Democrat has, in his own words,
``poked every bear in the forest'' while inciting a revolution in
Louisiana.
   He won education reform, campaign finance reform, tort reform,
worker's compensation reform, even unemployment insurance reform.
But when it came to fiscal reform, when it came to dismantling the
last vestiges of the populist past, Roemer lost.
   Can't a family's home be the one thing that's not taxed, Roemer's
opponents asked?
   ``I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from Louisiana
tradition,'' Roemer said. ``It doesn't come easy.''
   Along the way, Roemer is also compiling a spectrum of political
enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers. Public
opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer.
   The question remains, what happens if he can't complete the
revolution?
   ``It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to Saudi Arabia
... a wasteland, a welfare state,'' Roemer said, adding that people
with the means to move away would do so.
   Politicians, he said, ``are beginning to realize that.''
   Fiscal reform has become the vortex of Louisiana's struggle to
climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by
more than half in 1984-85. Tens of thousands lost jobs, and both
businesses and workers left the state.
   And taxes on oil _ which used to account for 40 percent of the
Louisiana state budget _ plummeted. The state, long known for its
big spending ways, hadn't put anything aside for dry years. It
hadn't spent much on developing a strong economic base, outside of
oil. In fact, it hadn't even had a balanced budget in the 1980s
until Roemer took office 10 months ago _ even though it has a
balanced budget law.
   It's debt reached $2 billion.
   ``We could not make the payroll the week after I took office,''
Roemer said.
   Now, state promoters, planners and business leaders all buzz with
talk about Louisiana's recovery _ if there is fiscal reform.
   ``When the price of oil was $40 a barrel, hardly anybody
worried,'' said Schreiber, the businessman who chaired a governor's
task force on labor.
   ``Having all these advantages made everyone in the state very
lazy. Louisiana has not been competitive in business,'' Schreiber
said. ``It's only really now that the state is pulling its act
together.''
   The day after reform failed last October, two companies
considering Louisiana announced plans to build in Texas. Other
businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the Bayou State
are holding off until they see if reform passes, said Louisiana's
chief of economic development, Connie Lewis.
   Wall Street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what
would be necessary to raise the state's bond rating, currently just
one notch above junk bonds. Low bond ratings means the state must
pay higher interest on its debt. Roemer has accomplished all but one
item _ fiscal reform, said his chief of staff, Steve Cochran.
   ``They watch us very closely,'' he said.
   The battle will probably be waged this spring when Roemer comes
back to the Legislature with a plan. Last time, his package passed
the state Senate, but came up 10 votes short of the necessary
two-thirds margin in the House.
   The opposition focused on Roemer's plan to cut by two-thirds the
$75,000 homestead exemption _ the nation's highest. It was led by a
county tax assessor, Lawrence Chehardy, who saw reform as an attempt
to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner.
   ``People in Louisiana read horror stories in other states where
property taxes did go wild,'' said Chehardy. ``Government taxes
everything. Can't there be one thing in life a person can have
without being taxed?''
   Chehardy says lawmakers should cut the budget, and if there are
any tax increases, taxpayers should get a chance to vote.
   But Roemer and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so
much _ more than $500 million _ that further reductions could
cripple the state. Already, they worry about the declining quality
of care at state-financed charity hospitals and the ability of
cities like New Orleans to get by without the traditional state
support.
   And the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of $734
million. The total budget is $4.2 billion, but only $2.2 billion is
discretionary spending _ money that isn't tied to court orders or
debt payments.
   ``Cutting that much ($734 million) would shut more and more
hospitals, cut transportation money and higher education,'' said
Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine. ``That is, in my mind,
shutting down government.''
   Still, the early talk of next June's budget is a revolutionary
concept by itself in Louisiana, a state that at times balanced its
budget for only three-quarters of the year and hoped oil prices
would go up.

   John Keker, the lawyer prosecuting Oliver North
in the Iran-Contra trial, has a reputation for intuitively making
the right move in a courtroom.
   In a civil lawsuit, lawyers for a bank abruptly asked one of
Keker's clients whether he would waive the attorney-client privilege
of confidentiality.
   Reacting to the unorthodox request, Keker quickly said his client
_ an investor who alleged he had been defrauded _ would agree to a
waiver if the bank was willing to waive the same privilege covering
conversations with its attorneys.
   The bank backed down.
   Representing an insurance company accused of overcharging its
customers, Keker on cross-examination asked an expert witness to
select from a stock of well over 100 files the one he considered to
be the most egregious example of overcharging.
   Robert A. Van Nest, a partner in Keker's San Francisco law firm,
recalls that Keker spent a minute familiarizing himself with the
contents of the file selected by the expert and ``then proceeded to
tear the witness apart.''
   ``Two things about John,'' said Van Nest, his tenacity and his
intuition.
   ``He doesn't let a point drop. He will fight all the way to
whatever is there.
   ``He's remarkably intuitively skilled in a courtroom. It's a
great athlete's intuition, to know where the ball is and where
everything is on the field. John has that kind of intuition. He has
an ability to respond to the evidence.''
   Keker's ability ``to kind of sense where the witness is going''
is ``a rare skill in today's lawyer,'' said Van Nest. ``So many of
us take deposition after deposition and there's nothing to predict.''
   Keker's weaker points? ``He has as many weaknesses as the San
Francisco 49ers,'' said Van Nest.
   The North case will be Keker's first as a prosecutor, but his
abilities as a defense lawyer translate easily to the other side of
the courtroom, says William T. McGivern Jr., chief assistant U.S.
Attorney for the northern district of California.
   ``He's always been aggressive and he can bring that aggression to
the prosecution side,'' said McGivern. ``He's aware of the moves of
a defense lawyer, having been one himself.''
   In short, Keker ``can try a case there's no doubt about that,''
said McGivern, who as a prosecutor has been involved in several
cases in which Keker has been a defense attorney.
   A Vietnam War veteran who served in the Marines and was wounded
in combat, Keker is a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law
School and a founding partner of Keker &amp; Brockett in San Francisco.
   He has successfully defended movie maker George Lucas in a civil
lawsuit and won a case in which his client, a San Francisco society
figure and architect, was accused of vehicular manslaughter.
   After the Iran-Contra affair erupted in 1986, Keker sought work
with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   ``John felt there was an important lesson here for Americans who
care about the democratic process and he was intent in participating
in the investigation for that reason,'' said Van Nest.
   Van Nest said Keker had concerns that those involved appeared to
have been ``hiding the ball, running foreign policy without the
consent of representatives of the people.''
   ``The political and legal implications struck me as enormous,''
Keker said of the Iran-Contra episode in an interview last year with
The Los Angeles Times.
   Keker, 45, has more than 15 years as a trial lawyer and relishes
the role.
   ``When you go to court,'' he told the Times, ``you get a chance
to be a hero, which is a thing that most people repress the desire
for. You also get a chance to fail enormously.
   ``That sort of edge is something that people who are trial
lawyers usually like. You get a chance to do the right thing. You
get a chance to do it in a stylish way.''

<HEAD>Agency Calls for Reshaping of Aid Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal foreign aid agency says the time
has come for a radical reshaping of the way the United States
allocates the billions of dollars a year it passes out to other
nations.
   The recommendation was contained in a 158-page report issued
Monday by the administrator of the Agency for International
Development, Alan Woods.
   ``The challenges of today's problems, and tomorrow's, cannot be
met with yesterday's solutions, suitable as they may have been to
yesterday's problems,'' the report said.
   The study, which made no specific recommendations for policy
changes, said the aid program no longer seems able to fulfill its
original mandate of helping poor countries achieve the transition
from dependency to self-sufficiency.
   Somewhere between 1949 and the present, the original concept of
aid as a transitional means of helping countries become
self-sufficient has been lost, it said.
   ``Is today's U.S. foreign aid fostering healthy development
towards independent prosperity _ or simply postponing the day of
reckoning for governments unwilling or unable to take the
politically painful steps needed for their own development?'' the
report asked.
   ``All too often, dependency seems to have won out over
development,'' the report said.
   A principal conclusion calls for ``radically reshaping'' future
official assistance programs to face new realities and to coordinate
government assistance with U.S. private sector involvement in
providing humanitarian aid, education and overseas investment.
   This reshaping ``must be both an immediate concern and a major
long-term national priority. Nothing less will serve the national
interests of the United States,'' the report said.
   Woods noted in comments to a group of reporters that no country
has ``graduated'' from less developed to developed status in the
past 20 years.
   All this is in sharp contrast to the Marshall Plan of the late
1940's and early 1950's when an ambitious U.S. aid program helped
put Western Europe on its feet and then was terminated.
   One problem highlighted by the report is that ``succeeding
Congresses and administrations, prodded by the dominant crises _ and
interest groups _ of the moment, have piled differing and often
conflicting foreign assistance objectives on top of each other.''
   This ``dizzying'' array ranges from winning friends for the
United States, to alleviating poverty, to countering the Soviet
Union and to finding markets for American farm products, the report
said.
   In a December speech, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a member of a
bipartisan House task force on foreign aid, said the 33 separate
statutory objectives for foreign assistance ``are so numerous that
they do not provide meaningful direction.''
   ``All of these 33 objectives may be worthy. I probably voted for
most of them. ... However, a program that pursues all objectives
risks accomplishing none of them,'' he said.
   Complicating fulfillment of these objectives has been a decline
in the amount of aid appropriated from $19 billion in 1985 to $14
billion this year, Hamilton said.
   The Woods report suggested that developmental success has less to
do with foreign aid levels than with the internal policies of
recipient countries.
   ``Where development has worked, and is working, the key has been
economic growth,'' it said. ``And this is largely the result of the
individual nations making the right policy choices and making the
most of their internal human and material resources.''
   The report said growth-oriented policies ``are a constant among
success cases, regardless of the level of aid they have received _
which are sometimes greater and sometimes less than the levels
received by developmental laggards.''
   It said the ``impressive development of first Japan and later
Taiwan and South Korea in East Asia is proof positive that the right
donor program and guidance, when matched by the right recipient
policies, can result in a smooth transition from dependence to
self-sufficiency.''

   Since taking office in May, Gov. Buddy Roemer has balanced a
state budget for the first time in the 1980s. He's steered a package
of reforms through the Legislature, including political campaign
reform and education reform. Yet he lost his most important battle _
overhauling the state's populist taxing structure.
   Here, in excerpts from an interview with Associated Press
regional reporter Scott McCartney, Roemer discusses his goals and
concerns for Louisiana from his Baton Rouge, La., office.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Question: What are you trying to do to this state? It seems like
there's a revolution going on.
   Answer: It really is. ... We inherited the highest unemployment
rate in America and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of
reasons. For example, the price of oil in last year's budget was $21
a barrel. Oil never saw $21. It was a phony figure which exasperated
the deficit. We've got it (oil, which is currently around $17 a
barrel) at $13.80. That's how tough we are. ...
   As a result, I think the business community in the state and
outside of the state knows that something's happening in Louisiana.
Our unemployment rate is beginning to go down. It was above 12
percent when I took office. It's now about 9.5.
   Q: Is it the attitudes in the state that you're bumping up
against?
   A: We had a state, and I love Louisiana, but we had a state where
big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to
reverse it. It's not done. We've got a ways to go. We need to
rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs. I
tried ... I failed by a close margin. We'll try it again, and win it.
   When we do that, all of the ingredients will be in place. ...
Watch us. I want to warn Texas and the other states of the
Southwest. Watch us.
   Q: Is it fair to say what you're really doing is throwing out the
past, throwing out the populist government, throwing out the legacy
of Huey Long?
   A: Right, in part. I want to be fair to Huey because he had many
great points. Huey built the roads in this state to tie farms to
market. He gave children free textbooks. So when we say we're
breaking with the past, I really don't think of Huey Long. I do
think of the populist strain where there's something for nothing and
everybody else pays the bill. We are trying to break from that. ...
I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from Louisiana
tradition. It doesn't come easy.
   Q: What would happen if tax reform doesn't pass?
   A: It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to Saudi Arabia.
We'd be a slave to how many times OPEC can get together and jack the
price around. We'd be a wasteland, a welfare state. Those who are
without hope, those who are without means, won't move _ they can't,
they're stuck. Those with an education, with financial mobility, are
going to vote with their feet. They're going to leave. And for the
first time the politicians are beginning to realize that.
   Every bear in the forest, I've poked. Now is the time to do it.
There are some who think that if I do my job right, I could never
get elected to another public office.
   Q: Do you believe it?
   A: Might be true.
   Q: Do you care?
   A: I don't. ... I would be totally satisfied four years from now
to prop my feet up on the desk and say, `Well done.'
   Q: Do you think things can turn around that quickly?
   A: Yes, in terms of public perception and attitude. That's the
real fight. The fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and
down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control.
You'll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic. But
what needs to turn around is attitude.
   I found many people in this state who had given up, who felt
Louisiana could not change, who felt that we were a slave to our
past, who felt that the populist politicians owned Louisiana.
They're beginning to realize now that we are winners. Not me, we.
This state's a winner.

<HEAD>Sino-Soviet Warmth Causes No American Concern</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Not so long ago, American policy-makers would
be concerned about the forthcoming Sino-Soviet summit, the first one
in 30 years. But that's no longer the case and the meeting is not
likely to blemish President Bush's trip to Beijing this weekend.
   ``If Sino-Soviet rapprochement contributes to the stability of
the region and the globe, then it is all to the good,'' said one old
Asia hand who is helping plan Bush's trip.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's scheduled visit to
Beijing in May will end the Sino-Soviet rift and highlight Kremlin
concessions on the three points the Chinese have said were
preventing improved relations for a decade.
   Gorbachev's meeting with senior Chinese leader Deng Xiao-peng
will be the first Sino-Soviet summit since Nikita S. Khrushchev met
with Mao Tse-tung in 1959. Mao and Khrushchev later argued over
ideology, and Soviet and Chinese troops clashed in the 1960's and
1970's along the 4,670-mile border.
   The reason the Chinese are welcoming the Soviet leader, and that
the United States does not object, is the marked shift in Kremlin
foreign policy in the four years Gorbachev has been in power,
according to scholars and government experts.
   Before agreeing to meet with the Russians, the Chinese wanted the
Soviets out of Afghanistan, the Vietnamese out of Cambodia and a
reduction of Soviet troops along the border.
   The Kremlin has met or started to meet all of those conditions.
   The last Red Army soldier left Afghanistan last week, ending a
bloody and futile nine-year occupation.
   Vietnam, a close military ally of the Soviet Union, has removed
some of the more than 100,000 troops it sent into Cambodia in 1978
and agreed to negotiations over withdrawing the rest.
   In 1987, the Soviet Union withdrew 12,000 of its troops from
Mongolia, on the Chinese border, and last December Gorbachev
announced unspecified further reductions in the estimated 50,000
troops remaining there.
   The Sino-Soviet summit, in short, derives from Gorbachev's
efforts to change Soviet policies and to make friends rather than
enemies around the world.
   ``There could be a summit only if the Soviet Union changed its
pattern of behavior from the last two or three decades,'' said
Stephen Morris, a fellow at the Russian Research Center at Harvard
University.
   ``The things that brought the Soviets and the Chinese together
are the same things that brought the Soviets and the Americans
together,'' said Morris, a specialist on Soviet relations with Asian
nations.
   A State Department specialist on Asia, who spoke on condition he
not be further identified, noted that ``both the Chinese and the
Soviets have stressed that the normalization of their relations will
not affect their ties with any other country,'' in other words, the
United States.
   If the Soviets fully meet the conditions laid down by the
Chinese, said the government expert, ``that will be a big plus for
stability in the region.''
   Bush, announcing his trip to China, indicated that the time had
passed for the kind of geopolitical maneuver that opened the door of
U.S.-Chinese relations in the 1970's, the ``China card'' played by
then-President Nixon against the Kremlin.
   ``Well, I don't know what signal it sends in that regard, but let
me just remind you that I'm the one who does not believe in `playing
the Soviet card,' or `playing the China card,''' Bush said on Jan.
28.
   The most recent senior U.S. official to visit China, then-Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, said in Beijing last September that
``we think the relaxation of tensions between China and the Soviet
Union would be healthy for world peace and stability.''
   A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington
concluded that ``a Beijing-Moscow summit need not bode ill for the
United States.''
   ``The United States does not necessarily gain if Chinese-Soviet
relations remain cool, nor does the United States necessarily lose
of those relations improve,'' wrote Heritage analyst Andrew B. Brick.
   Relations between the communist giants has already improved in
recent years, noted Brick, and the two are natural trading partners,
with similar economies, a long border, and natural resources that
the other needs.
   Under a bilateral trade pact signed in 1985, said Brick, the
Soviet Union has become China's fifth largest trading partner, with
barter exchange rising from $260 billion in 1981 to $1.8 billion
last year, and expected to reach $6 billion by 1990.

<TEXT>
   More and more Swedes are calling in sick
from their jobs and authorities say they plan to try to find out if
they are faking. Abuses in one of the world's most liberal welfare
systems may be costing billions in sick pay.
   A recent study by the Swedish Employer's Association said the
average Swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness
in 1987, compared with 18 days in West Germany, 16 in France and 11
in Britain.
   A recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those
questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating. Official
statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent
over the past three years.
   Sweden's sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor
system. Under a 1987 reform, blue-collar workers joined other wage
earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are
off sick, starting from the first day they stay home.
   The government handles the payments, but most of the money comes
from taxes paid by employers.
   In the Swedish system, an employee who is ill calls his Social
Insurance Office and later signs a form stating the nature of the
illness. A doctor's certificate is required only if the worker is
home for a week or more.
   One form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when
he's not. However, authorities say it's even more common for workers
to file for sick pay and go to work anyway, getting sick pay in
addition to regular pay. It's difficult to check.
   ``If I knock on the door and nobody opens, what is my proof?''
Yvonne Stroberg, a local official, said recently on Swedish
television. She suggested more telephone checks with employers
rather than home visits by inspectors.
   The National Accounting Board described another scheme in a
report late last year. It said some people collect payments for sick
leave, parental leave and student grants for the same period.
   Karl Gustaf Scherer, director of the National Social Insurance
Board, said on television his organization would increase its
supervision.
   In Bandhagen, south of Stockholm, the local office started a
three-week campaign to check all claims on certain days.
   Sick leave, pensions and various other social benefits are
expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year.
   Illness benefits last year amounted to $5 billion, $120 million
more than Sweden paid for defense.
   One option under study is to let employers take over sick
payments for those absent from work up to two weeks, saving the
government money and paperwork. The employer would then claim a
refund from the authorities.
   Unions have opposed the plan. Margareta Svensson at the
blue-collar General Confederation of Unions said it would permit
employers to put pressure on employees.
   ``There would be people who would not dare to be (off) ill if
their employer controlled'' sick payments, she said.
   Since benefits are administered locally, there is no official
overall picture of cheating nationwide.
   A random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of
Halmstad indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false, and the
figure was 15 percent in neighboring Varberg, Svenska Dagbladet said.
   Another study reported by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper said a
three-day check of claimants in the northern province of Jamtland
showed all 180 cases were valid.
   The National Accounting Board's report said illness claims, valid
or not, varied strongly by location. The 10 districts with the
highest absenteeism were low-income suburbs of Sweden's three
largest cities.
   The head of the Social Insurance Office in Rinkeby, a Stockholm
suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants, topped the list, with an
absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average.
   ``People out here have heavy, monotonous, dangerous and boring
jobs,'' said Gun Britt Johansson, head of Rinkeby's social insurance
office.

   President Bush will use his upcoming trip to
South Korea to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to that country's
security while seeking improved access for American products in
South Korean markets, U.S. officials say.
   On the final leg of a trip that also will take him to Japan and
China, Bush plans to spend 4{ hours in Seoul, the South Korean
capital. There, he will meet with President Roh Tae-woo and other
officials and visit some of the more than 40,000 U.S. troops
stationed in the country.
   Bush departs Wednesday for Tokyo, where he will attend Friday's
funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito. He will spend two nights in
Beijing before flying to Seoul on Monday.
   Although U.S. officials are delighted with the political and
economic development of South Korea in recent years, there is
growing impatience over South Korean barriers to U.S. exports,
including beef and fruit.
   The result is a lopsided trade imbalance in South Korea's favor _
about $10 billion last year on total two-way trade of slightly more
than $30 billion.
   ``Korea has free access to U.S. markets. Korea should now open
up,'' said one State Department official, who spoke on condition
that he not be identified further.
   Another irritant in the relationship between the two countries is
the large U.S. military presence in the capital area. U.S. and South
Korean officials have been engaged in discussions designed to ease
the frictions.
   There is a small but determined radical movement in South Korea,
which is driven primarily by anti-Americanism.
   The radicals have attacked the U.S. cultural center in Kwangju
several times over the past month. A principal rallying cry recently
has been opposition to the Bush visit.
   South Korea is a far different country today from the one which
Bush saw in 1982, his last visit there.
   The country's unpopular military dictatorship has been replaced
by a democratically elected government, and South Korea now ranks
among the world leaders in economic growth rates.
   The United States has made a major contribution to South Korea's
prosperity, accounting for 34 percent of the country's exports.
   It is quite a change from the situation in the country during the
decade after the armistice ended the Korean War in 1953, when the
destitution there was such that some U.S. officials recommended
suspending all economic assistance, considering the country's future
prospects to be beyond hope.
   South Korea has been playing an increasingly active role
internationally, establishing trade and diplomatic ties in Eastern
Europe and hosting the Olympic Games last September.
   Last fall, Roh began making peace overtures to North Korea and
asked then-President Reagan to complement South Korea's steps with
gestures of his own.
   Reagan responded by liberalizing rules for U.S. diplomatic
contact with North Koreans, encouraging cultural exchanges between
the two countries and easing restrictions on tourist travel and the
export of humanitarian items to North Korea.
   A subsequent exchange of notes included a North Korean proposal
for formal diplomatic discussions, which the United States regarded
as unacceptable because it undercut South Korea's position.
   Still, U.S. officials have been encouraged by an apparent easing
of tensions recently on the peninsula, an area long viewed as having
the potential for an outbreak of East-West hostilities because of
the major stake that both superpowers have there.

<TEXT>
   The Polisario guerrilla front says it
will hold a second round of talks next week with Morocco's King
Hassan II to discuss extending a truce and a political solution for
the disputed Western Sahara.
   Polisario leader Mohammed Abdelaziz, speaking to a news
conference Monday, also dismissed the newly declared five-nation
union of north African Arab states as unviable as long as the
conflict over Western Sahara is unresolved.
   ``It is like building houses on a volcano which can erupt at any
time,'' Abdelaziz said, speaking through a translator.
   The leaders of Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Libya, and Tunisia
declared the union on Friday, but did not disclose details on how it
will function.
   One likely result would be a suspension of aid and support by
Algeria for the Polisarios' 13-year war to free Western Sahara from
Moroccan rule.
   Morocco annexed most of the former Spanish territory in 1976.
   Abdelaziz said he received word Sunday that King Hassan had
agreed to meet a Polisario delegation next week, but the date and
venue was not set.
   The king first met the Polisarios for two days in early January.
The guerrillas later declared a cease-fire for February to improve
the climate for the five-nation summit in Marrakech, Abdelaziz said.
   Asked if the truce could be extended, he said he hoped the
meeting with Hassan ``will be an occasion to transfer the truce into
a political agreement.''
   He said the Polisarios would not relinquish the demand for
sovereignty over all of Western Sahara, and rejected the idea of
autonomy under a Moroccan flag.
   The options which should be put to the inhabitants in a
referendum are ``total independence or integration into Morocco. For
us, the only choice is total independence,'' he said.
   The Polisario delegation was in Sweden as guest of the governing
Social Democratic Party. It was to meet Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson, opposition leaders and Swedish Red Cross officials.

   Donald Trump can buy hotels, he can buy football
teams, he can buy casinos and airlines. But he can't buy respect.
   Spy magazine calls him a ``short-fingered vulgarian.'' Cartoonist
Berke Breathed takes Trump's brain and installs it in the skull of
Bill the Cat, the foul feline of ``Bloom County.'' A Daily News
columnist writes that when she needs cheering up, she watches
``Donald Trump do something silly.''
   The Stand Up New York comedy club devoted a night to ridiculing
Trump. For two hours, comics drew laughter with readings from
``Trump: The Art of the Deal'' and took their own potshots _
suggesting, for example, that he bought a Parisian landmark and
renamed it the ``Arc de Trump.''
   The 43-year-old billionaire does not believe he deserves this
tidal wave of derision, which rises along with his success and
prominence. But Trump _ who declined to be interviewed _ thinks he
understands it.
   ``Those who don't like me don't know me, and have never met me,''
he told Time magazine. ``My guess is that they dislike me out of
jealousy.''
   Not so, say Trump's detractors. They dislike him on merits.
   ``He's just an everyday slob with too much money. He just doesn't
have enough taste to keep his name off of things,'' said Breathed.
   The sequence about Trump's transplanted cerebrum, Breathed said,
is born of his conviction that Trump ``looks too smooth and polished
on the outside. He should look like Bill the Cat.''
   Trump is no stranger to the funny pages; he also appeared within
the past year in ``Doonesbury.'' Garry Trudeau showed Trump tossing
casino chips from the deck of his 282-foot yacht, the Trump
Princess, to small boats below. This obviously was not the
``quality'' image Trump wants to project.
   ``I did pretty well in school, but for the life of me, I really
can't understand what `Doonesbury' is about,'' Trump has said. He
suggested Trudeau's wife, television's Jane Pauley, ``has a lot more
talent than he does.''
   Critics have found fault with Trump's taste. When he announced
last month that he intended to close that Plaza Hotel landmark of
bogus Hawaiiana, Trader Vic's _ a closing that he delayed when the
threat of the bar's demise improved business _ Trump said he was
doing so not because of any hostility to Samoan Fog Cutters and
similar drinks, but because the bar was tacky.
   ``Wildly tacky,'' riposted Village Voice reporter Guy Trebay,
``is Trump Tower, with its mean escalators and pink marble vastness.
Does Donald Trump think a waterfall wall is the acme of subtle
design?''
   Critics have found fault with Trump's ego and penchant for
self-promotion. Daily News columnist Gail Collins, writing about a
new board game based on Trump's wheeling and dealing, noted that
``Trump _ The Game'' contained ``approximately nine million photos
of Donald Trump.''
   The game is meant ``for players 12 and up, and I suppose there
could be worse things to give your 12-year-old than a game that
encourages him to act like Donald Trump. `Uzi: The Crack Dealer,'
for example,'' she mused.
   Critics have found fault with Trump's dedication to building
glitzy buildings in a city where homelessness and poverty are
endemic. One group staged a brunch for the homeless this month in
front of the Plaza, along with a ``public shaming'' of its owner.
Trump did not attend.
   But the reigning champion of Trump bashers is Spy, a New York
satire magazine, and Trump has reacted with irritation and vitriol.
   In September, Trump claimed Spy was in dire straits and would be
out of business within a year; now each issue contains a countdown
of ``our death foretold.'' Last week, an outraged Trump claimed that
the father of a Spy executive had suggested Spy would ease up on
Trump if the Trump Shuttle offered the magazine to passengers; Spy
said this was a joke.
   The irreverent and irascible magazine is fixated on the Big T _
on the ``eerily stiff hairdo'' of Trump's wife, Ivana; on Trump
himself, who was mentioned derogatorily in all 10 issues last year
and whose picture was compared in the March issue with the first
police sketch of Son of Sam.
   Each year, Spy lists the 100 most annoying people, places and
things in New York. One year, Trump was No. 1; one year, he was No.
3. Last year, he was Nos. 10, 14, 21, 26 and 30, subdivided into
Donald Trump, Candidate; Donald Trump, Acquirer; Donald Trump,
Boxing Promoter; Donald Trump, Author, and Donald Trump, Fixer of
Things We'd Almost Rather Leave Broken.
   ``We don't hate him, we despise him,'' Spy said this month.
   But why?
   ``He's ... sort of a polyester guy in a 100 percent cotton
world,'' froths Editor E. Graydon Carter. ``He represents a sort of
mass-market, fake sophistication. In a city that invented real
sophistication, his kind is driving the real stuff out.''
   Carter is just warming up. He dismisses Trump as a ``sort of
show-and-tell child'' who insists on splattering his name everywhere
he goes.
   Carter knows that Trump has become a celebrity _ his face on the
covers of news magazines, his book a bestseller. To some, he is a
capitalist hero.
   ``The folks who watch motivational cable shows late at night _ to
them he's a hero,'' Carter said. ``To anybody who cares about New
York, who doesn't like brass, he's no hero.''

<HEAD>Kenyans Lobby Congress To Maintain Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenyan diplomats are lobbying Congress to block
a threat by several congressmen to limit aid to Kenya because of
alleged human rights abuses.
   The effort follows some acerbic criticism by the head of the
House panel that appropriates money for foreign aid. ``It will be a
cold day in you-know-where before this committee earmarks money for
Kenya,'' said Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis., at a recent hearing on
human rights in Africa.
   ``Earmarking'' is a method Congress uses to guarantee that select
countries receive a certain amount of foreign aid, making them
immune from administration attempts to shift assistance to other
priorities. The bulk of U.S. foreign aid is earmarked for about 20
countries, leaving the administration little room for maneuvering
with the aid.
   Economic aid for Kenya has been earmarked for the past three
years. Skillful efforts by Kenya and its lobbyists last year brought
the military component of the assistance under the protection of the
earmark too, despite Obey's objections.
   Kenya got $15 million in military aid, which accounts for about
60 percent of all U.S. military assistance to sub-Saharan Africa,
and an additional $45 million in economic and development funds.
   Kenya supporters in the administration and on Capitol Hill cite
the access granted by the strategically placed country to U.S. Navy
ships at Mombasa and to Air Force planes at its airfields as reason
enough for the financial support.
   But since last fall, when the aid was appropriated for fiscal
year 1989, several other congressmen have joined Obey, head of the
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, in
criticizing what they view as Kenya's deteriorating human rights
situation.
   William Gray, a member of Obey's committee who also serves as
chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House, issued a statement
at the same hearing critical of Kenya.
   Gray said Kenya, which had been a ``shining star in Africa and a
model for its neighbors over many years,'' had been turning in a
different direction in recent years, resulting in an erosion of its
human rights record.
   Specific charges against Kenya by human rights groups, as well as
the State Department's annual international human rights report,
include the stifling of political opposition by banning political
parties and jailing dissidents.
   Critics also object to recent constitutional amendments that
allow President Daniel arap Moi to dismiss judges and to detain
criminal suspects without trial for up to 14 days.
   But Kenyan Ambassador Denis Afande said critics fail to
understand that Kenya is acting strictly within the bounds of its
own constitution and laws. ``Kenya is trying very hard to respect
the rule of law,'' he said in an interview. ``The criticism here is
very demoralizing to my people.''
   Other African nations have much worse records than Kenya, he
said, and many Kenyans feel their country is being picked on
unfairly. ``We were very surprised by all this,'' Afande said.

   As many as 7,000 people were evacuated
from their homes Monday after a leaking crude oil tank at a Chevron
plant created a noxious cloud of gas with traces of hydrogen
sulfide, officials said.
   More than 20 people were treated and released at hospitals for
minor reactions to the fumes, most for fume inhalation, officials
said.
   Chevron officials said they were monitoring air quality in the
area of the leak since it was discovered in the early afternoon, and
described the gaseous release as a miminum health hazard that
created a terrible odor.
   ``Most crude oils in Texas have sulphur in them, and that means
their gas containes hydrogen sulfide, which is listed as one of the
hazardous chemicals,'' said Chevron spokesman Art Spencer.
   Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable, poisonous gas with a
characteristic odor of rotten eggs.
   ``We're doing continuous monitoring and we're finding that
there's nothing there that is hazardous to health and we're also
finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening,''
Spencer said.
   ``But the odor got so strong that the city emergency response
unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of it,'' he
said.
   Authorities described the evacuation as the largest in recent
years in this coastal city, a heavily industrial area near the
Louisiana border.
   ``We've had some real bad fires at these plants where people were
injured and killed, but even then we never had an evacuation of this
magnitude and I've been here 28 years,'' said Port Arthur police
Sgt. Cedric Clayton.
   Sgt. Mark Blanton estimated late Monday that 5,000 to 7,000
people were evacuated from a densely populated 14- by 17-block area
on Port Arthur's west side. About 3,000 people were being housed at
three schools that were opened as emergency shelters, he said.
   Officials decided after a late meeting with Chevron officials
that the evacuation would continue until at least 7 a.m. Tuesday,
Blanton said.
   ``It appears the spill is under control, but the odor is still
present and we're going to keep it evacuated until then,'' he said,
adding that Chevron tests show a mimimal amount of hydrogen sulfide
is present.
   At least 24 people were examined at local hospitals as a result
of the leak, officials said.
   ``As far as I'm aware, plans are just to treat and release
them,'' said Doctors Hospital spokesman Dan Bleyhl. ``Nobody
suffered anything really bad.''
   A Chevron employee discovered the leak around 1:30 p.m. Monday,
officials said. The leaking tank has a capacity of about 300,000
gallons, but its exact content was not known because it was
connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit,
Spencer said.
   Crews were using vacuum trucks Monday evening to remove the
spilled crude from a ditch surrounding the tank, but Spencer
estimated the task could take two or three days to complete.

   A cave-in in a gold mine shaft killed
three miners in this northeastern Ontario city, the mine manager
said.
   The three bodies were brought up from a depth of 1,200 feet about
five hours after Monday's accident, said Robert Perry, general
manager of the Placer Dome mine near the Quebec border.
   One member of a four-man mining crew, who was above ground when
the cave-in occurred, had reported his fellow miners missing, Perry
said.
   Union and mine officials said they would conduct separate
investigations into the cause of the cave-in.
   It was the second fatal accident in a year at the mine, which
began operating in 1910. A worker was killed in May when he fell
down an ore chute.

   A major tobacco company advertised its cigarettes
as ``Just what the doctor ordered'' at the same time it began a
defense of smoking against growing evidence of serious health
hazards, according to newly released documents.
   Reports and memorandums passed between the research firm A.D.
Little Inc. and Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. since the 1950s were
gathered by a Boston attorney in a 1987 liability suit against
Liggett and released by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month.
   More than 1,200 pages of the documents reviewed by The Associated
Press indicate that Liggett officials knew their product posed a
health hazard but that they denied the dangers to themselves,
smokers and the surgeon general.
   The documents, highlights of which were cited in the liability
suit against Liggett in Newark, N.J., by survivors of a heavy
smoker, prove nothing, said Liggett, the maker of L&amp;M and
Chesterfield cigarettes.
   ``The charge that Liggett suppressed information was rejected by
the court and the jury,'' said Liggett attorney Donald Cohn. ``In
other words, we've been through all this and it ended up a big zero,
and that was a 5{-month trial.''
   In that case, a federal jury in June found Liggett partly
responsible for a smoker's lung cancer and awarded $400,000 to her
widower, Antonio Cipollone. But the jury cleared Liggett and two
other cigarette makers, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc., of
conspiring to mislead the public about the risks of smoking.
   ``Clearly they (Liggett) had enough evidence to conclude that the
product was harmful to humans,'' said Dr. Gregory Connolly, head of
Massachusetts' anti-smoking office.
   ``They conducted counter-advertising programs to keep people
smoking, and they modified their products to allay public fear
without producing anything safer. We've paid an extremely heavy
price in terms of human lives.''
   The documents show that after a 1954 review of existing studies,
A.D. Little and Liggett moved ahead with their own research, and
began, often despite strong hints of hazards, a long defense of
smoking.
   Liggett's advertising in the 1950s included the line ``Rosalind
Russell says L&amp;M filters are just what the doctor ordered.'' Other
ads proclaimed ``Nose, throat and accessory organs not adversely
affected by smoking Chesterfields'' and ``Play safe, Smoke
Chesterfields.''
   When Edward R. Murrow reported in 1954 that smoking appeared to
cause lung cancer, Liggett asked A.D. Little to put the damaging
information into a more favorable light. The response was three
short statements to be read after an episode of ``Dragnet.''
   ``Before this year is ended about 20,000 people in the United
States will get lung cancer. Twice as many will probably die in
automobile accidents,'' one statement said. ``There is no real proof
that the smoking of cigarettes is a cause of lung cancer now; there
is only an association and a suspicion. Don't let's be fooled by
mere suspicion.''
   A.D. Little scientists prepared a paper for presentation at a
private conference in June 1960 in Durham, N.C. _ the site of
Liggett headquarters _ that referred to statistics linking smoking
with lung cancer and said data showing tobacco smoke caused skin
cancer in laboratory animals ``are confirmed by experiments which
were run in our own laboratories.''
   Tobacco companies took the position that they could publicly deny
any link between cancer and smoking as long as they could point to
air pollution, drinking or any other possible factor in cancer rates
in humans, said Northeastern University Law Professor Richard
Daynard, leader of the Tobacco Liability Project, which tracks
research and litigation on smoking.
   ``On a legal level, it's outrageous. There's a clear duty to
warn,'' he said.
   The surgeon general released the first government report linking
smoking to lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema in 1964.
   A February 1963 A.D. Little in-house draft on smoking and
mortality rates prepared in anticipation of the surgeon general's
report states that researchers felt there was ``a statistically
significant, not merely apparent, relationship between cigarette
smoking and death rates.''
   But Liggett told the surgeon general in April 1963 that any
assessment of the effects of cigarette smoking would be ``highly
speculative.''

   Armenians are rebuilding their cities and towns
hit by the Dec. 7 earthquake, but it is proving harder for them to
recover from the ethnic strife with neighboring Azerbaijan that
began a year ago. A former Moscow correspondent recently returned to
an Armenian village to gauge the aftermath of both upheavals.

<TEXT>
   In this backward Armenian village torn
apart last year by bitter ethnic strife and a devastating
earthquake, the rival mountain people are finding it easier to mend
bones than fences.
   Despite edicts from Moscow that national differences be cast
aside, and despite the daunting task of post-disaster recovery, the
peasants of Kursali are loathe to let go of the hate for
Azerbaijanis that has given them solace through severe tragedy.
   The long-simmering hostility between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
that broke open a year ago forced the 1,100 residents of this
ancient village to choose sides against friends and neighbors.
   There had been little trouble here, but, in an excess of
adherence to the adage that blood is thicker than water, Kursali
came to typify the headlong rush into ethnic trauma that wracked
Armenia before the earthquake.
   Nearly 1,000 Armenians sought refuge here after rioting and
murder in the Azerbaijani port of Sumgait, some crowding into the
hillside homes of relatives and others swapping the places they
abandoned for stone hovels left behind by Azerbaijanis made to pay
for the crimes of their distant countrymen.
   Kursali was in the midst of such turmoil that officials have no
clear idea how many people were here when the Dec. 7 earthquake
struck, destroying every dwelling and visiting death on every family.
   ``For us every day is like the day of the earthquake. It's
horrible,'' said Alavina Mirzoyan, whose husband was killed when the
house across the rutted road tumbled into ruins with him inside.
   She lives with her three children and two elderly in-laws at a
cold, windswept campsite among the rubble that used to be their home.
   Her sister-in-law, Nora Bagiryan, contends the family cannot be
evacuated because of bureaucratic tangles and the fact that they
delayed leaving until her brother's body was found two weeks after
the earthquake.
   ``Now they've stopped evacuating people and look what these
children must live with!'' she lamented, breaking into sobs.
   With no longstanding ties to the area, the family fears it will
fall to the bottom of the housing allocation lists in the hands of
officials of the close-knit villages surrounding Spitak, the city
hit hardest by the earthquake.
   The Spitak region's mayor, Vresh Adjyan, showing West German Red
Cross representatives the village they have proposed to rebuild,
conceded there has been a halt to evacuations but promised the
family their plight would be addressed.
   ``We came here on Nov. 13 after we traded our home in Azerbaijan
for this,'' Grigory Bagiryan said, motioning to a pile of twisted
beams and shattered stone walls. ``We don't have jobs here or a home
or anything. And the Azerbaijanis are laughing at us.''
   Only two ruined homes away, Akhmed Gosanov tells a sad tale from
the other side of the controversy.
   The Azerbaijani farmer lived all of his 65 years in the spacious
stone home his grandfather built, raising seven children and tending
a prosperous plot of fruit trees.
   But the Armenians who had been his friends through life drove him
and other Azerbaijanis from the village when the flood of refugees
arrived and ethnic hatred spread swiftly through the overwhelmed
community.
   The home was taken over by Armenians, but Gosanov retains
ownership of it and the rights to farm the land.
   ``We never had any problems here,'' the bewildered farmer said.
``We want to live here, but the Armenians won't let us.''
   With his family safe in the Azerbaijani city of Kirovabad,
Gosanov has been camped in freezing weather in a sod hut that he
built in the corner of his property. He makes daily forays into
nearby Spitak to plead for a fair price for his property and losses.
   ``I've lived here all my life. My father died here, and my
grandfather died here,'' Gosanov said. ``And now the Armenians are
trying to throw me out.''
   The Armenian officials of the Spitak region have offered him only
a fraction of what his rights to the private plot are worth, he
contends.
   The ethnic conflict that has separated Gosanov from his Armenian
neighbors stems from centuries-old differences and distrust between
the Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   Long suppressed by the official Soviet facade of multinational
brotherhood, hostility broke open in the first days of 1988 when
Armenians began demonstrating in demand of annexation of a mostly
Armenian region of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The protests were initially peaceful, but counterdemonstrations
by Azerbaijanis turned violent. On Feb. 28, zealots went on a
rampage of atrocity, killing 26 Armenians and six others in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
   Inter-ethnic turmoil rocked the Caucasus Mountain area
intermittently throughout last year, and the earthquake that killed
25,000 people did nothing to defuse the widespread tensions.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev lashed out at the demonstrators
after a visit to the earthquake-stricken area, but in distant
regions such as Spitak and Kursali the local officials can do little
to soften the strife. They often share the anti-Moslem sentiments of
their fellow Armenians.
   Kursali, which is expected to be rebuilt this year, likely will
continue to be plagued with discontent as the homeless masses with
rival claims to residence here struggle to rebuild and return to the
old ways.
   The Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, who were welcomed with
open arms last year, now are competing for the sturdy new homes to
be built here. Claims of favoritism and injustice are expected to
flourish when the houses are finished late this year.
   Spitak and nearby villages were evacuated after the earthquake,
but the injured are recovering and returning to see what of their
lives is salvageable.
   ``Nothing is getting better,'' said Alexander Gukasyan, an
Armenian refugee from Azerbaijan recuperating at a Red Cross field
hospital in Stepanavan, another of the hardest-hit cities. ``The
Azerbaijanis continue to throw us out, even when we have no place to
go.''

   Breathe deeply to greet the day? Not in Mexico
City. It has some of the dirtiest air in the world.
   It burns the eyes and nose, hides the spectacular, snowcapped
volcanoes outside the city, and leaves tourists with a smell more
memorable than the sights seen dimly through the haze.
   Doctors say the pall is a hazard for the metropolitan area's 19
million residents, and the public outcry has become loud enough to
force at least some government action.
   ``For all of us who live here, it is shortening our lives,'' said
Homero Aridjis, an writer of prose and poetry who speaks for the
Group of 100 Artists and Intellectuals, an environmental protection
group.
   Studies indicate athletes who exercise outdoors suffer reduced
lung capacity. Patients with respiratory illnesses recover slowly.
   Embassies offer early retirement or weekends out of the smog.
Schools closed in January, one of the worst months for pollution.
   ``Since the middle of 1986, the question has been who is going to
take responsibility for the effect this has on children,'' said
Humberto Bravo of the National University's Center for Atmospheric
Studies, who has been studying air pollution since the 1950s.
   ``We're not only contaminating more but it is increasing faster
and in a way that is more damaging to health,'' said Ramon Ojeda
Mestre, director of pollution control.
   Pollution is not a top priority, however, for peasants who
continue to arrive from the countryside in large numbers seeking
work.
   ``Do you think they are going to be very worried about the
environment when they're at a subsistence level wondering `What am I
going to eat?''' said Margarita Castillejos of the Colegio de
Mexico, a graduate school and think tank.
   Ozone, the main contaminant, is caused largely by automobile
exhaust and exceeded Mexico's acceptable level of .11 parts per
million at least 323 days last year, according to government records.
   In Los Angeles, synonymous with smog in the United States, the
ozone standard of .12 parts per million was violated on 174 days in
1988.
   Mountains ring the Valley of Mexico and what goes into its air
has a hard time getting out. Winds carry pollution from the
industrial north of the valley to the residential south.
   Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conqueror, first saw Tenochtitlan, the
city's Aztec ancestor, 35 miles away between the 17,000-foot peaks
of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. That was in November 1519; it
seldom can be seen from that distance now.
   Officials and environmentalists blame the 3 million cars and
other vehicles for 80 percent of the nearly 5 million tons of
pollution expected this year.
   Few Mexicans can afford new cars. Officials estimate 60 percent
of those in the valley need repairs and 1 million more than nine
years old.
   The three chief polluters among the valley's 35,000 industries
are owned by the government: an oil refinery in a densely populated
neighborhood and two electric plants that burn heavy fuel oil.
   Adding to Mexico City's pollution problems is its altitude of
7,400 feet, which creates more pollution by preventing engines from
burning fuel efficiently, and abundant sunshine that causes a
chemical reaction creating ozone.
   Wind adds other elements _ dust from dry lake beds and fecal
matter and garbage particles from open air dumps.
   The main problem doctors report is aggravation of asthma and
other respiratory illnesses.
   ``The children we are studying are going to be people who have
chronic illnesses,'' Ms. Castillejos said. ``They may not die but
they aren't going to have a healthy life,''
   Norberto Miranda Torres, a policemen on the busy Paseo de la
Reforma, said some officers ``have had to go to the doctor and it
turned out that even their lungs were affected. When they spit, it's
black. I have a friend they sent out of the city for 15 days on
doctor's orders.''
   Dr. Daniel Aguilar Angeles of the government's General Hospital
said a patient from Mexico City with respiratory or digestive
illnesses is more difficult to treat than one from the provinces.
   ``He doesn't respond to the treatments or responds badly,'' said
Aguilar, who heads an association studying pollution effects.
   Dr. Ruben Shturman said a study he is conducting on athletes in a
downtown park indicates at least one-third suffer respiratory
impairment, compared with less than 10 percent of the general
population. The air is so bad that making lungs more efficient is
harmful, he said.
   ``The more they exercise, the more polluted the air is, the worse
the potential for damage,'' he said. Shturman works out on a
treadmill and small trampoline in his lab, with an air purifier
going.
   Facing growing demand for action, the government last year began
auto emission checks and extended school Christmas vacations through
January.
   A new program calls for better studies of contamination sources,
increased monitoring, use of low sulfur fuels in the refinery and
other facilities and better control of industrial emissions.
   Catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline will be phased in by
the early 1990s, officials say.
   Ojeda Mestre, the pollution control director, said the program is
expected to cut pollution this year by 20 percent.

   A young woman's scathing public reply to a college
student's classified ad seeking a wife has touched off a heated
public debate over the low social status of intellectuals in a
country that once prized learning.
   ``Wielders of pens like you are less than beggars; people like
you who take the world prize for being behind the times are nothing
but fools,'' she wrote in a letter published in the Zhejiang
Workers' News, where the lovelorn student placed his ad.
   The tale was retold Monday in the national newspaper for
intellectuals, the Guangming Daily. Neither the woman nor the
student was identified.
   ``Learning is not food on the table, ideals are not money to
spend,'' the woman wrote. ``Modern women eat money and people like
you who wield pens and don't have money can only marry 50-year-old
housewives. If you do marry a housewife, advise your children not to
go to school. Five years of elementary school is enough, everyone
nowadays uses calculators.
   ``Tell them to sell soft-shelled turtles'' _ an expensive
delicacy _ ``and they can become multimillionaires.''
   The letter, published in coastal Zhejiang province late last
year, ``touched a sensitive spot in society,'' the Guangming Daily
said.
   The Zhejiang Workers' News was inundated with phone calls and
nearly 700 letters from readers who agreed with the woman or offered
consolation to the young man.
   ``This view that learning has no value is just a temporary
phenomenon,'' wrote one reader, Shao Guoqin.
   But many teachers, researchers and writers fear their low status
has become a permanent feature of modern Chinese society. After
centuries in which scholars ruled China and learning was the only
way to advance, those with college degrees have become one of the
poorest-paid groups in cities.
   A survey by the Beijing Statistics Bureau last year found that
college graduates earned an average of $9 less each month than
illiterates.
   Most college professors earn far less than the $54 per month that
is common for factory workers.
   Scholars' traditional status first was undermined by Mao
Tse-tung's distrust of them and the revolutionary leader's emphasis
on the wisdom of simple peasants.
   Since Mao's death in 1976, intellectuals no longer face attack as
class enemies. Instead, in a society newly concerned with making
money, they have watched inflation erode the spending power of their
fixed salaries while factory workers have been encouraged with pay
bonuses.
   ``Our brains are stuffed with learning, but are our pockets
jingling?'' one college graduate wrote to the Zhejiang Workers'
News. ``We can only haggle with the peddlers _ a penny for cabbage,
two cents for radishes. Women treat college students with disdain
and some people in society look down on them _ isn't it because
there's no money in studying?''
   Surveys found that intellectuals have less leisure time than
other urban residents and live an average of 58 years, 10 years less
than the national average, due apparently to poor nutrition and hard
work.
   College students, worried about their futures, repeatedly have
put up posters protesting the poor status of intellectuals.
   The problem has been a theme of all student protests in recent
years, including rallies and a poster campaign last June at Beijing
University that began when a student was killed by a group of
unemployed youths.
   Students also have protested by dropping out. Official reports
said the number of undergraduates quitting school rose 45 percent
last year, while the number going on to postgraduate studies fell 75
percent.

<HEAD>Met Opera Sets New `Salome' in 20th Century</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the curtain rises on the Metropolitan
Opera's two-story new production of ``Salome,'' it looks like a set
for a Kurt Weill opera or maybe ``Cabaret.'' It cries out ``German
decadence'' in the time the Nazis came to power.
   It doesn't make ``Salome'' any more universal to set it in the
century in which Richard Strauss composed it rather than in biblical
times, but it works. Even for an audience which has heard ``Salome''
often before, the production and Eva Marton as Salome provided some
chilling moments.
   Miss Marton is exceptional. Her voice soars through dense
orchestration. Mature technique gets her there but she keeps her
voice sounding young.
   Salome is young and director Nikolaus Lehnhoff has directed
carefully in that direction. Her acting conveys that Salome doesn't
understand the lust that draws her to John the Baptist. When he
flings her from him, she has childish tantrums.
   After John the Baptist is beheaded, Miss Marton's voice becomes
mature-sounding and she seems to be bragging about a kinky lust she
now does understand.
   Two or three small excesses could be trimmed so the theatrical
experience isn't broken by inappropriate laughter. The stage is
slanted but a woman pushed away by a man probably wouldn't roll over
twice from the shove. When Miss Marton starts her dance, she removes
the long pink gloves that match her girlish gown and twirls the
gloves like a stripper before throwing them to Herod.
   Richard Cassilly sounded Wagnerian as Herod, keeping a full voice
centered to punch it authoritatively through the large orchestra.
Helga Dernesch was glamorous as Salome's mother, Herodias. Mark
Baker sounded very good as Narraboth, the young guard captivated by
Salome. He replaced Neil Rosenshein, who was ill.
   The set is like nothing else the Met has seen. The main stage
looks like the basement of a castle, with walls of black bricks, a
gate at the back and a rectangular hole in the floor, the dungeon
where John the Baptist, called Jochanaan in the opera, is kept.
   Bernd Weikl sounded commanding as Jochanaan. But his standing
against the gate, arms outstretched like Jesus on the cross, was
another effect used too often.
   Miss Marton's dance of the seven veils was a success. She began
with graceful arm motions and no veils in sight. As she danced, she
removed the skirt of her dress and sheer underskirts, throwing them
into the dungeon. She finished in a simple white dress.
   Marek Janowski conducted superbly. Gil Wechsler had spotlights
follow principals through the general gloom and put two fixed
spotlights on Jochanaan. Lehnhoff, from Hannover, Germany, was
making his Met directing debut. Set and costume designer Jurgen
Rose, a native of Bernburg-Saale, East Germany, also made his Met
debut.

   A young girl's pet heifer, whose theft just before
a livestock show aroused the community, was returned to its owner
after investigators tracked the cow down and arrested two suspected
rustlers.
   ``I was jumping up, screaming and standing on my head,''
9-year-old Ginny Sherman said Monday, describing her reaction when
the white-faced, polled Hereford named T.C. was returned the night
before.
   ``We're never going to sell her. We're going to raise her to show
and keep her until she dies,'' said Ginny, who is showing T.C. at
the Houston Livestock Show.
   There was an outpouring of concern after the cow disappeared on
Valentine's Day from the Future Farmers of America Barn in the
Houston suburb of Pearland.
   Police offered a $1,000 reward and at least two Houston radio
stations reported a big response after airing stories about Ginny
and T.C.
   ``We had a call about every minute and a half for four hours,''
said KILT announcer Robert B. McEntire.
   Investigators for the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers
Association, working with law enforcement officers, traced the
heifer to Abilene.
   Investigator Doyce Cook said the animal was sold at an auction in
Llano, northwest of Austin, and was easily identified because it had
tatoos in both ears.
   Authorities said two Houston teen-agers were in the custody of
juvenile authorities, but have not been charged.

   Hundreds of flag-waving
schoolchildren greeted Prince Charles as he arrived for a three-day
visit in honor of this former British Caribbean colony's 10th
independence anniversary.
   Charles, 40, who will represent the British monarchy during
Wednesday's celebrations, was accompanied Monday by a 12-member
delegation including exiled King Constantine of Greece.
   The prince traveled here from Wellington, Fla., where he spent
the weekend playing polo.
   About 3,000 onlookers and 600 children cheered the smiling prince
on his arrival at Hewanorra International Airport.
   He then boarded a small plane for the 15-minute flight to the
capital of Castries on the other end of this 238-square-mile
island-nation, where he was greeted by hundreds more schoolchildren
and St. Lucia Governor General Stanislaus James.
   In Castries Harbor, five visiting warships _ three British, one

   Actress Vanessa Redgrave, who has been criticized
by Jewish groups for supporting the Palestine Liberation
Organization, is sponsoring the first Western performances by the
Moscow-Jewish Theater Shalom.
   Redgrave appeared at west London's Lyric Hammersmith Theater
Monday to introduce members of the Shalom company, which will
present Arkady Khyte's ``The Train To Happiness (Scenes From Jewish
Life)'' beginning tonight.
   The play, presented by Vanessa Redgrave Enterprises, will be
performed in Russian with simultaneous translation by actresses
Frances Barber and Kika Markham and American playwright Martin
Sherman.
   Redgrave, 52, called Shalom's Western debut ``a very profound
historical and emotional experience,'' and said her career was
influenced by seeing the Jewish actors Stella Adler and Joseph
Schildkraut in the United States in the 1950s.
   The Shalom's artistic director, Alexander Levenbuk, denied
suggestions that the actress was anti-Semitic.
   ``She's a wonderful woman,'' Levenbuk said. ``If such supposed
anti-Semites were doing the sort of thing she's doing, everyone
would be better off.''
   Shalom hopes to take ``The Train to Happiness,'' a series of
sketches about Jewish life in Russia from czarist persecution to the
present day, to the United States and Israel later this year.

   Former U.S. astronaut James B. Irwin
gave President Daniel Ortega a tiny Nicaraguan flag taken to the
moon in the 1971 Apollo 15 space mission.
   Irwin, a 58-year-old retired Air Force colonel who travels
worldwide preaching Christianity, called the flag ``a gift of love
to the people of Nicaragua.''
   ``Just like you took this flag to the moon, relations between our
two countries must return to normalcy,'' Ortega said at Monday's
ceremony. ``You are making a contribution toward that, and for this
I thank you.''
   Irwin's trip was sponsored by Christian Embassy, an international
ministry of politicians, diplomats and business people, said Barry
Bowater, who started a chapter in Ottawa five years ago and
coordinated the trip.
   The 4-inch-by-3-inch, blue and white Nicaraguan flag was framed
with a picture of the astronauts taken on the moon and a patch with
the Apollo mission logo. Irwin said the flag was among those from
several nations he took on his space trip and did not belong to the
U.S. government.
   Ortega gave Irwin a black ceramic dove, signifying peace.

   Victoria Principal, trying to move beyond her
image as a ``Dallas'' glamour girl, wears short hair and a boxy,
off-the-rack suit to portray a female assistant district attorney in

   In an interview in the Feb. 25 issue of TV Guide, Ms. Principal
said she found herself patronized as nothing more than a beautiful
woman and typecast after nine years of playing ``Dallas'' sweetheart
Pam Ewing.
   ``I realized there was a certain tone of voice someone would use

``He would not give me the benefit of the doubt that I could
understand what was being said or had the ability to create or
produce a project. It offended me, and there still is great rage.''
   Ms. Principal, who is executive producer of the CBS movie as well
as its star, observed female assistant district attorneys to prepare
for her role.
   ``None of them had longer than shoulder-length hair,'' she told
the Radnor-based magazine.

   Actor Martin Sheen led about 300 demonstrators
in a protest outside police headquarters against the recent arrests
of day laborers waiting on street corners for job offers.
   Sheen was joined by a half-dozen representatives of church groups
as he attempted to deliver a letter to Police Chief Daryl Gates
Monday calling the arrests ``a totally undemocratic, imposing and
racist action.''
   Police have said they were enforcing the 1986 immigration laws,
which prohibit employment of undocumented aliens.
   Sheen told Sgt. Bryce Houchin that the demonstrators were there
specifically to protest the arrests of 50 laborers at an
intersection last Thursday. Houchin did not permit the demonstrators
inside, but said the letter would be delivered to one of Gates'
representatives.
   Sheen, 48, has participated in numerous anti-nuclear protests and
demonstrations on other issues.

   Jesse Jackson made an appeal Monday for the
``earliest possible'' parole of soul singer James Brown, saying
Brown had been a model prisoner and an inspiration to others.
   Jackson met with Brown for more than 90 minutes to discuss the
singer's health, his trouble with the law and his stay at the State
Park Correctional Institute near Columbia.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a self-styled civil rights activist from
New York and longtime protege of Brown, met Jackson at the airport.
Sharpton asked to join the meeting with Brown, but South Carolina
corrections officials refused.
   Neither Sharpton nor Jackson was not on Brown's list of approved
visitors, but Jackson had received prior permission, authorities
said. The Chicago minister and South Carolina native said he wanted
to meet with Brown and learn more about the case.
   He said he had spoken with Gov. Carroll Campbell and Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., to see what could be done for Brown.
   Jackson said his intention was not to criticize any of the legal
aspects surrounding the case, including the six-year sentence Brown
received.
   ``The appeal really is for mercy,'' Jackson said.
   He said he also wanted to clear up misconceptions about Brown's
convictions. Jackson said Brown is concerned that the public
mistakenly thinks he was charged with the use or possession of drugs
and that he shot at police.
   Brown, in a statement read by Jackson, said, ``I am not on
drugs.''
   The 55-year-old entertainer, who lives in Beech Island, is
serving a six-year sentence at the minimum-security prison after
being convicted in January of an array of charges stemming from a
two-state, high-speed chase on Sept. 24.
   Judge Hubert Long said then that Brown must undergo examination
and treatment for any drug or alcohol problem he might have as part
of his sentence on the South Carolina conviction. Brown was
convicted in Georgia and South Carolina.
   Authorities said the chase began after Brown disrupted an
insurance seminar in an Augusta, Ga., office building by walking in
with a shotgun. Before officers could arrive, Brown left the
building and a chase began.
   Brown pleaded guilty in Georgia to having no state license tag,
reckless driving, driving with a suspended license, attempting to
flee or elude police, carrying a deadly weapon to a public
gathering, simple assault and improper lane change.
   He was fined $1,000 and given a six-year sentence that runs
concurrently with the six-year sentenced he received in South
Carolina for failing to stop for authorities during the chase.
   Brown will be eligible for parole in South Carolina in August
1991. But Georgia authorities say their state law provides Brown
must serve until March 10, 1992 on the six-year sentence before he
would be eligible for parole.
   Jackson said prison officials told him Brown was an inspiration
to other prisoners and to corrections department employees.
   Brown is popular with other inmates, said Francis Archibald,
director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Some
prisoners have had their pictures taken with the man who is known as
the ``Godfather of Soul,'' Archibald said.
   Brown works in the kitchen and sings in a church choir at the
center, he said.

<HEAD>Native Indians Meet to Protest Hydroelectric Dams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their first joint political action,
more than 500 Indians from 20 Amazon rain forest tribes have
gathered in this jungle town to protest planned hydrolectric dams
that would flood their lands.
   Sporting green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and red and black
warpaint, about 100 warriors from the Kayapo tribe ran chanting into
a brick community center Monday in Altamira, which is 2,000 miles
northwest of Rio de Janiero.
   The tribe circled in a ritual dance, then sat to applaud as the
men, women and children of each subsequent tribe arrived for a week
of debates, speeches and other events.
   For the first time, Amazon tribes were together to discuss common
concerns.
   The Indians are protesting the proposed Kararao and Babaquara
dams on the Amazon's Xingu river. If built, the reservoirs would
flood about 3,000 square miles of jungle, displacing 7,000 of the
220,000 Indians who remain in Brazil.
   About 5 million Indians roamed the country when the Portuguese
arrived in the 1500s and ``settled'' what is now South America's
largest nation.
   Anthropologists have expressed fears about the Indians' continued
survival, as hundreds of thousands of non-Indian homesteaders,
ranchers and prospectors stream into the Amazon annually, chopping
and burning away the rain forest and ignoring demarcations of native
tribal areas.
   ``We want the government to rethink the dams,'' Jorge Terena of
the Terena tribe told a cheering crowd packed into the community
center. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of our culture
and our ancestors.''
   ``We will not accept the dams,'' said David Yanomami of the
primitive Yanomami tribe. ``The river will rise. The fish will die.
The game will move away.''
   Later in the day, thousands of farmers and local shopowners
marched through Altamira, a town of 38,000, carrying placards saying
``Dams mean more jobs and more progress'' and ``Gringos leave us in
peace.''
   ``I know the Indians will have problems, but I'm in favor of the
dams,'' said Raimundo Castro Bastos, owner of an Altamira bar. ``I
believe the dams will bring development and progress for us.''
   Government and industry leaders say the energy provided by the
dams is vital for the growth of this Third World nation.
   The government representative to the meeting, Fernando Mesquita,
president of the Brazilian Environment Institute, spoke to whistles
and boos from the crowd, which included native Indian leaders from
around the world, hundreds of foreign and Brazilian
environmentalists, and droves of journalists.
   ``We recognize that great indignities were committed against the
Indian people. But now it is a question of national awareness. We
are here to listen,'' Mesquita said.
   The late December shooting death of internationally-known Amazon
ecologist Francisco Mendes, who fought against the destruction of
the rain forest by ranchers, increased international awareness of
the movement to preserve the jungle and protect its native peoples.
   Environmentalists are concerned that slash burning of the rain
forest is contributing to the warming of world temperatures and
destroying both a vital source of oxygen and an important habitat
for animal and plant life.
   The ecologists are trying to discourage foreign lending
institutions from putting money into Brazilian development projects
considered harmful to the enviroment and native peoples.
   Foreign governments and environmental groups have, for example,
proposed that Brazil swap part of its $115 billion foreign debt for
promises to preserve parcels of jungle territory.
   President Jose Sarney, for his part, has said he doesn't want any
meddling in domestic affairs by foreigners.

<HEAD>Pinochet Plans To Play Kingmaker In Presidental Race And Remain Army
Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet says that
although the constitution prevents him from running for re-election,
he will still pick the candidate he wants to succeed him and will
not step down as army chief.
   ``I'm going to tell you soon whom we must support'' in
presidential balloting scheduled for Dec. 14, the right-wing general
told cheering supporters on Sunday in Temuco, 370 miles south of
Santiago.
   ``Let's stay together, let's not quarrel among ourselves,'' the
72-year-old army commander said in his speech carried by Santiago
newspapers on Monday. ``We should not yield the field to those other
gentlemen'' in the opposition.
   Congressional elections also will be held Dec. 14.
   The Temuco speech quickly drew fire from opposition leaders, who
called Pinochet's remarks a threat to any future elected government.
   Pinochet was ending an eight-day tour of southern Chile during
which he made clear that he plans to retain a key role in Chile once
he steps down from the presidency in March 1990.
   The 55,000-men army is by far the most powerful of the armed
services and the key to Pinochet's hold of power for more than 15
years.
   Under a 1980 military-written constitution, Pinochet is allowed
to remain army commander for eight years after leaving the
presidency. He must hand power over on March 11, 1990, to the winner
of the December election.
   Andres Zaldivar, vice president of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, said Monday of Pinochet's remarks: ``That's
unacceptable. Pinochet should leave the army as a gesture of
dignity.''
   Pinochet took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the
elected government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died in the
takeover.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the elections after losing an Oct. 5
referendum, in which he sought voters' approval to remain in power
until 1997.
   After the referendum defeat, the pro-Pinochet forces split. At
least two politicians formally announced their candidacies for
president and conservative business leaders are actively promoting
the nomination of Pinochet's 39-year-old finance minister, Hernan
Buchi.
   Several small groups also asked that a formula be found, probably
a constitutional amendment, to allow Pinochet to run. He insists,
however, he definitely will not be a candidate. The constitution
bars him from running.
   But Pinochet has made it clear that he plans to play an active
role in the campaign and the election by telling his followers for
whom to vote.
   The opposition says it plans to seek a single presidential
candidate. Leaders of a coalition of 17 opposition parties are
scheduled to pick the nominee next month among at least four
contenders.
   Patricio Aylwin, a former Senate president, is considered the
front-runner.
   Aylwin is president of the Christian Democrats, the largest
opposition party, and was the opposition's chief spokesman during
the campaign for the referendum.

   The People's Daily, the voice of the Communist
Party and China's leading newspaper, is trying out a new look in an
attempt to win back readers by giving them more of the news that
interests them.
   The paper has seen its circulation fall 20 percent a year
recently. Currently, 4 million papers are printed a day, the most of
any daily in China, but only 2 percent of subscribers are private
citizens.
   In a front-page letter Monday to its readers, the paper said the
change would increase the amount and the timeliness of news. It also
said it would ``work to reflect the opinion of the people and help
employ public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses,
closer to life.''
   ``Not bad for day one,'' said a retired official as he read the
paper in downtown Beijing. ``I guess you could say it's `glasnost'
with Chinese characteristics.''
   In the past, the paper has been filled with reports about
bureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there. Tidbits of
important information were often buried.
   Breaking news such as plane crashes and important government
decisions was either not reported or published late and with scant
details. The paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues of
little import to everyday life.
   Many Chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift in
the political wind. But as the society has become more concerned
with economic development than ideology, the paper's usefulness _
and its readership _ has diminished.
   Monday's editions differed from previous weeks, but only slightly.
   International news was displayed on page one. Several breaking
stories were reported with current details. An unusual report
appeared on the status of China's military draft. More photographs
lined the pages.
   ``They wouldn't have had this a while ago,'' said Kang Kexing,
pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawling
for eels on the Yangtze River. ``Before, they'd only report it after
it ended.''
   A companion story asked the Agriculture Ministry for reaction.
``Telephone Interview By The Paper,'' read the headline.
   ``They seem to be showing off here,'' said Kang. ``Very pleased
with themselves for reporting this so soon.''
   Other readers pointed to a story on Salman Rushdie's apology to
Moslems angered by his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``In the past, it seemed that the only international news we got
were things almost directly related to China,'' said one reader.
``This has nothing to do with China. That seems to be a change, and
a good one.''
   The changes are limited, however. The People's Daily, like all
China's papers and publications, remains run by a government very
concerned with what is read by its people.
   Newspaper officials interviewed Monday said they believed the
change would help the circulation which has dropped further since
January when the paper doubled in price to about 5{ cents.
   Readers on the street were less enthusiastic.
   ``There's no comparison between this and some of the other
papers,'' said Yang Gong, a 23-year-old university student.
   Indeed, the People's Daily is by far the stodgiest of the four
dailies with the highest circulation in China.
   The No. 2 paper, the Worker's Daily, although generally
conservative, occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power for
the state-run labor union. Next in line, the Legal Daily, often is
filled with lurid stories of murders and rapes.
   The No. 4 paper, China Youth News, is one of the most interesting
publications in China. Over the last seven months, it has written on
labor strife, prostitution, homosexuality and the uses of liquor for
bribery.
   ``The People's Daily was boring before and it's boring now,''
said Chen Daqin, a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glass
case holding Monday's editions on bustling Wangfujing Street.
``They've changed the soup but the prescription's the same.''

<HEAD>Industry-Led Consortia Needed to Combat Foreign Competition, Group
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More industries must conduct joint research,
with government support, to cope with foreign competitors in
critical electronics areas, a panel of industry, academic and
government experts recommends.
   ``The survival of the U.S. industrial base in vital electronics
sectors is at stake,'' said a statement issued after a workshop
meeting last week held under the aegis of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   It said participants at the workshop had reached a consensus that
``to address the problem, we endorse industry-led consortia with
government cooperation and support.''
   The IEEE is a New York-based professional association with more
than 250,000 members worldwide.
   John Richardson, chairman of the IEEE's Committee on
Communications and Information Policy, said the consortia envisioned
by the panel would go beyond efforts currently being mounted by
Sematech, a consortium of U.S. companies developing advanced
technology for computer chip-making.
   ``Consortia similar to Sematech are needed because Sematech alone
will not do the whole job,'' he said. ``Sematech is a good start,
but that only addresses one part of the industry.''
   During last week's meeting, Richardson said, ``it was explored as
to how far along the spectrum of research, development,
manufacturing and commercialization these consortia should go. The
consensus was that they certainly should stop short of
commercialization.''
   The workshop involving about 60 participants from industry,
academia and government was held Feb. 14 at the Washington
headquarters of the National Research Council.
   A majority of the workshop's participants agreed that the
situation involving foreign competition was serious, but they
decided to shy away from estimating specifically how much it will
cost to turn things around.
   ``There was widespread if not unanimous agreement that the U.S.
electronic industries are in deep trouble, that there is a fighting
chance to recover, that this will have its costs and that these
costs will be non-trivial. But there was a reluctance at this early
stage to mention a dollar figure for government support or private
investment,'' Richardson said.
   Alan McAdams, an economics professor at Cornell University's
Johnson Graduate School of Manageent, said the panel put most
emphasis on developing initiatives in three areas _ high-definition
television, advanced-design memory chips and high-resolution
computer systems.
   ``We think that these initiatives will have enormous benefits to
the domestic economy,'' McAdams said. ``One trouble with talking
about cost is that people forget about benefits. We believe that
whatever we recommend will have payoffs many-fold greater than
cost.''
   The workshop stressed the importance of developing dual-use
technologies that meet both civilian and military needs.
   McAdams noted that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
has committed about $30 million and put out a call for proposals in
the area of high-resolution computer systems.
   ``We applaud the fact that they've acted quickly and that they
recognize that these are multi-use technologies, with both military
and civilian implications,'' he said.
   Participants at the workshop also looked for government support
of the electronics initiatives from the Commerce Department's
National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   Last week's meeting followed a position statement adopted Jan. 25
by the IEEE's Technology Activities Council.
   The statement said that ``the United States must immediately
re-establish significant technological capability and domestic
manufacturing of world-class products by U.S.-owned firms based on
electronic and related technologies that serve both civilian and
military purposes.''
   ``The situation is critical,'' it said. ``A pro-active stance by
the federal government is required if these goals are to be
achieved.''

   Share prices plunged at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Tuesday, but the dollar finished higher against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares, a 3.69-point
winner for a record close of 32,177.08 on Monday, lost 197.00
points, or 0.61 percent, to finish the day's session at 31,980.08.
   The dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's
125.75-yen finish. The currency opened at 126.60 yen and was traded
in a range of 126.60-127.35 yen.
   Dealers said many market participants hesitated to make major
moves before Congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan scheduled for later Tuesday.
   They added that the dollar moved higher because speculative
investors bought up the currency in anticipation of a tighter U.S.
economic policy.
   On the stock exchange, profit-taking erased earlier gains made by
the index, which had won about 48.40 points shortly after the market
opened for trading.
   Dealers said many speculative investors backed off in fear that
the main market barometer may rise too sharply.
   Attention focused on medium-sized shares, they said.

   When President Bush arrives in Japan for the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, a parade of kings, presidents and prime
ministers will begin streaming into the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo for a
chat with him.
   During Bush's two-day stay, as many as 15 to 20 foreign leaders
will have an audience with him.
   ``Funerals may be the most convenient way for meetings of heads
of state,'' says Robert A. Scalapino, director of the Institute of
East Asian Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
   ``Funerals seem to be a place where people can meet without too
much being written into it,'' Scalapino wrote recently. ``It doesn't
seem contrived.''
   John F. Kennedy's funeral provided the setting for many
high-level meetings in Washington. Likewise, the funeral in Moscow
of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev provided an opportunity for
meetings of heads of state.
   Many of the dignitaries Bush will see have talked with him during
his eight years as vice president, but there is a big difference
now. Bush is no longer the understudy.
   First on the visitors' list will be French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   Bush, arriving in Tokyo after a flight of more than 15 hours,
will go directly to the U.S. Embassy for a luncheon meeting with
Mitterrand. As he dines with the French leader, Bush's body clock
will tell him it is about midnight Wednesday in Washington, but in
Tokyo it will be about 2 p.m. Thursday.
   Bush is expected to nap on Air Force One on the way to Asia to
help adjust to the 14-hour time difference.
   Blocks of time have been set aside for other meetings on Thursday
night, Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.
   The entire list of Bush's visitors has not been released but his
guests are expected to include several Mideast leaders: Jordan's
King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli President
Chaim Herzog.
   Others who will see Bush are Pakistan's prime minister, Benazir
Bhutto, President Suharto of Indonesia, President Corazon Aquino of
the Philippines, King Juan Carlos of Spain and President Mobuto Sese
Seku of Indonesia.
   Bush also will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
at Akasaka Palace and with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace.
   In compiling Bush's guest list, White House officials considered
the nature of relations with countries whose leaders expressed an
interest in seeing the president, officials said.
   They also looked at whether there were shared interests, as well
as whether there was a past personal relationship.
   White House officials consulted with Japanese officials to make
sure they would not take offense at Bush for using the occasion of
the funeral for private meetings.
   ``We checked with the Japanese and they said it was perfectly
correct to do so,'' said a White House official. In fact, the
official said, the Japanese are pleased that Tokyo will be the site
of such high-level meetings.
   The president will receive dignitaries one by one at the American
Embassy across the street from the Okura Hotel where he's staying.
   Most of the meetings will run between 20 to 30 minutes, longer if
translations are necessary.
   Immediately after his last bilateral meeting Saturday, Bush will
depart for a two-night stay in China, the second country on a
three-nation journey.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that while Bush is in
Beijing, he plans to meet with Chinese human rights activist Fang
Lizhi. The Times quoted sources as saying Fang has been invited to a
reception that Bush will attend Sunday at the American Embassy in
Beijing.
   Fang, an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party, is an
internationally recognized astrophysicist and has often been
compared to Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. The meeting would mark
the first time that a U.S. president has met with a Chinese
dissident in Beijing.
   The president also will stop briefly in South Korea before
returning to Washington Monday night.
   White House officials are playing down expectations of major
developments from the talks.
   ``They are largely a renewal of acquaintances or introductions _
discussions of broad topics of mutual interests,'' one official said.
   ``You can't expect too much substantial accomplishment or
resolution of thorny issues in a 20 to 30 minute meeting,'' the
official added.

   An Air Force cargo plane with eight
people on board crashed and exploded in a swampy forest just north
of this base in the Florida Panhandle, officials said.
   The C-141 Starlifter cargo plane left from Norton Air Force Base
in Southern California, refueled in Colorado Springs, Colo., and was
on its final approach to land here when air traffic controllers from
adjacent Eglin Air Force Base suddenly lost radio and radar contact
around 8 p.m., Air Force officials said.
   Army Rangers reported an explosion about four miles north of the
field, said Airman Joe Geraci, duty officer at the airfield.
   It remained unknown early Tuesday whether there were any
survivors, said Hurlburt spokesman Lt. Doug Kinneard. Seven people
on board were crew members and one was a civilian passenger,
Kinneard said.
   Military and civilian fire and rescue units reached the crash
site by 10:10 p.m., Kinneard said.
   ``It's an extremely rugged area,'' Capt. Thom Connell, a Hurlburt
spokesman said early Tuesday. ``They're still working to get to the
actual wreck itself.''
   He said a helicopter had been dispatched to the site.
   The area around the base was hit by strong thunderstorms and
flashes of lighting through much of the night. Air Force officials
said it was too early to tell if the bad weather played a part in
the crash.
   The plane crashed in a forested swamp in the middle of the
testing range at Eglin, the Air Force's headquarters for non-nuclear
arms testing, the spokesman said.
   ``They've found one of the engines in a creek,'' said Lynn
Jurkovic, a dispatcher at the nearby Fort Walton Beach Fire
Department, which sent three rescue units to the scene.
   The C-141, capable of carrying up to 200 troops, belonged to the
63rd Military Airlift Wing at Norton, which is about 60 miles east
of Los Angeles, said base spokesman Capt. Gary A. Jacobs.
   The names of those aboard will be withheld pending notification
of next of kin, Jacobs said.

<TEXT>
   In the 1960s, Leo Whalen watched a news
report about the home of the nation's 36th president and decided
that Lyndon B. Johnson's ranch needed a few ducks.
   So he wrote a letter and proposed a trade: mallards to put in the
water on Johnson's property in exchange for a Lone Star LBJ Ranch
hat.
   ``It seems that you have a deal,'' LBJ's aide, Earl Deathe Jr.,
replied.
   The presidential pact was a feather in Whalen's cap, but no big
deal for his Whistling Wings Inc., beak broker to the world. The
Whalen family is to mallards what the Wrigleys are to gum. Only more
so.
   Each year, 200,000 mallards are born in this town of 1,100, which
lies 10 miles east of the Mississippi River in the northwestern
corner of Illinois. They're sold to conservation groups, university
researchers, hunting clubs, foreign palaces and even a few
restaurants _ around the globe.
   ``We originally started as a hunting club, but it never really
got off the ground,'' said the founder's son, Bill Whalen, who
shares duck-keeping duties with his sister, Marianne Whalen Murphy.
   ``Dad brought the idea home from Europe after World War II. But
at that time we were too far from any major city to draw hunters, so
we diversified and simply went into raising the birds,'' he said.
Because mallards are the most popular hunting ducks, Whistling Wings
stuck with them.
   ``We've grown up with it,'' says Mrs. Murphy, ``and it's grown
with us. ``When you pick up the phone you never know who you're
going to be talking to.''
   Once it was a caller from Japan, inquiring about ducks for
Emperor Hirohito. Chilean officials asked if they could send a plane
to get some eggs, and the Brookfield Zoo in suburban Chicago bought
a duck each week for an 11-foot anaconda snake.
   ``It just wouldn't take anything else,'' said zoo reptile curator
Ray Pawley.
   Whistling Wings has 4,000 breeding ducks. Each hen produces at
least 40 eggs that hatch in incubators after 27 days.
   Ducks sell for $1.55 to $15.50 depending on the age of the duck
and size of the order. Younger ducks cost less.
   Mrs. Murphy and her brother deal ducks out of a small office in
the center of Hanover. A few miles south, near the town sign that
welcomes travelers to the ``World's Mallard Duck Capital,'' is the
farm where ducks are kept in pens during late fall and winter.
   When the weather turns warm, most newborn mallards are driven to
a chain of small, private lakes on 300 hilly acres in Jo Daviess
County.
   ``We want to raise them in their own environment,'' Bill Whalen
explained as he took a visitor around the scenic duck territory, icy
and bare in winter.
   By truck or plane, they're shipped to 48 states and points beyond
_ sometimes unintentionally.
   ``Mom took some into Chicago once for a flight to Florida,'' Mrs.
Murphy said. ``The plane was hijacked to Cuba. One-thousand birds
headed to Tallahassee became Cuban ducks.''

   A family walking along a state beach
found a cleanly severed human head floating in the surf, officials
said.
   The unidentified victim, a white male, had been shot once, and it
was not known how long the head had been in the water, Santa Cruz
County Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Moore said.
   Law enforcement officers combed the beaches near Greyhound Rock
on Monday but did not find any other body parts or evidence, Moore
said.
   The victim was described as a white man, about 19 to 25 years old
with brown hair and blue eyes. An artist's sketch of the victim was
being circulated in an attempt to identify him.
   The head was discovered Sunday afternoon at Greyhound Rock State
Beach, about 13 miles north of Santa Cruz in northern California.

   Mexico has asked Washington to abandon its
plan to dig a ditch near San Diego along a four-mile stretch of
border that drug smugglers and illegal immigrants now cross in
vehicles.
   U.S. officials have said the 8-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch was
originally planned to improve drainage along the border on the
relatively flat Otay Mesa.
   But more recently, they said it could also discourage narcotics
traffickers and illegal aliens from crossing the border in cars and
trucks. On Friday, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Alan Nelson said construction could begin within two
months and should be completed by summer.
   In a statement late Monday, the Foreign Ministry asked the State
Department to abandon plans to dig the ditch ``and immediately begin
a study of other alternatives that would permit a quick and
acceptable solution to the problem of flood waters on the Otay
Mesa.''
   Ministry officials reacted with surprise in late January to news
reports that one purpose of the planned ditch would be to deter drug
smugglers and illegal immigrants.
   They said they had only been told the ditch, about 25 miles
southeast of downtown San Diego, was meant to improve drainage.
   The project has since been criticized by people on both sides of
the border. Some have likened it to the Berlin Wall, and several
Mexican congressmen called it an ``unfriendly'' gesture.
   Immigration officials say the isolated Otay Mesa is the most
popular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1,950-mile
U.S.-Mexico border.
   About one-third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants seized in
the United States last year were rounded up on the mesa. Officials
say up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally
into San Diego each month.
   The Foreign Ministry statement came three days after Nelson told
a meeting of Mexican and U.S. governors from border states that the
ditch would prevent illegal drugs and aliens from entering the
United States.
   But he emphasized that its primary purpose would be drainage.
   ``I hope it will be understood for what it is and what it is not.
At no time was there an intent to send a negative message (to
Mexico),'' he said during the 7th International Border Governors
Conference in the northern city of Saltillo.

   A Frenchman who made a world-record 14,000
parachute jumps fell to his death when his chute didn't open
properly, officials said.
   Roch Pierre Charmet, making his seventh jump of the day Monday
from Pacific Parachute Center, plunged into a stack of lumber at a
lumberyard near the airport here, according to Yamhill County
sheriff's Sgt. John Kowalik.
   The 59-year-old Montlhery man had jumped out of an airplane at
2,500 feet, said Pacific Parachute founder Ted Mayfield.
   ``He was just tumbling and falling to 500 feet,'' Mayfield said.
``I saw his pilot chute come out and then a ball of garbage. It was
just like the parachute didn't inflate. It was just a big ball.''
   Mayfield said Charmet had folded his own parachute.
   Charmet learned to jump in 1958 as a paratrooper with a French
army unit in Algiers. An instructor with the Parachute Institute of
France, Charmet broke the world record in Sheridan last year when he
made his 14,000th jump, Mayfield said.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists Charmet as the man with
the most jumps. Valentina Zakoretskaya of the Soviet Union, who has
made 8,000 jumps, holds the record for women.
   Charmet had been staying at the Sheridan Airport since the
beginning of this month, Mayfield said. He had come to Sheridan,
about 45 miles southwest of Portland, through a program sponsored by
the Portland Parachute Club and Mayfield's organization.
   Charmet's death was the 10th at the center since February 1974,
Mayfield said.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading stock index today
plunged from its latest record high, and the dollar gained sharply
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 197.00 points, or 0.61
percent, closing at 31,980.08. That was its first closing below the
32,000-yen level since Feb. 14, when it ended at 31,982.89.
   It had set a record high closing of 32,177.08 on Monday.
   The plunge in the index resulted mainly from the dollar's quick
rise on the foreign exchange market, said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   He also said prospects for a tighter economic policy in the
United States, possibly leading to higher interest rates,
discouraged investors from buying stock while awaiting Congressional
testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
scheduled later today.
   Expectations of higher interest rates generally discourage stock
buying, the analyst added.
   In addition, he said, institutional investors feared the Nikkei
had risen too high recently and were selling to take profits.
   In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.2
billion shares, steel and real estate shares were among losers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40
yen from Monday's 125.75-yen finish. The dollar opened at 126.60
yen, its low for the day, and went as high as 127.35 yen.
   The dollar's sharp rise was prompted by expectations of Greenspan
suggesting a tighter U.S. economic policy later today, dealers said.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive to foreigners.
   Some traders avoided major moves before Greenspan's testimony,
dealers added.

   A lack of snow made it difficult to bury the

67th annual hatchet hunt commemorating George Washington's birthday.
   Eric Shepardson, 13, and 4-year-old Alex Blake Jr. found two

to remind children of the founding father who, legend says, admitted
as a boy that he chopped down a cherry tree.
   ``No snow, so it was hard to hide the prizes. The prizes were
more easily found, but that was OK,'' said Joseph Hawkins, director
of the local YMCA that sponsored Monday's event along with the city
Fire Department.
   About 350 children participated in the three-hour hunt, Hawkins
said.
   Shepardson said he found one of the two hatchets when ``they
started giving clues.
   ``It was in a tin can that someone threw. It landed right next to
where I was standing,'' said the eighth-grader.
   Finders keep the hatchets, which are capable of taking down a
cherry tree, Hawkins said.

   A moose is keeping a vigil near four mares
on a farm here, but the horses' owner says the animal is lonely, not
lovestruck.
   The yearling moose appeared in the area Thursday and moved close
to John Calderwood's farm Sunday.
   ``He's not going to leave now,'' Calderwood said Monday.
   Calderwood and a state game warden believe the moose is male, but
they don't think it has amorous intentions.
   ``The game warden said he probably wandered off from his mother
and is lonely,'' said Calderwood, who raises horses on his Burnt
Swamp Farm.
   The mares aren't fond of the onlooker and move to the far side of
their enclosed pasture whenever the moose approaches the fence, he
said.
   ``They're not letting him out of their sight,'' Calderwood added.
   Calderwood said he isn't feeding the animal because he doesn't
want to encourage it to stick around. He said he hopes the moose
will depart before his mares begin going into heat in the next three
weeks.
   If a Vermont farmer's experience in October 1986 is any guide,
Calderwood could have a long wait. A lovesick moose wandered onto
Larry Carrara's farm in Shrewsbury, Vt., became enamored with his
Hereford cow, Jessica, and stayed for 76 days. The romance attracted
attention worldwide and prompted a Nashville, Tenn., man to write a
song about the unlikely couple.

   An effort to have the magpie declared the
state bird was beaten back by ruffled lawmakers, but only after a
legislator proposed a unique designation: state scavenger.
   State Sen. Bill Yellowtail extolled the magpie's virtues in
pushing a bill to have it replace the meadowlark as the state bird.
   He said the magpie is self-sufficient and hardy, like Montanans,
and praised it for staying in the state during bad weather as well
as good, unlike the migrating meadowlark.
   ``The meadowlark right now reclines on a Bahama beach, bedecked
in sunglasses and Bermuda shorts and drinking a mint julep,''
Yellowtail said.
   But other lawmkers denounced the magpie's eating habits and its
noisy chattering.
   Sen. Judy Jacobson said legislators who live in the capital for
part of the year shouldn't criticize those who head south for the
winter.
   ``Where would you be living today if people in Helena didn't go
south for the winter?'' she asked. ``We'd all be in tents on the
Capitol lawn.''
   Jacobson suggested the meadowlark retain its post and the magpie
be designated as the state scavenger, a move the Senate approved
34-14.
   ``I'd like to honor both of these birds in the way that they
ought to be honored,'' she said.

   Corrupt officials in China's army are recruiting
epileptics, criminals, schizophrenics, deaf mutes and people who
can't read, threatening the modernization of the army, the nation's
leading newspaper says.
   The report Monday in the People's Daily was one of several in the
state-run press recently on the difficulties of drafting and keeping
good soldiers.
   They have appeared as the People's Liberation Army gets ready for
its annual draft, which was moved up this year from autumn to March
1.
   ``An army with no education is a stupid army,'' the People's
Daily said. ``In today's world where military science is flying
ahead, a stupid army will fail.''
   Last week, the Liberation Army Daily ran two stories on how a
thief and rapist became a soldier after his father gave the wife of
a military official a job. The articles said such occurrences are
common.
   Monday's People's Daily cited one regiment in which 433 men
claimed to have a high school level education. When they were given
a test only 4 percent passed and 37 percent got a grade of zero.
   Of the 150 new conscripts another company got last year, the
majority were ``gamblers, fighters, thieves and hooligans,'' the
report said. One man was wanted for murder, another for escaping
from jail. One headed a criminal organization.
   In one division, 200 of the 733 soldiers were shorter than the
5-foot-3 cut-off point.
   ``Deaf mutes, sick people also become soldiers,'' the report
said. ``Schizophrenics, epileptics are also not rare.''
   ``Everybody in my county fills in the draft form the same way,''
said one illiterate soldier when asked why he claimed to have a high
school education on his draft card. ``We fill it in as we wish. And
whatever we say, that'll do for the truth. I can't write so I had my
cousin fill it in.''
   A Western military analyst said the annual draft was moved up
this year to force soldiers to undergo an extra winter training
period in their three years of service. The extra exercises will
help in the selection of officers and strengthen the military's weak
winter fighting capacity, he said.
   Conscription is supposed to play a key role in China's program to
modernize its military and abandon Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung's
philosophy for guerrilla warfare, ``People's War.''
   Under that strategy, China threw the largest number of people in
the smallest amount of space and tried to overwhelm its enemy. But
heavy losses suffered in 1979 during a border war with Vietnam
signaled its death knell.
   Reforms in the last nine years have cut at least 1 million men
from the military, leaving fewer than 3 million in uniform.
Standards for new soldiers have been raised. Today, 70 percent of
divisional leaders have college educations, compared with 1.6
percent in 1982.
   China started buying advanced weapons from the West and
developing its own arms industry. Last year, it reinstituted a
ranking system after a 23-year ban and elite fighting squads began
practice.
   Serious problems have developed in the draft, however.
   Attracted by the opportunites available under current economic
reforms, many men don't want to be soldiers. Others, who lack the
educational, cultural or physical standards still look to the
military as a way out of the countryside.
   ``The military is in a bind,'' said the military attache, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The only people who want to be
soldiers are hillbillies but the system has changed. No more is it
just `a rifle and a sleeping bag and off you go, sunshine.'''
   Corruption is rife as thousands of qualified men bribe officials
to let them out of military service and others who don't qualify pay
to get in.
   In addition, the defense budget has been cut drastically, from
about 17.5 percent of all state expenditures in 1978 to 8 percent
today. Many officers want early retirement to seek their fortunes
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Bill Baird Still Fighting for Abortion Rights After 26 Years</HEAD>

   Bill Baird says he's more worried than at any other
time during the 26 years he's fought for birth control and abortion
rights.
   Baird fears that his work, which led in part to the 1973 Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion, may swiftly come undone. And
he's concerned that no one understands what's at stake in the
growing battle between anti- and pro-abortion activists.
   ``I see war,'' predicted Baird. ``I see that this nation has a
real potential to turn into Northern Ireland unless people take
seriously this holy war being waged.''
   Baird, 56, believes women are about to lose important civil
rights allowing them to have abortions and to choose birth-control
devices. He views the onslaught against abortion as the result of an
aggressive right-wing agenda initially promoted by the Reagan
Administration.
   ``The real root of the anti-abortion movement is to keep women at
home waiting with the pipe and slippers,'' he said. ``It's called
control.''
   Baird says he began his crusade in the early 1960s when a woman
died in his arms after a self-inflicted abortion attempt with an
eight-inch coat hanger. Baird believes that American women may be
forced to return to that era.
   ``I grieve over the fact that America seems fast asleep at the
wheel,'' Baird said during a recent interview at his counseling and
referral clinic in Boston. ``Americans should wake up and learn that
freedom isn't free.''
   Despite his years battling anti-abortion activists, Baird has
never taken a public stance on the morality of choosing an abortion.
   ``And I never will,'' he said. ``We men have been telling women
what to do for too long. When I'm asked the question in debates, I
always say, `I'll never get pregnant, it isn't up to men to decide
for women.'''
   Baird often travels with a voluminous file of old press clippings
that detail his brushes with the law _ like his 1967 arrest for
distributing contraceptives to Boston University students.
   For a man closely associated with the once-revolutionary concept
of sexual freedom, Baird leads a near-monastic life.
   He has lived 400 miles apart from his wife and four children for
almost 15 years. The decision to live separately came after his
children became the target of death threats. Baird moved them to an
undisclosed town somewhere in New England and lives alone ``behind a
six-foot high fence'' on New York's Long Island.
   Baird's two other counseling clinics are in Hempstead and
Hauppage on Long Island. His clinics do not offer abortions because
they became too expensive to perform, he said.
   Baird said he is ``painfully lonely'' and admitted that his
children harbor some resentment over his work and the family's
separation.
   But nothing can stay him from his crusade. He said he recently
worked night and day on behalf of a comatose New York woman who was
allowed by a judge to have an abortion earlier this month over the
objection of anti-abortion activists.
   ``I see myself as the candle that lights the darkness of
ignorance and sexism,'' Baird said. ``I don't have much money but
I'm the most stubborn man you'll ever meet in your life.''
   Baird is most bitter about a 1971 incident in which he gave a
lecture on birth control before an audience that included a mother
and her 14-month old child and was arrested for corrupting a minor.
   He also served three months in prison for distributing
contraceptives. He said he still ``remembers how I felt standing in
the ashes'' after his Hempstead clinic was firebombed in 1979.
   He has been shot at, spat at and reviled even by some feminists.
But he will not be deterred.
   ``I will die fighting this cause,'' he said. ``I eat, sleep and
breathe your rights.''

   A minor earthquake shook Seattle suburbs,
but there were no reports of damage, said the National Earthquake
Information Center here.
   The quake occurred at 10:48 p.m. PST Monday about 20 miles
southwest of Seattle and registered 3.0 on the Richter scale, the
center said.
   The quake was felt in the south Seattle suburbs of Federal Way,
Renton, Enumclaw and Skyway, the center said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage.

   Many of the first visitors to a new museum at the
former Texas School Book Depository went directly to the sixth-floor
spot where Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly fired the shots that killed
President Kennedy.
   ``It took me back, that view, it really did,'' said Pat Radmacher
of Granbury, one of 1,700 people who visited The Sixth Floor museum,
which opened during the Presidents Day holiday Monday in what is now
the Dallas County Administration Building.
   The southeast corner has been made to appear as it did when
Oswald ate lunch there Nov. 22, 1963, waiting for Kennedy's
motorcade. Visitors may not share Oswald's perch _ which has been
sealed off with glass _ but see a view of Elm Street close to it.
   ``I got a big lump in my throat when I saw this window,'' said
Danny Veno of Dallas. ``I've waited a long time to see this. A long,
long time.''
   The 9,000-square-foot exhibit organized by the Dallas County
Historical Foundation contains 350 photographs, 30 artifacts, a
30-minute audio tour and six films running a total of 40 minutes.
   ``Our purpose is not to preserve the memory of that death,''
Dallas County Judge Lee F. Jackson said at a dedication ceremony.
``It is not in our power to preserve what already lives so
powerfully any more than we could erase or escape this history.
   ``The lessons of history found here will be passed, like a torch,
to all generations.''
   ``About 26 years ago America was wounded,'' said the Rev. G.
James Christopher of the St. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church. ``But today we stand here whole again.''
   Dallas residents often have debated whether there should be
official recognition of the Kennedy assassination in the city where
he was killed.
   The Sixth Floor, Christopher said, shows Dallas has ``finally
reconciled the pain of the past with the promise of hope for the
future.''
   Although it was packed with people, the museum was very quiet,
save for some small talk and a couple of children asking quesions.
   Four-year-old Jeremy Livingston looked up at his father, Jerome
Livingston, a computer programmer from New York.
   ``Why would anyone want to kill a president?'' the boy asked.

   Iran recalled all its ambassadors from
Common Market countries today, a day after the 12 European countries
recalled their envoys to protest Ayatollah Khomeini's execution
order against novelist Salman Rushdie.
   The move by the Foreign Ministry was in direct reponse to the
Common Market foreign ministers' decision in Brussels, Belgium, on
Monday to recall their ambassadors from Tehran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   IRNA did not specify the countries from which the Iranian
ambassadors were withdrawn and it was not immediately known in what
Common Market countries Iran has maintained ambassadors.
   In Britain, for example, Tehran has been represented by a charge
d'affaires.
   Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that respect for
Islam and its values will remain an inviolable principle in
relations between Iran and other countries, IRNA said.
   The communique said that Khomeini's week-old order for Rushdie's
death for blaspheming Islam with his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was
a ``consensus judgement of all Moslem leaders throught the world,''
the agency reported.
   The dispatch, monitored in Nicosia, said the Foreign Ministry
deplored the refusal of the European community to condemn the book
and criticized the community's support for a work it said blasphemes
Islam.
   Britain announced Monday it would withdraw all its diplomats from
Tehran and request that Iran recall its representatives in London.
   Khomeini had refused to accept Rushdie's apology for offending
Moslems with the book, affirming his call for Moslems to kill the
naturalized Briton, who is reportedly in hiding under police guard.
   Britain stopped short of actually severing ties, while its
partners in the Common Market said they would recall their envoys
for consultations.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' portrays the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than
God _ wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The novel has been banned in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, India,
Egypt and South Africa. Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece
and Turkey have canceled plans to publish it and it has been pulled
from bookstore shelves in Japan. Many U.S. bookstores have also
removed the novel from display.
   The novel has also prompted Moslem protests around the world. In
Pakistan and India earlier this month, seven people were killed in
protests against it.

   As her 8-year-old son watched, a flaming
blowtorch was forced down a woman's throat by a woman and two
teen-agers apparently trying to collect a drug debt, police said.
   The 38-year-old victim was hospitalized in satisfactory condition
following the attack Saturday, officials said Monday.
   Rescue workers found the woman dazed and wandering, unable to
talk and pointing to her throat, said police Lt. Stephen McCartney.
   Police arrested Lamont Smith, 17, and Renee White, 20, on charges
of assault with intent to commit murder, McCartney said. A
16-year-old accused of taking part in the attack was arraigned as a
juvenile and ordered held.
   The victim's name was not released because she may have been
sexually assaulted by some of her assailants earlier in the week,
McCartney said.
   In that incident, some or all of the suspects confronted the
woman about the debt and held her son out a second-floor window by
his feet, McCartney said.
   ``We have some suspicion that it's drug related,'' McCartney said.
   The woman apparently told her attackers she would pay on Friday
but then failed to, he said.

   An experimental bone-marrow transplant that ended
in death five years ago for David, the ``boy in the plastic
bubble,'' is helping other children with the same immune system
disorder to survive without isolation.
   ``His life certainly had an impact on mankind. If only our lives
could have as much of an impact,'' said Dr. William Shearer, David's
primary physician at Texas Children's Hospital.
   David was born with severe combined immune deficiency syndrome,
or SCIDS, a disorder that left him without protection against
disease. At the time, children with the disorder died because there
was no treatment.
   Doctors placed David in a clear plastic bubble immediately after
birth and increasingly bigger bubbles as he grew to protect him from
germs while researchers worked on a treatment.
   David, whose family name was never released to the public, died
Feb. 22, 1984, of blood cancer contracted shortly after he underwent
a bone-marrow transplant designed to free him from the bubble.
   No other child lived like David and, because of the treatment,
there has not been another ``bubble boy.''
   Today, at Texas Children's Hospital, many children with SCIDS are
being treated successfully with the improved transplant treatment,
Shearer said. A handful of hospitals across the country also perform
the transplant.
   Gone are the strict sterile conditions that made David a prisoner
of his disorder. Children with the condition stay in the hospital
before and after transplant. Visitors need only wash their hands and
be healthy.
   SCIDS also is being identified earlier, thanks to pediatricians
who are more aware of the disorder. ``When they see children who
have unusual infections, they think maybe this child has a similar
problem (to David),'' Shearer said.
   About one out of 100,000 babies have SCIDS.
   The treatment involves taking about a quart of bone marrow from a
donor, either a sibling or a parent, and injecting it into a vein.
If the transplant is successful, cells known as lymphocytes in the
marrow form the core of a healthy immune system.
   Sixteen children have been treated at Texas Children's in the
past five years, including one boy who successfully underwent the
procedure while David was dying. Eleven are still alive.
   Three-month-old Ana Ruth Calderon was released from the hospital
three weeks ago after receiving a marrow transplant.
   ``She is fat and sassy, doing well,'' Shearer said.
   Shearer said neither he nor David's parents look back at whether
anything could have been done differently.
   ``They went for a chance at the time when the technology was
right,'' the doctor said, ``and for one reason or another, it worked
out in a very sad way.''

   A plane that crashed into a foggy
mountaintop, killing a Las Vegas church leader and eight family
members on a holiday trip to Disneyland, failed to clear the ridge
by less than 200 feet, authorities said.
   The wreckage of the chartered twin-engine Cessna 402 was found
Monday near the top of a 2,270-foot ridge overlooking Hagador Canyon
in the Santa Ana Mountains of Southern California.
   The plane crashed Sunday, scattering bodies and debris over a
100-yard area in the Cleveland National Forest 45 miles southeast of
Los Angeles.
   ``There were toys in the airplane, including two little stuffed
Mickey Mouses,'' said Mickey Worthington of the Riverside County
coroner's office.
   The dead were tentatively identified as Michael Cranson, 36, a
Las Vegas police officer; his wife, Raeann, 33; their five children
_ Shauna, 15; Stephanie, 14; Nicole, 12; Joshua, 11; and Kyle, 7 _
James Montano, 24, and Cynthia Montano, 23. The Montanos were
identified in Las Vegas as Raeann Cranson's sister and
brother-in-law.
   Also killed in the crash was the pilot, identified as Hassan
Berro, co-owner of Las Vegas Flyers charter line.
   ``They found Michael, and they found his police badge,'' said
Merrill Pugmire, who is bishop of the family's Mormon Church stake
in Las Vegas.
   The plane left McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on
Sunday morning and went down about 20 miles short of its
destination, Orange County John Wayne Airport. The plane vanished
from radar screens that afternoon.
   ``The bodies and baggage were ripped apart and scattered over the
peak,'' said KNX-AM reporter Bob Tur, who discovered the wreckage
during a helicopter flight. He said the fuselage was twisted, broken
into several pieces and partly buried.
   Cranson was president of a Mormon young men's group and had been
active in youth work and Scouting, he said.
   ``They were very excited, they had been planning this as a family
weekend get-together,'' said family friend Lora Dee Christensen, who
spent Monday morning at the Cranson home. ``They were very devoted
to their church and always very concerned about each other. They
were just a beautiful family.''
   The crash was under investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board, whose crew arrived at the crash site late Monday.

   The dollar was stronger in late morning European
trading today. Gold prices also were slightly higher.
   Foreign currency dealers said they did not expect much movement
before U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's scheduled
testimony before Congress later in the day.
   The dollar rose in Asian and early European dealings on
expectations Greenspan would emphasize the Fed's commitment to
fighting inflation, they said.
   But the run started to lose steam midmorning because of the
market's reluctance to take large positions ahead of what is
considers to be the key event of the week, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.40 yen to a closing 127.15. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 127.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8535 West German marks, up from 1.8435
   _1.5770 Swiss francs, up from 1.5683
   _6.3113 French francs, up from 6.2825
   _2.0920 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0820
   _1,358.25 Italian lire, up from 1,350.50
   _1.1895 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1897
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7560, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7665 late Monday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold at midmorning today of $382.75 a troy ounce, unchanged from the
opening bid but up slightly from late Monday's bid of $382.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.70, up from $382.20 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 33 cents to close at a bid
$384.34.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.93 a troy ounce,

   Preparing for talks with Israeli and PLO
officials, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met today
with Egyptian officials and insisted that chances for Arab-Israeli
peace are not a mirage.
   At the meeting in Cairo with Egyptian counterpart Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, Shevardnadze explained a proposal for convening an
international peace conference, a Foreign Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Shevardnadze's three-day Cairo visit is the busiest leg of a
Middle East tour designed to advance Soviet proposals for regional
peace. The tour has taken him to Syria and Jordan, and he will later
visit Iraq and Iran.
   On Monday, Shevardnadze met for three hours with President Hosni
Mubarak.
   He has scheduled separate meetings in Cairo on Wednesday with
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel and Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   In today's talks, Egypt and the Soviet Union ``agreed on the
importance of moving the Israeli position and convincing Israel of
the importance of peace, withdrawal from the occupied territories
and giving Palestinians self-determination,'' the Foreign Ministry
official said.
   At a dinner speech Monday night, Shevardnadze said, ``Here, where
the eye is deceived at times by the desert mirage, there must be no
room for political illusions.''
   ``The peaceful horizons of the Middle East are not imaginary, not
a mirage. Their concept is based on a conscious and realistic
realization of supreme responsibility for the destinies of peoples.''
   He said all parties to the conflict should abandon mutual
``doubts and suspicions and display a will and readiness to have a
civilized dialogue.''
   He spoke in Russian, but his speech was distributed in Arabic
translation.
   Abdel-Meguid also spoke of ``a rare historic opportunity'' to
forge a Middle East peace settlement.
   In Damascus, Shevardnadze unveiled a plan to convene a
U.N.-sponsored conference, with PLO participation, within nine
months.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ would
sit as a preparatory committee to arrange the conference.
   Israel opposes a conference under U.N. auspices. It also says it
will not meet the PLO, which it views as a terrorist group.
   Egypt and the Soviet Union ``stressed the importance of the
United Nations and the Security Council's role in preparing for the
international conference,'' the Egyptian official said of today's
talks.
   Arens, who met with Mubarak Monday night, told reporters
afterward that Israel still disagreed with Egypt on the role of the
PLO in peace talks.
   Arafat is expected in Cairo Wednesday afternoon at roughly the
time Arens is to leave for home.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will for the first
time visit the Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst the
nuclear disaster, during his current trip to the Ukraine, Radio
Moscow reported today.
   Gorbachev found out Monday in Kiev, the republic's capital, that
the dangers of nuclear power are still very much on the minds of
Ukrainians.
   In a street encounter broadcast by Soviet television, an elderly
woman asked Gorbachev why another nuclear power plant was being
built in the Crimea.
   The area contains some of the country's most popular beach
resorts and is home to 2 million people.
   Gorbachev said he was aware of worries about the plant's safety.
He also said American specialists who helped plan nuclear power
plants in earthquake-prone Japan had been asked to study the Crimean
facility.
   ``Construction is under way,'' Gorbachev said. ``But if the
conclusion (of the specialists) is that it is not advisable to build
a station there, then it will be turned into a training center for
personnel, not an atomic power station.''
   He assured the woman that the government now takes a cautious
approach to nuclear power.
   Radio Moscow said today that Gorbachev was preparing visits to
Chernobyl and Slavutich, a nearby town built to house plant workers.
   The broadcast did not say exactly when Gorbachev would be at
Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor on April
26, 1986 killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud
around the world.
   Gorbachev today arrived in Lvov, a center of railway engineering,
automobile assembly and oil refining. The city of 753,000 residents
is about 260 miles west of Kiev, where Gorbachev began his trip
Monday.
   Last month, 10 Soviet scientists wrote a letter to the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda calling for construction of the Crimean plant
to be stopped. They said it was not designed to withstand
earthquakes of the magnitude possible there.
   Since the Chernobyl accident, the Soviets have moved away from
complete faith in the safety of nuclear power, and public opposition
to it has grown.
   Nikolai Lukonin, the nuclear power minister, announced in
December that six projects to build nuclear plants or add more
reactors at existing stations had been scrapped because of
earthquake danger or tougher standards.
   The Soviet press is also increasingly reporting on the growing
health problems from Chernobyl. Last week, Moscow News said cancer
cases have doubled and calves are often born without heads and limbs
in a region 30 miles from Chernobyl where people were not evacuated
during the disaster.
   Also at Monday's street encounter in Kiev, Gorbachev said the
confusing electoral system he ushered into law in December already
needs reform.
   ``We will review the results of the campaign, carry out the
necessary corrrections,'' Gorbachev said. He was not specific.
   The new law creates a 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies,
a two-thirds of whose members will be elected by the public on March
26.
   One-third of the deputies, however, will be chosen by the
Communist Party, its affiliates, unions, social and political
organizations.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Tapes Dispute Paramedics In Boy's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for the mother of a boy who died
during an asthma attack says emergency dispatcher tapes prove
paramedics were not attacked before they refused to enter a housing
project to help the child.
   However, the speech pathologist who prepared a transcript of the
tapes found a key segment was unintelligible, and neither supported
nor contradicted the paramedics' contention that they were driven
away by a barrage of eggs and rocks.
   The 9-year-old boy's mother, Sharon Jarnagin, has said there was
no such attack on the ambulance on Dec. 12, when her son, Carl, was
stricken.
   Her attorney, David Kremin, contends that the tape recordings,
which were released publicly at a news conference Monday, refute the
Fire Department paramedics' version, which has been supported by
city officials.
   On the recording, neither paramedic says anything about being the
target of missiles, Kremin said.
   The Fire Department, which oversees emergency medical activities,
``is still vigorously defending the paramedics and their actions,''
spokesman Scott LaGreca said after the tapes and transcripts were
released.
   ``It was a sad, sad case but we feel our people were correct in
their actions and our policy is sound.''
   He declined to comment further, citing the $60 million lawsuit
filed by Mrs. Jarnagin against the department and the city.
   Harry Dubnick, an attorney for the city, said Kremin was wrong.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind. They did the proper thing,'' he
said of the paramedics.
   But Kremin said more than a dozen witnesses will swear that
nothing was thrown at the rescue workers.
   The recordings cover about 32 minutes of telephone and radio
conversations among the two paramedics, the ambulance dispatcher,
the Police Department and the boy's relatives, who made eight calls
to an emergency number Dec. 12.
   According to the transcript Northwestern University speech
pathologist Thomas D. Carrell prepared from recordings Kremin said
he had obtained from city authorities, Ms. Jarnagin initially called
at 4:14 p.m.
   She requested an ambulance at the Dearborn Homes housing project
on the South Side, saying her son was having a severe asthma attack
and losing consciousness.
   About five minutes later, an ambulance was dispatched, followed
by a police squad car, the tapes show.
   At 4:28 p.m., one of the paramedics radioed the dispatcher that
they were leaving the housing project.
   In Carrell's transcript, the exchange goes:
   Ambulance: Uh, we had a (unintelligible) we're leaving the scene.
   Dispatcher: I'll get the police in there.
   Ambulance: No, we're not hanging around. We're leaving the scene.
   There is no indication on the tapes that officers in the police
car saw any attack on the ambulance.
   At 4:30, Mrs. Jarnagin called again, sobbing.
   Mother: There was an ambulance here and they left! They didn't
even come upstairs.
   After getting the address, the dispatcher tells her: You know
why? People were beating up the paramedics, ma'am.
   Mother: Huh? What people? ... There was no one out there. My son
went out there.
   According to the tapes, the police officers entered the
fifth-floor apartment minutes later and radioed at 4:32 p.m. to
request an ambulance.
   The same ambulance was directed to return to the housing project,
the tapes show. The unconscious boy was picked up and taken to a
hospital, where he died.

   Sweden recalled its ambassador from Iran
for consultations today, a day after the European Economic Community
countries recalled their envoys to protest Iran's death threats
against against novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Iran's ambassador to Sweden Daniesh Yazdi was informed of the
decision when he was summoned to Sweden's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
   The Swedish envoy, Hakan Granqvist, arrived in Tehran only
recently and had not handed in his accreditation, the national news
agency TT said.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson told reporters after the meeting
that the planned visit by a Swedish trade delegation to Iran next
March will be canceled if Iran does not withdraw the threat against
Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton, for his ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems consider the novel blasphemous.

   A small earthquake rattled suburbs south of here,
but there were no reports of damages or injuries, authorities said.
   The quake at 10:48 p.m. Monday was centered about 20 miles
southwest of Seattle and registered 3.0 on the Richter scale,
according to the National Earthquake Information Center at Golden,
Colo.
   The qauke was felt in Federal Way, Renton, Enumclaw and Skyway,
the center said.
   State Patrol offices in Bellevue and Tacoma, however, said they
received no phone calls from residents living in the area.
   The last quake in the Puget Sound area occurred last Tuesday, and
was centered near Mount Vernon about 60 miles north of Seattle. It
measured 4.0 on the Richter scale and also caused no damage or
injuries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage.

<HEAD>Acapulco Man Arrested For Arranging Brother's Early Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wealthy Acapulco man has been arrested for
engineering the early release of his brother, convicted of the rape
and murder of a 6-year-old girl, officials announced.
   Roberto Braun Diaz, 22, was arrested during the weekend in the
Pacific Coast resort and held in its jail, the attorney general's
office said in its statement Monday.
   He was accused of unspecified criminal actions leading to the
early release of his brother, 34-year-old Alejandro Braun Diaz. The
brother's whereabouts are not known, but officials say they believe
he fled the country, possibly to the United States.
   The brothers come from a German-Mexican family that owns a cruise
business in Acapulco.
   Two magistrates, Gilberto Arrendondo Vega and Eufemio Zamudio
Aleman, were suspended in Guerrero state in December and face
charges of accepting a $200,000 bribe for releasing Alejandro Braun
Diaz.
   He served only two years of a 30-year sentence for the torture
and killing of Merle Yurdira Mondain. He confessed to keeping the
girl tied to his bed for two days while he drugged and raped her.
   He and his teen-age houseboy, who remains in jail, told the court
they later strangled the 6-year-old and dumped the body in a
junkyard. The houseboy testified that Alejandro Braun was addicted
to drugs and alcohol.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito will be laid to rest Friday in an
elaborate ceremony modeled on Shinto rituals chosen by few modern
Japanese when departing this world.
   Only 7 percent of all Japanese are mourned with the rituals of
Japan's ancient indigenous Shinto beliefs; 90 percent are remembered
with Buddhist ceremonies and another 3 percent with Christian
services, says Kiyoshi Yokoyama, an official of the All Japan
Funeral Directors Cooperative.
   Buddhism, brought to Japan from China about 1,300 years ago, has
been the predominant religion in Japan for centuries, coexisting
with Shinto folk beliefs. From 1600 to 1867, families were required
to be registered at Buddhist temples, and priests became responsible
for funeral rites.
   Even the imperial family, who are believed to be descended from
Shinto gods, long observed Buddhist memorial services until the
government established Shinto as a state religion in 1868.
   Traditionally, Japanese place the ashes of the deceased in stone
family tombs similar to those used in Western Christian cemeteries,
but attitudes toward the dead differ greatly from those in the West.
   According to Shinto and Buddhist beliefs, failure to provide
proper funeral rites will deny the dead their final rest. Spirits
that are not properly cared for will return to haunt the living, it
is believed.
   A death in a Japanese family is usually announced with a notice
in black and white on the door. A mortuary is summoned to prepare a
wake, which is usually held in a temple or in the home.
   A white reception tent is often erected and black-and-white
funeral wreaths on tall poles surround the home. A black suit and
tie, and for women, a black kimono or dress with white pearls is the
customary attire.
   Unlike Hirohito, whose body was sealed in a coffin after his
death Jan. 7, most Japanese are cremated before burial. The custom
of embalming does not exist in Japan, and cremation is believed to
purify the soul.
   Tokyo and most other cities require that bodies be cremated due
to a lack of space for gravesites. An urn containing the cremated
remains is placed in the family grave.
   The tradition of giving ``koden'' or incense money to a bereaved
family persists because funerals are costly, ranging from about
$1,600 for simple services held at home to about $60,000 for a
deluxe funeral in a temple.
   For seven weeks after death, the spirit is believed to hover
nearby. If proper rites are observed over the years, it eventually
goes to a Buddhist afterworld or joins the pantheon of ancestral
Shinto gods the Japanese believe influence the living.
   Reverence for the dead, or ancestor worship, is a way of life in
Japan that could perhaps be described as a way of keeping in touch
with departed family members.
   As in many Asian cultures, family members, especially eldest
sons, are expected to care for the souls of their dearly departed
with memorial services at specified intervals and with offerings of
food, incense and prayers at gravesites and at altars in their homes.
   Some traditional homes have two family altars: a kamidana or
``god-shelf'' for Shinto gods, and a butsudan or Buddhist altar
housing small tablets bearing the names of ancestors.
   Once a year in July or August, Japanese return to their home
villages, where most family graves are located, and invite the
spirits of their ancestors to spend the O-bon festival with them.
Graves are swept and sprinkled with water in a ritual of
purification.
   The festival is a time for family reunions and community dances
that originated as a way of entertaining and pleasing ancestral gods.

   Workers today pumped noxious gas from a derailed train in North
Dakota, while dozens of derailed cars from a train carrying
explosives cluttered a main street in a city east of San Francisco.
   Hundreds of evacuated residents in both communities were allowed
to return to their homes Monday night, authorities said.
   In Bordulac, N.D., residents had fled a white gas cloud released
after a train carrying anhydrous ammonia derailed Monday. Two
farmers who inhaled the gas were listed in stable condition today at
the Carrington Health Care Center.
   Twenty-six cars on the Soo Line train derailed, including two
cars loaded with the ammonia. The two cars, each with a capacity of
30,000 gallons, spewed their entire cargo into the air.
   ``It takes your breath from you, and if you ever was in one, you
would know what it was like,'' Carrington Fire Chief Pete Kautzman
said of the gas cloud.
   Authorities did not know the cause of the derailment.
   In Manteca, Calif., a train hauling explosives and hazardous
materials hit a broken section of rail, sending 48 cars off the
tracks. About 100-150 people evacuated were back home Monday night,
Fire Capt. John Tardiff said today.
   No one was injured when the 82-car train, en route from Houston
to Oakland, derailed just before 6 a.m. Monday, police said.
   Rail cranes were dispatched to help right the cars cluttering
South Main Street in the San Joaquin Valley city of 40,000 about 65
miles east of San Francisco. Police said it could take two days to
complete the cleanup.
   The line could be reopened later today, Southern Pacific
spokesman Jim Loveland said.

<TEXT>
   The government freed 50 more
detainees today after hunger strikes were halted at two prisons, but
scores of detainees continued to fast elsewhere and police said 20
were hospitalized.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament he had signed
release warrants for 50 detainees. He did not say how many took part
in hunger strikes to demand they be freed or brought to court.
   About 225 detainees still are refusing food at prisons in the
southern cities of Durban, Pietermaritzburg and East London, their
lawyers said.
   Police reported 20 hunger strikers in East London were
hospitalized Monday, four days after they and six fellow detainees
began fasting.
   Civil rights lawyers said about 200 detainees in Durban and
Pietermaritzburg have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks.
Vlok has agreed to meet lawyers for the detainees, but no date has
been set.
   The first wave of hunger strikes started Jan. 23 and involved
nearly 300 detainees held without charge in Port Elizabeth and at
Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg. Some detainees at those
prisons went three weeks without food then broke their fast after
Vlok promised to review their cases and release ``a substantial
number.''
   Eight detainees were freed Friday.
   Vlok has won widepsread praise, even from anti-government
leaders, for agreeing to meet with lawyers, parents and clergymen
representing the hunger strikers. He told Parliament he would
continue these discussions ``and I trust the entire hunger strike
will soon be something of the past.''
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, on Monday visited a Johannesburg hospital where
some Diepkloof hunger strikers are recovering. He said it was
possible the fast would resume if the detainees were dissatisfied
about the numbers released in the next two weeks.
   Many of the hunger strikers have been held more than two years.
   Under the 32-month-old national state of emergency, police can
arrest anyone they believe may be a danger to the public safety.
Vlok decides periodically, based on police reports, whether the
detainee should remain incarcerated. Detainees do not have to be
brought to court and charged, and they can be kept in custody for as
long as the government pleases.
   Monitoring groups say more than 30,000 people, mostly blacks,
have been detained during the state of emergency. Vlok has never
given a total figure, but he said two weeks ago that there were
fewer than 1,000 people in detention at that time.

<TEXT>
   About 2,500 exhausted survivors of the
1984 Bhopal gas disaster poured into the capital by train today to
protest a Supreme Court order settling their case.
   A spokesman said they made the 16-hour journey from Bhopal ``to
seek justice and relief'' for the world's worst industrial disaster,
which has killed at least 3,403 people by government count.
   More than 20,000 people are listed as seriously affected by the
leak of methyl isocyanate, and deaths attributed to it continue at
the rate of at least one a day. More than 500,000 damage claims have
been filed.
   The protesters from Bhopal today blocked the road to the Supreme
Court, demanding a reversal of the Feb. 14 order that instructed the
Union Carbide Corp. to pay $470 million as full and final settlement
of all claims arising from the leak.
   The government had sued for $3 billion from the Danbury,
Conn.-based company, whose Indian subisidiary owned the plant.
   Some of the demonstrators had not eaten since the train journey
began Monday afternoon. At least five protesters were admitted to
hospitals today suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion,
said V.C. Shukla, a member of Parliament from the opposition Jan
Morcha (National Front) Party.
   Many more in the crowd looked ready to collapse and talked
between gasps for breath. They complained they had no water to drink
since arriving in New Delhi.
   Placards depicted Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on his knees before
a devil throwing a coin. They proclaimed: ``Slave India salutes
Killer Carbide.''
   Riaz Ahmed Qureishi, who lost two children in the gas leak, said
the protesters did not accept the award and demanded the hanging of
former Union Carbide chariman Warren Anderson.
   ``Killers of one prime minister are hanged, but killers of
thousands of people escape with only a small payment,'' he said,
referring to the Jan. 6 hangings of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   The government is working on how to divide the award among those
who have claimed damages.
   Kaushalya Ahirwal, a leader of the women's wing of the Welfare
for Bhopal Gas Victims group, said she did not know the amount but
it was ``very little.''
   ``My husband is very ill, in hospital. My sister died and my
mother is blinded, but we have got no money,'' Mrs. Ahirwal said.
   ``We have been betrayed by the court,'' said Shukla, a former
chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located.
   He said the protesters will march to Parliament on Wednesday and
would ask the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
   ``We are outraged that the government should have agreed to the
order without consulting even the relief agencies,'' Shukla, the
opposition legislator, said. ``After losing four years, what was the
sudden hurry to settle for so little?''
   Parliament opened a 3-month-long session today, and President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman made no mention of the Union Carbide
settlement in his opening speech.

<TEXT>
   A man has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for
sexually assaulting his 8-year-old stepdaughter twice, including
once when his wife ordered the girl to ``relax and be quiet,''
authorities said.
   The 23-year-old man, whose identity was withheld to protect the
victim, told District Court Judge Harold Entz that he had sex with
the girl on five separate occasions, including one time when his
wife, also 23, pinned the girl's arms back while he raped her.
   The man from suburban Mesquite testified that his wife had
suggested having sex with the child to fulfill one of his fantasies,
and he was vulnerable to the suggestion while drunk or high.
   A Dallas County grand jury indicted the man on two charges of
aggravated sexual assault with a child under 14. Defense and
prosecution lawyers negotiated a plea bargain for the man to plead
guilty in exchange for 45 years in prison and a $750 fine.
   Charges are pending against the child's mother.
   An affidavit filed with an arrest warrant for the mother stated
that she had forced the girl to strip and then told her to ``relax
and be quiet'' during the sexual assault.
   Gerald Skor, a lawyer representing the mother, said his client is
innocent.
   ``She's a battered woman,'' Skor said.
   The judge said he would not accept a plea bargain for the mother
for less than 45 years in prison.

<HEAD>California Town Sets Up Computer Link Between Residents And Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting today Santa Monica residents
can fire off a complaint to City Hall, look for a job or check to
see if the latest best seller is at the library, all by tapping a
few computer keys.
   Touting itself as the city of the future, Santa Monica was to go
on line with a computer system that will allow residents with
personal computers a direct hook-up with City Hall.
   Officials say they will answer each computerized missive with a
reply sent to that person's own computer.
   But residents can use the system to do more than complain about
municipal problems. They can comb the computer network to find out
such things as where to get parking permits and dog licenses, what
events are scheduled at the pier and the Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium, which city agencies are hiring, and whether or not the
books they want to pick up at the local library have already been
checked out.
   Eventually, the system will be used to apply for licenses and
permits, said Assistant City Manager Lynne C. Barrette.
   The idea is the brainchild of community activist Michael Hill.
   ``This is a marvelous way to access the (city) staff reports,''
said Hill, who suggested the computer network two years ago. ``You
can play a truly effective role. People who feel disenfranchised can
find a way to be a part of government.''
   Not all reaction to the system has been positive, however.
   Some officials fear the computer system will give this seaside
community an an image as an elitist city catering to affluent
personal computer owners. They hope to overcome that by setting up
computer terminals at the library and other public centers to give
everyone access.
   Computer experts expressed concern that neither the public nor
bureaucrats may be ready for such an innovation.
   ``It may overburden ambivalent department heads and city
employees who want to be responsive but aren't getting additional
resources,'' said Judith Payne, a social scientist at Santa Monica's
Rand. Corp. think tank.
   The cost of setting up the system has been nil, however. The
$350,000 system, called Public Electronic Network, was a gift from
two computer companies. Hewlett Packard provided the hardware and
Metasystems Inc. donated the software programs.
   The system is designed to work with any model personal computer.
There is no charge to use the network, although frequent users will
see their phone bills increasing, officials said.

<HEAD>Condors Lay Egg At Los Angeles Zoo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After weeks of amorous but clumsy courting, a
female California condor laid an egg scientists hope will prove
fertile and produce a condor chick for the endangered species'
captive breeding program.
   The egg was noticed Monday after Los Angeles Zoo researchers
reviewed a videotape of activity in the condor's plywood nest box
and briefly saw it as the condors traded places from the nest to the
outside.
   The couple, a male condor named Cuyama and a female named
Cachuma, had piqued the interest of observers on Sunday when they
showed signs indicating an egg-laying was near.
   ``They were showing great interest in each other, nibbling each
other and following each other around to the nest box and scraping
around as though making a nest in the sand,'' said Mike Wallace,
curator of birds at the zoo and supervisor of its captive condor
breeding program.
   He said the egg was the first for the Los Angeles Zoo program. A
condor egg laid in captivity was hatched last year in the program at
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   Only 28 of the endangered California condors remain alive, 14 in
captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 more in San Diego.
Scientists hope the vultures, which are North America's largest land
birds with 9{-foot wingspans, will reproduce enough so that some can
be returned to the wild in five to 10 years.
   The breeding program has removed all known California condors
from the wild. Environmentalists have complained that other captive
breeding programs have met with only limited success.
   The egg will be removed from the nest and placed in incubation
sometime Wednesday, Wallace said. As part of the breeding program,
scientists hope to have the birds produce as many as three
fertilized eggs during the January to April mating season.
   ``If you remove the first egg as soon as it's laid, they will
recycle and go into another mating ritual, and within 30 days lay
another egg,'' he explained.
   Experts will know in seven to 10 days whether the egg placed in
the incubator is fertilized, Wallace said. If it is, the chick
should hatch in 55 to 66 days.
   Cuyama and Cachuma, both 6 years old and new to the courting
ritual, have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks,
with Cuyama waltzing around Cachuma with outstretched wings, Wallace
said.
   ``We had seen attempts on (Cuyama's) part to copulate, but they
were not good ones because it's his first time and he's learning
how,'' Wallace said.
   The other six condor couples at the zoo also have been in
courtship over the past week.

<HEAD>Judge Rules That Cheever's Widow Has Fulfilled Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Illinois judge ruled that the widow of writer
John Cheever has done her part to settle a contract dispute with an
independent publishing house over a collection of her husband's
stories.
   The order from Cook County Circuit Judge Roger J. Kiley Jr. says
Mary Cheever fulfilled her obligation to Academy Chicago Publishers
by providing it 15 uncollected stories of her choosing, The New York
Times reported today.
   The publisher had planned a volume of 68 stories but was stopped
from bringing it out last year when Mrs. Cheever sued, contending
the August 1987 contract was invalid because promises to her of
consultation and control over the book's content had not been kept.
   Last September, Kiley ruled that the contract was valid. He also
proposed a compromise under which Mrs. Cheever would submit 12 to 15
of the 68 stories. Last week, he ruled that the stories she
submitted fulfilled that obligation.
   Thomas Leavens, a lawyer for the publishers, said Academy Chicago
had not decided whether to appeal.
   Mrs. Cheever's lawyer, Martin Garbus, said she was now free to
edit her husband's stories in a collection of her own.
   Cheever, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1979,
died in 1983.

   In a sign of this snowless winter in
the Berkshires, Williams College officials trucked in 60 tons of
man-made snow from a ski area for photographs for a college
promotional brochure.
   ``We're not faking anything,'' Philip F. Smith, director of
admissions, said Monday as workers spread the white stuff from the
nearby Brodie Mountain Ski Area in front of a dormitory and the
geology building. ``We are just hoping to get some good winter
shots.''
   Student models were posed amid the man-made drifts for
photographs to be used in the college's prospectus. About 30,000
copies of the brochure are mailed to high school students each year.
   Matt Kelly, general manager of the ski slopes, said it's not the
first time the ski area has provided snow to the snowless.
   In January, he said, the ski area sent 80 tons of snow to Grafton
State Park in New York State for its annual winter carnival. And in
previous years, the ski area has provided man-made drifts for a
variety of films and commercials shot in the area, he said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Abdel-Magid Khalil has
resigned, charging the government's reluctance to negotiate an end
to Sudan's southern civil war has isolated the country, two
newspapers reported today.
   The independent newspaper Al-Ayam said Khalil quit after
returning from an unannounced visit to Jordan and Iraq, where he
apparently was refused new military and financial aid.
   Al-Adwa, another independent newspaper, said Khalil's letter of
resignation charged ``the foreign policy adopted by the government
does not lead to a unified internal front nor to stability, and has
also led to the isolation of the country both in the Arab and
outside world.''
   The newspapers quoted Information Minister Beshir Omar as saying
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi has accepted Khalil's resignation. He did
not name a successor. Al-Ayam speculated that Mahdi will assume the
defense portfolio he held from the time he was elected prime
minister in 1986 to June 1988, when he appointed Khalil.
   Mahdi canceled a trip to Japan to attend the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito because of the ``emergency circumstances,'' according to
Omar's statement. Vice President Idris Banna and the five-member
Supreme Council will represent him at the funeral, the statement
said.
   Khalil's letter said government policies ``have weakened the
country's ability to acquire military and economic assistance ...
   ``The government's rejection of the peace plan and its reluctance
to move in the direction of peace in the country has affected
Sudan's reputation in the outside world.''
   The United States this month urged an end to the almost
6-year-old civil war and said it would try to promote a peace
settlement. Washington has linked further U.S. aid to ending the
war, and other friendly Western and Arab donors say there is an
urgent need to end the fighting.
   John Garang, the U.S.-educated renegade colonel who leads the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, signed a peace plan Nov. 16 with
Mohammed Osman Mirghani, leader of Sudan's Democratic Unionist
Party. At the time, the Democratic Unionists belonged to the
governing coalition of Mahdi's Umma party and the National Islamic
Front of Moslem fundamentalist Hassan Turabi.
   Although his party endorsed the plan, Mahdi refused to let the
government act on it. In December, the Unionists left the coalition
because of the government's position on the peace plan and its
handling of the economy. Mahdi formed a new government in February
with the National Islamic Front as the junior partner.
   The front rejects a key rebel demand _ abolition of harsh Islamic
laws that are applied to all Sudanese regardless of religion.
   Sudan is divided into the minority Christians and animists of the
south, a black people, and the dominant Moslems of the north, who
are Arabic.
   The Sudanese economy is faltering under the $1 million a day
costs of the civil war, a $13-billion foreign debt and decreasing
foreign aid.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets on the
capital today on the ninth anniversary of an uprising against the
Soviet-backed government. The Foreign Ministry said the attack
killed one person and injured three.
   The bombardment was the first since Thursday, when a barrage of
rockets killed at least seven people, including four children. The
last Soviet troops left Afghanistan on Wednesday.
   The Foreign Ministry reported that one rocket today struck near a
government ministry for refugees in northern Kabul, killing one man
and injuring three other people.
   Three rockets hit southeastern Kabul, but there were no reports
of casulties.
   Earlier, the government displayed a huge cache of arms and
explosives devises and said the guerrillas had planned to use them
today to attack buildings and bazaars.
   The Foreign Ministry took foreign reporters to the headquarters
of KHAD, the government's secret police, where it had lined up the
wide array of weapons on several tables.
   Many had markings from the United States, Britain, Egypt, Sweden,
China and Italy. Officials said others were made in Pakistan, where
the most powerful guerrilla groups are based.
   According to Moammad Omar, a state security agent, the weapons
were seized Monday in a well in eastern Kabul.
   He said agents captured three guerrilla sympathizers who
confessed to planning to use the devices to attack government
buildings and markets around the city today and Wednesday.
   The guerrillas hold most of the countryside, while government
troops control major cities.
   The 1980 revolt occurred two months after Soviet troops
intervened to bolster a Marxist government in Kabul. Soviet soldiers
fired on Moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting
``God is Great!''
   Government officials say dozens of people were killed.
   Around the city today, business was brisk in some shops but light
in others. Some closed for the occasion.
   Authorities stepped up security around the city, sending more
soldiers to marketplaces.
   Omar said security agents received a tip that guerrillas and
sympathizers had stored weapons and explosive devices in a well. He
said they searched eight days before finding the arms.
   Among the weapons were 113 pounds of plastic explosives that
agents said came from Pakistan, Chinese-made hand grenades, British
mortar shells, Egyptian rockets, Italian fuses for mines, British
and Pakistani detonators, Swedish circuit testers, Chinese
Kalashnikov rifles, and British pistols.
   There were also political pamphlets.
   Officials also showed several fliers they said the guerrillas
distributed in Kabul last week suggesting that rockets attacks were
imminent.
   One, printed in English and the local language Dari, said: ``We
will contine our Jihad (holy war) until the withdrawal of the last
Soviet soldier.''
   The final Soviet troops, once estimated at more than 100,000 in
Afghanistan, withdrew Wednesday under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   President Najib has accused Pakistan of stepping up its supply of
weapons to the guerrillas, who have rejected offers of power-sharing
and vowed to overthrow the government.
   Over the weekend, Najib declared a state of emergency and shook
up his government to consolidate control.

   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright, a team of
philologists and a Soviet museum are among this year's recipients of
the Onassis awards, worth $100,000 each, it was announced today.
   American physicist Amory B. Lovins and British doctor Dame Cicely
Saunders also will receive awards, the Alexander S. Onassis Public
Benefit Foudation said.
   The prizes honor international contributions in scholarship,
human rights and the environment.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou will present the awards April 20 at a
ceremony in Athens.
   Fulbright, 84, of Arkansas, will receive the Athinai prize for
``his major contribution to education by establishing this century's
largest international study fellowship program of academic and
cultural exchanges,'' said the foundation's president, Professor
Yannis Georgakis.
   Leningrad's State Hermitage Museum, cited for its archaeological
excavations along the Black Sea coast, will receive the Olympia
prize for its contribution to culture.
   Dame Cicely, who in 1961 founded the London-based St.
Christopher's hospice for the terminally ill, will split the
Aristotelis prize for Man and Society with the Hellenic Spanish
Dictionary.
   ``We are honoring this dictionary for its important contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek,'' said Georgakis.
   The Onassis prize for Man and His Environment goes to Lovins, 41,
for ``his notable contribution to the protection of the natural
environment by working towards alternative solutions to contemporary
energy problems,'' Georgakis said.
   In 1982 Lovins established the Colorado Rocky Mountain Institute,
which explores links between energy, water, agriculture and economic
development.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of Greek
shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in honor of his son, who died
in a plane crash in 1973.

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Review Ruling On Iranian Assets Procedure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to referee a
dispute between the U.S. government and American businesses stemming
from the 1981 settlement of the Iran hostage crisis.
   The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recovering
money from Iran's government do not have to pay a portion of it to
the U.S. government.
   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iran
included release by the U.S. government of billions of dollars in
frozen Iranian assets. The settlement also set up a process
permitting those with claims against Iran to take them to an
international tribunal.
   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former President
Jimmy Carter to approve the settlement.
   That question was not at issue in the case acted on today, in
which Sperry Corp. and Sperry World Trade Inc. made a claim against
Iran.
   The companies leased computer systems to Iran during the 1970s,
before the hostage crisis severed relations between the United
States and Iran.
   After the hostages were freed in January 1981, the Sperry
corporations were awarded $2.8 million by the international tribunal
set up to handle claims against Iran.
   Congress in 1985 passed a law requiring those who win such claims
to pay to the federal government 1.5 percent of the first $5 million
recovered and 1 percent of amounts over that.
   The fee is to reimburse governmental expenses in helping resolve
the claims.
   The government said the Sperry corporations owed it $42,000.
   A federal appeals court here ruled last August that the fee is an
unconstitutional seizure of private property by the government.
   ``Whatever (the fee) was thought to be, it was a taking of
Sperry's money to help settle the national crisis, a burden the
government must bear on behalf of all of us,'' the appeals court
said.
   Justice Department lawyers, in seeking Supreme Court review, said
tens of millions of dollars are at stake. Some $12.7 million already
has been deducted by the government from awards to successful
claimants.
   The government's appeal said it is reasonable to require those
that win claims against Iran to defray the $4 million the U.S.
government spends each year to help operate the Iran claims process.
   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.

<HEAD>Court Lets Kentucky Abortion-Notification Law Take Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed Kentucky to
begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law requiring parental notification.
   The justices, without comment, turned down an emergency request
by ``pro-choice'' advocates seeking to block the law until a federal
appeals court rules on its constitutionality.
   At issue was the law's provisions for parental notification and
consent.
   As passed by the state Legislature, the law required that
unmarried girls under 18 seeking abortions first obtain the written
``informed consent'' of both parents.
   The law, challenged quickly by the American Civil Liberties
Union, never has taken effect.
   But U.S. District Judge Charles M. Allen in Louisville last Aug.
23 ruled that the law, with certain modifications, could be enforced.
   Allen previously had struck down the mandatory two-parent
requirement, a separate provision requiring that parental consent
forms be notarized and the imposition of criminal liability on any
doctor who does not get the consent of both parents if both are
available.
   Allen said those provisions impermissibly interfere with a girl's
constitutional right to have an abortion.
   But in his ruling last August, Allen said the state could require
that girls living with both parents get their informed consent or,
as an alternative, get permission from a judge before obtaining an
abortion.
   If the girl lives with only one parent or legal guardian, Allen
said, she only needs the consent of that person.
   Allen's ruling is being challenged before the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, but the appeals court refused to block enforcement
of the abortion regulations pending its review.
   In seeking emergency help, ACLU lawyers said Allen's decision
inappropriately rewrote the Kentucky law to make it pass
constitutional muster.
   They said numerous affidavits from doctors and other health
providers introduced as evidence in the Kentucky case have
``demonstrated the burdensomeness of the informed parent consent
requirement (and) the attendant increase in cost and medical risk to
the minor through delay.''
   The law's opponents say ``informed consent'' means that parents
likely would have to visit a hospital or abortion clinic before
approving of the procedure.
   The emergency request said the law would lead some young girls
``to delay or avoid seeking professional help and medical care''
when they believe they are pregnant.
   It said enforcement of the Kentucky law should be blocked because
two similar cases _ one from Ohio and one from Minnesota _ currently
are pending before the Supreme Court.
   The justices have not yet said whether they will grant review to
the Ohio and Minnesota controversies.
   In each of those cases, the disputed abortion laws are not in
effect.
   The case is Eubanks vs. Wilkinson, A-582.

<HEAD>Court Votes To Resolve Dispute Over Freedom Of Information Act</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today voted to resolve a
significant dispute over the Freedom of Information Act, while
agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants a secret.
   The justices said they will decide whether a government law
enforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor being
investigated for possible fraud certain documents received from
another agency.
   Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identity
of the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumably
to protect the contractor's reputation.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York City,
ruled last June 23 that the sought-after government documents must
be released to the contractor. But Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall on Jan. 30 blocked any such release until the high court
considered the government's appeal.
   The documents at issue are 1978 letters a government agency,
referred to in court papers as the John Doe Agency, exchanged with
the contractor, identified as John Doe Corp., about the contractor's
billing practices.
   Those letters became relevant in 1986 during a grand jury
investigation of possible fraudulent practices by the contractor,
and they were tranferred from the John Doe Agency to a federal law
enforcement agency, identified in court papers as John Doe
Government Agency.
   The contractor under investigation filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987
seeking ``all documents that are related in any way to the subject
matter of the (1978) correspondence.''
   A federal trial judge ruled against the contractor, saying
release of the documents would jeopardize the grand jury
investigation.
   But the 2nd Circuit court ruled that the FOIA requires surrender
of the documents.
   An exemption in the law for materials ``compiled for law
enforcement purposes'' does not apply in this case, the appeals
court said, because the letters were not originally obtained or
generated for law enforcement purposes.
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers argued
that the June ruling ``would seriously impair the ability of
numerous federal agencies to conduct their law enforcement
responsibilities'' and hinder ``an important law enforcement
investigation.''
   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts Los Angeles Taxi Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Los Angeles must pay damages to a taxi company that went out
of business after the city intervened in a dispute between the
company and its drivers.
   The court will review a ruling that barred Golden State Transit
Corp. from winning any money from the city.
   The Los Angeles City Council refused in 1981 to renew Golden
State's taxi franchise because the cab company was snarled in a
labor dispute with a Teamsters union local that represented its
drivers.
   Golden State, with 400 cabs, had been the city's largest taxi
operator until 1980. The Teamsters called a strike for the same day
the city was to consider renewing the franchises of 13 cab companies.
   Golden State went out of business after failing to win renewal of
its franchise.
   The Supreme Court in 1986 ruled that Los Angeles officials
improperly interfered in violation of the National Labor Relations
Act.
   The justices said then that local governments lack authority to
tip the balance in labor disputes by defining what economic
sanctions either side might suffer.
   But the high court ruling left it unclear what remedy was
available to Golden State.
   The case went back to the lower federal courts, and last
September the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied compensatory
damages to the defunct taxi company.
   The appeals court noted that a federal judge, following the
Supreme Court ruling in 1986, ordered Los Angeles to grant Golden
State a four-year franchise and pay the market value of the
company's assets less what it received in bankruptcy proceedings.
   The company said that was a hollow victory since it had
liquidated its assets when it went out of business.
   The 9th Circuit court said Golden State was not entitled to
compensatory damages under a federal civil rights law generally
invoked by individuals rather than businesses.
   The appeals court said the civil rights law does not provide
monetary damages in such cases for violations of the National Labor
Relations Act.
   The appeals court also rejected the taxi company's argument that
the federal courts have ``inherent power'' to award damages in such
cases.
   The case is Golden State Transit vs. Los Angeles, 88-840.

   The Supreme Court today threw out an emergency
request by anti-abortion activists who had sought to prevent a Long
Island, N.Y., man from having an abortion performed on his comatose
wife.
   The abortion was performed earlier this month after state courts
and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall rejected the request.
   In a highly unusual move, the anti-abortion activists persisted
in seeking Supreme Court action even after the case was made moot by
the abortion. They sought help from Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, who referred it to the full court.
   John Short and John Broderick of the Long Island Right-to-Life
group, had challenged rulings that appointed Martin Klein of Upper
Brookville as legal guardian of his wife, Nancy.
   That designation allowed him to order the abortion.
   Mrs. Klein, 32, fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in
a car accident Dec. 13. She was about 18 weeks pregnant when the
abortion was performed.
   Her husband had been told by doctors that Mrs. Klein would have a
better chance of survivla if the fetus she was carrying was aborted.
   The case is Short vs. Klein, A-641.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether people who do not own property may be excluded from
membership on a public body authorized to recommend a reorganization
of local government in the St. Louis area.
   The court said it will hear a challenge to the make-up of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The board of freeholders was created to write a proposed charter
for reorganizing the city and county government structure. The board
also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the city and
county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were ppointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the county
executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, suing for himself and all others in the city and county
who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the U.S.
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last September that the
federal constitutional protection does not apply because the
freeholder board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   ``The board of freeholders serves only to recommend a plan of
reorganization to the voters of St. Louis City and St. Louis
County,'' the state court said. ``It can recommend ... property
taxes and sales taxes, but it cannot levy and collect them. In sum,
the board of freeholders has no general governmental powers.''
   The state court said the St. Louis case is not covered by past
U.S. Supreme Court rulings that struck down property ownership as a
qualification for membership on a city school board or regional
airport commission.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

   The Supreme Court let stand rulings that the
public has no right to attend the so-called ``summary jury trials''
held in some legal disputes.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by newspapers
in three Ohio cities that trial judges should be barred from
conducting such proceedings in secret.
   The newspapers' lawyers had asked the high court to rule, for the
first time, that the Constitution provides a public right of access
to judicial proceedings in civil, or non-criminal, cases.
   The court in 1980 ruled that the public has a right to attend
criminal trials even when defendants object. The justices since have
expanded that ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial
proceedings in criminal cases.
   But the court never has ruled that such a right of access exists
as well for civil trials and proceedings.
   The appeal acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit by three Ohio
utilities against General Electric Co., over the design and
construction of the William H. Zimmer Nuclear Power Plant.
   The suit alleged that GE sold the utilties _ Dayton Power and
Light, Columbus and Southern Electric and Cincinnati Gas and
Electric Co. _ a nuclear reactor container system it knew was
incapable of ``operating in a safe manner.''
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel presided over a summary
jury trial in the case, in which lawyers for both sides presented
summaries of their evidence.
   The jury's verdict in such proceedings is advisory and
non-binding unless both sides agree otherwise. The verdict is
supposed to be a reliable indicator of a full trial's outcome _
sparking attempts to settle so a full trial will not be necessary.
   Since first introduced in 1980, summary jury trials have been
used in at least 65 federal courts in about half the states.
   In the GE case, the judge ruled that the summary trial would be
closed to the public and ordered the parties, lawyers and jurors
never to reveal anything that occurred during the proceeding. He
also permanently sealed the trial transcript.
   The Cincinnati Post, The Dayton Daily News and The Columbus
Dispatch challenged the closure, but the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled against them last Aug. 18.
   The appeals court said summary jury trials are more akin to
settlement conferences than real trials, and that the public
therefore has no right to attend or see the transcript.
   ``There is no historically recognized of right to summary jury
trials in that this mechanism has been in existence for less than a
decade,'' the appeals court said, adding, ``There is general
agreement that historically settlement techniques are closed
procedures.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the three newspapers
argued, ``Public confidence will be lost if judges may respond to
their expanding dockets by disposing of cases through secret
courtroom proceedings and permanent gag orders.''
   ``This court cannot expect that public confidence, so vital to an
effective judiciary, will thrive where judges conduct decisive
courtroom proceedings behind closed doors in permanent,
court-imposed secrecy,'' the appeal contended.
   But lawyers for GE discounted what they called the appeal's
``great flourishes of hyperbole,'' and urged the justices to reject
it.
   The case is Cincinnati Post vs. GE, 88-813.

   Leftist guerrillas bombed the
headquarters of an army brigade in the capital today, killing two
civilians and wounding three others, authorities said.
   Rebels also used rocket-propelled grenades and rifle fire in a
pre-dawn attack on a military engineers' base in Zacatecoluca, 35
miles southeast of the capital. Radio reports said the assault
killed three soldiers.
   The rebel attack on the 1st army brigade base, which killed an
elderly couple who live nearby, was the fifth since November on a
major military installation in San Salvador.
   As in the earlier attacks, guerrillas used pickup trucks fitted
with a catapult-like device to launch the bombs against the 1st
brigade. The detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs
and simultaneously blows up the vehicle.
   Two vehicles exploded today, killing Pedro Martinez, about 70
years old, and his wife Maria Teresa, about 65.
   Martinez's body lay on the sidewalk in front of his home an hour
after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded.
   Mrs. Martinez, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died on
the way to the hospital, said Col. Orlando Zepeda, who commands the
4,000-troop brigade. Three civilians were wounded by the explosions,
Zepeda said.
   The bombs launched by the vehicles did not fall inside the
grounds of the 1st brigade, he said. Journalists were denied entry
to the installation to verify the report.
   The explosions damaged about 10 homes, breaking windows, gouging
walls and blowing doors off hinges.
   In Zacatecoluca, Marxist-led guerrillas and soldiers battled for
three hours near the headquarters of the Detachment of Military
Engineers, radio reports said.
   Radio YSU reported from the scene that rebels hit an army truck
with a rocket-propelled grenade, killing two soldiers inside. The
radio said another soldier was killed in the fighting.
   There was no immediate word on army wounded or civilian or
guerrilla casualties.
   The attacks came as two guerrilla commanders and representatives
of El Salvador's political parties began a second day of meetings in
Mexico to discuss a rebel proposal to postpone the March 19
presidential election.
   The rebels say they are willing to end a decade-long election
boycott if the vote is postponed and security conditions guaranteed.
   The 9-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people,
most of them civilians.

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Virginia Case On Federal Copyright Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let states
and state agencies be sued for alleged violations of federal
copyright law.
   The court, without comment, turned away a Radford, Va., case that
highlighted a conflict between the Constitution's 11th Amendment
shielding states from federal lawsuits and copyright law requiring
all suits be filed in federal court.
   Photographer Richard Anderson sued Radford University, a
state-run school, and some school officials over the unauthorized
use in 1982 of copyright photographs.
   A federal trial judge dismissed the school and its officials as
defendants, ruling that the 11th Amendment protects them against
such suits.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal by a
2-1 vote last July 20.
   The appeals court noted a 1985 Supreme Court decision that
``Congress may abrogate the states' constitutionally secured
immunity from suit in federal court only making its intention
unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.''
   Congress did not do so in passing the Copyright Act of 1976, the
appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Anderson argued that
the 4th Circuit court misinterpreted the 1976 copyright law. They
said the law was intended to make states generally accountable for
copyright violations.
   ``Because the jurisdiction of the federal courts is exclusive (in
copyright cases) the effect of the 11th Amendment defense is not
simply to relegate the injured party to a suit in state court but to
deny any damage recovery at all against state infringers,'' the
appeal said.
   The Association of American Publishers, the Association of
American University Presses and the American Intellectual Property
Law Association sided with Anderson in ``friend of the court''
briefs.
   ``Whenever the 11th Amendment has previously been found to
preclude federal court jurisdiction some other forum has been
available,'' one of those briefs told the justices. ``For (Anderson)
and all others holding copyrights, however, no relief can be sought
in state courts.''
   The case is Anderson Photography vs. Radford University, 88-651.

   A U.S. Navy captain said
today he would have rescued Vietnamese boat people his ship found in
the South China Sea if he had been correctly informed of their
desperate plight.
   Capt. Alexander Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, accused critics of
unfairly judging him in hindsight.
   He has been before a Navy court-martial since Feb. 10 on charges
of failing to adequately assist the more than 80 Vietnamese refugees
his ship, the USS Dubuque, encountered June 9 as it sailed for the
Persian Gulf.
   Thirty-one of the refugees died and survivors resorted to
cannibalism before they were rescued by Filipino fishermen June 27
after 37 days at sea, United Nations officials said.
   Balian, his voice choking with emotion, said if he had known the
desperate conditions aboard the Vietnamese craft, ``there is no
doubt in my mind I would tow them to my side and embark them. That's
what I did on two previous occasions.''
   He said he ordered his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley
Halter, to determine if the refugee boat was seaworthy.
   ``Finally, the report came back `no engine,' and I surmised they
had a good sail,'' Balian said.
   He also said he was told ``they could make it on their own if we
gave them food and water,'' which were provided.
   Under cross-examination, Balian insisted he was not responsible
for the refugees resorting to cannibalism.
   ``I am being charged with giving insufficient assistance,'' he
said. ``What is sufficient assistance? You're saying I should have
embarked them. I should have embarked them _ on hindsight.''
   During the afternoon session, trial judge Capt. James Freyer
rejected a prosecution attempt to offer as evidence a fitness report
on Balian.
   Freyer said out of the jury's presence that the report was
``highly prejudicial'' and implied Balian was guilty.
   Balian was relieved of command of the Dubuque in August after the
Vietnamese reported the incident to U.N. officials in the
Philippines.
   He was acquitted Thursday of a charge of failing to assist a
Vietnamese who drowned.
   Balian today denied allegations that he ordered crew members not
to throw life rings to some of the Vietnamese who swam toward the
ship. He said he did order an interpreter to tell swimmers to move
away for fear they would be injured by the ship's propellers.
   He also denied previous testimony by a crew member, Chief Petty
Officer Luis Ilano, that he had advised the Vietnamese simply to
follow the sun to reach land.
   Balian said he ordered the interpreter to give the refugees a
navigational chart and mark their position.

<HEAD>Court, in Illinois Case, Backs FDA Rules on Animal Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed the Food and
Drug Administration to impose strict controls on the use of drugs by
veterinarians for ``experimental'' treatment of some animal diseases.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an Illinois
drug distributing company that the government wrongly is interfering
with the treatment of serious animal illnesses.
   The FDA seized a large quantity of drugs July 9, 1986, from
Schuyler Laboratories Inc. in Rushville, Ill.
   The drugs are in bulk form. Veterinarians mix them with other
drugs to create new medications to treat certain diseases for which
the FDA has not approved finished drugs.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the FDA
seizure last July, said the federal agency had ``looked the other
way for decades'' in declining to enforce rules against the
veterinarians.
   But the appeals court said the FDA reacted to the growing
practice of mixing experimental drugs by deciding to cut off
supplies.
   Schuyler Laboratories acts as a middleman, purchasing the
unblended drugs from the manufacturer and selling them to
veterinarians.
   Schuyler was accused of violating FDA regulations that require
drug labels to carry directions for their use. The bulk drugs do not
carry directions.
   The company said preventing veterinarians from mixing their own
drugs could have ``devastating consequences for the animals that
provide the basics of the American food supply.''
   Schuyler said there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat acute
inflammations, respiratory infections and other diseases that can
wipe out dairy herds and other cattle.
   But the federal agency defended its cautious approach to
licensing new drugs for treating animals. It can take years of
testing to determine, for example, whether new animal drugs can
cause cancer in humans who consume the animal products, federal
officials said.
   The 7th Circuit court, while noting that ``many veterinarians
find this state of affairs deplorable,'' said the FDA is acting
within its powers.
   ``No individual veterinarian will possess complete knowledge of
the efficacy of a novel drug compound _ let alone of its persistence
in the food chain,'' the appeals court said.
   Schuyler Laboratories failed to show that the FDA policy is
arbitrary or capricious, the appeals court said.
   The case is 9@1 KG Containers vs. U.S., 88-614.

   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart failed
today in his Supreme Court bid to kill a $90 million lawsuit by a
defrocked evangelist who Swaggart accused of adultery in 1986.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Marvin
Gorman's suit against Swaggart and others unconstitutionally
entangles Louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine and
discipline.
   Gorman was a pastor of the First Assembly of God Church in New
Orleans when Swaggart accused him of ``immoral dalliances'' with
several women.
   Gorman resigned from his ministry a day after a July 1986 meeting
of church leaders in which Swaggart aired his allegations and Gorman
admitted to one instance of immoral conduct.
   Swaggart and other Assembly of God officials did not consider
Gorman's resignation valid, however, and he was formally dismissed
only after the accusations were read to his congregation.
   In February 1988, Swaggart himself tearfully confessed to an
undisclosed sin. A New Orleans prostitute later said Swaggart paid
her to perform sex acts while he watched.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last April 8
after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at least a year.
   He returned to his ministry's Family Worship Center in Baton
Rouge, La., and resumed his television programs. But the fortunes of
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries have not recovered fully from the
1987 scandal.
   Last month, Penthouse magazine published an article in which a
New Orleans stripper told about performing sexual acts for Swaggart.
   Calling her story ``diabolical and slanderous fiction,'' Swaggart
has threatened to sue the magazine. He also said his television
ministry would end this month unless he received enough donations to
overcome ``pornographers'' who are trying to sabbotage his
broadcasts.
   Penthouse said the stripper, Catherine Mary Kampen, detailed the
alleged relationship with Swaggart in a deposition for lawyers
representing Gorman in his lawsuit against Swaggart and others.
   Gorman contends, among other things, that he was defamed and
libeled by Swaggart.
   Swaggart and the 13 other defendants sought to have Gorman's suit
dismissed, arguing that it violates religious freedoms for courts to
preside over disputes stemming from church discipline.
   ``The secular courts are without jurisdiction to hear his
claim,'' lawyers for Swaggart contended.
   The cases are Swaggart vs. Adler, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. Gorman,
88-1058.

   The Supreme Court today rejected a
constitutional attack against a Texas seat belt law, letting stand
the $35 fine a Houston lawyer was assessed in 1986 for not buckling
up.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal question,''
refused to hear Raymond D. Richards Jr.'s arguments that requiring
him to wear a seat belt while driving a motor vehicle violates his
fundamental right to be free from bodily restraints.
   Texas courts also rejected Richards' arguments, although along
the way one judge, Ben G. Levy, voted for him.
   Dissenting from an opinion of the Court of Appeals for the First
Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Levy wrote that allowing the
state to punish someone for not wearing a seat belt might lead to
punishment ``for smoking cigarettes, for not brushing one's teeth or
for being foolish.''
   In a recent interview, Richards said he had spent ``a lot of
time'' but not a significant amount of money in contesting his $35
fine.
   The case is Richards vs. Texas, 88-1097.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
the pandering conviction of a Hollywood movie producer who hired
actors to peform sex acts in a pornographic film.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a California Supreme
Court ruling that Harold Freeman's conviction on charges of
procuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedom
of expression.
   Freeman, president of the Hollywood Video Production Co., is in
the business of producing and marketing ``adult'' films. He produced
and directed a 1983 film called ``Caught From Behind, Part II.
   For the movie, Freeman hired actors and actresses who, as part of
their roles, engaged in various sex acts.
   Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Freeman with five counts
of pandering, based on his hiring five actresses who performed in
the movie. Freeman was not charged with any violation of the state's
obscenity laws, and the movie was not formally judged to be obscene.
   Freeman was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail amd five
years probation. He also was ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution
and a $100 fine.
   The state Supreme Court threw out Freeman's conviction last Aug.
25, ruling that California's pandering law should not have been
applied to him.
   Freeman was not procuring people for the purpose of prostitution,
the state court said, because ``there is no evidence (he) paid the
acting fees for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, his
own or the actors.''
   The state court added that even if what the film's participants
engaged in could be classified as prostitution, ``the application of
the pandering statute to the hiring of actors to perform in the
production of a non-obscene motion picture would impinge
unconstitutionally upon First Amendment values.''
   The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech
and expression.
   On Feb. 1, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor turned down an emergency
request by county prosecutors seeking to postpone the effect of the
state Supreme Court's ruling until their formal appeal was
considered.
   O'Connor predicted that the prosecutors' formal appeal would be
rejected because the state court ruling was based on an
interpretation of state law, and was thus ``binding upon this
court.''
   The cases are California vs. Freeman, 88-1054, and Applegate vs.
Freeman, 88-1050.

   The Supreme Court today let Minnesota state
troopers claim the costs of their workday meals as tax deductions.
   The justices, without comment, rejected government lawyers'

innumerable claims'' by the millions of Americans who eat meals

   Minnesota State Highway Patrol troopers Karl W. Christey and
Steven L. Pillsbury claimed such deductions for the tax years 1981
and 1982.
   The Internal Revenue Service denied the claims, but in a
subsequent lawsuit seeking tax refunds a federal trial judge and the
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the troopers.
   Christey had deducted $962.66 and $880.28, respectively, for his
meals while on duty. Pillsbury claimed $944 and $968, respectively,
for the same years. Both men made their claims under that part of
the Internal Revenue Code allowing deductions for ``ordinary and
necessary business expenses.''
   The Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that New Jersey state troopers
could not claim the costs of their on-duty meals as tax deductions,
but that case was decided on another portion of the tax code.
   Minnesota troopers are required to eat their meals in a public
restaurant adjacent to a highway whenever practical.
   They must report by radio before beginning their meals, and make
sure they supply the telephone number or code number of the
restaurant where they are eating.
   No more than two troopers may eat together, and they must eat at
certain times. They may not bring meals from home.
   In its ruling last March 2, the 8th Circuit court acknowledged
that the costs of someone's meals most often is a personal expense
and not tax-deductible.
   But the appeals court agreed with U.S. District Judge Paul
Magnuson that ``the number of duty-related restrictions and
requirements concerning their meals effectively extended the
performance of the troopers' duties from patrol cars on highways to
tables in restaurants.''
   The appeals court added, ``This is not a case in which the
taxpayers are attempting to deduct the cost of their meals merely
because they are working overtime, or working through their meal
break, or where business activities make meals at home
inconvenient.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, Justice Department lawyers said
the appeals court was wrong, and that meal costs are personal _ not
business _ expenses.
   ``The troopers expended these funds because they were hungry, not
because the Highway Patrol required it,'' the government appeal
said. ``The meals were a personal benefit to them just like the
meals that other types of workers consume during the workday.''
   The appeal contended that the lower court rulings ``invited
innumerable claims for their deduction, depending upon the outcome
of an undefined inquiry into the almost infinite variety of
circumstances of each person's employment.''
   Government lawyers said the appeals court ruling ``encourages
substantial factbound litigation, which will have major deleterious
effects on tax administration.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Christey, 88-1023.

   About 7,000 people returned to their
homes today after they had been evacuated because of a stinking gas
from a refinery's leaking crude oil tank, police said.
   The evacuation order was lifted at 5:30 a.m., police officer Al
Gillen said. ``All the roads are reopened. Everything is back to
normal as it was before the leak.''
   The gas, which escaped Monday from a leaking tank at a Chevron
refinery, contained hydrogen sulfide, a flammable, poisonous
chemical that smells like rotten eggs.
   The leak, first discovered in the afternoon, was not considered a
serious health threat, but at least 24 people were examined at local
hospitals, officials said. No serious injuries were reported.
   An estimated 5,000 to 7,000 people were asked to leave their
homes in this coastal city near the Louisiana border, and about
3,000 stayed in emergency shelters overnight, said police Sgt. Mark
Blanton. The rest found lodging on their own.
   Police barricaded a 17-by-14-block area in the western portion of
the heavily industrial city.
   ``We've had some real bad fires at these plants where people were
injured and killed, but even then we never had an evacuation of this
magnitude and I've been here 28 years,'' said police Sgt. Cedric
Clayton.
   ``We decided to evacuate the entire area simply as a safety
precaution,'' he added. ``There are a lot of elderly people who live
in that particular area and there are two or three (public) housting
complexes.''
   Chevron officials said they had been monitoring air quality in
the area of the leak since early Monday afternoon, and described the
gaseous release as carrying a miminum risk but a terrible odor.
   ``Most crude oils in Texas have sulphur in them,and that means
their gas contains hydrogen sulfide, which is listed as one of the
hazardous chemicals,'' said Chevron spokesman Art Spencer.
   ``We're doing continuous monitoring and we're finding that
there's nothing there that is hazardous to health and we're also
finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening,''
Spencer said. ``But the odor got so strong that the city emergency
response unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of
it.''
   St. Mary Hospital spokeswoman Jody Roberts said doctors treated
20 people , many of whom complained of headaches, watery eyes or
breathing difficulties. Four patients also were treated at Doctors
Hospital.
   A Chevron employee discovered the leak around 1:30 p.m. Monday
and reported it around the same time that the first calls began
arriving at police headquarters, officials said.
   Spencer said the leaking tank has a capacity of about 300,000
gallons, but its exact content was not known because it was
connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit.
   Crews were using vacuum trucks this morning to remove the spilled
crude from a ditch surrounding the tank. Spencer estimated the task
could take two or three days to complete.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal By Mining Companies On Hazardous Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
mining companies seeking an exemption from federal environmental
rules for certain hazardous wastes.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
Environmental Protection Agency must regulate the wastes.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that a 1980
federal law exempting some ``high volume, low hazard'' mining wastes
from environmental rules does not apply to six types of waste
produced from smelting.
   The appeals court said the exemption does not apply to six types
of dust, sludge and other waste from the smelting of copper, lead,
zinc, aluminum, ferrochromium and ferrochromium-silicon.
   In a victory for environmental groups, the appeals court
overturned an EPA decision and ordered the agency to apply
hazardous-waste rules to the six types of smelter waste.
   The American Mining Congress, the Aluminum Association and
Kennecott said the 1980 law was intended to apply to ``all mining
industry processing wastes.''
   The case is American Mining Congress vs. Environmental Defense
Fund, 88-848.

   Searchers battling treacherous swamps
today could not find survivors or bodies near the wreckage of an Air
Force cargo plane that crashed with eight people on board, officials
said.
   The C-141B Starlifter crashed three miles north of this base
Monday night while coming in for a landing, Air Force officials
said. The plane was from Norton Air Force Base in Southern
California.
   The fate of the eight people on the aircraft _ seven crew members
and a retired military passenger who boarded the plane during a
refueling stop in Colorado Springs, Colo. _ remained unknown,
officials said.
   ``I understand it's about five feet of water, underbrush and a
swamp area, just difficult getting through on land,'' said Technical
Sgt. David Torrence, adding search crews still had found no sign of
the fliers by mid-morning.
   ``It's just too early to make any kind of a guess'' on the
chances of finding anyone alive, said Capt. Thom Connell, a base
spokesman.
   The wreckage did not appear to be spread out and the C-141B's
large, distinctive T-shaped tail was intact, said Capt. Dale Stovall
of the 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt, who was in charge of
the search.
   Small fires still burned hours after the crash.
   Controllers at adjacent Eglin Air Force Base lost radio and radar
contact with the plane around 8 p.m. CST Monday as it was on final
approach to this base 40 miles east of Pensacola, officials said.
   The first rescuers did not reach the area of the crash until
12:30 a.m. The search was suspended about four hours later, and was
to resume at daylight.
   The searchers, who had to climb down ropes from hovering
helicopters, found ``just terrible terrain, terrible conditions,''
said Connell. ``It's stumps and rocks and fallen trees.''
   He said bulldozers would attempt to plow a path to the crash site
today.
   ``We are having difficulty reaching the site,'' said Stovall.
``The water in the area is five feet deep.''
   At the time of the crash, Army Rangers heard an explosion, but
Stovall said the sound may have been that of the plane hitting the
ground. The aircraft was not carrying munitions, he said.
   There were thunderstorms in the area, Stovall said, but he
declined to say if weather figured in the crash. An Air Force safety
team is investigating the accident.
   The first rescuers arrived in an Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.
   ``They've found one of the engines in a creek,'' said Lynn
Jurkovic, a dispatcher at the nearby Fort Walton Beach Fire
Department, which sent three rescue units to the scene.
   The aircraft was on a regularly scheduled flight to pick up
personnel and cargo bound for Howard Air Force Base in Panama,
Stovall said.
   The C-141B, capable of carrying up to 200 people, belonged to the
63rd Military Airlift Wing at Norton, about 60 miles east of Los
Angeles, said base spokesman Capt. Gary A. Jacobs. The four-engine
plane is 168 feet long and has a wingspan of 160 feet.
   Hurlburt is headquarters for Air Force Special Operations, which
trains for small-unit actions behind enemy lines using specially
modified helicopters and cargo planes that fly low to avoid radar
detection.
   Eglin is home of the Air Force Armament Divsion, which is
responsbile for developing and testing non-nuclear weapons, and a
wing of F-15 Eagle fighters.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Hear Appeal Of Former Carolina Klan Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of a former Ku Klux Klan leader in North Carolina convicted
of criminal contempt for his role in a paramilitary organization.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that former Klan
leader Glenn F. Miller was denied a fair trial.
   Miller was sentenced to six months in prison and placed on
probation for three years for criminal contempt.
   He also was sentenced to five years in prison in a subsequent
case in which he pleaded guilty to illegally possessing hand
grenades and issuing a ``declaration of war'' againsts blacks, Jews
and homosexuals.
   Miller, who testified for the government in prosecutions against
other white supremacists, was placed in the federal witness
protection program and given a new identity.
   The case acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit filed by Bobby
L. Person accusing Miller and the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan with violently intimidating blacks to prevent them from
exercising their rights.
   A court consent decree that settled the suit in 1985 barred
Miller and the Klan from operating a paramilitary organization or
engaging in military exercises or training ``in furtherance of a
civil disorder.''
   About a year later, Miller was accused of criminal contempt for
violating the consent decree. The Klan organization, meanwhile, had
changed its name to the White Patriot Party.
   Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which represented
Person, filed the criminal contempt complaint and, in an unusual
development, acted as prosecutor in the contempt proceeding for
about two months.
   In June 1986, the U.S. attorney's office in North Carolina was
placed in charge of the case. Dees was allowed to continue as an
assistant to the U.S. attorney's office in prosecuting the complaint.
   Miller was convicted of criminal contempt after a jury heard
testimony that his ultimate goal was the armed overthrow of the
government.
   Miller said his rights were violated for a number of reasons. He
argued that Dees continued to be in charge of the prosecution after
June 1986 and was biased against him.
   Miller also said all blacks should have been barred as
prospective jurors because they stood to benefit from the court
order Miller was charged with violating.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction last
August.
   The appeals court said there was adequate evidence that the U.S.
attorney's office, and not Dees, was in control of the case.
   The appeals court also said Miller failed to show that no black
could serve as an impartial juror in a case involving a white
supremacist.
   The case is Miller vs. Person, 88-792.

   A man was arrested for vandalizing a
centuries-old cemetery containing the grave of Benjamin Franklin,
authorities said today.
   George Guido, 36, of Philadelphia, was accused of knocking over
six grave markers Monday night and smashing an ornament on a wall
next to Franklin's grave, which was undamaged in the attack.
   Officials initially had thought the man vandalized Franklin's
grave, but later learned that a crack and chips off the corners of
the tombstone were the products of age rather than vandalism, said
the Rev. David Laquintano of Christ Church.
   Franklin's tombstone was undamaged, Laquintano said, and concrete
chips found nearby were from a smashed ornament from the wall next
to the grave.
   Guido was charged with institutional vandalism, criminal
mischief, desecration of venerated objects and criminal trespass. He
was held pending arraignment.
   The colonial statesman, inventor, publisher and scientist was
buried at the cemetery of Christ Church April 21, 1790, four days
after his death at age 84. Franklin was the oldest delegate at the
Constitutional Convention, which drafted the U.S. Constitution in
1787 at Philadelphia's Independence Hall.

   Playwright Vaclav Havel today was
convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a
rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion.
   Havel, Czecholovakia's best-known dissident, was charged with
inciting people to participate in the banned Jan. 16 rally and for
obstructing the duty of a public official.
   On the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term
of two years, on the second to another six months in prison. Havel
was found guilty of both offenses in a one-day trial.
   The prosecution of Havel and other opposition activists has gone
on despite widespread criticism at home, in the East bloc and the
West that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with
dissent. Seven other activists from the Charter 77 human rights
committee and other independent movements also went on trial today.
   Authorities banned a number of Western diplomats and
representatives from human rights organizations from the trials.
   Havel, 52, who helped found the Charter 77 movement, has been
harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his
1975 open letter to Communist Party leader Gustav Husak accused
authorities of creating ``a bureaucratic order of grey monotony that
stifles all individuality.''
   Havel was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in
jail in 1979. Authorities have banned his plays, which are widely
acclaimed in productions abroad.
   Earlier today, more than 100 Havel sympathizers had jammed a
small stairwell leading to the courtroom, loudly cheering him police
led him to the trial.
   Havel's brother, Ivan, said Havel did not take part in a Jan. 16
flower-laying ceremony in a downtown Prague square, but was detained
on the square an hour later.
   The seven other defendants _ all activists with Charter 77 and
other independent groups _ face hooliganism charges in connection
with the Jan. 16 gathering. The charges carry a maximum two-year
jail sentence.
   The seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of
Jan Palach, the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier
to protest the Soviet-led invasion that quashed communist reforms in
Czechoslovakia.
   The arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest
in Prague since Palach's death.
   Ota Veverka, one of the seven Charter 77 human rights group
activists being tried, said what happened on Wenceslas Square ``was
not a criminal act but an assault by police.''
   Most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to
lay flowers in Palach's memory and no demonstration was planned.
   More than 2,000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for
the government to release the dissidents.
   It was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment
intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public.
   The trials also have drawn an official protest from the Hungarian
Writers' Union, as well as criticism from the United States, Britain
and other Western governments and groups.
   Last month, NATO, Warsaw Pact, and 12 other European nations
agreed on new human rights accords in Vienna.
   Britain and the United States have charged that the trials
violate the spirit of those accords. Nine independent groups in
Czechoslovakia have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new
accords to protest the trials.
   Those on trial are Charter 77 activists Sasha Vondra and Jana
Sternova and independent activists Veverka, Nemec, Jana Petrova,
Stanislav Penc and Petr Placak.
   Dana Nemcova, another Charter 77 activist, has been hospitalized
with an undisclosed ailment and will stand trial separately later,
the official CTK news agency reported.

   Camouflaged combat fatigues replaced pastel
nursing uniforms at the state-run General Hospital, where the Rhode
Island National Guard was called in to replace striking workers for
the second time this year.
   ``The Guard is prepared to stay there as long as necessary,''
said Patrick Kirby, chief of staff for Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, after
nurses and attendants at the 480-bed hospital walked out in a
contract dispute Monday.
   Seven of the 110 Guard troops sent to the hospital had nursing
training; the rest were given non-medical tasks such as feeding,
washing and dressing patients.
   ``I think it's a very dangerous situation for patients, in fact I
think it's life-threatening,'' said Thomas Romeo, director of the
state Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals. ``Not
all the individuals up there right now know exactly what they're
doing. There's not a lot of tolerance for error.''
   Citing the possible harm and the illegality of strikes by state
employees, the state sought a court order to force the employees to
return to the hospital, which mostly handles long-term patients.
   Superior Court Judge Antonio S. Almeida said he would issue a
ruling today after listening to lawyers from both sides present
their arguments.
   Joe Fargnoli, president of Local 1350 of the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the main issue in the
contract dispute is not money but the hospital's refusal to fill
vacant jobs.
   ``We only want the state to honor its contract with us and pull
together with the employees to restore normality and security here
at the hospital,'' he said.
   Patient Louise Baran, herself a registered nurse, said she felt
comfortable about the care she was receiving. Although she didn't
fault either side in the dispute, she said she was disappointed it
had reached the point of a walkout.
   However, 56-year-old Connie Prior, a quadriplegic who has been at
the hospital for two years, was incensed by the walkout.
   ``I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Ms. Prior said.
``Number one should be the patients.''
   More than a dozen acute-care patients have been transferred to
other hospitals since the walkout began, and the facility has
stopped admissions, officials said.
   Doctors reported to work as usual Monday, but about one-fifth of
the 89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practical
nurses showed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the
26 registered nurses honored the picket line, said Dan Caley, a
spokesman for the state health agency.
   DiPrete called out the National Guard late Sunday after the union
voted 4-1 to reject a proposed 53-cent-an-hour raise offered in
return for concessions on staffing.
   A previous four-day sickout ended Jan. 31 when the Guard was
called in.
   Under the hospital's latest offer, starting salaries for
attendants would go from $16,600 to $17,600, and for nurses would
increase from $18,800 to $20,000, he said.
   Contract negotiations broke off Friday, and no new talks were
scheduled.
   The hospital appealed for volunteers to augument the National
Guard. Dan McCarthy, coordinator of hospital volunteers, said the
facility was seeking about 30 general helpers and 16 nurses. Only
about two dozen people volunteered Monday, said a volunteer
coordinator who would not give her name.
   One striker, a therapist who would not give her name, said she
felt no qualms about the walkout. ``I think it's for a good cause,''
she said. ``We have a medical emergency staff (on call) in case
anything should happen. It's not like we're totally abandoning
them.''

   Twenty-five children were rescued from a school bus trapped in
raging floodwaters as more rain returned today to parts of Kentucky
and Tennessee not yet recovered from last week's downpours.
   The Ohio River spilled over its banks from Louisville, Ky., to
Cairo, Ill., and was expected to continue rising all week, the
National Weather Service said. The high water and stiff current shut
down a ferry and hindered barge loading.
   Smaller rivers were also on the rise from Kentucky to Louisiana
after a weekend respite from storms that had dumped up to 11 inches
of rain over the area last week.
   The weather service issued a flash flood watch for all of
Tennessee, for eastern and southeastern Kentucky and West Virginia
and parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia and Ohio.
   Flooding closed roads and damaged homes in Florence, Ala., early
today, and roads were reported under water in central Tennessee
after more than 2{ inches of rain fell Monday evening.
   In western Kentucky, a 19-year-old woman died Monday when she
lost control of her car on a wet highway and hit a truck.
   In the central part of the state, which received up to 3 inches
of rain in 24 hours, searchers on Monday discovered the body of one
of two men missing since their van got stuck in high water in Hardin
County last Thursday. The search for the other man resumed this
morning.
   About 50 miles west, in Stanley, Ky., a school bus tilted on its
side in flood waters up to its midsection. The children and driver
were inside the bus for at least 30 minutes before they were rescued
and loaded into two small boats, according to firefighter Rick
Fulkerson of the Stanley Volunteer Fire Department.
   None of the children was injured. Richard Coy, a Daviess County
sheriff's deputy who discovered the bus, said there were some tense
moments before the boats arrived because the bus was slowly sinking
in the ditch.
   ``The boat ride was fun, but getting stuck wasn't fun,'' said
fifth-grader Marshall Coleman. ``It was kind of scary. A whole bunch
of people were crying.''
   The Ohio River ferry between Cave In Rock, Ill., and Marion, Ky.,
shut down Monday and its operator, Bill Patton, predicted it would
be out for at least a week.
   The river covered the road on the Kentucky side, Patton said.
``It's swift and full of trees and logs and everything else.''
   Northbound river traffic was having a hard time fighting the
current, Patton said. While 10 mph is the average speed going
upriver, towboats were fighting to reach speeds of 2 mph.
   The Ohio's high level has interfered with operations at the
Owensboro Riverport Authority. Grain can't be loaded onto barges
again until water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a
fixed loading spout, said port director Janet Douglas.
   Of Kentucky's major rivers, those in the western half of the
state posed the greatest problems with the new rainfall because of
backwater flooding from the Ohio, the weather service said.
   The Rolling Fork and Green rivers, in central and southwestern
Kentucky, respectively, were above flood stage today.
   At West Point, Ky., which lies just south of the Ohio, Mayor Gene
Smith said water had receded a few inches Monday, but 42 houses that
had to be evacuated the day before remained flooded.
   The flood knocked out pumps at a waste treatment plant, causing
raw sewage to be discharged into the river, Smith said. But he said
the worst appeared to be over.
   ``Based on our old-timers, and based on the forecast, we're not
anticipating any additional flooding,'' he said.
   Despite the new rain, Tennessee officials said only a few
families in the Portland area, northeast of Nashville, had to be
evacuated due to flooding.
   ``At 1 o'clock this morning things looked really dim,'' said
Cecil Whaley, an operations officer for the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency. ``We had that front with all that rain coming in
from Arkansas that was supposed to hit us but it turned off and
headed toward northern Mississippi and Alabama instead.''
   In Obion County in northwestern Tennessee, about 130 people
remained away from their homes after being flooded out last week.
   Tennessee officials also found at least one bright spot. The town
of Lebanon, which was hard hit by last week's floods, appeared to be
escaping the newest round of flooding.
   ``I don't understand these things,'' said said Bob Cayler,
operations officer with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency,
``I just report them.''
   In Alabama, officials said parts of Lauderdale, Morgan, Colbert,
Lawrence and Limestone counties experienced minor flash flooding as
a wave of heavy thunderstorms passed over the area.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that states may
use anti-racketeering laws to fight pornography, but invoked
free-speech rights to ban the states from seizing before trial the
contents of adult bookstores.
   The justices threw out an obscenity conviction against a Fort
Wayne, Ind., bookstore because authorities seized its contents
before trial. But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors still
may use the state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenity
case.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the
Constitution's free-speech protections do not bar states from using
alleged acts of obscenity as a basis for an anti-racketeering law.
   ``Given that the (anti-racketeering) statute totally encompasses
the obscenity law, if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague,
the former cannot be vague either,'' White said.
   In other matters acted on today the court:
   _ Allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law that
includes provisions for parental notification.
   _ Refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a Hollywood
producer for hiring actors to peform sex acts in a film. The
California Supreme Court had thrown out the conviction as violating
the producer's freedom of expression.
   _ Rejected a constitutional attack on a Texas seat belt law,
letting stand a $35 fine against a Houston lawyer for not buckling
up.
   _ The court declined to kill a $90 million suit against
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart by a defrocked evangelist who Swaggart had
accused of adultery.
   _ Let stand rulings that the public has no right to attend
so-called ``summary jury trials'' held in some legal disputes. Three
Ohio newspapers had sought to force such proceedings to be held in
open court.
   _ Agreed to referee a dispute between the U.S. government and
American businesses over whether firms receiving money because of
claims against Iran must pay part of the money to the U. S.
government.
   Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is
patterned after the much-used federal act that bears the same
acronym, RICO.
   States are using such laws with increasing frequency as a
powerful new wepaon to fight obscenity and organized crime.
   White said the Indiana law went too far in permitting prosecutors
to padlock adult bookstores before obscenity trials.
   While the Constitution generally permits seizure of suspected
contraband material, White said, ``It is otherwise when materials
presumptively protected by the First Amendment are involved.''
   ``Probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for
seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively
protected books and films,'' he said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justices John Paul Stevens, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall said the obscenity charges against
Fort Wayne Books Inc. should be thrown out.
   Stevens, writing for all three, said Indiana's law violates the
Constitution by permitting the seizure of a bookstore's contents
after an obscenity conviction.
   Stevens noted that the law allows the seizure based on a judgment
that two items sold by the store were obscene.
   The law allows prosecutors ``to cast wide nets and seize ... the
obscene, those non-obscene yet sexually explicit (items), even those
devoid of sexual reference,'' Stevens said.
   The law was used in March 1984 against three Fort Wayne
bookstores selling sexually explict material. Law enforcement
officials padlocked the stores and seized all inventory.
   The three Fort Wayne stores were allowed to reopen in April 1985.
But only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business.
   The Supreme Court today also upheld rulings that permit the
Howard County, Ind., sheriff's office to charge Ronald Sappenfield
with distributing obscene material and violating the state RICO law.
That case has yet to go trial.
   The cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470, and
Sappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.

   A teen-ager who last week said she found a
newborn baby on her family's back porch has admitted she is the
infant's mother and says she concocted the story because she was
afraid.
   Tiffany Anderson, 16, told police she gave birth to the 7-pound
girl in the family's bathtub Thursday evening. She told her family
she found the baby wrapped in a towel and left in a box on a pile of
garbage bags on the doorstep when she went out to quiet a cat.
   ``I didn't mean to lie, but I got really scared and didn't know
what to do or who to tell,'' Anderson said in a statement filed in
City Court. ``I am very sorry for all the problems that I have
caused. I was just scared about this.''
   Anderson apparently hid her pregnancy by wearing baggy clothes
and saying she was gaining weight. She said pressure from her
boyfriend, the baby's father, was one reason she hid her pregnancy,
according to police investigator Terry Sheridan.
   The girl admitted the baby was hers Monday after a doctor
confronted her because she had lost 16 pounds since her last exam.
   She then told her mother, who called police.
   Anderson was charged with falsely reporting an incident, a
misdemeanor. She is scheduled to appear in City Court later today.
   The baby, Tiffany Kisha, is in good condition at Strong Memorial
Hospital. She was scheduled to be released today or Wednesday, but
the mother's disclosure could change that, said Bob Meteyer, a
spokesman for the Department of Social Services.
   ``As the biological mother, she certainly has rights. But all
that has to be sorted out,'' he said.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday.
   Bush: With me is Congressman Bill Grant from the 2nd District of
Florida and his wife; the new chairman of the Republican Party in
the state of Florida, my old friend Van Poole; and our chairman of
the national committee, Lee Atwater.
   And I just wanted to bring Congressman Grant in here to say how
pleased I am that he is switching over to become a Republican.
   Florida is on the move.
   The nation, I think, benefits from this.
   Bill can answer any questions.
   He has a small, short statement.
   But this is good news for our party, not only in Florida, not
only in the South, but nationally, and I welcome him to the party.
   The way it will work is I have asked him to say a few words and
then I'm going to step back in and take a couple of questions and
then turn it over to Bill for follow-on and Lee Atwater will be with
him.
   Congressman Grant, welcome.
   Grant: Thank you, Mr. President.
   Bush: We're pleased you're here.
   Grant: Thank you.
   Well, I'm here this morning to announce that I intend to
reregister as a Republican in my hometown of Madison, Fla., this
afternoon.
   After a period of prolonged and careful deliberation, I have
determined that I can better represent the values and the priorities
of north Floridians in the state of Florida as a Republican.
   Please understand, I have been a Democrat all of my adult life
and I want the people who have sent me to the Congress to understand
that my actions are not going to change me as a person, will not
change my heritage.
   This action is not going to change my values, nor will it change
the way that I vote.
   I'm registering as a Republican because I can best serve the
people of Florida's 2nd Congressional District and a working
partnership with this president, with this administration and with
this Republican Party.
   I've been assured by President Bush that he will work closely and
cooperatively with me to ensure that the force of his administration
is brought to bear to improve the lives of the people that I
represent.
   I'm reregistering as a Republican because I share this party's
commitment _ or inclusion _ for all of the American people.
   I'm reregistering as a Republican because I share the values for
which the party stands.
   Those values include a commitment to a strong national defense,
where we're assured that our friends love us and our enemies fear
us; a commitment to fair and equal opportunity for all the citizens
of our land; and an unswerving commitment to fighting the crime and
drug abuse that plague our society.
   I believe that these values are shared by the people that I
represent, and I'm convinced that I can best serve them as a
Republican and I'm proud to make this announcement today.
   Thank you.

   President Bush said today the allegations
against John Tower have been ``gunned down'' by a thorough FBI
report, and he called on the Senate to move swiftly to confirm the
former senator as secretary of defense.
   Fielding questions from reporters at the White House, Bush said
he had personally reviewed the FBI background report on Tower.
   ``What I got from it was that there has been a very unfair
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up,'' he said.
   Tower has been plagued by reports of womanizing and problem
drinking and by questions about his financial ties to defense
contractors. The Senate Armed Services Committee had postponed a
vote on the nomination while the FBI report was being compiled and
may decide today or Wednesday when to vote.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, had no immediate response to the president's declaration.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine told reporters he
didn't know when the committee would act on the nomination, but
noted that the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been ``at
the request of the White House.''
   Mitchell also said it was ``premature'' to speculate about
whether the Senate would hold a closed-door session to review the
Tower file.
   The FBI report was delivered on Monday to the White House, which
forwarded it to the Senate committee.
   ``I hope that the Senate will move forthrightly on this
nomination,'' the president said.
   Published reports have said the FBI found that Tower drank
excessively in the 1970s, but no longer does so. Asked about that,
and whether the former senator had undergone treatment, Bush replied:
   ``I say there is no evidence of any kind of disease of
alcoholism. None. None whatsoever.''
   Tower's nomination has become the longest-running controversy in
the early weeks of the new administration, and Bush has gone out of
his way today to demonstrate support for his nominee at several
turns.
   ``I've never wavered in my support for John Tower,'' he said.
   ``I'd say all of these charges we've read about have been rumor,
and a lot of it vicious rumor.''
   ``John Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense, he'll be a
good secretary of defense ... the allegations against him that have
been hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of
fact,'' Bush added.
   With his appearance in the White House briefing room, the
president gave his personal stamp to what his senior aides already
had been telling reporters about the FBI report.
   ``It was very exhaustive; interviews with anybody and
everybody,'' press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said of a 140-page
report delivered to the White House on Monday and quickly
hand-carried to Capitol Hill by the president's counsel, C. Boyden
Gray.
   ``It did not corroborate the personal charges against the
(former) senator, nor did it show any problems with illegal campaign
contributions,'' said Fitzwater.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions, meantime,
that as a senator from Texas, profited from a lucrative oil
investment arranged in 1981 by a Corpus Christi lawyer whose son was
nominated to the federal bench by Tower.
   Towers' financial disclosure forms indicate he put up no capital
and financed his entire investment with a five-year promissory note
from a now-defunct San Antonio bank, the newspaper said.
   The money was used to purchase machinery which was leased to a
Corpus Christi drilling firm under terms that allowed Tower to pay
off the note while earning about $25,000 from the rental payments
and resale of the equipment in 1986, it said.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified people familiar with Tower's
finances, said the late Hayden Head Sr. was instrumental in
arranging the transaction, which closely coincided with the
appointment of Hayden Head Jr. to a federal judgeship.
   A spokesman for Tower denied there had been any ``quid pro quo''
between the oil investment and the judicial nomination, the Journal
said.
   At the Capitol on Monday, Nunn seemed reticent to discuss the
latest development in the troubled Tower confirmation process.
   Just before going into a closed-door meeting with Gray, Nunn was
asked whether the White House statements made him feel pressure to
move quickly to a committee vote.
   ``The only pressure I feel ... (is) to get the facts before
making this decision,'' he replied.
   However, while awaiting the report, Nunn had also said, ``We're
not going to hold up a vote in the committee any longer.''
   He and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
panel, indicated that if new questions arise later, they could be
dealt with later in the confirmation process.
   Nunn and Warner said in advance of the meeting with Gray that
they would make no comment to reporters afterward. Gray eluded
reporters after giving the report to the two senators.
   Although they did not elaborate on a specific timetable in brief
remarks to reporters on Monday, Nunn and Warner had indicated
previously that the committee might vote on the nomination by the
end of the week if the FBI report was received early in the week.
   Mitchell has said he will bring the Tower nomination to a prompt
vote on the Senate floor once the committee decides what it wants to
do.
   Tower's nomination has been stalled by numerous allegations of
excessive drinking and womanizing. Many senators also expressed
concerns about their former colleague's close ties to defense
contractors. Tower received more than $1 million as a consultant for
major defense firms since he left the Senate in 1985.
   Meanwhile, staff members of Nunn's committee met Monday with
Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer. Indahl had been
sent to Geneva in 1986 to investigate allegations of security
breaches in the U.S. delegation to missile talks with the Soviet
Union while Tower was a member of the contingent, said congressional
sources who requested anonymity.
   On Sunday, Indahl had spoken to investigators of a House
subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations
against Tower. At that meeting, the sources said, Indahl
corroborated a report that Tower, while in Geneva, had used his
secretaries as mistresses.
   The sources would not go into detail on what Indahl told the
House committee.

   Rep. Bill Grant, a two-term congressman who
switched to the Republican Party today, represents much of Florida's
Panhandle, where Republicans have been displaying increasing
strength in recent elections.
   Grant, 46, appeared at the White House with President Bush, who
announced Grant's defection from the Democratic Party.
   ``This is good news for our party not only in Florida, not only
in the South, but nationally,'' Bush said.
   For his part, Grant told reporters at the nationally televised
announcement, ``After a period of prolonged and careful
deliberation, I have determined that I can better represent the
values and the priorities of north Floridians in the State of
Florida as a Republican.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, asked about Grant's defection from the
majority party, said:
   ``It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I hope
he's happy.''
   Grant was a banker from Madison, a rural town in northern
Florida, when he first won election to the House in 1986, after four
years in Florida's state Senate.
   His conversion tips the balance of Florida's delegation to
Congress, giving the state 10 Republicans and nine Democrats.
   Grant is the second Florida congressman to switch parties in five
years. Former Democratic Rep. Andy Ireland became a Republican in
1984.
   Grant's district is the largest, geographically, east of the
Mississippi River. The 2nd congressional district stretches along
the state's northern border from near Panama City to just west of
Jacksonville and includes Tallahasse, the state capital.
   Voters in the Florida Panhandle have long voted for Democratics
in state elections but recently have been showing more support for
Republican candidates, especially in the last two presidential
elections.
   Last fall, two Republican upsets in races for traditionally
Democratic congressional seats _ the 4th and 6th congressional
districts _ eroded the Democrats' majority in the delegation. In the
Senate, Republicans gained one of Florida's seats when Connie Mack
defeated Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay to replace the retired
Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   Grant won his seat after 12-term Rep. Don Fuqua, a Democrat,
decided to retire. Grant won 51 percent of the vote in a
five-candidate primary. He had no Republican opponent in the general
election.
   Grant has been active in the Democratic Party and had figured in
speculation for a possible run for governor in 1990. He drew
publicity last summer for his unsuccessful campaign in support of
Sen. Bob Graham for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.

   States may not offer the equivalent of patent
protection for utilitarian and design ideas left unprotected by
federal law, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The justices killed a lawsuit in which a Florida boat
manufacturer charged that its design for a fiberglass recreational
boat was duplicated illegally by a competitor.
   The court said only Congress, and not individual states, can
decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design
ideas.
   ``It is for Congress to determine if the present system of design
and utility patents is ineffectual in promoting the useful arts in
the context of industrial design,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote for the court.
   She said a Florida law that would have protected the boat
manufacturer's design ``conflicts with the strong federal policy
favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent
protection.''
   Bonito Boats Inc. in 1976 developed an original hull design that
was marketed as model 5VBR.
   A hardwood model was created from engineering drawings, and the
model was then sprayed with fiberglass to create a mold. The mold
then was used to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale.
   No patent was obtained for the utilitarian or design aspects of
the hull, or for the process by which the hull was manufactured.
   After the model 5VBR proved a marketing success, the Florida
Legislature enacted a law that, in effect, gave Bonita Boats a
state-level monopoly for making hulls that way.
   Bonito Boats later invoked the state law in suing Thunder Craft
Boats for allegedly using the same process. A Florida trial judge,
upheld by the state Supreme Court, threw out the lawsuit after
ruling that the state law giving protection to Bonito Boats'
creativity impermissibly conflicts with federal patent law.
   Today's decision upheld the state court rulings.
   ``Congress has considered extending various forms of limited
protection to industrial design either through the copyright laws or
by relaxing the restrictions on the availability of design
patents,'' O'Connor noted.
   ``Congress explicitly refused to take this step in the copyright
laws, and despite sustained criticism for a number of years it has
declined to alter the patent protections presently available for
industrial design,'' she said.
   The case is Bonito Boats vs. Thunder Craft Boats, 87-1346.

   Playwright Vaclav Havel today was
convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a
rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion.
   Havel, Czecholovakia's best-known dissident, denied charges that
he incited people to ``anti-state and anti-Socialist'' activity.
   In the one-day trial, he was convicted of inciting participation
in the banned Jan. 16 rally and for obstructing the duty of a public
official.
   On the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term
of two years, on the second to another six months in prison.
Prosecutors had asked for a one-year term, but Judge Helena Hlavata
ruled on a nine-month prison term and rejected a proposed fine.
   The prosecution of Havel and other opposition activists has gone
on despite widespread criticism at home, in the East bloc and the
West that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with
dissent. Seven other activists from the Charter 77 human rights
committee and other independent movements also went on trial today.
   Authorities banned a number of Western diplomats and
representatives from human rights organizations from the trials.
   Havel, 52, who helped found the Charter 77 movement, has been
harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his
1975 open letter to Communist Party leader Gustav Husak accused
authorities of creating ``a bureaucratic order of gray monotony that
stifles all individuality.''
   Havel was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in
jail in 1979. Authorities have banned his plays, which are widely
acclaimed in productions abroad.
   He told the court that Charter 77 was a peaceful organization
whose sole intention to ensure respect for human rights.
   ``For 12 years we have offered dialogue on these things, for 12
years the state power has not responded to our initiative,'' Havel
said.
   More than 100 Havel sympathizers had jammed a small stairwell
leading to the courtroom, loudly cheering him earlier today when
police led him to the trial.
   Havel's brother, Ivan, said Havel did not take part in a Jan. 16
flower-laying ceremony in a downtown Prague square, but was detained
on the square an hour later.
   The seven other defendants _ all activists with Charter 77 and
other independent groups _ face hooliganism charges in connection
with the Jan. 16 gathering. The charges carry a maximum two-year
jail sentence.
   The seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of
Jan Palach, the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier
to protest the Soviet-led invasion that quashed communist reforms in
Czechoslovakia.
   The arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest
in Prague since Palach's death.
   Ota Veverka, one of the seven Charter 77 human rights group
activists being tried, said what happened on Wenceslas Square ``was
not a criminal act but an assault by police.''
   Most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to
lay flowers in Palach's memory and no demonstration was planned.
   More than 2,000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for
the government to release the dissidents.
   It was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment
intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public.
   The trials also have drawn an official protest from the Hungarian
Writers' Union, as well as criticism from the United States, Britain
and other Western governments and groups.
   Last month, NATO, Warsaw Pact, and 12 other European nations
agreed on new human rights accords in Vienna.
   Britain and the United States have charged that the trials
violate the spirit of those accords. Nine independent groups in
Czechoslovakia have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new
accords to protest the trials.
   Those on trial are Charter 77 activists Sasha Vondra and Jana
Sternova and independent activists Veverka, Nemec, Jana Petrova,
Stanislav Penc and Petr Placak.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules States Cannot Exempt Religious Writings from
Sales Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that states may
not give preferential treatment to religious publications by
exempting them from sales taxes imposed on other books, newspapers
and magazines.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a now-defunct Texas statute
violated the Constitution.
   The decision presumably will force the state to give sales tax
refunds to non-religious publications or impose the levy against
religious organizations that were exempt.
   Five justices _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul
Stevens, Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor _ said the Texas
law violated the Constitution's required separation of church and
state.
   Justice Byron R. White said the law violated free-press
guarantees in the Constitution by taxing non-religious publications
while exempting others solely on the basis of religious content.
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Brennan, writing only for himself, Marshall and Stevens, said
Texas's previous sales tax exemption for religious publications
``lacks a secular objective'' and ``effectively endorses religious
belief.''
   Moreover, Brennan said, nothing in the Constitution's guarantee
of the free exercise of religion bars states from imposing such
taxes on religious periodicals.
   In a separate concurring opinion, Blackmun and O'Connor said
while the Texas law violates the separation of church and state,
some exemptions for religious publications could be constitutional.
   ``For example,'' said Blackmun in an opinion joined by O'Connor,
``a state statute might exempt the sale not only of religious
literature distributed by a religious organization but also of
philosophical literature distributed by non-religious organizations
devoted to such matters of conscience as life and death, good and
evil, being and non-being, right and wrong.''
   In a dissenting opinion joined by Rehnquist and Kennedy, Scalia
said the ruling appears to topple exemptions for religious
publications granted by many other states.
   ``In short, religious tax exemptions of the type the court
invalidates today permeate the state and federal (legal) codes and
have done so for many years,'' Scalia said.
   Texas imposed a sales tax on books and periodicals from October
1984 through October 1987. But the law exempted ``periodicals
published or distributed by a religious faith and that consist
wholly of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith.''
   The Texas Legislature revoked the sales tax on all books and
periodicals in October 1987.
   Texas Monthly, a general interest magazine with a circulation of
about 280,000, challenged the exemption for religious publications
after it paid more than $149,000 in sales taxes in 1985.
   The magazine is seeking a refund of the money.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 struck down an Arkansas tax imposed on
sales of general interest magazines but exempted newspapers and
religious, professional, trade and sports magazines.
   The court in that case said states have a heavy burden of proof
to justify taxing publications based on their content.
   The Texas law presented a different situation: everything but
religious publications had been taxed.
   The case acted on today is Texas Monthly vs. Bullock, 87-1245.

   Bush: Now, I'll be glad to take a couple of questions.
   As you know, we're leaving on this trip tomorrow and there may be
some on that, which I doubt. (Laughter.)
   Terry?
   Q. Mr. President, what's your reaction to Iran's death threats
against the British author Salman Rushdie? And do you think that the
British allies _ or that the Western allies should impose economic
sanctions against Iran in retaliation?
   A. Well, I strongly support the EC-12 declaration in response to
the Iranian threats against Rushdie.
   However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering
rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of
civilized behavior.
   And our position on terrorism is well-known.
   In the light of Iran's incitement, should any action be taken
against American interests, the government of Iran can expect to be
held accountable.
   And so that is my view on it, and I think the EC-12 did the right
thing.
   Q. How about the economic sanctions part of it?
   A. They will be discussing that, I'm sure, but I don't know where
we go from there.
   As you know, we have certain economic sanctions, and I'll be
meeting in _ I know I'll be talking to President Mitterrand, and I
expect this subject will come up, and maybe others _ but Brent, are
we in? _ I'm not sure exactly of the bilaterals we're having, but it
will be a matter.
   Helen, and then we'll start moving around trying to get to the
back of the room.
   Q. Basically, in a way, a question about your trip. There is a
widespread perception that you don't have a foreign policy, that you
have permitted the Russians to move into the vacuum in the Middle
East, you were surprised on Central America, that your ``go slow''
attitude really has let the Russians grab the ball.
   A. Well, I've never heard such an outrageous hypothesis.
(Laughter.)
   The fact that the Soviets _ you failed to point out that the
Soviets moved out of Afghanistan.
   Some good things happening.
   I don't worry about a trip by Mr. Shevardnadze to the Middle East.
   I have no worry about that _
   Q. (Inaudible.)
   A. No, it happened just this week.
   And they're out of there.
   I don't worry about that.
   And we have a foreign policy.
   We are reviewing appropriately East-West relations, the way we
look at South America.
   But this doesn't trouble me one bit.
   We've established and are following on with certain principles
that are out there.
   And I think that Jim Baker when he came back made very clear that
the NATO alliance still looks to the United States.
   I'll have an opportunity to discuss a lot of things as we go on
this particular trip.
   So I simply don't agree with that.
   I really hadn't ever heard such a negative approach to foreign
policy.
   Q. (Inaudible.)
   A. Middle East policy? It's to encourage discussions between King
Hussein and the Israelis.
   And to build on the progress that has been made already.
   And I think it was _ I've already said that I think it was very
useful, the changes that the PLO advocated.
   Now, we want to see that there's some follow-on there.
   So the policy is set.
   I campaigned on what the policy is.
   And I think it's quite clear.
   The question is, what specific steps we take next, and I don't
want to be rushing out because Mr. Shevardnadze went to the Middle
East.
   I'd like to have for the first step we take of that nature to be
a prudent step.
   So the principles are there, and I think we're _ you know, we've
got to now flesh that out and figure out what we do specifically.
   Yes?

<TEXT>
   A University of Virginia professor cautioned
today against taking drastic action to combat the atmosphere's
greenhouse effect until scientists learn whether it causes droughts,
heat waves and other climatic changes.
   ``Our policy should be commensurate with the state of our
scientific knowledge,'' Dr. Patrick J. Michaels told a House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee studying the global warming problem.
   Dr. Stephen Schneider, a scientist for the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, agreed that better information is needed, but
he said action was needed now as ``insurance against catastrophic
change.''
   The greenhouse effect ``gives you an additional reason'' to redce
burning of fossil fuels and take other action to benefit the
environment, the Boulder, Colo., climate specialist said.
   The subcommittee was told that it may take two decades to learn
whether the greenhouse effect is responsible for temperature changes
like the searing heat waves of last summer.
   Schneider and Michaels agreed that scientists are unable to
attribute last summer's heat to the buildup of greenhouses gases,
and Schneider showed the committee slides of news articles that he
said prematurely blamed last summer's temperatures on the building
up greenhouse gases.
   Schneider said ``another decade, or possibly two, will be
required to be sure that the warming of the 1980s (the warmest
decade recorded on a global basis) will ... continue into the 1990s
and beyond.''
   ``I expect it will, but I can't prove it, of course,'' he said.
   Michaels, a professor of environmental sciences, said climate
experts have a ``clouded vision'' of future global warming, and told
lawmakers that ``basing sweeping environmental policy'' on such
uncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy is otherwise
rational.''
   Michaels has warned in past statements against ``public
hysteria'' and ``the politics of fear'' toward global warming.
   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's atmosphere
trap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, the
more heat.
   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they
are to outgoing infrared energy. Mars, a planet with a thin,
predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a mean temperature that
is below that of deep freezers. Venus, with a thick, largely carbon
dioxide atmosphere, is hotter than an oven.
   The earth's atmosphere, on the other hand, has been just right to
support life. It has not become an iceball because of heat trapped
by greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, fluorocarbons, nitrous
oxide.
   In addition to natural buildup, the greenhouse gases have
increased dramatically because of human activities, including
burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas; and destruction of
tropical rain forests.
   The problem comes in trying to predict the future.
   Michaels denied that he's trying to ``throw roadblocks in the way
of sensible environmental policy,'' and agreed global climatic
change is ``potentially the most serious environmental disturbance
ever created by technological man.''
   But he added, ``My purpose is rather to underscore that policy
should be commensurate with the state of scientific knowledge.''
   Although there's no single set of figures to show how much the
erth has warmed, Michaels said the planet ``at best, appears to have
warmed up only half as much as our average forecasts indicate it
should have.''
   He added that the greenhouse effect may be causing a rise in
nighttime temperatures only, a potentially beneficial effect that
could lengthen growing seasons. And it is ``well known,'' he added,
``that long-term climate records sometimes warm because their
surroundings become more urbanized.''
   Schneider, in proposing action now, suggested stepped-up
investments in efficient energy production; accelerated testing of
non-fossil fuel alternatives; development of climate-adapted crop
strains; coastal planning to deal with rising sea levels and storm
surges.
   ``Delaying rapid change can buy us time to adapt more easily and
provide insurance against the not remote possibility of catastrophic
rates of change,'' he said.

   A storm centered over western Kentucky today lashed Gulf Coast
states with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes and caused renewed
flooding in parts of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   Tornadoes hit several parts of northwest Alabama and central
Louisiana, downing power lines, throwing mobile homes and knocking
trees on cars. No serious injuries were reported. School was
canceled today in Alabama's Houston County due to the poor weather
and road conditions.
   In North Carolina, tornado-like winds flipped mobile homes in
Moore County, injuring four people, tore off a roof of a school and
overturned several small planes in Anson County, authorities said.
No children in the school were hurt.
   Twisters also were sighted in east-central Mississippi. Heavy
rain accompanied the thunderstorms and caused flash floods in
Alabama and Louisiana.
   Rainfall measured from 3 to 7 inches Monday in Rapides Parish in
central Louisiana, where twisters hit in seven locations, said Bill
Godron, the parish's civil defense director. Parts of the Florida
Panhandle had more than 3} inches of rain in the six hours ended at
1 a.m. EST. Tupelo, Miss., received just over 3 inches of rain in
the period.
   Golfball-size hail pelted Fort Walton Beach on the Florida
Panhandle.
   Wind gusting to 80 mph downed trees and power lines in Jackson,
Miss., Monday evening, knocking out power to several thousand homes.
Strong winds also led to power outages in Birmingham, Ala., and
southwest Georgia, early today.
   Several roads were flooded in central Tennessee, where more than
2{ inches of rain fell Monday. The Ohio River rose over its banks
from Louisville, Ky., to Cairo at the southern tip of Illinois.
   Flash flood watches were in effect in northern Mississippi,
northwest Alabama, Tennessee, parts of Kentucky and West Virginia,
southwest Virginia and southern Ohio.
   Rain was widespread early today along the East Coast from the
Carolinas to Connecticut.
   In the Midwest, a band of snow stretched from southern Michigan
to Iowa and northern Missouri. Quincy in western Illinois received 7
inches. Snow advisories were posted for northern and central
Illinois and southern Michigan, and a winter storm watch was in
effect for northern Maine.
   Light snow also fell on the central and northern Plains.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in much of
the East, including the Atlantic states, the central and eastern
Gulf Coast, the Tennessee and Ohio valleys and the lower Mississippi
Valley; thunderstorms from Mississippi to the Atlantic Coast between
South Carolina and northern Florida; rain along the northern Pacific
Coast; snow in Illinois and the upper Great Lakes region, northern
Maine, Montana and Wyoming.
   Highs were forecast to be in the teens and 20s from western
Montana across the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley
to western portions of the upper Great Lakes; the 30s and 40s in
much of Nevada and Idaho, the central Rockies, the central Plains,
the Ohio Valley, the remainder of the Great Lakes and northern New
England; the 50s and 60s along the Pacific Coast, southern Nevada,
the southern Rockies, Texas, the Gulf Coast, the Tennessee Valley,
the mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England; the 70s in Southern
California and southern Arizona; and the 70s and 80s in Florida,
southern Georgia and the coast of the Carolinas.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 1 below zero at Grand
Forks, N.D., to 76 degrees at Key West Naval Air Station and Miami,
Fla.

   Five children died when a fire raged through an apartment complex
in Chester, Pa., and four children died in a New York City row house
blaze while playing with matches or a lighter, authorities said.
   In both fires Monday, hysterical mothers watched helplessly as
flames destroyed their homes and families.
   In New York, two mothers desperately threw buckets of water on
what authorities called a ``wall of fire,'' but to no avail.
   In the Pennsylvania fire, police Officer Michael Kruczaj said he
arrived at the scene to find 25-year-old Michelle Arnold outside her
burning apartment, holding one of her six children, a critically
injured 13-month-old boy.
   ``My babies! My babies! They're still inside!'' Ms. Arnold
shouted at Kruczaj, he recalled later.
   But the officer said the fire and smoke were too thick for him to
attempt rescuing Ms. Arnold's other five children, three boys and
two girls 2 to 6 years old. All died in the blaze.
   The fire started Monday afternoon under a bed and officials
suspect the children may have been playing with matches, fire Capt.
Joseph Cliffe said. The official cause remains undetermined.
Authorities said early reports of an explosion were erroneous.
   Thirty-nine of the 80 two-story units in the Crosby Square
apartment complex were damaged, authorities said. It was not known
how many people were in the building at the time of the fire or how
many were evacuated.
   Witnesses said Ms. Arnold was outside the apartment building
talking to friends when the fire broke out. She ran inside and was
able to rescue her 13-month old son, Marlon, just before Kruczaj
arrived, authorities said.
   Marlon was in critical condition today with burns over 70 percent
of his body and suffering from smoke inhalation, officials said.
   The New York fire broke out Monday afternoon in a Brooklyn
apartment.
   According to Fire Department spokesman Efrain Parrilla, four
children were playing in a bedroom and their mothers, sisters Gail
and Devoria Murray, were in a kitchen at the rear of the home when
they smelled smoke.
   When they went to investigate, they found one door blocked by a
mattress and another door blocked by a bunk bed, Parrilla said.
   ``Devoria and Gail tried to put out the fire with pots and pans
of water but it was to no avail. That mattress was like a wall of
fire,'' Parrilla said.
   Harry Isaacs, a neighbor, said the sight of the two hysterical
mothers trying to douse the flames was enough to ``give you
nightmares.''
   ``By the time we got there, they were gone _ they had no
chance,'' said fire Lt. Philip McDonnell.
   He said firefighters found the children, ages 4 to 8, atop one
another on the lower portion of a bunk bed on the top floor of the
three-story brick building.
   Fire Marshal John Regan said it appeared the children had been
playing with matches or a lighter.
   An unused smoke detector was found in a closet, Regan said.

   Players and spectators of a soccer match
saved about 100 passengers from a sinking ferry in northeastern
Bangladesh, witnesses and police said Tuesday.
   There were no injuries.
   The ferry was carrying more than double its sanctioned capacity,
and sank near the banks of River Karala at Mahasingh, 110 miles
northeast of Dhaka on Monday, they said.
   Most of the 22 players of a soccer match and hundreds of
spectators who heard the screams of the passengers jumped into the
river, witnesses said. They rescued women and children from the hull
of the sinking ferry.
   Almost all male passengers already had reached safety.
   ``The passengers could survive as the ferry sank near the bank
and it took 30 minutes to sink,'' a police officer said.
   Ferry accidents are common in Bangladesh. Officials estimate 900
people have died in about 60 such accidents in the past seven years.

   A man has died of injuries
suffered in December's crash of a U.S. Air Force jet in Remscheid,
bringing the death toll to seven, officials said Tuesday.
   Truck driver Paul Gerd Kuepper, 47, died in a hospital Feb. 11,
according to authorities in Remscheid, 24 miles northeast of Cologne.
   Kuepper suffered severe burns when an A-10 Thunderbolt II
warplane crashed into a residential area Dec. 8. Fifty people were
injured.
   A series of military air crashes killed more than 100 people in
West Germany last year, causing a public outcry against low-level
training flights.
   The most serious disaster occurred on Aug. 28, when three Italian
stunt-flying jets collided at U.S. Ramstein Air Base and one of them
plunged into a crowd of spectators, killing 70 people and injuring
hundreds of others.
   The U.S. Air Force announced last week it was canceling all
public air shows in West Germany this year because of that crash.

   Postal workers accused of traffic violations
must stand trial in state courts, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The decision limits the federal government's power to block some
state prosecutions of federal workers.
   The justices ordered two U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to
stand trial in California state courts.
   Both cases stem from traffic accidents in Santa Clara County.
   In one, Kathryn Isabella Mesa was accused of
misdemeanor-manslaughter after her mail truck collided with and
killed a bicyclist. In the other, Shabbir A. Ebrahim was charged
with speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided
with a police car.
   Both defendants succeeded in tranferring their cases to a federal
court. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 sent the
cases back to the state courts.
   The Supreme Court today upheld the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, rejected
Justice Department arguments that permitting state prosecutions in
such cases could interfere with federal officials in performance of
their duties.
   Only if a federal issue is directly at stake may a prosecution be
shifted to federal court, O'Connor said. She also noted that
transferring cases like traffic violations to federal court would
impose heavy burdens on local state prosecutors.
   ``We can discern no federal interest in potentially forcing local
district attorneys to choose between prosecuting traffic violations
hundreds of miles from the municipality in which the violations
occurred or abandoning those prosecutions,'' O'Connor said.
   A federal law providing for removal of states cases to federal
court was enacted in response to New England's opposition to a trade
embargo declared during the War of 1812 between the United States
and Great Britain.
   Federal customs officials were given authority then to board
vessels in order to collect duties, assuring they would avoid
prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the
performance of their duties.
   The 9th Circuit court had noted that in the California case there
was no claim by the mail carriers that their allegedly illegal
conduct was justified by the duties they were performing.
   The case is Mesa vs. California, 87-1206.

   Iran recalled its ambassadors from Common Market countries today,
a day after the 12 European countries decided to withdraw their
envoys from Tehran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order
that novelist Salman Rushdie be killed.
   Iran said its move was in direct reponse to the European Economic
Community's decision Monday to recall ambassadors from Tehran and
suspend high-level diplomatic exchanges.
   Hours later, Britain _ which already said it would withdraw its
entire embassy staff from Tehran _ announced it was expelling the
Iranian charge d'affaires and his aide to protest the death threats.
   ``It is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal
relationship with Iran,'' British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe told the House of Commons.
   President Bush said today he strongly supports European countries
that have withdrawn their ambassadors from Iran.
   ``However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the
norms of civilized behavior,'' Bush said.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran.
   In a communique, the Iranian Foreign Ministry called Khomeini's
week-old order for the death of Rushdie a ``consensus judgment of
all Moslem leaders throughout the world,'' Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   Many Moslems consider Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemous, although some Moslems have criticized Khomeini's order
that Rushdie be killed. The book has been banned by seven nations,
including India, Egypt and Pakistan.
   IRNA quoted the Foreign Ministry communique as saying respect for
Islam and its values will remain an inviolable principle in
relations between Iran and other countries.
   Britain said Monday it was withdrawing its embassy staff from the
Iranian capital and closing its embassy. The two countries resumed
diplomatic relations in November after a 17-month break.
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, now lives in London
and is a British citizen. The novel was first published in Britain
in September.
   Sweden and Norway, although not members of the Common Market,
recalled their ambassadors from Iran today. Foreign Minister Sten
Andersson of Sweden said his nation also will cancel a visit by a
trade delegation scheduled for next month unless the death threat
against Rushdie is rescinded.
   The European Community's foreign ministers, at a meeting Monday
in Brussels, Belgium, decided to recall their country's ambassadors
for consultation at Britain's request.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran called the EC action a
``useless maneuver certain to harm the European Community rather
than Iran,'' IRNA reported. He said it was ``the Western countries
which need to win Iran's favor, rather than the other way around,''
the agency said.
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, criticized the
recall as ``a big mistake'' and said it proved Rushdie's novel was a
plot ``designed by Western imperialism to fight true Islam,'' IRNA
reported.
   ``We do not fear such threats,'' he added. ``We are prepared to
follow our own path at an cost.''
   IRNA quoted Moslem leaders in Tehran as calling for severing ties
with Britain because: ``British colonialism and the Great Satan (the
United States) had played a basic role in insulting the prophet
Mohammed.''
   The statement called Rushdie's novel ``slanderous'' and asked the
world's Moslems to carry out Khomeini's order that the author be
killed.
   Iranian clerics have put a $5.2 million bounty on the author's
head. Rushdie is reportedly in hiding under police guard.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' portrays the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than
Allah _ was the source of the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The novel has prompted Moslem protests around the world. In
Pakistan and India, seven people died in the protests.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey have
canceled plans to publish Rushdie's book, and it has been pulled
from bookstore shelves in Japan. Many U.S. bookstores have also
removed the novel from display.
   In a letter today to Premier Michel Rocard of France, the more
than 500 authors in the French section of the international Pen Club
called for publication of ``The Satanic Verses.'' The authors said
they were confident authorities could assure the publishers' safety.
Last week, Christian Bourgois, the French publisher with rights to
the novel, said it was suspending publication to protect its
employees.
   On Monday, Iranian leaders met at Khomeini's home to reaffirm the
``execution'' order, and Iranian television showed the
fundamentalist patriarch sitting on a balcony above a crowd of
several hundred men who waved clenched fists and chanted ``Death to
America!'' and ``Long Live Khomeini!''
   After Khomeini called for Rushdie's killing, Iranian President
Ali Khamenei said an apology from Rushdie might lead to a pardon.
   The 41-year-old writer apologized Saturday for any distress his
book has caused Moslems.
   But Khomeini rejected the apology. Neither he nor IRNA made any
mention of Khamenei's statement on the issue, suggesting a split in
Iranian leadership.
   The decision by the European countries to recall their
ambassadors was a setback for Iranian moderates' hopes of improving
relations with Western nations. Iran recently has expressed interest
in bolstering ties and receiving aid to help rebuilt its economy,
battered by eight years of war with Iraq.

   President Bush, calling Iran's death threats
against author Salman Rushdie ``deeply offensive to the norms of
civilized behavior,'' today backed European countries that have
withdrawn their ambassadors from Iran.
   Bush was asked about further U.S. sanctions against the
government of Ayatollah Khomeini, who has called on Muslims to send
Rushdie ``to hell.'' Noting existing economic sanctions against
Iran, Bush said only that ``I don't know where we'll go from there.''
   Bush also said American booksellers deserve the protection of the
law against threats of retaliation if they display copies of
Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' Several book dealers,
including two large chains, have taken the book off the shelves.
   ``However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the
norms of civilized behavior,'' said the president. ``I've just laid
down how I feel in terms of in this case the Imam exhorting people
to go out and commit murder.''
   At a meeting with reporters on the eve of a six-day trip to the
Far East, Bush also reiterated his support for his embattled
Pentagon nominee John Tower and urged the Senate to ``move
forthrightly'' to approve the nomination.
   The president said the allegations that have held up action on
Tower's nomination were ``very unfair treatment of this man by rumor
and innuendo.'' He said a new FBI report, released Monday, had
``gunned down'' the allegations of misconduct.
   ``I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I knew all along. John
Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense,'' he added.
   ``Anybody that's been through this ordeal will be stronger, not
weaker,'' Bush said.
   Bush, who leaves Wednesday for Japan, South Korea and China, was
asked at one point if the United States had given up momentum in
foreign affairs to the Soviets, whose foreign minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has been in the Middle East on a peace mission.
   Bush brushed off the suggestion as ``preposterous.''
   Later, when asked what the Soviet role in the region ought to be,
he replied, ``I think it should be a limited role, and I think
that's what it's going to be.''
   ``I don't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet
foreign minister takes a trip to the Middle East,'' he said. ``In my
view that's a good thing.''
   At a meeting in Brussels Monday of the 12 foreign ministers of
the European Community nations, it was decided to withdraw
diplomatic representatives from Iran in the wake of Khomeini's call
for the assassination of Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen
living in London.
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police protection since the
threat.
   Iran announced today it was withdrawing its diplomats from
European nations.
   Bush called reporters to the White House press room to announce
that second-term Rep. Bill Grant of Florida was switching his
registration from Democratic to Republican.
   ``This is good news for our party not only in Florida, not only
in the South, but nationally,'' Bush said.
   Grant's defection startled Democratic leaders. ``It took me by
surprise,'' House Speaker Jim Wright said. ``I hope he's happy.''
   On other topics, Bush:
   _ Sought to allay some U.S. fears that the Japanese own too much
American property. ``It is important if we believe in open markets
that people be allowed to invest here just as I'd like to see more
openness for American investors in other countries. ... We have to
do a better job of knocking down barriers to American products''
overseas, he said.
   _ Said ``I'd like to find some way to do something'' about easy
access to automatic weapons. But the president, a strong opponent of
gun control, added that ``I want to be the president that protects
the rights of people to have arms.''
   _ Declared ``I'm not ruling anything in or out'' on Star Wars,
the nuclear defense shield. Asked about budget aide Richard Darman's
statement that further Star Wars development was conditional on the
outcome of a 90-day review, Bush said, ``I'm not going to close any
doors or open any ... We're going to have to make some tough
choices. ... Let's wait and see what the review produces.''
   _ Conceded that his effort to defeat former Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke in Louisiana may have been viewed by voters as ``improper
or overkill.'' But he added that Duke's record is ``one of racism
and bigotry and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.'' Duke
was elected as a Republican to a seat in the Louisiana House.

President Bush covered in his news conference Tuesday:

<TEXT>
   Bush sharply criticized the Ayatollah Khomeini for ``exhorting
people to go out and commit murder'' against Salman Rushdie, author
of ``Satanic Verses.'' Bush said that ``however offensive that book
may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetraton are
deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior.'' He warned
that, ``In the light of Iran's incitement, should any action be
taken against American interests, the government of Iran can expect
to be held accountable.'' He supported the European Community's
unified stance against Iran's threats, and said he would discuss the
possibility of sanctions with the president of France and other
leaders in Tokyo.

<BYLINE>MIDDLE EAST</BYLINE>

   The president said the Soviets' role in the Middle East ``should
be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to be.'' He
said he was not going to be ``stampeded'' into pressing ahead on
Middle East policy simply because Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze is visiting the region. The U.S. policy is ``to
encourage discussions between King Hussein (of Jordan) and the
Israelis and to build on the progress that has been made already.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOWER</NOTE>

   Bush reaffirmed his support for John Tower, saying an FBI report
had ``gunned down'' allegations of misconduct against the nominee
for secretary of defense. He said, ``Anybody that's been through
this ordeal will be stronger, not weaker'' in running the Pentagon.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DAVID DUKE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The president said it may have been ``improper or overkill'' for
him to urge Metairie, La., voters to reject former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke's bid for a seat in the state house as a
Republican. The voters who elected Duke may have resented the
intervention, Bush said, but Duke's record ``is one of racism and
bigotry and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STAR WARS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush said he was ``not ruling anything in or out'' on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars, but the
administration has ``some tough choices'' ahead on defense. He
reiterated his support for the principle of SDI, but said he was not
in favor of ``premature deployment'' and would not close or open any
doors until a review of overall defense policy is completed.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>URBAN VIOLENCE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The president said the federal government has a responsibility to
help curb violence in Washington, D.C., and across the nation, but
he rejected stiffer gun controls. He said his forthcoming anti-drug
program will address his campaign promises to get tough on criminals
and build more prisons. He said he wants to enforce ``the laws that
are already on the books about automated AK-47s coming into this
country.'' He said he wants to help the police ``who are out there
on the line all the time,'' but he also wants ``to be the president
that protects the rights of people to have arms.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>JAPAN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush defended Japanese investment in the United States, saying it
is only the third-largest foreign investor behind Britain and the
Netherlands. He said the Japanese and other foreign investors are
helping the United States finance its ``horrendous deficits,'' and
it is important to keep U.S. markets open even as it presses for
``more openness for American investors in other countries.'' He
promised to exercise his responsibility to protect U.S. technology
and national security.

<HEAD>WASHN: specifically. Yes?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, the FBI's final, or presumably final report on
Senator Tower is now in. You are reported to have read some of it.
The Senate committee has it. I would like to know what you got from
it, and also, whether you have any reason to believe that the Senate
will go forward _ any reason from private conversations with members
of the armed services committee _ will go forward with a favorable
vote on this nomination?
   A. What I got from it _ and I reviewed some of the more _ the
parts that related to some of the allegations against Tower _ what I
got from it was that there has been a very unfair treatment of this
man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again _ rumors surfacing
with no _ no facts to back them up.
   And I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I've felt all along,
and that is that John Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense;
he will be a good secretary of defense, although the report didn't
answer that.
   But the allegations against him that have been hanging over this
simply have been gunned down in terms of fact.
   And so that's positive.
   And I had a little preview, so when I held my thumbs up, I was
glad to get that report.
   And I hope that the Senate will move forthrightly on this
nomination.
   So _ and I don't know, Brit, what _ where it stands.
   I talked to _ I had some of the leaders down this morning, but
the only one I got to talk to on this was Bob Dole.
   And I'd like to see it go forward, obviously.
   Q. If I might follow _
   A. I have never wavered in my support for John Tower.
   Q. If I could follow up, sir. There's a report in the Wall Street
Journal this morning that Senator Tower promoted a federal judgeship
for the son of a man with whom he had done business for his own
personal benefit. And I was wondering if that's news to you, sir,
and if _ or if it troubles you in any way?
   A. I never heard such a report, and I'd _ you know, one thing
after another.
   And, you're telling me something I don't know anything about.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, does this announcement by Congressman Grant
this morning overcome the embarrassment to the party of the election
Saturday of David Duke, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan? And do
you intend to _ you came out for his opponent in the election; so
did former President Reagan. What does the party do next about David
Duke?
   A. Well, I'll leave that to Lee.
   But I strongly support what our national Chairman Lee Atwater has
said in this matter.
   And maybe there was some feeling in Metairie, La., that the
president of the United States involving himself in a state
legislative election was improper or overkill.
   I've heard _ read that.
   And I can't deny that.
   But what I can affirm is, I did what I did because of principle
and Lee has done what he has done because of principle and this man,
his record is one of racism and bigotry, and, I'm sorry, I just felt
I had to speak out.
   But whether it helped or hurt, I don't know.
   Q. Mr. President, you said during your speech to the joint
session of Congress that your support for the Strategic Defense
Initiative was unqualified, but the Office of Management and Budget
director, Richard Darman, when he briefed on your budget, said that
it was conditional on the outcome of this 90-day review that's
coming up. Is it or is it not conditional and would you rule out
curtailing the program to an accidental launch protection system?
   A. I'm not ruling anything in or out.
   I have stated my support for the principle of SDI.
   I have not favored what some would call ``premature deployment''
but on the other hand I will be very interested in seeing what this
overall review comes up with and I'm not going to close any doors or
open any in regards to this or any other systems.
   We're going to have to make some tough choices on defense.
   I'm aware of that and so let's wait and see what the review
produces.
   Lesley?
   Q. Mr. President, back on John Tower, if we could. You've said
that the process has been unfair and I would like to ask you
specifically about Sam Nunn, who some people say will now run
defense policy because John Tower has been so weakened and damaged
by this drip, drip, drip of allegations.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says North `Placed Himself Above the Law'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with defense statement, picks up pvs 4th graf,

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North ``placed himself above the
law'' by lying to Congress and shredding documents to conceal his
support of the Nicaraguan rebels, a prosecutor told jurors today at
the opening of the former presidential aide's Iran-Contra trial.
   Associate independent counsel John W. Keker said North's lies to
congressional committees and to the attorney general amount to ``a
crime that goes to the soul of our self-government.''
   But North's lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, countered that ``the
defense says to you, he is not guilty on all charges. He never broke
the law ... he followed instructions of higher authority.''
   Keker, then Sullivan, delivered their opening statements, each
describing a different North, the first person to go on trial in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``He was doing his job as he understood it; he was doing his duty
as he understood it,'' Sullivan said. ``If he didn't, then there
could be death resulting to the people he worked with and dangers
resulting to the United States.''
   ``The need for secrecy is no excuse for lying to Congress,''
Keker told the jury. ``Lying to Congress is a crime.''
   ``You don't have to be a political scientist to understand why
that's so,'' Keker said. ``Congress enacts the law, the president
approves it and enforces it. If they start lying to eachother our
system of government is not going to work.''
   A year after it passed the 1984 Boland Amendment banning U.S.
military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, Congress received
news reports that North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel, was
secretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries and
private donors and providing tactical military advice.
   North and his boss at the time, national security adviser Robert
McFarlane, ``decided they didn't want Congress to know what Colonel
North had been doing. They decided they would not tell Congress,''
Keker said. ``They decided they would place themselves above the law
and not tell Congress about Colonel North's activities.''
   Similar inquiries a year later were met with false answers from
North, including a meeting with the House Intelligence Committee at
the White House when the National Security Council aide ``looked
them right in the eye and he lied,'' Keker said.
   He said North pocketed some of the travelers checks a Contra
leader gave to him to cover expenses incurred helping the rebels.
   ``Colonel North used that $4,000 like it was his personal piggy
bank'' to buy groceries, tires and take his family on a trip,''
Keker said.
   North also accepted installation of a security fence around his
Great Falls, Va., house from arms dealer Richard V. Secord, who had
helped sell U.S. arms to Iran and divert $15 million in profits to
buy weapons for the Contras, the prosecutor said.
   The arms-for-hostages deals with Iran were kept secret from
Congress until October 1986, when ``the roof caved in on this house
of cards'' with public disclosures about the Iran-Contra affair, he
said.
   When North went to his office on Nov. 21, 1986, ``the first thing
he did was take some of the records and change them to make it look
like what he had been doing he hadn't been doing for the last two
years,'' Keker said.
   ``He wanted to hide that he had already twice lied to the
Congress of the United States,'' Keker said, and also wanted to hide
that he and others ``had diverted money from the Iranian arms sales
to help the Contras.''
   ``He went into his office and began to change the records, shred
the records, destroy the records,'' Keker told jurors. Two days
later, when he lied to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, ``he
had placed himself above the law again.''
   North sat raptly at attention as Keker spoke, occasionally taking
notes.
   North's wife, Betsy, was escorted to her seat in the packed
courtroom by security guards midway through Keker's opening
statement.
   Some 100 lawyers, reporters and members of the public began
lining up outside the courtroom for opening arguments in the
long-awaited trial.
   The crush of spectators prompted court officials to announce that
only 15 seats would be set aside for the public, including some
aides to independant counsel Lawrence Walsh who were hoping to
observe the proceedings from the audience.
   The defense contends that Reagan was personally involved in
offering inducements to third countries to support the Contras
opposing the leftist government in Nicaragua, and that Reagan and a
handful of top administration officials then directed a cover-up of
the arrangement.
   If North hid the arrangement from Congress, Sullivan suggested in
court filings last week, it was because he was directed to do so by
the president and his aides.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has spent much of the 11
months since North was indicted wrestling with problems stemming
from balancing the use of classified material against North's right
to a fair defense.
   National security concerns by the Reagan administration led to
the dropping of the two central charges against North. The trial was
delayed last week due to fears by U.S. intelligence agencies that
North would be allowed to spill out in the courtroom a mass of
classified material damaging to the national security.
   In a tartly worded opinion issued in December, Gesell accused the
defense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitive
classified information to scuttle the case.
   The judge rejected a Justice Department request for more
stringent controls over state secrets that North wants to present in
his defense. The next day, as a jury was being chosen, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh launched efforts to get the trial delayed,
setting off a complex fight with independent counsel Walsh, who
wanted the case to go forward immediately.
   Thornburgh got the assurances he was seeking last Wednesday and a
Supreme Court stay that had delayed the trial was lifted.
   Through it all, the jury selected in the case waited to be called
by Gesell.
   The nine women and three men jurors chosen Feb. 9 have one thing
in common: They had almost no exposure to North's nationally
televised congressional testimony in 1987 in which he admitted,
under limited immunity from prosecution, many details touching on
the events that led to the criminal charges against him.
   The jurors include an electronics technician, a cashier, a clerk
typist at the Labor Department, a clerical worker who says ``I don't
like the news'' and an unemployed former office manager who says she
recalled that North was ``selling something to Iran.''
   North faces 12 criminal charges. Indicted last March, he is the
first figure in the Iran-Contra affair to come to trial. He could
face up to 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines if convicted
on all counts.
   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and arms
supplier Albert Hakim also face criminal charges in the case, but,
along with Secord, are to be tried separately later.
   Gesell dismissed two central charges against North on Jan. 13 _
conspiracy and theft counts that accused North of diverting more
than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   U.S. intelligence agencies feared damage to national security and
as a result Walsh asked to have those two counts thrown out.

   A. I think Sam Nunn would be the first to deny that.
   I think he's been fair and have so stated before.

   None.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Tougher Pension Plan Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told federal judges to
be tougher in second-guessing decisions by pension and welfare plans
that deny benefits to workers.
   In ruling unanimously in a case involving the Firestone Tire &amp;
Rubber Co., the justices said federal judges must evaluate such
cases just as if the pension and welfare plan officials had not yet
made any decision.
   Some federal courts instead have been employing a less stringent
standard of review _ generally not disturbing decisions by plan
officials unless they are found to be ``arbitrary or capricious.''
   The dispute ruled on today stemmed from Firestone's selling its
plastics division in 1980 to Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   The sale affected some 500 workers at Firestone plants in
Pottstown, Pa.; West Caldwell, N.J.; Perryville and Salisbury, Md.;
and Baton Rouge, La.
   Nearly all the workers were given the opportunity to keep their
jobs under the new ownership, and most accepted.
   Some workers sought certain benefits from Firestone, including
early retirement and severance pay, that were included in the three
Firestone welfare and pension plans.
   The company denied the benefits. It also refused to release
information about the benefit plans to workers who sought it, on
grounds that the workers no longer were employed by Firestone and no
longer participants in the plans.
   The workers sued, charging Firestone with violating the federal
Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that Firestone did not
act in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the suit.
The appeals court said workers' claims must be examined more closely
in such cases. Writing for the Supreme Court today, Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor said the appeals court was right.
   O'Connor said the more stringent standard of judicial review
should apply unless the plan gives its administrator or other
officials ``the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for
benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.''
   The justices told the 3rd Circuit court to restudy the issue of
whether the workers seeking information about the welfare and
pension plans from Firestone qualify as ``participants'' who are
entitled under ERISA to such information.
   The case is Firestone vs. Bruch, 87-1054.

   Local officials welcomed a plan taking
effect today to arrest unqualified applicants for political asylum,
but advocates for Central American immigrants criticized it as
``mean-spirited.''
   While more than 100 immigrants lined up today to apply for
political asylum, six people, including three nuns, began a fast
outside the detention facility in protest of the new Immigration and
Naturalization Service policy.
   ``We don't plan to finish this fast until we have a specific
answer'' from the U.S. government, said Jose Amaya, a Salvadoran
resident-alien.
   Amaya said the group was demanding refugee status for Salvadoran
aliens and an end to U.S. military aid to their country. Their
protest was in front of the INS' Port Isabel Service Processing
Center, a 315-acre detention facility 15 miles northeast of
Brownsville where asylum applications are taken.
   On Monday, Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the INS office here,
said the federal agency will speed up its processing of asylum
applications and take a tough line on ``frivolous'' claims.
   For months, local elected officials have called on the federal
government to relieve the burden placed on their communities by
homeless Central Americans.
   ``From the standpoint of the city, I think it will be good in
terms of taking people and providing for them in a humanitarian
way,'' said Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza, whose city is Texas'
southernmost.
   The INS plan, which will take several weeks to phase in, will
bring more than 500 federal workers to the Brownsville area. The
agency will add 269 people to its 375-member Border Patrol between
Del Rio and Brownsville, a stretch of more than 300 miles. It also
will increase its staff of asylum adjudicators in Brownsville from
16 to 74.
   Immigrants who apply for asylum but don't qualify will be placed
in detention centers. If necessary, the INS will build a tent city
capable of holding up to 5,000 detainees, officials said.
   Harlingen Mayor Bill Card, whose city on Feb. 10 evicted the INS
from its asylum-processing office over alleged health and safety
violations, described the plan as a ``good initial first step.''
   But advocates for the immigrants decried the plan.
   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez said a lengthy
appeals process, a shortage of qualified attorneys and clogged
immigration court dockets will mean lengthy detention for many under
the new procedure.
   ``I think we're going to see detention (for) years,'' said Ms.
Yanez.
   A group called the Brownsville Ad Hoc Refugee Committee
criticized the new policy as a ``mean-spirited attempt to deter
political refugees from applying for political asylum.''
   Several local churches helped provide bus tickets for Central
Americans who had until midnight Monday to leave the area legally,
said Mervin Mosbacker Sr. of Church World Service, a non-profit
interdenominational relief group.
   Since Jan. 9, the INS has been prohibited by a court order from
restricting the travel of asylum seekers, many of whom go to
California or Florida. The restraining order expired today.
   The adjudication and detention plan announced Monday could not
have been implemented had the order been in place.
   Nelson said he hoped the plan would slow the wave of immigration
he said threatened to ``empty out'' Central America.
   ``We think people (will) realize in Central America that it's not
worth spending your life savings to pay a smuggler to get you into
the United States because you will not get to stay and work here if
you do not have a legal basis to come,'' he said.
   Those denied under the new plan will be placed in deportation
proceedings, held in INS custody and will appear before immigration
judges, where they may resubmit asylum cases.
   Previously, Central Americans who were denied asylum were given
30 days to leave the country.
   Single adults will be held in INS detention centers, Nelson said.
The INS will put family groups and unaccompanied minors under less
restrictive custody in shelters operated by the Justice Department's
Community Relations Service, where they must report for daily roll
calls.
   Detention facilities listed in the plan include 1,100 beds at the
INS' Port Isabel Service Processing Center, 200 in Laredo and 200 in
El Paso.
   Nelson said a tent camp might be built for up to 5,000 people at
the Port Isabel center if the population continues to accumulate.
   At the current rate, the INS estimates that 100,000 Central
Americans this year would pass through the Brownsville area, the
main entry point for asylum seekers from that region.
   In the recent past, the U.S. has provided political asylum to
Nicaraguans in particular, but the INS maintains that most Central
American immigrants do not qualify because they are seeking better
economic conditions rather than fleeing political persecution.

   Three people, including one connected with a
neo-fascist terrorist group, were arrested with explosives they
apparently planned to use in a jail break, police said Tuesday.
   Francesco Tamponi, Luca Onesti and Anna Casu were arrested
Saturday in Rome and charged with criminal association and
possession and transport of explosives, police told a news
conference.
   ``A breakout of notable importance has been avoided,'' said Col.
Italo Leopizzi. ``These arrests are the result of four months of
anti-terrorist surveillance.''
   Police arrested Tamponi, 24, and Casu, 27, as they were on their
way to Rebibbia prison, on Rome's outskirts, where Tamponi's
brother, Giovanni, is serving a life sentence for armed robbery and
double homicide.
   Police believe the group planned to use the explosives to free
criminals with right-wing sympathies from Rebibbia. They found
nearly one pound of explosive in powder form, six detonators and 16
feet of slow-burning fuses.
   Onesti, 33, was arrested in 1981, during Italy's strict
anti-terrorism laws, for suspected links to the right-wing Armed
Revolutionary Nucleus terror group. He finally was released without
charge in 1985.

<HEAD>Child-Molesting Teacher Surprised He Got Away With It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted child molester who taught at a
Cherokee Indian school for 14 years said today in videotaped
testimony to Congress that he was surprised he was able to continue
the illicit activity for so long.
   ``This is strictly hindsight. Looking back, it certainly is a
phenomenon that's hard to understand,'' said Paul Wade Price, who is
serving a 10-year sentence in Butner Federal Correctional
Institution in Butner, N.C.
   Price pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation. But in
the tape he admitted for the first time that he had abused at least
25 boys while he taught at the Cherokee school in western North
Carolina.
   Under questioning by Ken Bellen, counsel to a special
investigative unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs,
Price said no one ever tried to stop him even though he believed
that they knew of his sexual activity with the boys.
   Price's testimony came as the committee began its third week of
hearings into corruption of various kinds on the nation's Indian
reservations.
   A former supervisor of Price testified that he was instrumental
in having Price removed from his division as a seventh-grade teacher
at Western Carolina University's campus lab school in 1971. Arthur
Justice, then director of the lab school, had a son who was in the
seventh grade at the school when Price taught there.
   Justice said that his son told him of cases of sexual molestation
by Price with other seventh-graders on an overnight camping trip.
Justice said he told the school superintendent about the incident
and the superintendent waited until the end of the year to dismiss
Price.
   Justice said that when he found out that Price was teaching at
the Bureau of Indian Affairs school on the Cherokee reservation he
wrote a letter to the school principal and warned him about Price.
However, Price was not dismissed until 14 years later.
   Justice said that while all 50 states have child abuse-reporting
laws the federal government does not.
   In 1974, Congress required states to enact such laws as a
requirement for receiving federal aid.
   Justice, who has had experience in enforcing these laws, said
``even a suspicion'' of child abuse must be reported and a follow-up
investigation must be conducted within 24 hours.
   ``I strongly believe there needs to be some federal
legislation,'' he said. He said there is no federal law to stop
Price from going to another Indian school and committing the same
crime again.
   At the close of his testimony, Price said:
   ``I've had time, of course, in prison to reflect over this and
the seriousness of it. Fondling is, you know, in my mind, I was
thinking, it really doesn't hurt anybody. But I know now how much it
does hurt. We just must find a way to help the children first _ and
of course the molesters also _ above all, the children, who really
don't know what they're getting into.''

   A. Well, I hope so.
   But certainly in Washington we have a responsibility, it's a
federal city, and a lot of the funds come _ obviously come from the
federal government.
   But, there isn't any easy answer to that, and yet I, you know,
campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law, on being tough on
criminals, on more prison space.
   And I think that those things all will be caught up in our new
anti-drug effort that I'm looking to Bill Bennett to lead.
   And so it's a complicated problem where everybody in the country
has a stake in it.
   Everybody should be trying to do something about it.
   And yes, I think the federal government has a role in that.
   Q. If I may follow. Is there any federal money for it? Is this
something that you really do not have the resources to attack?
   A. Yes, there will be federal money and I wish we had more.
   Yeah, Charles.
   Q. Mr. President!
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. How far do we go to be democratic, here?
   No that's too far _ here. (Laughter).
   Q. Mr. President, you said in answer to Helen's question that you
wanted your first step in the Middle East to be prudent. What do you
mean by a prudent step? What do you have in mind?
   A. What I have in mind is I don't want to just send somebody
charging off on a mission to counter Mr. Shevardnadze's trip to see
Mubarak and others.
   Let's do something that's going to hopefully have results.
   And I'm not saying we have to know that a trip by the secretary,
or a trip by _ instructions to an ambassador are going to result in
a settled policy _ everything's settled in the Middle East.
   But, I don't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet
foreign minister takes a trip to the Middle East.
   So it's _ in my view, that's a good thing.
   Q. What role do you think Mr. Shevardnadze and the Soviets could
and should be playing?
   A. I think it should be a limited role, and I think that's what
it's going to be.
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. And that's exactly the way it should be and I think the people
in the Middle East feel that way.
   But the fact that he goes there really shouldn't be bad.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, if the West Germans _
   A. Viewed with alarm.
   Q. _ if the West Germans refuse to modernize short-range weapons,
will that hurt the alliance in the long run and perhaps result in
the denuclearization of Europe _
   A. Too hypothetical a question, Jerry, for me to answer.

   President Bush said Tuesday the federal
government has a responsibility to help curb an increase in
drug-related homicides in the nation's capital.
   ``We have a responsibility as a federal city ... but there isn't
any easy answer to that,'' he said in answer to a question at a news
conference.
   ``I campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law, on being tough
on criminals, on more prison space. I think all those things will be
caught up in our new anti-drug program. ... Yes, I think the federal
government has a role in it.''
   He said, ``There will be federal money and I wish we had more,''
but he did not elaborate.
   The District of Columbia has recorded 80 homicides so far this
year, compared with 51 by Feb.21 a year ago. The city's 372
homicides last year set a record for the city. About 80 percent of
the deaths were drug-related, according to a study released last
week.
   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, said last week
he was worried about the proliferation and use of firearms in
Washington and elsewhere but still wanted to be a president who
``protected the rights of people to have arms.''
   He said that states should enforce existing laws and that he
would strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic weapons. .
   ``It's hard, very hard to do, but that's my position and I'm not
going to change it,'' he said in an interview with several reporters
last Wednesday.
   ``Look at the laws on gun control, and you'll find where some of
the more stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are procured
there and weapons are used there. So, you're not going to get me to
do anything other than to say I'm very concerned about this.''
   The district has one of the nation's toughest gun laws.
   Dozens of states, as well as Congress, are considering measures
to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of
semiautomatic weapons.

   Representatives of 16 countries arrived Tuesday for
Emperor Hirohito's funeral, and concern for the safety of visiting
world leaders grew with the discovery of two homemade projectiles
near Tokyo's airport.
   The projectiles were in launchers aimed at the heavily guarded
airport, about 40 miles east of the city, and apparently were
planted by radicals opposed to Friday's state funeral, a police
official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a timer
also was found. He declined to say at what time it was set.
   Cargo traffic and flights through Narita International Airport
and Tokyo's domestic airport will be restricted this week, and
32,000 police have been mobilized in Tokyo.
   Officers were stationed at checkpoints throughout the city and
patrolled downtown neighborhoods. They also have searched homes
along the funeral route.
   Authorities say the massive police presence is justified by
Japan's small but active radical groups and by fears that
international terrorists could attack as visiting leader.
   Officials say representatives of 163 countries will attend the
funeral.
   Workers on Tuesday made final preparations at the funeral site in
a Tokyo park.
   Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito, and Empress Michiko met briefly
with Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and his wife, Tellervo, at the
Akasaka Palace. It was the royal couple's first meeting with foreign
dignitaries since Hirohito died Jan. 7.
   They are expected to meet other heads of state and visiting
royalty during the week.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is to meet with about 40 of the
55 heads of state who plan to attend the funeral, and Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno will meet about 90 foreign officials, the
Foreign Ministry says.
   Many of those talks will last less than half an hour, but
Takeshita plans longer meetings with President Bush and President
Francois Mitterrand of France.
   The diplomatic contacts began Tuesday with a meeting between
Deputy Foreign Minister Takakazu Kuriyama and his Soviet
counterpart, Igor A. Rogachev.
   They discussed plans for talks in March on a peace treaty to
formally end World War II hostilities and settle a long-standing
territorial dispute involving Soviet-held islands, the Foreign
Ministry said.
   Foreign officials also will meet among themselves. British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe has scheduled talks with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to discuss Hong Kong's return to
Chinese control.
   Many Japanese proudly see the large number of countries attending
as a sign that Japan finally has been accepted internationally after
its disastrous role in World War II.
   But there were reminders of lingering ill feelings. In several
nations, including South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand and
Britain, there were disputes over who to send to the funeral because
of memories of the war, fought in Hirohito's name.
   Japanese who oppose the state funeral, including radicals, say
Hirohito led Japan into World War II and failed to stop the
oppressive actions of the militarist government of the time.
   Japan's Parliament adjourned Monday until after the funeral,
giving Takeshita a respite from criticism at home over an
embarrassing stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken his
governing Liberal Democratic Party. Three Cabinet members have
resigned in connection with the scandal.

   Elections officials cracked seals on voting
machines today and confirmed that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard
David Duke won a seat in the Lousiana Legislature by a 227-vote
margin.
   ``We were very careful,'' said Sam Altobello, registrar of voters
for Jefferson Parish in the New Orleans suburb.
   The official count from Saturday's special election was taken to
the courthouse, where the numbers will be shipped by special courier
to Baton Rouge in time for the opening of a special legislative
session Wednesday.
   However, Duke's opponents were checking possible ways to block
his taking office at the outset of the session.
   State Rep. Odon Bacque, a freshman legislator, said he plans to
challenge the seating of Duke when he is to be sworn in.
   Bacque, the only registered independent member in the House, said
he will challenge Duke's seating on grounds that Duke did not live
in the district for a year as required by law.
   Duke has maintained that he did live in the district and on
Sunday dismissed further questions about it as frivolous.
   Duke, 38, defeated homebuilder John Treen, 63, in Saturday's
election for a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives
despite endorsements for Treen by President Bush, former President
Reagan and the most powerful political figures in the suburban New
Orleans area. Both candidates were registered as Republicans.

   President Bush's journey to Japan will take him
inexorably down a path of war memories punctuated by visions of
being shot down at sea and losing two Navy buddies in combat.
   But if attending Emperor Hirohito's funeral on Friday presents a
painful reminder of the war with Japan, Bush isn't saying so.
   ``I'm doing what's right,'' he said recently.
   Bush, a former Navy aviator whose plane was shot down over the
Pacific by the Japanese in 1944, said, ``We have a good relationship
with Japan. I want to see it even better. And this doesn't concern
me a bit. And you're talking to a person who was in combat in World
War II. I feel you look ahead, not always look back. You do what's
right.
   ``It's the right thing to do.''
   Bush visited Japan twice as vice president, in 1982 and 1984.
   In his 1987 autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush shows little
reluctance to talk about what happened Sept. 2, 1944.
   The young Navy officer and two other crew members _ gunnery
officer William G. ``Ted'' White and radioman-tailgunner Jack
Delaney _ had taken off in a TBM Avenger on a mission to knock out a
Japanese radio facility on Chichi Jima, one of three islands in the
Bonin chain about 600 miles from Tokyo.
   Bush described in graphic detail how his plane was blown from the
sky and how he managed to ride a torn parachute to the water,
ultimately to be picked up by a Navy rescue ship, the USS Finback.
   As he neared the water, Bush wrote, ``I looked around for Delaney
and White, but the only thing in sight was my parachute drfiting
away.''
   Bush wrote about the letter he sent his parents six days after
his rescue, in which he ``described my feelings at the time.''
   ``I try to think about it as little as possible,'' he wrote in
the book. ``Yet, I cannot get those two out of my mind. ... I know I
won't be able to shake the memory of this incident and I don't
believe I want to completely.''
   Two days before his inauguration Jan. 20, Bush was reunited with
about three dozen of his war buddies, hosting a nostaligic party for
surviving fellow pilots, radiomen and gunners and sharing
remembrances with them.
   In a recent telephone interview from his home in Rogers, Ark.,
Don Kohler, the submarine torpedoman who helped pull Bush from his
bobbing life raft, said, ``I think he feels the need to go there for
the total relationship between their country and our country.
They're a major entity in the world economy.''
   Kohler, who is 64, like Bush, said he shares the president's view
that ``you should forgive and forget. ... I don't know what part
Hirohito had in running the country into war, but, believe me, I
think most people in Japan today want to forget about the war.''
   Kohler added, ``I know there are other people'' in the United
States ``who have strong feelings the other way.''
   Former Sen. Jeremiah Denton, R-Ala., who was a North Vietnamese
prisoner of war for eight years, described Bush as ``a giant of a
man'' who wants to avoid showing any feeling of vindictiveness
toward the Japanese.
   Bush is traveling to Japan with an interest in ``the commonality
of humankind'' and ``with altruism toward his fellow man,'' Denton
said in a telephone interview.
   ``He seems to understand the Japanese people and the Japanese
people understand him,'' said Denton.
   Denton said that while he has not returned to Vietnam, he
believes that Americans caught in wars seldom hold lingering
bitterness toward the people of a nation that has warred against the
United States.
   ``I feel very lovingly frustrated toward the people of Vietnam,''
he said.
   A presidential scholar at the University of Virginia, Larry
Sabato, said that Bush ``is in the noblesse oblige tradition and
part of noblesse oblige is sublimating oneself to the common good.''
   ``My personal feeling is that if he does have lingering
bitterness; he's suppressed it,'' Sabato said. ``He's going to be
busy having meetings with world leaders. He really won't have that
much time to concentrate on the personal aspect of it. He'll be so
busy that I don't think he'll have much time for personal
reflection.''

   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, entered Edgehill Newport in Rhode Island on
Feb. 6. Most patients undergo a 28-day rehabilitation program
followed by three days of observation on the premises.
   Dukakis attributed his wife's excessive drinking to ``physical

   Pianist Leonid Vintskevich and saxophonist
Lembit Saarsalu, two of the top Soviet jazz musicians, will give
their first North American performances this week at the Lionel
Hampton Jazz Festival.
   Festival director Lynn Skinner said it has taken two years to
obtain the Soviet government's permission and clear all the
diplomatic hurdles for the two to come to the event sponsored by the
University of Idaho's School of Music.
   The 22nd annual festival begins its three-day run Thursday and
will feature performances by the Soviet jazzmen at each night's
featured concert.
   ``They don't speak any English, but they speak the language of
jazz,'' Skinner said. ``The recordings they've sent us have been the
very finest you could imagine in terms of performance skills.''
   Although Saarsalu lives in Estonia and Vintskevich several
hundred miles away in Kursch, they have played a number of concerts
together in the Soviet Union and have teamed up at European jazz
festivals, Skinner said.
   They'll get a chance to play at the festival with Hampton and his
New York Big Band, along with other American jazz greats such as
trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, saxophonist Stan Getz, vocalist Carmen
McRae and guitarist Kenny Burrell.

   Fulbright, 84, of Arkansas, will be honored for establishing the

foundation president Yannis Georgakis.
   An Onassis prize will go to Lovins, 41, for ``his notable

   Q. Mr. President, I'll ask you a Japan question _
   A. Shoot. (Laughter.)
   Q. _ with the summit starting tomorrow. How do you reasssure
those Americans who are afraid of Japanese economic power, who think
that they are buying and are owning too much of the United States
economy?
   A. I tell them that the Japanese have the _ are the third largest
holder of investment in the United States, behind the UK and the
Netherlands.
   I tell them that it is important, if we believe in open markets,
that people be allowed to invest here, just as I'd like to see more
openness for American investors in other countries.
   I tell them that we have to do a better job in knocking down
barriers to American products in the various markets.
   I tell them, don't get so concerned over foreign ownership that
you undermine the securities markets in this country.
   We have horrendous deficits, and foreign capital joins domestic
capital in financing those deficits.
   So I also tell them I have a responsibility as president in terms
of our technology, in terms of our national security, and I intend
to exercise that responsibility.
   Gerry?
   Q. Yes, Mr. President, I think what concerns some people about
Senator Tower is the fact that he has admitted that he had a
drinking problem in the '70s, and he hasn't really had any kind of
treatment program or been enrolled in any kind of treatment program.
What do you say to people about the potential of a relapse?
   A. I say that he _ that there is no evidence of any kind of the
disease alcoholism _ none, none whatsoever.
   And that would be something that would be _ that your question is
addressed to.
   And I'd say that I looked at the reports with this in mind, and I
didn't listen to rumors.
   I didn't listen to mindless allegations.
   I was fair enough to look at the facts.
   And I've known Senator Tower, and known him professionally, and
known him as a friend.
   And I do not think that these charges that are tried and then
shot down, and then tried again and then shot down again, have
helped the process.
   And so I am not about to make a judgment on some rumor or some
innuendo.
   And we've looked at the facts.
   And I think the report speaks to the fact that a lot of the
charges _ most _ oh, I'd say all of these charges that we've read
about _ have been rumor, and a lot of it vicious rumor.
   And so I am convinced that he is not only capable of doing this
job, but will do it in an outstanding way.
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. How many more have we got?
   Q. On the budget _
   A. Who is that voice I hear in the back?
   Could it be Sarah McClendon?
   Q. No!
   A. Well, sorry. It's a democracy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Limits Damages in Georgia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case involving alleged
fraud in a 20-year-old business merger, today limited the ability of
people to seek additional damages after winning a lawsuit.
   The 9-0 ruling in a case from Georgia restricts the ability of
purported fraud victims to sue a leading accounting firm.
   The case arose out of the 1969 merger of Cavalier Bag Co. and
E.T. Barwick Industries Inc.
   The owners of Cavalier Bag _ Myles, Guy-Kenneth and Robert
Osterneck _ charged in a 1975 lawsuit that the financial health of
Barwick Industries was overstated.
   The Osternecks sued Barwick officials and Ernst &amp; Whinney, an
accounting firm that had prepared the allegedly inflated financial
statements.
   After nearly 10 years of pre-trial maneuvering, the case went to
trial in 1984 and the Barwick company and its offficials were
ordered to pay the Osternecks more than $2.6 million in damages plus
$946,000 in interest.
   But the Osternecks lost their case against Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   They then appealed, seeking to revive the case against the
accounting firm. That appeal was filed at the same time that the
Osternecks' request for interest payments against the Barwick
officials was pending in court.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Osternecks'
bid for damages against the accounting firm must be treated as a
motion to amend the original judgment that the Osternecks had won.
   Therefore, the appeals court barred the Osternecks from pursuing
a separate appeal against Ernst &amp; Whinney while at the same time
they were seeking additional interest payments against the Barwick
officials.
   The Supreme Court today upheld the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said handling
appeals in this manner helps avoid piecemeal appellate court review
of lower court judgments.
   The case is Osterneck vs. Ernst &amp; Whinney. 87-1201.

<HEAD>Court Gives Lawyers Extra Fee in Louisiana Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court today gave lawyers
added incentive _ the possibility of bigger-than-bargained-for legal
fees _ to represent those who claim their civil rights were violated.
   The court ruled in a Louisiana case that the losing side in some
civil rights lawsuits may be forced to pay the winning side's
lawyers more than the lawyers originally had sought.
   The normal rule in U.S. courts is that each side pays its own
lawyers. But Congress has altered that rule in about 200
fee-shifting laws, and allowed the winning side to collect its
lawyer fees from the losing side.
   Most notably, such fee awards are available to people who
successfully sue over civil rights violations.
   Arthur J. Blanchard, who said he was assaulted without
provocation by a St. Martin Parish sheriff's deputy, James Bergeron,
was awarded $10,000 in damages by a federal jury.
   The presiding judge also awarded Blanchard $7,500 in lawyer fees,
which Bergeron was ordered to pay.
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reduced the lawyer-fee
award to $4,000 after noting that Blanchard and his lawyer had a
contingency-fee agreement in which the lawyer was to get 40 percent
of any damage award.
   The appeals court said the 40 percent contingency agreement
effectively placed a cap on any lawyer-fee award that could be made.
   Writing for the Supreme Court today, Justice Byron R. White said
no such cap exists.
   ``If a contingent fee agreement were to govern as a strict
limitation on the award of attorney's fees, an undesirable emphasis
might be placed on the importance of the recovery of damages in
civil rights litigation,'' White said.
   ``The intention of Congress,'' he said, ``was to encourage
successful civil rights litigation, not to create a special
incentive to prove damages and shortchange efforts to seek effective
injunctive or declaratory relief.''
   The justices told the 5th Circuit court to reconsider its
lawyer-fee award ruling in Blanchard's case.
   The case is Blanchard vs. Bergeron, 87-1485.

<TEXT>
   President Bush met with congressional leaders
today in an effort to propel budget talks forward, but a top House
budget writer said details on ``tough choices'' were still missing.
   Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the hour-long breakfast session at the White House
dealt more with process than with details of the $1.16 trillion
spending plan.
   ``It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track.
And we are,'' Panetta told reporters after the meeting.
   But, he added. ``When does he (Bush) start to make the tough
choices? That's part of the process here, to find out what the
choices are.''
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the meeting
``was not a discussion about details'' but an effort ``to discuss
how we might proceed in the future, to discuss the process.''
   The session included Democratic and Republican leaders from both
houses as well as heads of the congressional budget, appropriations
and tax-writing committees.
   Seated at the center of one side of the long rectangular table in
the Cabinet Room, the president refused to answer reporters'
questions during a brief photo-taking session.
   Bush has vowed to be an active player in shaping spending cuts
needed to get the government's annual budget deficit under the $100
billion required by law for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1.
   Congress faces an April 15 deadline for completion of its version
of the budget.
   Bush's participation in the budget-writing process is unusual in
that it comes less than two weeks after he submitted his proposed
$1.16 trillion spending plan, before any votes on spending decisions
have been held by committees in either chamber.
   ``It's a ratcheting-up of the process,'' presidential Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in advance of today's meeting.
   ``Its purpose is to keep the momentum going,'' said Fitzwater,
noting that it was Bush's first meeting with congressional leaders
since the president's address to a joint House-Senate session nearly
two weeks ago.
   Fitzwater said Bush hopes discussions will continue during his
absence, but that talk has not yet reached the negotiating stage.
``I'd say it's in the consultation and discussion stage,'' he said.
   White House budget director Richard Darman, meanwhile, opened two
days of testimony before the Senate and House budget committees with
a defense of Bush's spending plan as realistic. Leaving the details
of spending cuts for future negotiations was acknowledging where
those decisions would be made, he said.
   But Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee said they saw it as
a political ploy.
   ``I just don't see this as a serious initiative,'' said Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C. ``Where are the cuts going to come
from?'' said committee chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``We just don't
know from looking at the Bush budget.
   Democrats say Bush listed politically popular initiatives on
child care, education, and homelessness but did not list the
approximately $10 billion in cuts that must be made in other
programs to pay for the increases _ leaving those unpopular choices
to share with Congress.
   Fitzwater counters that ``some 800 pages of details'' have been
made available to Congress in addition to the 193-page budget
document that Bush submitted on Feb. 9.
   ``They contain a number of policy options,'' he said, ``but not
necessarily specific cuts. ... A number of various options.''
   When pressed Monday to say whether Bush had recommended budget
reductions in specific areas, Fitzwater replied, ``cuts that the
group might consider.''
   Indeed, papers obtained by The Associated Press show the
administration avoided in those documents putting its stamp on any
particular set of cuts. Options listed included adoption of former
President Reagan's budget choices, or freezing programs at last
year's levels without allowing for inflation.
   Blank spaces were left for final decisions, presumably to be
worked out in negotiations with Congress.
   The documents also suggest that the definition of a ``flexible
freeze'' is itself flexible and still being developed.
   The Bush budget released Feb. 9 defined the freeze as a package
of $136 billion in domestic programs held at this year's spending
levels, without inflation. Some of those could be increased, but
only if others were decreased to keep the total the same.
   The papers sent to Congress last week showed the $136 billion
included a small piece of the defense budget, about $6 billion,
earmarked for programs such as atomic research.
   Bush made three out-of-town speeches on his fiscal 1990 budget
proposal last week, capping the appearances with a declaration in
St. Louis last Friday that he wanted ``a quick and early resolution
to the budget crisis.''
   ``I am committed to working closely with my friends on the Hill
to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
law for an April 15 budget resolution,'' he said.
   That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a
deficit in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 of no more than $100
billion _ down from an estimated $160 billion this year. Failure by
Congress and the administration to meet that target could result in
automatic across-the-board cuts.
   In the proposal he submitted, which was intended to amend the
fiscal 1990 budget offered by Reagan in January, Bush said he wanted
to increase spending in a number of social areas.
   But Democrats have been pushing him to spell out where he would
make $10 billion to $11 billion in necessary cuts to pay for the
emphasis he wants to give certain programs, especially in view of
Bush's no-tax-increase pledge.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine suggested Monday
that Democrats will have their own agenda.
   Talking to reporters covering the AFL-CIO executive council
meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla., Mitchell said, for example, that it
was his intention to schedule early floor debate on legislation to
increase the minimum wage, which has been frozen at $3.35 an hour
since 1981.
   Mitchell said the Democrats' bill would not contain a sub-minimum
youth training wage that Bush has proposed. But the Maine Democrat
said it was possible the bill would be amended on the floor.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mildred Burke, a 20-year women's world
wrestling champion who attributed her success to her muscular build
and her alligator clutch hold, has died at age 73 after a stroke.
   Ms. Burke, who was 5-foot-2, 138 pounds in her wrestling prime,
had such a well-muscled build that the Police Department once
displayed her poster in its offices to shame its officers into
staying in shape.
   She died Saturday at Northridge Hospital. She suffered a stroke
Feb. 14.
   Ms. Burke, wrestling champion from 1936 to 1956, claimed to have
invented the alligator clutch, a pinning maneuver in which the
wrestler twists his opponent into something resembling a pretzel and
then sits on him.
   ``She was totally feminine,'' said her son, Joseph Wolfe of
Canoga Park. ``More than anything else, she stressed being very
feminine and a loving mother.''
   She claimed to have won more than 150 matches against men and
more than 5,000 against women. She claimed to have never lost.
   ``I've had two or three girls say they beat me and I've
threatened to take them to court because they never even wrestled
me,'' she said in 1981.
   Born in Coffeyville, Kan., Ms. Burke started wrestling in 1935 on
the carnival circuit. She offered $25 to any man of similar weight
who could pin her within 10 minutes. It was reported that no one
ever did.
   She was listed in ``Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for doing 100
body bridges _ arching the body face up _ on the desk of Ripley's
editor.
   In her later years she operated a wrestling school in Encino.

<HEAD>Judge Increases Damages In 1978 French Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today recommended that Amoco Corp. be
ordered to pay about $115 million to France and nearly 90 French
citizens or businesses damaged by millions of gallons of oil spilled
in a 1978 supertanker accident.
   Retired U.S. District Judge Frank McGarr, sitting as a special
master, recommended an increase of about $30 million in his original
$85.2 million judgment against the oil company.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle will enter a final judgment.
   Virtually all parties to the case had asked McGarr to reconsider
his January 1988 decision, issued before his retirement as a federal
judge.
   Amoco and the French plaintiffs immediately indicated they were
likely to appeal today's ruling.
   ``A lot of people won't be happy. The recommendation is a mixed
bag. But the oyster growers, for one, will be pleased. They're in
line for the biggest revision,'' said attorney Warren Marwedel, who
represented a number of oyster syndicates, two French regions and a
number of other plaintiffs affected by the spill from the Amoco
Cadiz supertanker.
   ``It's a very conservative, traditional opinion,'' Marwedel said.
``Things like the loss of enjoyment and environmental claims were
not given the consideration we had sought.''
   Amoco attorney Franck Cicero said the company was pleased with
McGarr's recommendation.
   `If you look at the total awarded so far, they've only got about
3 percent of what they originally claimed,'' Cicero said. ``The
judge indicated again he thought they were overreaching and there
were some duplicate claims.''
   Cicero said Amoco is proceeding with litigation against the
Spanish builder of the Amoco Cadiz, Astilleros Espanoles S.A.
   The Amoco Cadiz ran aground two miles off the Brittany coast
March 16, 1978. The huge tanker, which had lost the use of its
rudder, had been under tow through the English Channel by a
German-owned tug when the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds
and heavy seas.
   The Liberian-registered supertanker carried 223,000 tons, or 68
million gallons, of mostly Iranian light crude oil valued at $24
million. The spill, the largest ever from a tanker, caused an oil
slick more than 10 miles across and 80 miles long.
   The plaintiffs include more than 90 villages from France's
Brittany coast, groups of oystermen and fishermen, property owners
and environmentalists. They had initially sought more than $1.1
billion in damages.

   Anglers who find nothing appealing about the
great outdoors when their catch comes up short will be able to tip
the scales in their favor with a new device: fax machines.
   Beginning in May, fishermen on Lake Michigan will be able to use
fax machines to receive the latest weather satellite maps.
   The maps will tell where the cold water meets warm water, which
is where steelhead trout swim, said Allen Miller, a spokesman for
the project of the Sea Grant Institute at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
   ``The change in temperatures and water coming up from lower
depths tends to concentrate bait fish and insects, which in turn
attracts the trout,'' Miller said.
   Satellites send information, including the surface water
temperature, to a receiver in Wallops Island, Va. The information is
relayed to the university by another satellite.

   The campus may be dull and brown these
days, but 60 tons of manmade snow will give prospective students a
different view of Williams College.
   Because of a snowless winter in the Berkshires, the college
Monday trucked in the snow for photographs for a Williams
promotional brochure.
   ``We're not faking anything,'' Philip F. Smith, director of
admissions, said as workers spread the white stuff from a nearby ski
area in front of a dormitory and the geology building. ``We are just
hoping to get some good winter shots.''
   Student models posed amid the manmade drifts. About 30,000 copies
of the brochure are mailed to high school students each year.
   By late Tuesday morning, only a ``lump or two'' of the imported
snow was left. The campus was soggy under a spring-like rain and
temperatures were expected to reach the unseasonable 50s, said
spokeswoman Ellen Barek.
   The northern Berkshire Mountains, which normally receive 50 to 55
inches of snow by this time of year, have received only about 18
inches, said John Hockridge of the New England Weather Associates
office in nearby North Adams.
   ``We only get to redo this brochure once every five years,'' said
James Kolesar of the college's publicity office. ``To have a
brochure of Williams that did not have winter shots would be very
dishonest.''

<HEAD>Panel Told Nation Should Use Natural Gas, Develop Safe Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel was told Tuesday that the nation
should react to the greenhouse effect on global warming by using
natural gas instead of coal and by developing ``safe and publicly
acceptable'' nuclear power.
   Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of
Engineering, said these are among measures needed to prevent further
build-up of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for global
warming.
   White and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists still
do not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other human
activities will cause significant temperature changes, leading to
heat waves and drought.
   One witness, University of Virginia professor Patrick J.
Michaels, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee it would be
more prudent to await more study before making drastic policy
decisions.
   ``Our policy should be commensurate with the state of our
scientific knowledge,'' the professor of environmental sciences told
the energy and power subcommittee.
   Michaels said climate experts have a ``clouded vision'' of future
global warming, and added, ``basing sweeping environmental policy''
on such uncertainties ``is especially risky, even if the policy is
otherwise rational.''
   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in Earth's atmosphere
trap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, the
more heat.
   The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they
are to outgoing infrared energy.
   In addition to natural build-up, greenhouse gases have increased
because of human activities, including burning of fossil fuels,
coal, oil, and gas; and destruction of tropical rain forests.
   The problem comes in trying to predict what will happen in the
future. Projections are now made by scientists using mathematical
models that are only approximations of the real atmosphere.
   White told the panel not to wait for more study to take action,
suggesting, ``we can intervene through more efficient use of fossil
fuels and incentives to use those that contribute least to the
carbon dioxide building per thermal unit.
   ``For example, shifts from coal to natural gas, as well as
intensified efforts to develop no-fossil energy sources such as
passively safe and publicly acceptable nuclear power are desirable.
   ``We can work with other nations to reduce tropical
deforestation. These actions should slow the climate warming.''
   Dr. Stephen Schneider, a scientist for the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., agreed with White that
action was needed now as ``insurance against catastrophic change.''
   ``It's a question of what kind of risks do you want to take with
the planet,'' he said.
   Dr. Daniel L. Albritton, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said even after more is learned about the greenhouse
effect on global warming, lawmakers still might not be able to learn
how the trend would affect their own regions.
   The National Academy of Engineering is a private organization
created by the National Academy of Sciences.

<HEAD>Jurors' Identities In Mob Case Will Not Be Kept Secret</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that the jurors
selected to try mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and eight
associates in a 1985 rubout will be sequestered, but their names
will not be kept secret.
   The 59-year-old Scarfo and his co-defendants are accused of
plotting and carrying out the slaying of Frank ``Frankie Flowers''
D'Alfonso, who was gunned down on a street near his home.
   Detectives said D'Alfonso had showed ``disrespect'' to Scarfo by
joining a rival mob faction.
   Scarfo could be sentenced to death if convicted.
   He was convicted last year in a federal racketeering conspiracy
case of running the Philadelphia-South Jersey Mafia from his
Atlantic City home.
   Assistant District Attorney Charles Grant on Tuesday sought to
have the names and addresses of all prospective jurors kept
anonymous, but Common Pleas Judge Eugene Clark refused.
   ``He found no evidence that jurors would be threatened if their
identity was known,'' said Michael Pinsky, an attorney for one of
Scarfo's co-defendants.
   The judge ruled, however, that the 12 jurors and six alternates,
when chosen, will be sequestered in a hotel. Jury selection is
expected to take two weeks.
   Scarfo has been in jail since 1987 and is serving a 14-year
sentence for conspiring to extort $1 million from a developer. He
was acquitted in May of ordering the assassination of a rival and
awaits sentencing in the racketeering case.

   Here, at-a-glance, are highlights of the major
actions taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PORNOGRAPHY
   The court ruled that states may use anti-racketeering laws to
fight pornography, but invoked free-speech rights to ban the states
from seizing before trial the contents of adult bookstores.
   The justices said authorities unlawfully seized the contents of a
Fort Wayne, Ind., bookstore before any materials in the store were
judged obscene at a trial.
   But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors still may use
the state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenity case.
   The cases are Fort Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470, and
Sappenfield vs. Indiana, 87-614.
   
   RELIGIOUS BOOKS
   
   The court ruled that states may not give preferential treatment
to religious ublications by exempting them from sales taxes imposed
on other books, newspapers and magazines.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a now-defunct Texas statute
violated the Constitution. The decision presumably will force the
state to give sales tax refunds to non-religious publications or
impose the levy against religious organizations that were exempt.
   The case is Texas Monthly vs. Bullock, 87-1245.
   
   SUMMARY TRIALS
   
   The court let stand rulings that the public has no right to
attend the so-called ``summary jury trials'' held in some legal
disputes.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by newspapers
in three Ohio cities that trial judges should be barred from
conducting such proceedings in secret.
   The newspapers' lawyers had asked the high court to rule, for the
first time, that the Constitution provides a public right of access
to judicial proceedings in civil, or non-criminal, cases.
   The case is Cincinnati Post vs. GE, 88-813.
   
   EVANGELISTS
   
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart failed in his bid to kill a
$90 million lawsuit by a defrocked evangelist who Swaggart accused
of adultery in 1986.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Marvin
Gorman's suit against Swaggart and others unconstitutionally
entangles Louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine and
discipline.
   The cases are Swaggart vs. Adler, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. Gorman,
88-1058.
   
   FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
   
   The court refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a
Hollywood movie producer who hired actors to peform sex acts in a
pornographic film.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a California Supreme
Court ruling that Harold Freeman's conviction on charges of
procuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedom
of expression.
   The cases are California vs. Freeman, 88-1054, and Applegate vs.
Freeman, 88-1050.
   
   ABORTION
   
   The court allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law
that included provisions for parental notification.
   The justices, without comment, turned down an emergency request
by ``pro-choice'' advocates seeking to block the law until a federal
appeals court rules on its constitutionality.
   The case is Eubanks vs. Wilkinson, A-582.
   
   IRAN ASSETS
   
   The court agreed to referee a dispute between the U.S. government
and American businesses stemming from the 1981 settlement of the
Iran hostage crisis.
   The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recovering
money from Iran's government do not have to pay a portion of it to
the U.S. government.
   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.
   
   FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
   
   While agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants a
secret, the court voted to resolve a significant dispute over the
Freedom of Information Act.
   The justices said they will decide whether a government law
enforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor being
investigated for possible fraud certain documents received from
another agency.
   Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identity
of the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumably
to protect the contractor's reputation.
   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.
   
   ANIMAL DRUGS
   
   The court allowed the Food and Drug Administration to impose
strict controls on the use of drugs by veterinarians for
``experimental'' treatment of some animal diseases.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an Illinois
drug distributing company that the government wrongly is interfering
with treatment of serious animal illnesses. The FDA seized a large
quantity of drugs July 9, 1986, from Schuyler Laboratories Inc. in
Rushville, Ill.
   The case is 9@1 KG Containers vs. U.S., 88-614.

<HEAD>European Intellectuals Increasing Their Protests on Rushdie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's death sentence on novelist Salman Rushdie
has appalled European intellectuals and stung them into a concerted
protest that appears to be spreading throughout the non-Moslem world.
   ``We find ourselves caught up in a religious war,'' Edward
Mortimer, a British commentator, wrote Tuesday.
   In London, authors and free speech advocates announced they would
seek support for ``A World Statement'' to be published in newspapers
internationally.
   Expressions of disgust came from Mexican novelist Octavio Paz and
the Australian government. American writers led by PEN American
Center president Susan Sontag also have begun mobilizing, and
President Bush added his condemnation Tuesday.
   Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has been judged
blasphemous by Moslems because of its treatment of the prophet
Mohammed and the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Moslem protests began in Britain soon after the novel's
publication last fall, but their demonstrations and public
book-burnings were widely regarded as more as a curiosity than as a
threat.
   Then came last week's riots in Pakistan and India that claimed at
least six lives, followed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death
sentence on Rushdie and his publishers.
   Almost immediately, British playwright Harold Pinter led a group
of writers to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's doorstep to demand
action over ``an intolerable and barbaric state of affairs.''
   The British government's initial tactic apparently was to wait
and see whether an apology from Rushdie might lift the death threat.
Rushdie, who had gone into hiding, issued an apology Saturday for
causing offense to Islam. When that had no effect, the government
decided, with its European Economic Community partners, to get tough.
   On Monday the 12 EEC countries resolved to withdraw their envoys
from Iran. Non-EEC countries also took action. Sweden recalled its
ambassador, and the Austrian, Swiss and Finnish governments summoned
Iranian diplomats to express their condemnation.
   In France, the affair has dominated the headlines. Patrick
Marnham, a British writer and journalist in Paris, believes French
intellectuals have responded much more vigorously than their British
counterparts would have done if a French writer was under threat.
``They're really outraged,'' he said in an interview.
   After the book's French publisher suspended publication to
protect its employees from Khomeini's retribution, the weekly
l'Evenement du Jeudi proposed that French publishers put the book
out en masse and share responsibility. Nearly 20 publications and
publishing houses said they would participate.
   More than 500 authors belonging to the French section of the
international PEN club wrote to Prime Minister Michel Rocard
demanding action to ensure the book was published.
   In West Germany, writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger said a group of
authors, including internationally renowned Guenter Grass, had
agreed to explore ways of publishing ``The Satanic Verses'' after
its German publisher pulled out.
   Several Dutch newspapers and weeklies are to publish an ad signed
by some 850 intellectuals supporting Rushdie, and Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek has canceled a visit to Iran.
   The Irish Writers Union wrote to The Irish Times saying Ireland's
own history of religious censorship should rally its writers to
Rushdie's defense.
   Spanish novelist Juan Benet called the death threat ``savagery,''
and the Madrid newspaper El Pais quoted Octavio Paz as saying: ``It
seems incredible to me that in the 20th century a writer could be
sentenced to death for writing whatever he chooses.''
   The Norwegian and Danish authors' unions said they deplored the
death threat, and publishers in those countries said they would go
ahead with translations.
   Italian novelist Alberto Moravia denounced the death threat on
television, while in overwhelmingly Moslem Turkey, novelist Orhan
Pamuk published a newspaper article defending Rushdie's right to
free speech.
   ``If there is one thing that insults the Islamic countries, it is
the decision to announce a bounty for the muirder of the authors of
other countries and assign murderers to kill them,'' he wrote.
   Mortimer, writing in The Financial Times, said the real lesson of
the affair was its global nature, pitting Western concepts of
freedom against Islamic fundamentalism.
   ``Britain is no longer an island,'' he wrote. ``Nor is Europe for
that matter. And nor is North America.''

<HEAD>Bush Brands Iran's Death Decree Against Writer ``Deeply Offensive''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush condemned Iran's death decree
against British novelist Salman Rushdie as ``deeply offensive to the
norm of civilized behavior'' and warned on Tuesday that Tehran would
be held accountable for any actions against American interests.
   Bush said he strongly supports the decision of European
governments to recall their ambassadors and chief diplomats from
Iran in protest of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order for the
assassination of Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   On another matter, Bush said he was not concerned that Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's diplomatic trip to the Middle
East would diminish the U.S. role in the region.
   Asked what role Moscow should play in the Middle East, Bush said
emphatically, ``I think it should be a limited role and I think
that's what it's going to be.''
   Bush said he would not ``send somebody charging off on a mission
to counter Mr. Shevardnadze's trip.''
   The president made his comments at a hurriedly called news
conference at the White House on the eve of his departure for a
five-day Asian trip to attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in
Japan, followed by stops in China and South Korea.
   Bush used the opportunity to urge the Senate to ``move
forthrightly'' to approve the embattled nomination of John Tower as
secretary of defense after repeated allegations of womanizing,
excessive drinking and questions about Tower's relationship with
defense contractors.
   Bush said the allegations amounted to ``very unfair treatment of
this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again.'' The president
said a new FBI report, released Monday, ``gunned down'' the
allegations of misconduct.
   Saying Tower will be a good secretary of defense, Bush declared,
``I've never wavered in my support for John Tower.''
   Up until now, Bush has been silent on the worldwide controversy
over the ayatollah's death threat against Rushdie, an Indian-born
British citizen who now is hiding under police protection.
   Many Moslems say Rushdie's book portrays the prophet Mohammed's
wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than God _ wrote
the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Bush said that, ``however offensive that book may be, inciting
murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply
offensive to the norm of civilized behavior. ...
   ``In the light of Iran's incitement, should any action be taken
against American interests, the government of Iran can expect to be
held accountable,'' the president added.
   Asked if he hoped European nations impose economic sanctions
against Iran, as the United States did years ago, ``They will be
discussing that, I'm sure, but I don't know where we go from there.''
   A number of booksellers, including some of the nation's largest
chains, have taken ``The Satanic Verses'' off the shelves. Bush said
that stores should have ``protection of the law if they decide to go
ahead and sell a book of this nature.''
   He said ``we are in an open society. None of us like everything
that's written.''
   Meeting in Brussels on Monday, the 12 foreign ministers of the
European Community nations decided to withdraw diplomatic
representatives from Iran. On Tuesday, Iran announced it was
withdrawing its diplomats from European nations.
   Bush called the press conference to announce that second-term
Rep. Bill Grant of Florida was switching his registration from
Democratic to Republican.
   ``This is good news for our party not only in Florida, not only
in the South, but nationally,'' Bush said.
   Asked his views about another Republican, former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke, who was elected to a seat in the Louisiana House
of Representatives, Bush said his own attempt to keep Duke from
winning may have been viewed by some voters as ``improper or
overkill.''
   However, Bush said Duke's record is ``one of racism and bigotry
and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.''
   On other topics, Bush:
   _Said ``I'd like to find some way to do something'' about easy
access to automatic weapons. But the president, a strong opponent of
gun control, added that ``I want to be the president that protects
the rights of people to have arms.''
   _Tried to allay some fears that the Japanese own too much
American property. ``It is important if we believe in open markets
that people be allowed to invest here just as I'd like to see more
openness for American investors in other countries. ... We have to
do a better job of knocking down barriers to American products''
overseas, he said.
   _Declared ``I'm not ruling anything in or out'' on Star Wars, the
planned defense shield against nuclear missiles. Asked about budget
aide Richard Darman's statement that further Star Wars development
was conditional on the outcome of a 90-day review, Bush said, ``I'm
not going to close any doors or open any. ... We're going to have to
make some tough choices. ... Let's wait and see what the review
produces.''

<HEAD>50 Detainees Freed; Hunger Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government freed 50
detainees Tuesday after a hunger strike in two prisons was halted,
but at least 226 detainees still are fasting elsewhere, police and
lawyers said.
   Police said they have hospitalized 20 of the hunger strikers, who
are demanding they be freed or put on trial. Many have been held
without charge for more than two years.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament he signed
release warrants for 50 detainees.
   He said the hunger strikes were orchestrated outside prisons by
opposition groups seeking ``to discredit the South African
government.''
   ``Inside the prisons it is the work of a small group of
ringleaders _ hardened leftist activists _ who by means of cruel
intimidation control the group to such a degree that many detainees
are too afraid to break away,'' Vlok said.
   Veteran anti-apartheid legislator Helen Suzman said detainees
decided on their ``extremely dangerous course'' only after
exhausting all avenues for airing their grievances.
   ``By what criteria does the minister (Vlok) decide that people
must be kept away from the community?'' she asked. ``He should not
be worried about saving face, he should be worried about saving
lives.''
   Hunger strikes continued in the southern cities of Durban,
Pietermaritzburg and East London.
   Police said 20 hunger strikers in East London were hospitalized
Monday, four days after they began fasting with six fellow detainees.
   Civil rights lawyers said at least 200 detainees in Durban and
Pietermaritzburg have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks.
Vlok has agreed to meet lawyers for these detainees, but no date has
been set.
   The first hunger strike started Jan. 23 and involved nearly 300
detainees held without charge in Port Elizabeth and at Diepkloof
Prison outside Johannesburg. That strike was suspended last week
when Vlok promised to review detainees' cases and release ``a
substantial number.''
   Eight detainees were freed Friday.
   Vlok has been commended, even by anti-government leaders, for
agreeing to meet lawyers, parents and clergymen representing the
hunger strikers.
   However, anti-apartheid leader Rev. Frank Chikane said Monday
some detainees who recently quit their hunger strike could resume if
they are dissatisfied by the number of releases in the next two
weeks.
   Under the 32-month state of emergency, police can arrest anyone
they believe might endanger public safety. Vlok decides
periodically, based on reports from police officers, whether the
detainee should remain incarcerated.
   Monitoring groups have said more than 30,000 people, mostly
blacks, have been detained for some period of time during the
emergency. Vlok has never given a total figure, but he said earlier
this month there were fewer than 1,000 people in detention.
   On Tuesday, he said no youths under 16 were in detention. He said
there were 22 detainees who were 16 years old and 30 who were 17.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Helder Camara has turned
80, an age at which many clergymen slip quietly into retirement. But
the human rights crusader of the 1960s and 1970s remains an
outspoken defender of the poor at the request of Pope John Paul II.
   ``Following the pope's instructions, I will not hang up my
spikes,'' the Roman Catholic leader said.
   In accordance with church rules, Camara _ known worldwide as Dom
Helder, the Portuguese title for the high clergy _ had to retire at
75 as archbishop of Recife and Olinda on Brazil's northeast coast
but maintained his title.
   ``I'm as busy now as I ever was,'' said the short, slight
prelate, seeming even smaller in a voluminous khaki cassock adorned
with a simple wooden cross. The interview came amid a heavy schedule
of speeches and celebrations marking his 80th birthday Feb. 7.
   During a right-wing military regime in the world's largest
Catholic nation from 1964 to 1985, Camara denounced torture and
human rights abuses in the face of death threats and a machine-gun
attack on his parish house.
   The generals branded Camara the ``Red Bishop'' and banned his
name from news broadcasts. His supporters nominated him for the
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Those dark days have ended, but Brazil's chronic poverty persists
with the collusion of powerful economic interests, he says.
   ``The forces behind these conditions are well-known. Large
multinational corporations create great problems here,'' he said.
``The multinationals have very different attitudes in their own
countries from those they have in ours.''
   In 25 years as archbishop, Camara has condemned the
``exploitation'' of the Third World by the industrialized nations.
He also has criticized Communist powers for imposing their will on
smaller countries, but reserves his harshest words for his main
cause these days, land reform.
   ``It's a scandal,'' he said. ``How can 20 percent of the people
own 80 percent of the land in a country 34 times the size of
Germany?''
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 people _ mostly landless peasants _
have been killed in Brazil in rural property disputes.
   ``The church supports land reform, but it doesn't intend to be
political. No violence or radicalization,'' the archbishop said.
   Asked if he agreed with progressive clergymen who endorse land
invasions by the homeless, Camara paused. ``This business of
invasions is funny,'' he said. ``I laugh when these big landowners
say, `My land was invaded.' Where did they get it? Wasn't that an
invasion?''
   Camara said the pope also is ``very well informed'' about the
land reform issue. ``He thinks it's now possible to end this
scandal,'' he said.
   Although the pope has emphatically told priests to stay out of
politics and has punished radical Brazilian theologists, in 1980 he
met in Recife with Camara, then considered a ``non-person'' by the
military government.
   On live nationwide and international TV, John Paul embraced Dom
Helder and said, ``This man is a friend of the poor. He is my
friend.''
   Camara remembered that with emotion.
   ``The pope is greater than many people think,'' he said. ``He is
as great as John XXIII.'' That pontiff, who reigned from 1958-63,
was widely known for his warm, human character.
   The archbishop said he is not discouraged by the immense social
problems in this country of 144 million, where modern skyscrapers
exist side-by-side with miserable shantytowns, and where the World
Bank says the income distribution between the rich and the poor is
the most unfair in the world.
   ``One thing I learned from young people: When the problems are
absurd, the solutions become a passion,'' he said.

   A former general was named Tuesday to
replace the defense minister, who resigned and reportedly alleged
that government reluctance to end Sudan's southern civil war has
isolated the country.
   The independent newspaper Al-Ayam said Defense Minister
Abdel-Magid Khalil quit after returning from an unannounced visit to
Jordan and Iraq, where he apparently was refused new military and
financial aid.
   Information Minister Beshir Omar said Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi
named Salah Abdul-Salam defense minister. Abdul-Salam is a member of
the prime minister's Umma party. Khalil, who also was an army
general, is an independent.
   Omar said Mahdi canceled a trip to Japan to attend the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito because of the ``emergency circumstances.'' Vice
President Idris Banna and the five-member Supreme Council will
represent him at the funeral, the statement said.
   Another newspaper, Al-Adwa, said Khalil's letter of resignation
charged ``the foreign policy adopted by the government does not lead
to a unified internal front nor to stability, and has also led to
the isolation of the country both in the Arab and outside world.''
   It said government policies ``have weakened the country's ability
to acquire military and economic assistance.''
   The United States has urged an end to the nearly 6-year-old civil
war and said it would try to promote a peace settlement. Washington
has linked further U.S. aid to ending the war, and other friendly
Western and Arab donors say there is an urgent need to end the
fighting.
   John Garang, the U.S.-educated renegade colonel who leads the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, signed a peace plan Nov. 16 with
Mohammed Osman Mirghani, leader of Sudan's Democratic Unionist
Party. At the time, the Democratic Unionists belonged to the
governing coalition of Mahdi's Umma party and the National Islamic
Front of Moslem fundamentalist Hassan Turabi.
   Although his party endorsed the plan, Mahdi refused to let the
government act on it. In December, the Unionists left the coalition
because of the government's position on the peace plan and its
handling of the economy. Mahdi formed a new government in February
with the National Islamic Front as the junior partner.
   The front rejects a key rebel demand _ abolition of harsh Islamic
laws that are applied to all Sudanese regardless of religion.
   Sudan is divided into the minority Christians and animists of the
south, who are black, and the dominant Moslems of the north, who are
Arabic.
   The Sudanese economy is faltering under the $1 million a day
costs of the civil war, a $13 billion foreign debt and decreasing
foreign aid.

<HEAD>Bush Says Won't Be Rushed into New Middle East Policy by Soviets</HEAD>

   President Bush said Tuesday he would not be
rushed by high-profile Soviet diplomacy into framing a new U.S.
policy to deal with the Arab-Israeli confict.
   He said the Soviets should play only a secondary role in the
region ``and I think that's what it's going to be.''
   ``I don't worry about a trip by Mr. Shevardnadze to the Middle
East,'' Bush said at a White House news conference. ``I have no
worry about that.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is in the area for
talks with Arab leaders and also Moshe Arens, the Israeli foreign
minister. The session with Arens in Cairo is widely interpreted as a
bid by Moscow for a larger role in trying to set up Mideast peace
talks.
   Bush and James A. Baker III, the U.S. secretary of state, are
pondering their moves after a month in office. During a tour of NATO
capitals last week British, Spanish and Dutch leaders, among others,
urged Baker to take advantage of what they perceived to be
moderation by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Baker told them he would have U.S. diplomats explore the
situation in the area and that he would report back to the Western
Europeans at the opening of arms control negotiations between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna
early next month.
   At Bush's news conference, when the president was told by one
questioner there was a perception he did not have a foreign policy.
he said: ``I've never heard such an outrageous hypothesis.''
   In fact, Bush said, ``we have a foreign policy'' in which
East-West relations, South America and the Middle East are all under
review.
   He said Shevardnadze's trip, which involves the first visit by a
high-level Soviet official to Egypt in 17 years, ``doesn't trouble
me one bit.''
   Besides, Bush said he would ``have an opportunity to discuss a
lot of things'' with other nations' leaders on his own trip with
Baker to Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
   Bush and Baker are expected to meet with King Hussein of Jordan,
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Chaim Herzog of
Israel while they are in Tokyo.
   The president said his policy was meant to encourage
``discussions'' between Hussein and Israel ``and to build on the
progress that has been made already.''
   At the same time, Bush said the PLO had advocated ``very useful''
changes. Apparently he was referring to Chairman Yasser Arafat's
declaration last year that he accepted Israel's right to exist and
had renounced terrorism.
   ``The question is what specific steps we take next,'' Bush said,
``and I don't want to be rushing out because Mr. Shevardnadze went
to the Middle East. I'd like to have for the first step we take of
that nature to be a prudent step.''
   The president added: ``I don't want to be stampeded by the fact
that the Soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the Middle East.''
   In the past, the Soviets have backed radical Arabs and kept their
distance from Israel, with whom they broke relations after the 1967
Middle East war.
   Shevardnadze's meeting with Arens on Wednesday could step up a
resumption of diplomatic ties, while his stop in Cairo where he will
also see Arafat separately on Wednesday suggests support for Egypt
and mainstream Arab positions.
   And yet, Bush said the role of the Soviets in Mideast diplomacy
``should be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to
be. ... And that's exactly the way it should be and I think the
people in the Middle East feel that way. But the fact that he goes
there really shouldn't be bad.''

<HEAD>Officials Gather At Quantico To Compare Notes On Bundy Crimes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain; conference is closed to public.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUANTICO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officers from around the
country Tuesday met to analyze what Ted Bundy said before his
execution and determine which victims can be tied to the serial
killer.
   The FBI is holding the weeklong conference of about 20 law
enforcement officers at its National Center for the Analysis of
Violent Crime.
   ``There are a lot of people out there, a lot of agents who have
wondered if Bundy has committed crimes in their area,'' FBI
spokeswoman Kathy Bradford said. ``They've done them before on other
serial killer cases because they (serial killers) have a tendency to
move around the country.
   ``It's just a matter of sifting through the facts and seeing what
we can come up with.''
   The goal is to learn as much as possible about Bundy so other
convicted killers, present or future, cannot file appeals attempting
to shift guilt for their crimes onto Bundy, said Florida Deputy
Attorney General Jim York.
   ``I sure don't want a bunch of spurious appeals trying to blame
everything in the world on Bundy,'' he said.
   Ms. Bradford said details of the closed-door conference will be
annouced Friday or Monday.
   Bundy was executed in Florida last month for the murder of a
schoolgirl.
   The former law student maintained his innocence during 10 years
on death row, but as his appeals ran out and his execution date
neared, he confessed to at least 23 slayings in Washington state,
Colorado, Utah and Florida.
   In some instances, Bundy implicated himself in slayings in which
he had not been a suspect or ones that investigators were unable to
match to any known killings.
   Some law enforcement experts claim Bundy may have been involved
in 100 or more slayings of young women in Oregon, Idaho, Vermont,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   Agents will try to establish Bundy's movements from the time he
reached puberty in Washington until his arrest in Florida, the FBI
said.
   Defense attorneys had asked the governor of Florida to delay
Bundy's execution to give him time to tell more about unsolved
slayings. The appeal was denied.

<TEXT>
   Playwright Vaclav Havel, whose
works are performed to acclaim abroad but banned in his homeland,
has become a symbol of resistance to Czechoslovakia's Communist
authorities.
   On Tuesday, Havel was convicted of participating in a banned
rally and sentenced to nine months in prison. It was the latest
government move against the country's best-known dissident since the
1950s.
   Books with the lined face of the blond, mustachioed writer are
not found in Czechoslovak libraries or bookshops, but Havel's
outspoken human rights statements have brought him admiration beyond
his works.
   ``What is encouraging is that the young people know him,'' his
brother Ivan said in an interview this week at the Prague flat the
two share with their wives. ``This is paradoxical _ whatever happens
bad to him, whatever happens good to him, everything only increases
his popularity.''
   When the 52-year-old Havel was invited on stage at a folk music
festival in September, 5,000 people cheered.
   When the authorities surprisingly allowed an independent
demonstration in Prague on Dec. 10, crowds chanted ``Long Live
Havel!'' before he could speak.
   About 100 sympathizers gave the same chant Tuesday when Havel was
led to court, and more than 2,000 Czechoslovak intellectuals,
including Communist Party members, had signed petitions for Havel's
release.
   Born Oct. 5, 1936, the son of a civil engineer who built several
famous Prague landmarks, he first encountered difficulties with
authorities in the 1950s, when his bourgeois background barred him
from university studies.
   Between 1963 and 1968, in a flowering of Czechoslovak culture
that produced many well-known films and writers, Havel had three
plays performed in Prague.
   But after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968, Havel was among dozens
of writers whose works were banned in their homeland.
   A critical open letter to communist leader Gustav Husak in 1975
and his part in founding the Charter 77 human rights movement in
1977 led to almost constant harassment and detention.
   In the letter to Husak, Havel accused the Communist authorities
of creating ``a bureaucratic order of grey monotony that stifles all
individuality.''
   ``True enough, the country is calm,'' Havel wrote then. ``Calm as
a morgue or as a grave, wouldn't you say?''
   In 1979, when Havel was convicted for sedition and sentenced to
four years in prison, nobody in Czechoslovakia spoke up for him.
   But he already was well-known in the West, where he received
numerous awards and his plays drew critical praise.
   In giving Havel the Erasmus Prize in 1986, the Rotterdam-based
Erasmus Foundation said he was driven ``by the search for truth in
its purest form'' and lauded his ability to be critical of societies
in both East and West.
   Havel has refused many invitations to go to the West, fearing
that would mean leaving behind his native Prague and his wife of 24
years, Olga. Last year, a book of his letters from prison to Olga
Havel was published in the West.
   He would like to travel in Eastern Europe, he Told the Associated
Press in an interview last year. ``But I don't think they will give
me a passport,'' he added with a smile.

   A senior Palestinian official urged the
Soviet Union on Tuesday not to restore ties with Israel before
Washington and the Jewish state support an international Middle East
peace conference with the PLO.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's ruling 15-man Executive Committee, also accused
Washington of stalling in a dialogue with the PLO to gain time for
Israel to crush a 14-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Washington is pushing Moscow into an unconditional resumption
of ties with Israel, offering in return only promises of a wider
Soviet role in the Middle East,'' he said in an interview from the
PLO's headquarters in Tunis.
   ``We don't believe the Soviets will fall into this trap,'' he
said.
   Abed-Rabbo made his comments as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze was visiting Middle East capitals in a major initiative
to break the stalemate in the Middle East peace effort and assert
Moscow's influence in the region.
   Shevardnadze's 10-day, five-nation tour, the highest-ranking
Soviet mission in the region in nearly 20 years, underlined Moscow's
increasing credibility in Arab world following its military
withdrawal from Afghanistan and its efforts to moderate the PLO's
policies.
   Abed-Rabbo said PLO chief Yasser Arafat would ask Shevardnadze
about the possible restoration of Israeli-Soviet ties _ broken after
the 1967 Middle East war _ in a meeting Wednesday in Cairo.
   ``We believe any resumption of Soviet-Israeli ties should be
linked to the convening of an international conference, attended by
the PLO,'' he said.
   Israel and the United States have rejected PLO participation in
any such forum.
   Abed-Rabbo is also deputy leader of the Marxist Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine and headed the Palestinian side in
negotiations with the United States that began in December. He said
he still has no idea when the U.S.-PLO dialogue, suspended after
President Bush took office last month, will resume.
   Washington lifted its 13-year ban on public dealings with the PLO
after Arafat explicitly recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   U.S. officials said the talks were suspended because the new
adminstration wanted to review U.S. policy in the Middle East. But
Abed-Rabbo said this was ``nothing but a pretext.''
   ``The reality is that Washington is trying to gain time for
Israel to crush the uprising in the occupied territories so the
pressure for a Middle East peace settlement will ease.
   ``But they're ignoring a reality which even the Israelis are
slowly accepting: that it's impossible to suppress the uprising and
return to the situation that existed before the uprising was
launched.''
   At least 380 Arabs and 15 Israelis have been killed since the
uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8, 1987.
   Abed-Rabbo repeated a statement by Arafat that Israeli leaders
have made indirect contacts with the PLO on peace initiatives and
the uprising through third parties.
   ``What they've been saying through these third parties is
different from their public statements,'' he noted.
   ``These messages are coming regularly and on a weekly basis. If
Israeli leaders continue to deny that they've been in touch with us,
then we shall be forced to uncover everything,'' he said, without
elaboration.
   Israeli leaders have denied that there have been any direct or
indirect contacts made with the PLO, which it regards as a terrorist
organization.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Tuesday's auction, with rates on six-month
bills falling to the lowest level in nearly a month.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.51 percent, up from 8.49 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.50 percent, down from 8.54 percent last week.
   The rates for six-month bills were the lowest since Jan. 30, when
they averaged 8.39 percent. The rates for three-month bills were the
highest since they averaged 8.57 percent on Feb. 6.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.82 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,784.90 and 9.0 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,570.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 9.27 percent
last week, up from 9.15 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Polite Talk, Little Else as Bush, Congress Leaders Meet on Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and his budget director on
Tuesday prodded congressional leaders to join them in budget
negotiations, but Democrats responded by chiding them for
withholding their views on where spending cuts should be made.
   Talk of more talks was put on hold while, with Bush heading for
Japan, Congress began budget hearings amid efforts to extract more
detailed information from the White House.
   ``We've got an administration here that wants to embrace the
concept of a line-item veto but won't give us a line-item budget,''
said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee.
   The president met at the White House early Tuesday with Sasser,
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and other top Republicans and Democrats from
Capitol Hill.
   It was the first such meeting since Bush revealed his $1.16
trillion fiscal 1990 budget in a speech to Congress on Feb. 9.
   Lawmakers said they told the president that before negotiations
could begin they needed more detail, especially on how he would pay
for the new programs he wants for education, the environment, child
care and other areas.
   And they said the prognosis was poor for some of the specific
recommendations he did include _ such as a reduction in the capital
gains tax rate.
   Bush contends cutting the rate about in half, to 15 percent,
would result in more taxes being paid because economic activity
would increase. Democrats not only doubt the president's supply-side
math but contend the tax is a giveaway to the rich, since poor
people have few capital gains.
   The meeting was polite but it dealt more with schedules than
substance, participants said.
   ``The symbolism is very good. We haven't really gotten down to
substance,'' Wright said, predicting that once work begins, ``some
serious differences will emerge'' on issues such as a $5 billion
Medicare cut, one of the handful of spending cuts Bush did detail.
   ``It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track.
And we are,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the House Budget
Committee chairman. But, Panetta asked, ``When does he start to make
the tough choices? That's part of the process here, to find out what
the choices are.''
   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, appearing before the
Senate Budget Committee, defended the White House budget including
Bush's proposal for a ``flexible freeze'' on $136 billion in
existing programs.
   Those programs, mostly in domestic agencies, would be kept at
last year's spending levels with selected increases allowed only if
offsetting cuts were made. The White House has refused to say where
it would cut and where it would support increases.
   Going into further detail now had little appeal for the
administration, he said, since the chances were ``close to zero''
that Congress would agree with the administration's policy choices.
   ``We look forward to learning of other proposals and to
discussing them on the merits,'' Darman said. ``We mean to be
cooperative.'' Darman said all of the budget, not just the flexible
freeze, was negotiable.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., told him ``You get an `A' for
mood.'' But while that's important in Congress, he said agreeing on
a budget is ``going to take more than a good mood.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said he thought the White House
was trying to take political advantage and get Congress to join in
on putting something over on the public.
   ``We can't find it, can't catch it, and you say come on over to
the White House and we'll let you in on it,'' he told Darman, whom
he described as ``more Jack be nimble'' than David Stockman, former
President Reagan's budget director.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., the senior Republican on the
budget committee, said he disagreed with the Democrats on the need
for fine detail.
   ``I don't think we have to know the details but rather an overall
view,'' he said. However, he told Darman it was wrong to use the
word ``freeze'' for both Pentagon spending, which would increase
with inflation, and domestic programs that would be stuck at last
year's spending levels.
   At another hearing, before a House Appropriations subcommittee,
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said he did not know how much
money Bush is proposing for his department's fiscal 1990 budget.
There will be no set number until after the budget negotiations with
Congress, he said.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said failure to suggest ways to pay for
$441 million in new education programs sought by Bush cast doubt
over the seriousness of the proposals.
   ``It is certainly legitimate to question whether ... those are in
fact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which might
become real at a later date,'' he said.

<HEAD>Flag Maker Defends Label-switching Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The company that suggested U.S. importers
of its American flags switch the ``Made in Taiwan'' label to ``Made
in USA'' said it wants nothing more to do with U.S. protectionism.
   General Manager Ni Feng-ming said his company has switched to
making national flags for Canada, Japan, West Germany and Australia
after the 1987 suggestion to switch labels failed to get many U.S.
orders.
   ``We stopped sales to the United States about two years ago
because our products were strongly rejected,'' Ni Feng-ming, general
manager of Ming Teh, said in an interview. ``I guess Americans hate
to see their national flag made by foreigners.''
   The businessman added: ``American protectionism is really scary.''
   Although Ni says his company no longer exports American flags to
the United States because of protectionism and the appreciation of
the Taiwan dolla, both U.S. and Taiwan officials have expressed
concern over Ming Teh's label-switching suggestion.
   The U.S. Customs Service has ordered closer scrutiny of American
flags from Ming Teh following complaints from American flag
manufacturers and several members of the U.S. Congress.
   An official at Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said Tuesday
authorities have started an investigation to determine whether Ming
Teh violated any law.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Taipei
would take measures to ``discourage any label-switching ideas.''
   Ni stressed his company never changed the labels on its flags. He
said a salesperson suggested in June 1987 promotional letters that
U.S. importers remove ``Made in Taiwan'' tags from the company's
half-finished exports and add a ``Made In USA'' label once
processing was completed in the United States.
   Ming Teh dyed and printed the American flags and U.S. companies
did cutting and sewing, according to Ni.
   The huge Taiwan trade surplus with the United States has led to
friction between the two countries. Last year, the surplus was $10.4
billion on total trade of $36.43 billion.
   Mou Tun, an official at the China External Trade Development
Council, said Ming Teh was just ``trying to be considerate'' by
offering an alternative to U.S. importers who wanted to buy
Taiwan-made flags but did not want to upset U.S. flag makers.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up `Exclusionary Rule' Case from Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will consider
relaxing significantly the so-called ``exclusionary rule'' that bars
from criminal trials any evidence police seized unlawfully.
   The court said it will use a case from Chicago to decide whether
statements made by a criminal defendant after an unlawful arrest may
be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial
testimony.
   The court previously has allowed prosecutors to use unlawfully
seized evidence to contradict a defendant's own trial testimony. But
the justices never before have allowed the use of such evidence to
rebut other witnesses' testimony.
   The Illinois Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, allowed such evidence
to be introduced at the trial of Darryl James, sentenced to 30 years
in prison for a 1982 murder.
   James was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for two
Aug. 30, 1982, shootings. He was tried as an adult.
   Prosecutors said James shot and killed Geliria Boyd and wounded
another youth in a late-night confrontation on a south Chicago
street.
   Several prosecution witnesses identified James as the triggerman,
and testified that on the night of the crime he had long,
reddish-brown hair. At his trial, James had short, black hair.
   James did not testify at his trial but two defense witnesses
testified in his behalf. One said that James had short, black hair
the night of the shootings.
   Prosecutors then won court permission to let a police detective
testify that James, when arrested, said he had long, reddish-brown
hair the night of the crime.
   The trial judge previously had ruled that James' arrest was
unlawful because police at the time did not have a court warrant or
probable cause to suspect him of committing a crime. As a result,
the police detective was not allowed to testify directly about what
James had told him the night of the arrest.
   But the detective was allowed to testify about James' remarks to
rebut the defense witness' testimony.
   In a related case from Michigan, the court said it will decide
whether evidence obtained unlawfully after a defendant has been
arraigned can ever be used in court.
   A Michigan appeals court said no, and threw out Tyris Lemont
Harvey's 1986 conviction in Detroit on charges of criminal sexual
conduct. He had been sentenced to six to 10 years in prison.
   The state court said Harvey was entitled to a new trial because a
police officer should not have been allowed to testify about
comments Harvey made during an unlawful police interrogation six
days before his trial.
   The testimony was not offered as part of the prosecution's case
but only to rebut some of Harvey's trial testimony.
   The state court acknowledged that evidence obtained in violation
of a defendant's Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights _ to be free from
unreasonable police searches and the privilege against
self-incrimination _ sometimes may be used to rebut or impeach a
defendant's testimony.
   But it ruled that the statement made to the police officer
violated Harvey's Sixth Amendment right to effective legal help.
   ``A statement so acquired may not be used for any purpose,
including impeachment,'' the state court ruled.
   The ruling was appealed by Wayne County prosecutors.
   The cases are James vs. Illinois, 88-6075, and Michigan vs.
Harvey, 88-512.

   Seven months after a risky escape by boat from
Vietnam to Hong Kong, Le Van Deng said Tuesday he is ready to take
another risk and return to his communist homeland.
   ``I miss my parents and family,'' the 29-year-old told reporters
who visited the Argyle Street Holding Center where he and 79 other
Vietnamese are awaiting repatriation.
   They are expected to return to Vietnam next month and will be the
first group of boat people to go home voluntarily from this British
colony, which has more than 25,000 Vietnamese languishing in camps.
   Deng, speaking through an interpreter, said he was afraid of
being imprisoned in Vietnam but would go back anyway because he was
homesick for his family. He decided he wanted to go home a month
after his July 17 arrival in Hong Kong.
   Other Vietnamese who plan to go back also mentioned their
families left behind.
   Dien Tan Sang, 30, who fled to Hong Kong with his wife and three
children, said he decided to return ``because my parents are in
Vietnam and there is nobody to take care of them.''
   Dien, who spoke as his 4-year-old son sat weeping in his lap,
said he did not know whether he would be punished when they
returned. Asked if he were frightened, he slowly shook his head and
said: ``I am not afraid.''
   Both men said they were from the Vietnamese town of Quang Ninh
and that they fled to Hong Kong, about 500 miles northeast of
Vietnam, because others had done so. The trips typically are made in
overcrowded and rickety craft.
   Reporters previously had not been allowed to speak with the boat
people who have agreed to return home.
   Only 22 boat people voluntarily returned to Vietnam from Hong
Kong between 1979, when nearly 70,000 arrived, and 1988.
   But a tough new Hong Kong policy that no longer accepts all boat
people as eligible for resettlement appears to have convinced some
Vietnamese to return home.
   The Argyle Center group was issued travel documents by an
official Hanoi delegation that visited the colony this month.
   They were among the more than 10,000 boat people who have arrived
since the Hong Kong government introduced a policy in June under
which Vietnamese face forced repatriation unless they can prove they
fled their homeland because of persecution.
   Most boat people who have arrived since the new policy took
effect won't be granted refugee status, and those who are eligible
for resettlement might have to wait years before they are accepted
by another country.
   Hong Kong officials have said they hope smooth repatriation of
the first group will lead other boat people to volunteer to go home.
   Vietnam and the United Nations signed an agreement late last year
on the voluntary return of boat people. Under it, Hanoi agreed to
treat returnees well and the international organization is to
provide them with assistance.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
joined rescuers and survivors of last month's British Midland air
crash at a memorial service Tuesday for the 47 people who died.
   Before a gathering of 1,300 people at St. Anne's Anglican
Cathedral, leaders of Ireland's four main churches unveiled a scroll
for permanent display listing the names of those who died when the
Belfast-bound Boeing 737 crashed in central England on Jan. 8.
   British Midland Airways Chairman Michael Bishop read a passage
from the Bible and Archbishop Robin Eames, primate of the Anglican
Church of Ireland, talked of the responsibility borne by those who
provide public transport.
   ``It is at times like this that we are made aware of the awesome
responsibility of those who provide public transportation, of those
who for a few hours hold so many human lives in their hands,'' Eames
said.
   But he praised the airline, saying: ``From the chairman to the
youngest stewardess their reaction and their humanity went far
beyond the call of duty.''
   The jet crashed into the side of a major highway, close to the
runway of East Midlands Airport, after reporting engine trouble. The
cause is under investigation.
   Among the congregation were some of the 79 survivors of the
crash, some in wheelchairs or on crutches, and relatives of those
who died. Twenty-six of the victims were from Northern Ireland.
   Mrs. Thatcher flew to Belfast from Frankfurt at the end of a
two-day summit with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   She and other dignitaries spent 30 minutes talking with survivors
and relatives after the service.
   It also was attended by Tom King, the British government's
secretary for Northern Ireland, Transport Secretary Paul Channon and
the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.

<HEAD>Peace Talks End With No Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A second round of multilateral peace
talks on Cambodia ended without agreement Tuesday as negotiators
failed to bridge major differences between the warring factions.
   ``We haven't reached agreement on many points,'' said Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who organized the three-day talks. ``On
many points, further discussions will have to be done.''
   A statement cited differences among the four warring Cambodian
factions, notably establishing an interim government.
   It said participants agreed the Cambodians will continue
discussions among themselves. Alatas said results of those talks
would determine when to resume multilateral discussions.
   The Jakarta talks were aimed at ending Vietnam's 10-year military
occupation of Cambodia. They brought together leaders of Vietnam,
its ally Laos, the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia and
three allied guerrilla groups opposing it _ the communist Khmer
Rouge and non-communist forces of Sihanouk and Son Sann. Also
participating were members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which backs the resistance _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   The Cambodian factions clashed throughout the talks and in more
than one arena.
   According to a Thai military officer, Khmer Rouge and Cambodian
government troops broke a lull of several weeks on the eve of the
talks to trade heavy mortar and artillery fire Saturday and Sunday
near the key Thai border town of Aranyaprathet. The officer, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know if there were
casualties.
   At the talks, the pro-Vietnamese government insisted it be
allowed to govern while elections are held. The guerrillas demanded
the Phnomh Penh regime be replaced by a provisional government of
all four factions.
   ``How can you hold free elections in a communist state?'' said
Sihanouk's son and representative, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
Sihanouk boycotted the talks because he said his proposals already
have been rejected.
   Vietnam's representative, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, was
more upbeat, telling reporters ``the conference has been
successful.''
   Vietnamese officials first met the resistance at the first
multilateral talks in July. That also was marked by bitter clashes.
But from it emerged the consensus that a withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia must be linked to preventing a return to power by
the Khmer Rouge.
   On Monday, Ranariddh said the talks had to fail because the real
solution lay with the Soviet Union, which arms the 50,000-70,000
Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia, and China, which arms the
guerrillas. He said nothing would be achieved before the May 15-18
Sino-Soviet summit, the first in 30 years.
   Both communist powers recently have softened their positions and
declared their commitment to a negotiated Cambodian settlement.
   However, the Jakarta Post newspaper Tuesday quoted Hun Sen,
premier of the pro-Vietnamese government in Cambodia, as saying, ``I
do not believe my ally (the Soviet Union) will ever put pressure on
me.''
   Millions have been killed in Cambodia since 1970, when a coup
ended Sihanouk's 30-year rule. Cambodia became engulfed in the
U.S.-Vietnam war, and the Khmer Rouge regime that seized power in
1975 killed hundreds of thousands in slave labor camps and execution
chambers in trying to create a new agrarian society.

   Production of farm-grown catfish in January was
an estimated 26.9 million pounds, up 4 percent from a year ago, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Prices paid to growers averaged 78 cents per pound, up 10 cents
from January 1988, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said. The January price received by processors for dressed, whole
fish averaged $1.61 per pound for ice pack and $1.72 for frozen fish.
   Imports of freshwater catfish during December, the most recent
month listed, totaled 182,000 pounds, down sharply from 464,000
pounds a year earlier, the report said. Seventy-seven percent of the
imports were from Brazil.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to NATO plans to
leave his post this summer to return to the United States and a job
in private business, a knowledgeable source said Tuesday.
   Alton G. Keel Jr. will stay on at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization through a summit of President Bush and other leaders of
the 16 alliance nations, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   No formal date has yet been set for the high-level gathering,
although officials have said they expect it to be in late May in
Brussels.
   Keel will likely leave his job soon after the summit, probably in
June, said the source.
   ``He intends when he goes back to the United States to go in the
private sector,'' he said.
   The source noted reports that Keel might be in the running for
other jobs in the Bush administration but said Keel has asked that
his name not be considered. A successor has not been announced.
   Keel, 45, was sworn in as the U.S. representative to NATO on
March 13, 1987. Prior to that, he was acting assistant for national
security affairs to former President Reagan.
   The Hampton, Va. native was appointed a Congressional Science
Fellow in 1976 and from 1978 to 1981 was a senior staff member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   In 1981, he was named assistant secretary of the Air Force for
research, development and logistics. A year later, he was chosen
associate director for national security and international affairs
of the Office of Management and Budget.
   For five months in 1986, he directed the presidential commission
investigating the accident of the space shuttle Challenger and then
joined Reagan's National Security Council staff.
   Keel's wife, Franmarie Kennedy-Keel, returned to Washington in
November to take a position at the White House.

   Lithuanian's Council of Ministers on Tuesday
published a decree making Lithuanian the official language of the
Baltic republic to be used in all spheres of life, including
education and government, Tass said.
   At the same time, a plenum of the Communist Party Central
Committee in the capital of Vilnius issued a warning to nationalists
to avoid a policy of confrontation.
   The decision to make Lithuanian the official language was adopted
by the republic's legislature in October after years of pressure
from nationalist groups and came into force with the publication of
the decree by the Council of Ministers.
   ``Congresses, sessions, plenary meetings and other forums are to
be held in Lithuanian,'' the official news agency said in a dispatch
from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. ``If need be, translation of
reports into Russian or from Russian into Lithuanian will be
organized. The same goes for contacts with citizens at governmental
or public institutions, at public health and communal services and
judicial bodies.''
   Lithuanians account for approximately 80 percent of the 3.6
million population. ``Most Russians, Poles, Byelorussians and Jews
living in the republic speak Lithuanian,'' Tass said, a factor taken
into consideration when drafting Tuesday's decree.
   In a separate dispatch, Tass said a plenum of the republic's
Central Committee on Tuesday discussed the implications of the
nationalist movement on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
economic restructuring, known as perestroika.
   ``In Lithuania, forces have been formed which in words are for
the speeding-up of perestroika, but in deeds hamper it by their many
actions,'' Tass said.
   The news agency said a situation had been created in which there
was a threat of splitting Lithuanian society.
   ``The plenum stressed the urgency of the adoption of decisions
and resolute measures for cohesion of the republican party
organizations and demanded from party organizations and from all
communists to meet any threat of nationalist hostility and
nationalist chauvinism,'' Tass said.
   It said the Central Committee would continue to assess the
activities of unofficial nationalist movements.

<TEXT>
   Organizers of a proposed public garden in the
nation's capital to provide a ``living monument to peace'' opened a
national competition Tuesday for its design.
   Congress approved the idea _ the inspiration of Elizabeth
Ratcliff, a former teacher from Berkeley, Calif. _ and President
Reagan signed it into law in June 1987, giving organizers five years
to raise the $4 million to $6 million for the project.
   Applicants must register with the Peace Garden Competition by May
26 and submit designs by the end of August. The winning design will
be announced in September.
   The National Endowment of the Arts has given the Peace Garden
Project a $75,000 grant to help finance the competition, and the
California-based Columbia Foundation and LEF Foundation also have
donated money.
   Organizers estimate it will cost $250,000 to conduct the design
contest, including awarding prizes of $20,000 for the winner,
$10,000 for second place, $5,000 for third place, and $500 prizes
for honorable mention.
   The project will be constructed with the help of private funds.
The federal government will own and maintain it the garden, located
on six acres at Hains Point near the Jefferson Memorial.
   Mrs. Ratcliff said the inspiration for a National Peace Garden
came to her when she was visiting Washington in 1985.
   ``I just looked around and saw all the great monuments to the
past and all the wars we've been involved in,'' Mrs. Ratcliff said.
``It just suddenly came into my mind that what we needed in our
capital is a living monument to peace.''

   Eighty sick and wounded Iraqi prisoners of
war arrived home Tuesday after being freed by Iran, with some
falling to kiss the ground as they stepped off the plane.
   Also on Tuesday, a United Nations official said the first
U.N.-sponsored meeting between Iraqi and Iranian officers has been
postponed indefinitely. It had been scheduled for Wednesday.
   The 80 POWs are the first of 260 sick and wounded prisoners Iran
said it would free to mark the 10th anniversary of its revolution
earlier this month.
   Iraqi officials at Baghdad International Airport said the
Iranians informed the Red Cross they would repatriate 83 prisoners,
but later said three had asked for political asylum.
   A senior Iraqi officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross had informed
them 16 of the 260 prisoners opted to stay in Iran.
   Military police kept reporters away from the POWs, who all wore
gray track suits. At least 10 were in wheelchairs or carried on
stretchers.
   Gini Antone, a doctor of the International Committee of the Red
Cross who accompanied them on the plane from Tehran, said the
prisoners were sick but there were no serious injuries.
   Antone said morale was high during the 2{-hour flight, with
prisoners looking forward to returning home.
   Iraqi medical staff at the airport said the POWs will be taken to
a military hospital for more tests and will stay as long as they
need treatment.
   Most returnees were taken prisoner in early days of the war,
which started in September 1980.
   A jet chartered by the Red Cross committee carried them home.
   The plane will return to Tehran to bring the second batch of
prisoners Wednesday and the final group should arrive Thursday, said
Arnold Luethold, deputy director of the Red Cross delegation in
Baghdad.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the war Aug. 20. But peace
negotiations have stalled and an agreement to exchange prisoners in
November collapsed over mutual recriminations of bad faith,
including the numbers requesting asylum on both sides.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands, but U.N. officials estimate they
total 100,000.
   Further delays to the peace process were announced by a U.N.
official who said the two countries cannot agree on where their
Mixed Military Group should meet.
   They were to meet Wednesday along the road between the Iraqi town
of Khanaqin and the Iranian border town of Qasr-e-Shirin in the
central sector of the war front and cease-fire line.
   Officials refused to say which country expressed reservations on
the venue. U.N. officials are trying to negotiate a solution.
   The military officers were supposed to handle issues arising from
implementation of the cease-fire.

   The Planned Parenthood Federation of America
took aim at leaders of the pro-life movement Tuesday in a new $2
million national campaign to ``Keep Abortions Safe and Legal.''
   The campaign will try to mobilize more than 1 million people to
work at the local, state and national levels on public education
about abortion and the consequences of women losing the right to
choose to end their pregnancy.
   In addition, Planned Parenthood is running advertisements in
national magazines and newspapers around the country, charging that
pro-life leaders oppose not just abortion, but contraception and sex
education as well.
   One of the ads quotes fundamentalist Jimmy Swaggart as saying:
``Sex education classes in our public schools are promoting
incest;'' and Randall Terry, a leader of the campaign to block
abortion clinics, as saying: ``I don't think Christians should use
birth control.''
   The purpose of the ads is to educate Americans about the tactics
and hidden agendas of the other side, said David Andrews, acting
president of Planned Parenthood.
   ``We believe the more the American people know about the people
who are opposing abortion rights in America, the more compassionate
they're going to be in supporting abortion rights,'' he said.
   The National Right to Life Committee, which claims to be the
largest pro-life organization in the country, accused Planned
Parenthood of using ``scare tactics'' in their ads.
   ``They're taking instances and blowing them out of proportion,''
said Leonard Dinegar. ``They're scaring women into believing that
anyone who is pro-life is also against contraception and is in favor
of putting women who have had abortions in jail.''
   Dinegar said his organization takes no position on the issue of
contraception.
   But Andrews insisted that abortion opponents are giving Americans
a preview of what to expect if the Supreme Court, in its upcoming
review of its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, allows abortion
rights to be limited.
   ``One need to look no further than the case of Nancy and Martin
Klein,'' he said, referring to the comatose New York woman whose
husband had to fight pro-life attempts to stop him from allowing
doctors to terminate his wife's pregnancy in hopes of improving her
chances for survival.
   ``The millions of Americans who were profoundly offended by this
monstrous attack on a family's privacy must remember that we will
face scores of cases like this if the Supreme Court weakens in any
way the current laws regarding abortion,'' Andrews said.
   In getting its message to the public, Planned Parenthood hopes to
catch the eyes of the Supreme Court justices who could severely
limit abortion rights granted under the court's 1973 Roe v. Wade
decision.
   ``They do not live in a vacuum,'' said ... ``They are just as
prone to read and be influenced by the media and public opinion
polling and the force of public pressure that can be brought to bear
on an issue like this.''
   A Louis Harris poll of 1,248 randomly selected adults, surveyed
last month, found that 56 percent favor retaining Roe v. Wade while
42 percent want the decision overturned; and 68 percent oppose a
constitutional amendment to ban abortions while 29 percent are in
favor. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Part of Planned Parenthood's strategy is to organize Republicans
``to tell President Bush that in a kinder, gentler America there is
no room for back-alley abortions,'' Andrews said.
   ``Make no mistake,'' Andrews said. ``Back-alley abortions will
result if the opponents of abortion succeed. Abortion has always
been and will always be available, even when and where it is
illegal.''
   Planned Parenthood said it would spent $2 million from its
national budget on the campaign and supplement that with resources
from its 178 affiliates across the country.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Will Ask Israel To Talk to PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,
on the eve of separate talks with Israeli and PLO officials, said
Tuesday he would try to persuade Israel to negotiate with PLO chief
Yasser Arafat.
   Shevardnadze's 10-day Middle East initiative faces its toughest
test Wednesday when he meets Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in
an effort to sell Israel on his peace plan. Arens warned that
arranging peace talks could be a lengthy process.
   ``Peacemaking in the Middle East is a very difficult exercise. It
is a painfully slow process. But we are both convinced that very
intensive efforts have to be made to try to put momentum in the
process and try to move the process forward,'' Arens said.
   Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, speaking to
reporters after meeting Arens, also indicated that preparatory moves
might take a long time.
   ``We will keep on discussing and talking and having a dialogue, a
means we believe in even if the dialogue takes a long time,'' he
said.
   Israel is adamantly opposed to talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which it views as a terrorist group. It
also has serious reservations about the Soviet concept of an
international conference, which would include the PLO.
   ``We are trying to persuade Israel'' to enter negotiations with
the PLO, Shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with Egyptian
Prime Minister Ahmed Sidqi.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leaving on a four-day trip
to France, was chilly toward the Soviet proposal of a U.N.-sponsored
Middle East peace conference.
   ``We don't believe the international conference can serve the
cause of peace, but it was their (the Soviets') idea so it is not
surprising they should raise it,'' Shamir said.
   He did not, however, rule out further discussions, and Israeli
officials have hinted some compromise might ultimately be possible
to overcome Israel's fears that such a conference would be biased
against the Jewish state.
   On the eve of Shevardnadze's meeting with Arens, there was rising
speculation that it might set the stage for restoration of
diplomatic relations between Moscow and Jerusalem. Moscow severed
ties after the 1967 Middle East war when Israel captured Arab lands.
   Arens declined to comment on the prospects for renewing ties with
Moscow. But the prospect clearly alarmed PLO officials.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO's information department and a
member of the organization's 15-man Executive Committee, said the
Soviets should not renew relations unless Israel accepted an
international conference.
   ``Washington is pushing Moscow into an unconditional resumption
of ties with Israel, offering in return only promises of a wider
Soviet role in the Middle East,'' Abed-Rabbo said in a telephone
interview PLO headquarters in Tunis.
   ``We don't believe the Soviets will fall into this trap,'' he
said.
   Israel has insisted it would accept a Soviet role in peacemaking
only if ties are renewed.
   Shevardnadze was vague about what might happen concerning
Israeli-Soviet ties. He restated Moscow's position that the lack of
relations was not normal and said Israel ``knows the means'' for
bringing about a change.
   The Soviets have indicated they would like to see Israel take a
demonstrative step to match Arafat's statements in December that he
accepted Israel and renounced terror.
   Shevardnadze met earlier with Abdel-Meguid to review his
proposal, unveiled earlier in Syria, that the U.N. Security Council
and its five permanent members lay the groundwork for a peace
conference to be convened within nine months. The five permanent
council members _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China _ would sit as a preparatory committee to arrange
the conference.
   Egypt and the Soviet Union ``agreed on the importance ...
convincing Israel of the importance of peace, withdrawal from the
occupied territories and giving Palestinians self-determination,''
an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   Shevardnadze was scheduled to meet with Arafat on Wednesday about
the time that Arens was flying home to Israel.
   ``We are trying to persuade Israel'' to enter negotiations with
the PLO, Shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with Egyptian
Prime Minister Ahmed Sidqi.
   Shevardnadze's three-day Cairo visit has been the focal point of
a Middle East tour that has prompted questions about whether Moscow
snatched the peacemaking initiative from the United States.
   In Washington, President Bush denied he had yielded ground to the
Soviets and said he didn't want to be rushed into sending an
emissary to the Middle East.
   He said Soviet involvement was a ``good thing,'' and he wanted to
take ``prudent'' steps that would produce results.

   The prosecution demanded on Tuesday
that Lebanese militant Hussein Hariri be sentenced to life
imprisonment for hijacking an Air Afrique DC-10 in 1987 and killing
a French passenger.
   Prosecutor Willy Heim said the ``horror of the crime'' barred any
leniency toward the 22-year-old defendant he described as a ``killer
blinded by conviction.''
   In a brief statement, Hariri, identified in court as a member of
the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah group, said he regretted the death
of passenger Xavier Beaulieu but that the hijacking was ``not an act
of terrorism but was combat.''
   Hariri faces charges of murder and hostage-taking in the trial in
Federal Criminal Court that began Monday. The five-judge panel
hearing the case is scheduled to announce a verdict and sentence on
Friday.
   Heim's final arguments came after testimony by passengers and
crew members, including by a chief steward the Congolese chief
steward, Andre Memba, who he said he was an eyewitness of the
execution-style slaying of Beaulieu.
   An American on the plane said Tuesday that he began writing his
will after the Frenchman was killed.
   Beaulieu was shot from behind and at close distance after a
three-minute deadline set by Hariri for the refueling of the DC-10
at Geneva airport.
   Hariri told the court earlier he did not intend to kill Beaulieu
but that he fired without aiming when the 28-year-old Frenchman,
whose head was covered with a blanket made a threatening move. Memba
said Beaulieu was seated when he was shot and that Hariri was
standing behind him.
   ``The witness was bought, the way I bought the customs
official,'' Hariri protested in French. It was a reference to the $6
bribe he paid to slip by controls at Bangui, the capital of Central
Africa, where he boarded the plane with a 7.65 millimeter pistol,
140 rounds of ammunition and 562 grams of TNT.
   The French pilot, Edouard Artizzu, testified that a PLO
representative, Nabil Ramlawi, who negotiated with Hariri at the
request of Swiss authorities, was to be credited for talking the
hijacker out of killing a second passenger.
   Hariri earlier said Ramlawai, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Organization's Geneva mission, was a ``traitor'' and blamed him for
the failure of his mission.
   The plane, bound for Paris, was diverted over northern Italy July
24, 1987 with Hariri demanding the release of Lebanon and
Palestinian prisoners held by French, West German and Israeli
authorities. The ordeal ended when crewmembers overpowered Hariri
while Swiss police stormed the plane.
   In earlier testimony, the lone American hostage in the drama said
he wrote his will on a page of a travel journal after he saw
Beaulieu's body taken off the plane by two stewards.
   ``This was the first point at which I really expected to die
(too),'' said Peter W. Schroth, 42. ``I prepared a will which I gave
to the steward.''
   Schroth, a lawyer and Hartford, Conn., businessman, was the first
passenger directly threatened by Hariri while he was collecting
passports to sort out French nationals.
   He said Hariri picked him after he was unable to turn over his
passport because it was in his suitcase.
   ``He placed his pistol against the back of my head and shouted to
the other passengers, `Look at this man, if anyone moves he will
die.' ''

   President Bush's plan for rescuing the savings
and loan industry is based on overly optimistic economic assumptions
and understates the program's true cost by billions of dollars,
private analysts said Tuesday.
   The White House Office of Management Budget released figures
Tuesday showing, among other assumptions:
   _long-term interest rates falling 3 percent in two years to the
lowest point in 20 years.
   _savings and loan deposits growing at an annual rate of 7.2
percent even as the government will be curbing high-flying,
fast-growing institutions.
   ``These assumptions are highly optimistic, exceedingly
optimistic,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va. ``They're just not realistic.''
   If the administration's interest rate projections are off, the
government will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more a
year to finance the borrowing.
   If the deposit growth is lower than predicted, then insurance
premiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the $32 billion
projected over the next decade. That will mean taxpayers will have
to pay more.
   Bush's plan calls for raising $50 billion by selling bonds over
the next three years. The bonds will be sold in an off-budget
arrangement, which means the government will have to pay more in
interest than on normal Treasury borrowing.
   The OMB plan shows the special S&amp;L bonds carrying a rate 0.3
percentage points higher than long-term Treasury rates. That's ``a
shade optimistic,'' according to Robert Litan, a banking expert with
the Brookings Institution.
   More importantly, however, the government shows long-term
Treasury rates falling from about 9.2 percent now to 6.2 percent in
1991, which would be the lowest rate since 1968.
   ``To say that that's optimistic is the understatement of the
year,'' Litan said.
   Analysts said the deposit projections are in line with the growth
rate of the past 10 years, but are likely too high if the
administration follows through with other parts of its reform
program. S&amp;Ls under the Bush plan would not be allowed to grow
unless their owners put up more of their own money.
   ``There's no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast in
light of the capital requirements,'' Ely said.
   He also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rate
of inflation and, in the unlikely event that occurred, it would make
it much harder to meet the deposit growth targets.
   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee on Tuesday looked at
requiring independent certified public accountants hired by
individual S&amp;Ls to exchange information with federal regulators on
whatever they uncover in their audits.
   The committee was reviewing a General Accounting Office check of
11 failed S&amp;Ls in Texas which found that accounting firms, including
some of the nation's largest, failed to uncover problems in six of
the 11.
   While the six institutions showed a net worth of $44 million in
the independent accountants' audits, their net worth five to 17
months later when they failed was a negative $1.5 billion, said
Assistant Comptroller General Frederick D. Wolf.
   The committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the S&amp;L industry,
should have uncovered the audit problems long ago.
   ``Of the six audits found deficient by the GAO _ and these
include some of the most renowned horror stories _ the bank board
has not taken action against a single one,'' he said.
   In another development, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who heads
the House subcommittee overseeing S&amp;Ls, said the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which insures commercial bank deposits, may be too
overworked to take on oversight the S&amp;L industry.
   As part of the president's reform proposal, the FDIC would get
jurisdiction over nearly 3,000 S&amp;Ls. However, Annunzio, who is
fighting to keep S&amp;L regulation separate from bank regulation, said
the FDIC in the last two years has not conducted on-site safety and
soundness examinations at hundreds of commercial banks under its
oversight.
   ``With over 200 bank failures last year ... we should be stepping
up the number and frequency of bank ... examinations. Instead, the
Bush plan will saddle the insurer of deposits in these banks with
significant new responsibilities,'' he complained.

   NATO negotiators will offer to reduce
some of the alliance's conventional forces in Europe when they meet
officials of the Soviet-led Warsaw pact in arms talks next month, a
U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Stephen Ledogar, the U.S. representative at the upcoming arms
negotiations, said the proposal will be ``below but not too far
below'' existing levels for the Western alliance.
   Ledogar, speaking on a U.S. government satellite broadcast from
Washington, said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was still
working on its position for the talks on reducing conventional
forces in Europe, scheduled to begin early next month in Vienna.
   ``We will be approaching the problem by trying to reduce the
asymmetries, the disparities, which ... in almost all defense
categories are in favor of the East,'' he said.
   ``We will not simply recommend that the East do all of the
reduction, but we for our part will offer to do some of the
reduction too,'' he said.
   Asked by a questioner about reports in Germany that the West
would offer a 5 percent cut in conventional forces, Ledogar replied:
``While the percentage you mentioned is not firmly nailed down, it
is ... within the ballpark.''
   The Western alliance contends the Soviets and their allies have
built up a huge superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, forces
in Europe.
   The 16 NATO nations and the seven of the Warsaw Pact will take
part in the negotiations which will cover the area from the Atlantic
Ocean to the Ural mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Ledogar said the Western nations would like to focus the initial
bargaining on reducing main battle tanks, artillery and armored
troop carriers to equal levels.
   The Western approach, he said, ``will be to try to concentrate on
those military equipments and armaments that give to one side or the
other the capability to ... launch a surprise attack or sustained
large-scale offensive activity.''
   Previous East-West talks on reducing forces in Europe _ called
the mutual and balanced force reductions negotiations _ ended early
this month after dragging on for more than 15 years without
resolution. The two sides could not agree on mutual troop strength
and methods to police an eventual withdrawal.
   Ledogar declined to speculate on how long the upcoming talks
might go on.

<HEAD>GAO Says Agency Officials Ordered Changes in Report on Spotted Owl</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish and Wildlife Service officials, in an
effort to keep the spotted owl off the endangered list, ordered
changes in a report which originally said the bird may face
extinction, according to a General Accounting Office report released
Tuesday.
   The GAO, an arm of Congress, said officials ignored scientific
evidence and ordered revisions in a study prepared by biologists in
the agency's Northwest regional office. Scientists had concluded
that unless logging was slowed in ancient forests of the Northwest,
the owl could face extinction.
   The timber industry in the Northwest has opposed any effort to
name the owl a threatened or endangered species, fearing that such a
move would disrupt logging in public forests. Environmentalists have
advocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to halt
logging of old growth forests.
   ``While changes are an inevitable part of any draft report review
process, the nature of the changes made in this case and the way
they were made raise questions about whether objectivity was
maintained,'' the GAO said.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, an Interior Department agency
which determines what should be designated for protection as
threatened or endangered, is required to consider only ``biological
factors'' in making its decision.
   The service concluded in December 1987 that the owl, which lives
only in old growth forests of Oregon, Washington and northern
California, was not endangered, and refused to grant a petition
requesting that the bird be protected.
   The GAO said decisions on whether to classify a bird, animal or
plant as endangered ``can often be surrounded by highly emotional
debates centered on the decision's possible economic consequences
rather than its biological merits.
   ``In such cases especially, the Fish and Wildife Service needs to
be able to demonstrate that its review process and ultimate
decisions have been thorough, independent, and objective as
possible,'' GAO said. ``There is evidence the spotted owl process
did not meet such standards.''
   The GAO said agency ``management officials substantially changed
the body of scientific evidence'' found in the original report.
   ``The revisions had the effect of changing the report from one
that emphasized the dangers facing the owl to one that could more
easily support denying the listing petition,'' the GAO said.
   The agency's decision not to list the owl as endangered was
challenged in court and a federal judge has given the service until
May 1 to provide additional information on how it reached its
decision.
   An agency spokesman on Tuesday declined comment on the GAO
report. ``We would like to at least read it first,'' said Craig
Reiben, a Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman.
   ``The Fish and Wildlife Service's decision not to list the
spotted owl as an endangered species appears to have been based on
politics, not science or law,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass. He
said he planned to ask Fish and Wildlife Service Director Frank
Dunkle about the case at a hearing Wednesday.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the GAO report shows the
decision not to protect the owl was a ``simple case of political
expediency winning out over sound scientific evaluation and good
policy.
   ``We need the scientific facts about the spotted owl, not the
biased views of political appointees at the Department of Interior.''

   Oliver North's criminal trial opened Tuesday
with the prosecutor portraying him as a liar who ``places himself
above the law'' but with North's lawyer defending him as a patriotic
Marine who obeyed unflinchingly the orders of his commander in chief.
   North, now retired from the service, listened intently as
prosecutor John Keker told the jury the defendant had lied time and
again to his president and to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Chief defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan countered that North, a
former top National Security Council aide, worked in a secret world
where ``he always acted with the approval of his superiors; he acted
always with the best interests of his country.''
   Thus the two sides squared off for the oft-delayed first trial to
come out of the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that may take as much as
five months to complete.
   The first testimony comes Wednesday morning when Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., the former chairman of House Intelligence
Committee, takes the stand.
   Keker told the jury Tuesday that North had profited personally by
using traveler's checks furnished by a Contra leader and, on a
broader scale, had told lies that amounted to ``a crime that goes to
the soul of our self-government.''
   ``You will hear he considers himself a patriotic person, but
there is no higher patriotic purpose than to protect our system of
government,'' Keker said. ``To lie to Congress because you mistrust
it then is a crime and not a defense.''
   Sullivan did portray North as a patriot, saying he believed in
the Marine motto ``Semper Fidelis'' _ always faithful.
   ``He lived with that Marine Corps motto. He was always faithful
to country, to commander in chief, to his family, to those whose
lives depended on him,'' said Sullivan.
   And yet, said the defense attorney: ``Lt. Col. Oliver North has
in the end been abandoned by his government.''
   North's eyes moistened as Sullivan wound up his opening statement
almost in a whisper.
   The lawyer said that North was the troubleshooter at the National
Security Council, and if ``a secret mission had to be accomplished,
it was `Let Ollie do it.'''
   When Congress decided not to support the Nicaraguan freedom
fighters in 1984, Sullivan said, ``the president was angry ... and
he vowed he would find a way to support them.''
   Reagan ordered National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane ``to
keep them together body and soul and it was then the job of Ollie
North,'' Sullivan said.
   He recited a lengthy version of the history of the Iran-Contra
affair to the jury, some of whose members appeared to be nodding
off. Sullivan noted that while the Reagan administration was barred
by law from directly helping the Contras, officials solicited funds
for the cause from other countries.
   He quoted Reagan as saying privately at the time, ``If this leaks
out, we'll all be hanging by our thumbs outside the White House
until we find out who did it.''
   North followed the opening statements of Keker and Sullivan with
unflagging interest. He sat upright during the presentations which
took four hours, sometimes looking toward his wife, Betsy, who was
in the front row of spectators.
   The courtroom was filled to its 120-seat capacity, with reporters
taking 60. The public got only 15 and the rest went to assorted
lawyers, prosecutors and government security experts. U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell allowed four representatives of intelligence
agencies in court to monitor the large amounts of classified
information expected to be revealed publicly in the trial.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts, nine of them having to
do with deceiving Congress and the president. The other three
involve charges that he personally profited from the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``The need for secrecy is no excuse for lies,'' Keker said.
   At one point, he said, a House committee had met with North in
the White House seeking the truth about the situation.
   ``The committee looked Oliver North right in the eye and North
looked them right in the eye and he lied,'' Keker said.
   Keker said North took $4,000 of the $90,000 in traveler's checks
that Contra leader Adolfo Calero gave him to cover expenses.
   ``Colonel North used that $4,000 like it was his personal
piggy-bank'' for groceries, tires and to take his family on a trip,
Keker told the jury.
   Keker called North's fabrications to a presidential inquiry an
extraordinary criminal act ``by a man who at some point stops
playing by the rules and places himself above the law.''
   But Sullivan countered that North never broke the law, that ``he
followed the instructions of the highest-ranking officials of the
United States of America.''
   North was a Marine lieutenant colonel with 20 years service and a
distinguished Vietnam War record when he resigned from the service
after his indictment last March.
   Sullivan, who became known nationally during the 1987
congressional hearings on the affair, held up thumb and forefinger a
quarter-inch apart and told the jury: ``He never had this much
criminal intent.''
   North testified at the hearings under immunity from prosecution
for anything he might say. Keker, working for independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh, had to develop his evidence for the trial without
recourse to the hearing transcript.
   Keker told the jury that the Bible says there is a time and place
for everything.
   ``When the time came for Oliver North to tell the truth, he
lied,'' Keker said. ``When the time came to come clean, he shredded,
erased and altered. When the time came to let the light shine in, he
covered up.''

   The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will use a
case involving an abandoned movie project to examine penalties for
law firms accused of breaking a rule against needless lawsuits.
   The court agreed to hear an appeal by a defunct New York City law
partnership ordered to pay $50,000 for violating the rules.
   The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Northern J. Calloway, an
actor who plays the character David on television's ``Sesame
Street.``
   Calloway sued Marvel Entertainment Group and others, accusing
them of copyright and other violations on a proposed animated
science fiction movie to be called ``The Skyrider.''
   Calloway sought $44 million in damages.
   A federal judge imposed $100,000 in sanctions against Calloway,
$50,000 against his attorney, Ray LeFlore, and $50,000 against the
now dissolved law firm of Pavelic &amp; LeFlore.
   The penalties were imposed for violating a court rule aimed at
preventing frivolous lawsuits and herassing and delaying tactics by
lawyers.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding the penalties
against LeFlore and the law firm last August, said, ``Calloway's
case was at all times very weak. From the very beginning, (his) case
suffered from obvious and grave weaknesses.''
   For example, the appeals court said, none of the people sued made
any money from the proposed movie project and most lost money on the
venture.
   In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Pavelic &amp; LeFlore said the
$50,000 sanction against the firm should be thrown out because only
LeFlore _ and not the firm _ signed key papers in the suit.
   LeFlore did not appeal to the high court to throw out the $50,000
penalty against him personally.
   The case is Pavelic &amp; LeFlore vs. Marvel Entertainment, 88-791.

   Computer-equipped citizens can fire
off an angry electronic letter to City Hall, see if their favorite
book is at the library or check the bus schedule in a pioneering
program switched on Tuesday.
   Experts say Santa Monica's Public Electronic Network is at the
leading edge of a national trend linking local governments to their
constituents through computers.
   This affluent coastal Los Angeles suburb began enrolling computer
owners in the service Tuesday, and City Manager John Jalili said
interest appeared high, though a customer count for the free service
wasn't immediately available.
   Once a citizen has been enrolled and assigned a password to get
into the system, he or she will be able to tap into city files on
proposed developments and other City Council action, find out how to
get city permits and licenses, get schedules for city services and
get a range of consumer advice.
   They'll also be able to sound off, directing ``electronic mail''
at council members, department heads and the public at large.
   The city promises to respond.
   ``I love it,'' said Michael Hill, a teacher and active citizen
who was the first to sign up for PEN. ``We live in an electronic age
and we have this technology that allows us to use computers to
access information.''
   He planned to fire up his home computer Tuesday afternoon to
offer some ideas on how to fit a park improvement project into the
new budget.
   ``Then I'll probably e-mail (electronic mail) the information
services department head and congratulate him on a job well done,''
Hill said.
   The system is housed in a computer separate from the city's
internal data processing to head off the threat of ``hackers''
seeking inside information or planting destructive viruses.
   Although Santa Monica's system appears to go further than most,
many local governments around the country are experimenting with
computer citizen communications, said Ted Shogry of Public
Technology Inc., a Washington, D.C., group that researches
technology for local governemnts.
   Kansas City, Mo., and Hillsborough County, Fla., have ``24-hour
City Halls,'' which allow citizens to browse through reams of
information using computer kiosks set up in public places, he said.
   The organization is planning a 12-city test later this year of a
``videotext'' information system linking citizens with their
governments. The cities have yet to be chosen.
   Charlotte, N.C., and Fort Worth, Texas, have ``voice mail''
systems for callers to get recorded information on a variety of
services and problems, he said.
   ``It's attracting a lot of interest by local governments across
the country,'' Shogry said. ``There's a growing awareness of how
telecommunications and computer technology can be used to involve
more people.''
   Santa Monica's Jalili sees the system as a way to improve service
to citizens.
   ``First of all, it's going to stop the phone game where people
are transferred to eight different places,'' Jalili said. ``And
there are people who during their work day can't call in and when
they get home City Hall is closed.''
   Of course, many people who need help or information from City
Hall don't have personal computers.
   In Santa Monica, known for the liberal politics of such celebrity
residents as actress Jane Fonda, project organizers are sensitive to
the perception they're bypassing the poor.
   Terminals have been installed in all libraries and there are
plans to put them in recreation buildings and in a senior citizens'
center under construction.
   Elsewhere, the equipment put in public places is designed for
easy use by those who aren't familiar with computers: Some have
touch-sensitive screens to make typing unnecessary, and all have
simple instructions to lead users throught the microchip maze.
   ``My personal opinion is that for the electronic democracy to
become a reality, the needs of the poor or less educated will have
to be kind of aggressively addressed,'' Shogry said.
   In the case of Santa Monica, a survey found 33 percent of
residents owned personal computers and 23 percent had modems, the
devices needed to allow the computers to communicate over telephone
lines.
   For now, the experiment is free to the city and to subscribers.
The $350,000 system was a gift from two computer companies _ Hewlett
Packard Co. donated the machines and Metasystems Inc. provided the
software.
   But fees aren't ruled out in the future, said Jalili, depending
on how much staff time is involved.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday defended
a government order freezing cooperatives out of the medical
business, saying the private business was taking up too many
government resources.
   His remarks, broadcast on the evening TV news program ``Vremya,''
came on a visit to Lvov on his trip to the Ukrainian republic.
   The 57-year-old Soviet leader toured a television factory,
addressed city scientific and cultural leaders, and held discussions
with groups of citizens at the airport and on street corners.
   The official Soviet media said Gorbachev will visit the Chernobyl
area on his trip, nearly three years after the world's worst nuclear
power plant disaster occurred there.
   Gorbachev said in response to a complaint from an elderly woman
about medical cooperatives that Moscow officials heard some medical
equipment was not being used in the state-run system so it would be
ready for cooperatives, which charge their patients.
   ``After 2 or 3 o'clock, everything worked fine,'' Gorbachev said.
``It turned out that in the first part of the day it was being
prepared to be used for cooperatives.''
   In late December the government ordered cooperatives out of the
medical field, TV stores and other potentially high-profit services
that also require relatively big investments.
   Government officials said they moved against medical cooperatives
to ensure public health.
   But leaders of the cooperative movement saw it as an effort to
keep them out of profitable areas.
   Gorbachev has pushed the cooperative movement as a means to
provide goods and services that the state-run economy cannot or will
not provide. He said the Soviet Union needs them but should control
them through taxation and efforts to limit the amount of money their
workers can earn.
   Lvov, a railway, automobile assembly and oil refining city with a
population of 753,000, lies 260 miles west of Kiev, in a part of the
Ukraine that became part of the Soviet Union only at the end of
World War II.
   Lvov is still a center of Ukrainian nationalism.
   Gorbachev toured the Elektron factory, and factory workers told
him about plans to increase output of TV sets, which Tass said were
in short supply.
   Aside from being scarce, Soviet television sets are notoriously
dangerous. The state-run press has carried articles saying
Soviet-made color TV sets are prone to explode and are a major cause
of fires.
   Gorbachev found out Monday in Kiev, the republic's capital, that
the dangers of nuclear power are still much on the minds of
Ukrainians.
   In a street encounter broadcast on television, an elderly woman
asked Gorbachev why another nuclear power plant was being built in
the Crimea.
   The area contains some of the country's most popular beach
resorts and is home to 2 million people.
   Gorbachev said he was aware of worries about plant safety. He
said American specialists had been asked to study the Crimean
facility.
   ``Construction is under way,'' he said. ``But if the conclusion
(of the specialists) is that it is not advisable to build a station
there, then it will be turned into a training center for personnel,
not an atomic power station.''
   An explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April
26, 1986, killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud
around the world.
   Since then, the Soviets have moved away from complete faith in
the safety of nuclear power, and public opposition to it has grown.
   Last week, Moscow News said cancer cases have doubled in a region
30 miles from Chernobyl where people were not evacuated.

<HEAD>Senators Say Congress Will Review Secrets Law After North Trial</HEAD>

   Senate Democratic leaders said Tuesday that
Congress will review a law governing the use of national security
secrets in criminal cases because of the legal tangle created by the
trial of Oliver North.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the use of
an independent counsel to prosecute North on charges of lying to
Congress about the Iran-Contra affair had not been anticipated in
the law covering how to handle secret evidence.
   ``In this case, the balance which the law assumed would be there
does not exist,'' Mitchell told reporters. ``It is obvious that the
prior administration and this administration is not eagerly seeking
... prosecution. Indeed, its political interest lies in no trial at
all.''
   To help ensure that the administration did not forfeit the North
case for political reasons, the Senate Intelligence Committee held a
closed-door session to hear from CIA Director William Webster on the
administration's reasons for dropping conspiracy charges against
North in January. North's trial on 12 other charges began Tuesday.
   ``We heard from members of the intelligence community who shared
their national security concerns about information that could be
developed during the course of the trial now under way,'' said Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the intelligence panel.
   Boren declined to say whether he was satisfied that those
concerns were legitimate or to characterize Webster's level of worry
about the classified information, saying he did not want to open
himself to charges of influencing the case.
   Congress passed the Classified Information Procedures Act in
1980, propelled by a spate of cases in which defendants threatened
to disclose government secrets as part of their defense against
criminal charges.
   The law defines national security secrets and allows a trial
judge to screen such information before a trial to determine whether
the material can be used in open court. The judge can dismiss a case
or specific counts of an indictment if the government objects to
disclosure of classified information.
   The same law requires the Justice Department to report to
Congress on cases not prosecuted or charges dropped because of fears
of disclosure of secrets.
   ``We will carefully review (the law) when this is over to see if
changes are necessary,'' Mitchell said.
   ``We are dealing with situations here which might not have been
anticipated by the law when it was written,'' added Boren. ``It
would be appropriate for us to reflect upon when all is said and
done'' in the North case.

<HEAD>Government to Change Inscription on Katyn Monument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it will change
a monument inscription saying the Nazis killed more than 4,000
Polish army officers during World War II. It cited a Polish Red
Cross document that indicates the Soviets killed them.
   The announcement came from government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who
stopped short of saying that the Soviets were guilty of the crime in
the Katyn Forest in western Russia. He also did not say what the
Warsaw monument will read.
   ``We expect that this problem will be explained by the two sides
and on the basis of more comprehensive information,'' Urban told a
news conference.
   Urban referred to a broadcast by Radio Moscow on Monday which,
according to Urban, said the Red Cross report was ``serious evidence
requiring serious examination that the Katyn crime was committed by
Soviet security forces in the Stalinist epoch, and not by the
Nazis.''
   The 12-foot granite monument at Warsaw's Powazki Cemetery has an
inscription at its base saying it is ``To Polish Soldiers _ Victims
of Hitlerite Fascism Resting in the Ground of Katyn.''
   Urban said the government also plans to move the monument, now in
an out-of-the-way corner of the cemetery.
   The massacre in the Katyn Forest, 12 miles west of Smolensk, is
one of the most searing issues in Polish-Soviet relations, and for
years the word itself was too sensitive to be uttered in public.
   Official postwar histories all maintained the officers were
killed by Nazis in winter 1941, but most Poles and Western
historians have said they were killed by the Soviets in the spring
of 1940, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were still allied.
   In addition to the 4,300 bodies found at Katyn, 11,000 other
officers are unaccounted for and presumed dead after they were
imprisoned in the Soviet Union in the first days of World War II.
The officers represented about half of Poland's prewar officer corps.
   The monument blaming the Nazis for Katyn was erected in April
1985 and unveiled without public notice after some family members of
Katyn victims erected unauthorized crosses at the site in memory of
the slain officers. The crosses were taken down.
   Each Aug. 1 and Nov. 1, dates when Poles remember their war dead,
large groups of people gather at the monument, and many use candles
and flowers to cover over the inscription they regard as false.
   A joint committee of Polish and Soviet historians created in
April 1987 is examining the Katyn issue as part of an effort to
correct ``blank spots'' in the two countries' history.
   In November, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia reported that the
Soviet Council of Ministers approved plans for a monument in Katyn
for prisoners of war, but the report gave no construction schedule.

   National Republican Party officials were in
conflict with Lousiana GOP legislators Tuesday over how to react to
the election under the GOP banner of former Ku Klux Klansman David
Duke.
   Duke won a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives on
Saturday and national party chairman Lee Atwater declared the party
had no intention of accepting him as a member.
   Under Atwater's direction, a resolution was prepared declaring
that Duke was ``not a Republican in gesture, deed or belief.''
   The resolution is expected to be adopted by the party's 11-member
executive council, which will confer by telephone Friday.
   However, in Baton Rouge, La., Republican legislators said they
saw no reason to reject Duke.
   ``We can't be responsible for what he did before he was
registered as a Republican,'' said Rep. Art Sour, a Republican. ``I
don't understand what Atwater is talking about. Censure him for
what? The only control we have over him is what he's done since he's
been a Republican.''
   ``We will see if Mr. Duke is what he says he is or what the media
says he is,'' said Rep. Peppi Bruneau of New Orleans, GOP caucus
chairman. ``If he's what he says he is, he has no problem. He got to
the House the same way everybody else did.''
   Atwater also voiced concern that his effort to denounce the
former Ku Klux Klansman ``plays right into his hands'' by giving
Duke a new forum.
   ``I'm going to refrain from discussing Mr. Duke anymore,''
Atwater told reporters at the White House.
   For national party officials, the election of Duke came as the
GOP was launching an intensive campaign to win support among blacks
who have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in national elections.
   At a brief news conference Tuesday, President Bush conceded his
endorsement of Duke's opponent might have been viewed by Louisiana
voters as ``improper or overkill.''
   But, the president said, ``I did what I did because of principle
... this man, his record is one of racism and bigotry, and, I'm
sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.''
   Duke, 38, defeated homebuilder John Treen, 63, in Saturday's
election for a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives
despite endorsements for Treen by Bush, former President Reagan and
the most powerful political figures in the suburban New Orleans
area. Both candidates were registered as Republicans.
   ``I have no desire to impeach him from office,'' said Atwater.
   The GOP chairman said he wanted Republicans to ``officially
disassociate ourselves as a party from Mr. Duke.''
   Atwater noted that Duke had previously run for office as a
Democrat and had re-registered as a Republican only three days
before the election.
   ``He is not a man, who, I think, stands for either party,'' said
Atwater. ``He's an opportunist. ... There's a 20-year career there
in which he was a man of the swastika, vehemently anti-Semitic,
vehemently racist.''
   The GOP chairman said he would henceforth refrain from discussing
the Duke matter because ``it plays right into his hands. What he
wants is to get into a prolongued argument with me on television,
any other kind of media.
   ``He's a very effective demagogue and I'm not going to give him
an opportunity to do that any more. ... I'm not going to let myself
become a dupe in his play to get more free media coverage.''
   Atwater reiterated his contention that Duke ``does not represent
our party in any shape, form or fashion.'''

<HEAD>World Record Holder Dies in Parachute Jump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHERIDAN, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Frenchman fell to his death doing what he
had done more than anyone else in the world _ parachute jumping.
   ``He would jump with anybody anytime,'' said Ted Mayfield,
founder of the Pacific Parachute Center, where 59-year-old Roch
Pierre Charmet died Monday when his parachute failed to open
properly. ``That was his whole life.''
   Charmet, who held the world record for the most parachute jumps
with more than 14,000, had made six jumps when he went up for what
was to be the last for the day.
   Mayfield on Tuesday recalled that on the way up Charmet played a
French drinking song, something about knights of the Round Table
drinking wine, on a harmonica he recently learned to play. Charmet
jumped out at 2,500 feet.
   ``Normally, you wait three or four seconds and pull out a
hand-deployed pilot chute,'' said Mayfield. ``I could see him
fighting with something. At 500 feet the pilot chute came out, then
just a ball of material is all we could see.''
   He pulled the release on his back-up parachute, but it was too
late, Mayfield said. Charmet landed on a stack of lumber.
   An investigator from the Federal Aviation Administration arrived
Tuesday to inspect the parachute gear, which Charmet had packed
himself.
   Charmet lived in Montlhery, France, and was an instructor with
the Parachute Institute of France, authorities said.
   Small and lightly built with a gray beard and long gray hair, he
learned to jump while serving with the French Foreign Legion in
Algeria in the 1950s, and his 14,600-odd parachute jumps were
recognized as the world record by the United States Parachute
Association, Mayfield said.
   ``His favorite saying was, `Only skydivers know why birds
sing,''' Mayfield said. ``It's the freedom he would feel of leaving
the aircraft and being able to fly. That's what he felt.''
   For the past 15 years, Charmet had been spending a few months
each winter in this town of 2,400 people situated about 45 miles
southwest of Portland.
   ``He originally came here because he fell in love with a girl
traveling in France who was from here,'' Mayfield said. ``He
followed her here. When he arrived she was married to somebody else.
He liked the area and the people here, so he just came back every
year.''
   While in Sheridan, Charmet jumped repeatedly and broke the world
record here last year.
   Charmet's passion was accuracy jumping, leaving an airplane at
2,500 feet and landing on a 5-centimeter target.
   ``He'd make like 800 jumps in three months,'' Mayfield said. ``He
would line up four or five parachutes, pack them all, then make four
or five jumps. He would do this all day long.''

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Legislature meets in special session
Wednesday to debate Gov. Buddy Roemer's second plan to overhaul
Louisiana's tax system.
   Roemer, who pledged during the 1987 campaign to change the
state's populist-based tax system to lighten some of the burden on
businesses in order to create jobs, saw his original outline fail
before lawmakers in October.
   Legislators said their chief objection was a proposal to lower
the state's $75,000 homestead exemption from property taxation to
$25,000. Roemer has dropped the proposal, conceding it is
politically impossible now.
   ``It's much more of a consensus plan,'' Roemer said of the
revamped proposal. ``The Legislature has been much more intimately
involved in this. It's not everything I'd like to have, but I think
it's possible to pass.''
   Roemer said his plan would reduce state sales taxes by $100
million, increase income taxes by $175 million, give businesses a
tax break and create a highway, airport and port construction
program through a 4-cent excise tax on gasoline.
   The $75 million tax break for businesses would be made up through
income tax increases, mostly in the upper-income levels, the
governor said.
   Roemer said the move would help create jobs in a state plagued by
unemployment of more than 10 percent and help stabilize state
government, which has stumbled through several fiscal crises since
the collapse of oil prices and faces a $654 million shortfall for
the 1989-90 budget year.
   If the plan receives the necessary two-thirds vote from both
chambers, parts of it, such as the income tax increase, still must
be approved by the voters on April 29 in the form of a
constitutional amendment.
   Getting voters to back the plan may be the most difficult task,
one of Roemer's legislative floor leaders predicted.
   Rep. Ron Gomez, chairman of the House tax-writing committee, said
the program may be read by some voters as shifting business taxes
``on the backs of the people.''
   ``That's because we've operated so long under the rule of `Don't
tax you, don't tax me, tax the man behind the tree.' Well, there's
no one left behind the tree,'' said Gomez.

   A group of Palestinians attacked and stabbed an
Israeli soldier during an army raid in a small West Bank village
late Tuesday, and the wounded soldier opened fire, killing one of
his assailants, the army said.
   Elsewhere in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, army gunfire
wounded eight Palestinians on Tuesday, including a 14-year-old hit
in his thigh, a 13-year-old shot in the leg and an 18-year-old
critically wounded in the shoulder, Arab doctors said.
   Businesses in the occupied territories remained shut for a third
straight day in the longest work stoppage ordered by underground
uprising leaders.
   Observance of the strike was seen as a key test of the strength
of pro-PLO leaders of the uprising that began on Dec. 8, 1987. The
rebellion has killed 384 Palestinians and 16 Israelis.
   Dedi Zucker, a left-wing legislator, said Tuesday that most
Palestinian victims in the West Bank were killed during army raids
in remote villages and a growing number of the fatalities were
teen-agers rather than adults.
   Zucker, of the Citizens' Rights Movement, said a new Israeli
human rights group called Image was formed this week to rouse public
awareness of complaints of abuses by soldiers in the territories,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   ``People are ignoring what is happening,'' Zucker told a
gathering of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem.
   An army spokesman said a band of Palestinians attacked troops
making a security sweep on Tuesday in Abu Dis, a village of 3,000
about three miles east of Jerusalem, and that one of them stabbed
and slightly wounded a soldier while ``the others assisted in the
attack.''
   He said the injured soldier fired on the group, killing one Arab,
and that the others were detained. The spokesman, who remained
anonymous under army rules, did not elaborate, and it was not
immediately clear whether the victim actually did the stabbing or
assisted in it.
   An official at east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital identified the
man as 57-year-old Mohammed Said Rishik, and said he was shot in the
heart.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted family
members as saying Rishik was shot inside his house by men in
civilian clothes. But the army spokesman said he ``definitely
participated in the attack.''
   Zucker said a study of the 322 Palestinians the army says were
killed in the first 13 months of the uprising showed most West Bank
victims were from isolated villages rather than refugee camps, often
considered hotbeds of anti-Israeli activity.
   He said the raids are often staged to root out popular committees
who declare autonomy from Israeli authorities.
   Zucker's contentions challenged a key army assertion that
soldiers use violence in the occupied territories mainly in response
to stoning and firebomb attacks on troops and civilians.
   An army spokesman said raids in villages were essential to
maintaining order on West Bank highways.
   Zucker, whose party advocates a separate Palestinian state, urged
the army to help prevent shootings by soldiers by giving stiffer
punishments to troops convicted of violating open-fire regulations.
   Also Tuesday, police officials said a Jewish cabbie whose taxi
burst into flames in the West Bank on Feb. 8 was killed by a fire
resulting from a technical fault in his vehicle, and not a firebomb
attack as earlier believed.
   Immediately after the death, Jewish settlers stoned Arab-owned
cars and injured two Palestinian motorists.

   The Bush administration on Tuesday targeted
South Korea and the 12-nation European Community for possible trade
sanctions if the countries do not agree to lower trade barriers
blocking U.S. export sales of telecommunications equipment.
   The decision was announced by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills, who acted after a five-month investigation required under the
1988 Trade Act.
   The law requires the United States to open negotiations with
countries deemed by U.S. trade officials to be blocking sales by
American firms of telecommunications equipment.
   If the talks don't succeed in removing trade barriers within a
year, the law requires the administration to impose trade sanctions.
However, the administration has the option of extending the talks
for as long as two more years if U.S. officials believe that
progress is being made.
   The announcement said the decision was made by Mrs. Hills after
reviewing comments from industry, labor, other federal agencies,
members of Congress and foreign governments.
   ``Criteria for the examination included not only trade barriers,
but also each nation's market potential and any measurable progress
that it might be making toward (trade) liberalization,'' the trade
office said in a statement.

   More than 100 Jewish youths, shouting ``Free
the Pollards now!,'' took their case Tuesday to the rainy steps of
the Justice Department, where they demanded a re-examination of the
sentences and treatment of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard and his
wife.
   ``We will not be silent,'' said Jacob Davidson, president of the
North American Jewish Students' Network, which organized the rally
of high school and college students, most of them from the New
York-New Jersey metropolitan area.
   Although Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was not in town and no
one from his office came outside to meet with the demonstrators,
Davidson said, ``I want them to know this issue is not dead.''
   Pollard, 34, was sentenced in April 1987 to life in prison after
he was convicted of supplying classified U.S. documents to Israeli
agents. His wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, 28, was given a five-year
sentence as an accessory to her husband's illegal possession of the
documents.
   ``Nothing he turned over to Israel damaged American society in
any way,'' said Davidson, comparing Pollard's situation with that of
John A. Walker Jr., who provided countless U.S. Navy secrets to the
Soviet Union.
   Both Pollard and Walker are serving life sentences at the federal
prison in Marion, Ill. They are eligible to request parole after 10
years.
   Mrs. Pollard, whose sentence made her eligible for parole after
20 months, or last December, was turned down by the parole board
last summer, said her father, Bernard Henderson. All three had
pleaded guilty as part of plea-bargain arrangements.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller said, ``The Pollard case
is closed and there is no reason to reopen it. He has attorneys, and
if they can make some kind of a legal point, the legal process is
open to them.''
   Meanwhile, Israeli sources said Elyakim Rubinstein, an envoy from
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, was meeting this week with U.S.
officials in Washington to try to work out an arrangement that would
remove the threat of indictment or subpoena from four Israelis
connected with the Pollard case.
   The four Israelis are Col. Aviem Sella, Pollard's handler; Irit
Erb, a secretary at the Israeli Embassy who photocopied the
documents Pollard provided; Yosef Yagur, an Israeli attache who was
one of Pollard's liaisons with Israel, and Rafi Eitan, who was in
charge of the Pollard project. All are in Israel and have stayed
away from the United States out of fear of arrest.

   George Bush has never been to Sarawak. He
hasn't made it to Benin either. He's also passed up Suriname and has
not set foot in Chad, although he flew over it once.
   From a look at the president's itinerary as a government
official, however, it appears these are among a relatively few
countries he hasn't visited.
   Unlike President Reagan, who had made only a few trips abroad
before entering the White House, Bush goes to Japan, China and Seoul
this month with a well-stamped passport already in his pocket.
   In eight years as vice president, he visited 82 countries.
   This will be his fifth trip to China, where he has traveled to
Soujou, Chengdu, Guilin, Guanzhou and Shenzen as well as Beijing.
   He has sailed through a gorge of limestone peaks along the Li
River, cruised on the Nile to view the tombs and temples of the
Pharaohs, and gone speedboating on the Gulf of Aqaba with Jordan's
King Hussein.
   He has toured a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant in Shenzen, an oil
refinery in North Yemen, a water treatment plant in Cairo and a farm
in Poland with a thatch roof on its 100-year-old barn.
   He bumped through a desert game preserve in four-wheel-drive vans
in North Yemen, made a bumpy landing in a helium-filled craft Expo
86 in Vancouver, B.C., and stood atop a Jordanian bunker overlooking
the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
   He has met in his travels with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
Pope John Paul II, French President Francois Mitterrand, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, among others.
   On the way he has made some provocative comments. On the deck of
the carrier Enterprise in the Gulf of Oman, he called Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi a ``mad dog.'' Touring the Persian gulf, he touched
a political nerve by expressing concern about plummeting oil prices.
In Belgium, he heard a report of a new Soviet tank and said if
Soviet tank mechanics ran out of work ``send them to Detroit because
we could use that kind of ability.''
   He has attended the funerals of three Soviet leaders.
   Bush first went to China in September, 1974, and spent 16 months
as the U.S. envoy to Beijing. He returned in 1977 as a guest of the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, went back as
Republican vice presidential candidate in 1980 and carried out
missions to China for President Reagan in 1982 and 1985.
   In 1972, while U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bush
traveled to Khartoum, Sudan, and Nairobi, Kenya.
   Here is a rundown of his travels as vice president:
   June, 1981 _ France, England and the Philippines, where he
represented the United States at the inauguration of President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   September, 1981 _ Independence celebration in Mexico.
   October, 1981 _ Dominican Republic, Colombia and Brazil.
   April, 1982 _ Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and
China.
   November, 1982 _ Cape Verde, Senegal, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Kenya and Zaire, then to Moscow for funeral of Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev.
   February, 1983 _ West Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium,
Switzerland, Italy, France, England.
   March, 1983 _ Canada.
   June and July, 1983 _ England, West Germany, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Denmark, Ireland and Iceland.
   September, 1983 _ Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Yugoslavia, Romania,
Hungary and Austria.
   October, 1983 _ Jamaica, Lebanon.
   December, 1983 _ Argentina for inauguration of President Raul
Alfonsin, Panama and El Salvador.
   February, 1984 _ England, Italy, France, Luxembourg, and to
Moscow for funeral of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov.
   April, 1984 _ Switzerland, for disarmament conference in Geneva.
   May, 1984 _ Japan, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Oman.
   March, 1985 _ Sudan, Niger and Mali, then to Geneva to report on
the African drought and on to Moscow for the funeral of Soviet
leader Konstantin Chernenko and a meeting with Gorbachev, followed
by stop in Brazil for inauguration of President Tancredeo Neves and
visits to Grenada and Honduras.
   June, 1985 _ Italy, West Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium,
Switzerland, France, England.
   October, 1985 _ China, Hong Kong.
   April, 1986 _ West Germany, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, North

<HEAD>US: Soviets Left Millions of Mines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet military forces left 10 million to 30
million land mines behind them when they pulled out of Afghanistan,
posing a ``tremendous impediment'' to the safe return and
resettlement of millions of refugees, a Defense Department official
told Congress on Wednesday.
   The official, Edward W. Gnehm Jr., deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Near Eastern affairs, said the Pentagon, operating under
United Nations auspices, has begun a comprehensive program of mine
awareness and disposal training for Afghan refugees in camps inside
Pakistan.
   A State Department witness reported, meanwhile, the Soviets have
halted air strikes into Afghanistan from bases inside Soviet
territory, ending the largest remaining problem of active warfare in
the country.
   Howard Schaffer, deputy assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern Affairs, said also that because the level of human need
inside the country is ``enormous,'' the Bush administration is
``taking a fresh, sympathetic look'' into the possibility of
extending humanitarian assistance.
   He also said _ without offering an explanation _ the State
Department is confident that whatever government emerges in Kabul in
the aftermath of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan
``will be neither communist nor messianic Islamic.''
   Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian
and Pacific Affairs, Gnehm said a 40-person military training team,
part of a project dubbed ``Operation Safe Passage,'' has been
dispatched to Pakistan and will spend six months ``increasing the
awareness of large numbers of Afghan refugees of the threats they
will face as they return to their homes.''
   He said Afghan teams will be trained and given special equipment
to ``neutralize and dispose of land mines in their country.''
   Gnehm said that training posters have been produced in some of
the principal languages of Afghanistan which warn: ``Thousands of
people have been martyred by mines;'' ``Don't touch mines, they are
deadly'' and, ``All kinds of mines have been placed in Afghanistan.''
   Gnehm called the training program ``an unprecedented application
of special military skills for alleviating suffering from the
aftermaths of a terrible and brutal war.''
   ``Estimates of the number of mines range from 10 million to 30
million,'' Gnehm said. ``Most of the mines are antipersonnel devices
that have been scattered almost indiscriminately.''
   Responding to questions, he said that while the Soviets have said
they would they were defusing mines and were giving the communist
government in Kabul maps showing their location, ``to our knowledge
neither of these things has happened.
   He said the locations of the mines would be extremely difficult
to map since many of the antipersonnel devices were sewn from planes
and helicopters.
   He said an another danger is posed by the fact that heavy rains
have washed some of the explosive devices down from hill and
mountainsides into valleys used for farming.
   Gnehm also reported that since the first flight of an Air Force
C-5 cargo plane to Pakistan in March 1986, there have been a total
of 76 relief flights carrying more than 4.7 million pounds of excess
Defense Department property and privately donated supplies, all
intended to aid the refugees.
   Additionally, he said some 680 injured Afghan citizens have been
flown to Western Europe, Egypt and the United States to receive
medical treatment.

<HEAD>Additional $30 Million Damages Recommended in 1978 Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired judge Tuesday recommended a $30 million
increase in his $85.2 million judgment against Amoco Corp. for
oil-spill damage from the 1978 wreck of a supertanker off the French
coast.
   The revised award would be shared by the government of France _
which would receive the single largest portion, $44.4 million _ and
some 100 French towns affected by the spill that fouled 100 miles of
coastline.
   Frank McGarr, who retired as a U.S. District Court judge after
his 1988 ruling, continues to serve as special master in the case
and made the recommendation after being asked by parties in the case
to reconsider the award.
   The recommendation is subject to approval by another federal
judge; no date has been set for a final judgment.
   Both sides objected to the revised award as well and vowed to
appeal. None of the money has been paid. The towns had received $7.3
million in the original judgment and sought an additional $8 million
but received only $200,000 more.
   ``Today's damage determinations continue to support the position
the Amoco parties have maintained throughout: that the claims of
damage from this unfortunate incident were exaggerated,''
Chicago-based Amoco said in a statement.
   ``What we will be asking the appeals court to do is recognize the
damage to the environment, the livelihoods of the people in
Brittany, and the quality of life,'' said attorney Barry Kingham,
who represented the towns, association of oystermen and fishermen,
hoteliers, and the two French counties most affected by the spill.
   ``The judge refused to recognize those damages and he continues
to reject them. He simply gave out-of-pocket expenses for the
cleanup effort.''
   Attorneys for both sides said the revised award totals about $115
million _ $61 million in damages and between $54 million and $60
million in interest.
   The supertanker Amoco Cadiz ran aground two miles off the
Brittany coast. The tanker, which had lost the use of its rudder,
had been under tow through the English Channel when the towlines
snapped in hurricane-force winds and heavy seas.
   The tanker lost 68 million gallons of mostly Iranian light crude
oil valued at $24 million. The spill killed thousands of birds and
millions of sea creatures and washing wave after wave of thick black
tar along the coast.
   In 1984, McGarr ruled that Amoco and two subsidiaries were liable
because of negligence in the design, repair and maintenance of the
vessel, which was 300 feet wide and longer than three football
fields.

   Rep. Bill Grant, a little-known Democratic
congressman from a conservative district in the Florida Panhandle,
bolted to the Republican Party on Tuesday in a move President Bush
hailed as ``good news for our party.''
   Grant easily won election twice as a Democrat, even as his state
was moving toward Republican candidates.
   ``Florida is on the move,'' Bush, who met with Grant about the
switch last week, said before network television cameras. ``The
nation, I think, benefits from this.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, leader of House Democrats, said:
   ``It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I hope
he's happy.''
   Grant, 46, a former banker from the small town of Madison in the
state's Panhandle, was officially changing his voter registration
later in the day.
   His switch tips the balance in the makeup of Florida's House
delegation, leaving it at 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats and
breaking the Democratic Party's long-time majority.
   Bush said the change ``is good news for our party, not only in
Florida, not only in the South, but nationally.''
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown said ``I'm frankly not
real concerned about it.'' But some other Democrats voiced outrage
that Grant would change parties so soon after the election, and Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said finding a Democratic challenger would be a
top priority for the committee.
   Charles Whitehead, Florida state Democratic chairman, called
Grant ``a political opportunist'' who plans to run for statewide
office. He said Grant should resign and seek his seat again as a
Republican.
   Whitehead said Grant supported Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis last year and, after appearing at a joint campaign
event, ``emphatically requested that he be allowed to have
photographs made with Governor Dukakis.''
   Bush was asked if Grant's change helps the party overcome its
embarrassment at the election Saturday of David Duke, a former
leader of the Ku Klux Klan, to a seat in the Louisiana Legislature
as a Republican.
   Bush defended his stated opposition to Duke, and that of Lee
Atwater, the national GOP chairman, but acknowledged that ``maybe
there was some feeling in Metairie, La., that the president of the
United States involving himself in a state legislative election was
improper or overkill.''
   Grant met with the president Thursday about changing party
affiliation and made his decision over the weekend, said Republican
consultant Charles Black.
   Black, who knew Grant through mutual political friends, put Grant
in contact with Atwater, who arranged the meeting with the president.
   Grant said his switch ``is not going to change my values, nor
will it change the way that I vote.''
   ``After a period of prolonged and careful deliberation, I have
determined that I can better represent the values and the priorities
of north Floridians in the State of Florida as a Republican,'' he
said.
   Another Florida congressman, Andy Ireland, switched from the
Democratic to Republican party four years ago.
   The most successful of the recent party switchers has been Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, who became a Republican in 1982 as a House
member and later won election to the Senate. Unlike the later
Florida defectors, however, Gramm resigned his seat when he made the
switch and then won election to his old seat in the special election
that followed.
   Grant served four years in Florida's state Senate before winning
election to the House in 1986, when 12-term Rep. Don Fuqua, a
Democrat, retired. Grant won 51 percent of the vote in a
five-candidate primary and had no Republican opponent in the general
election.
   Grant's 2nd congressional district stretches along the border
with Georgia from near Panama City to just west of Jacksonville and
includes Tallahassee, the state capital.
   Last fall, two Republican upsets in races for traditionally
Democratic congressional seats eroded the Democrats' majority in the
Florida delegation. At the same time, Republicans picked up one of
Florida's Senate seats with the retirement of Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   Grant has been active in the Democratic Party and had figured in
speculation for a possible run for governor in 1990. He drew
publicity last summer for his unsuccessful campaign in support of
Sen. Bob Graham for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, called Grant's switch ``further proof that
we are moving toward majority status.''
   Grant's decision hardly changes the overall House balance,
however; Democrats have a 258-175 advantage, with two vacancies,
after the switch.

   The government maintains North is a liar who placed ``himself

president about a secret operation conducted by government officials
and private businessmen from 1984 when Congress forbade further aid
to the Contras until the fall of 1986 when the public first learned
of the activities.
   ``The need for secrecy is no excuse for lies,'' said John Keker
who presented opening arguments from the office of independent

   For an innocent man, William Chinn
spends a lot of time in court.
   The West Palm Beach carpenter keeps getting stopped for driving
on a suspended license because that's what the State Police computer
says.
   ``I'm going nuts. I can't take this any more,'' said Chinn.
   A state official promised Tuesday to ``help him all we can,'' and
she said she hoped to get the mistake corrected soon.
   David Wayne Whitehead, a 27-year-old driver with a long record,
used Chinn's stolen license when he was stopped for drunken driving
in October, and Chinn's license was suspended because Whitehead
refused a blood-alcohol test, authorities said.
   As a result, Chinn was cited last month for driving on a
suspended license and spent Valentine's Day in court explaining to a
judge, who dismissed the charge after being shown a court order
expunging Chinn's record.
   On Saturday, Chinn, 24, was stopped in South Palm Beach for
driving with a broken tail light, and a computer check revealed the
drunken-driving conviction.
   Chinn showed newspaper articles about his plight to the police
officer, but Chinn got a citation anyway. ``I'll have to take off
from work again to appear in court, and my boss will probably fire
me,'' he said.
   Police were not sympathetic.
   ``There's nothing we can do on our end,'' said South Palm Beach
Police Chief Stan Morse. ``We put it (the license) in the computer
and it came back suspended. It's up to Tallahassee to straighten it
out.''
   Eloise Krell, staff assistant to the chief of the bureau of
records in the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor
Vehicles, said she has received the court order and Chinn's mother
sent newspaper clippings.
   ``I told his mother that I would mail him a corrected driving
record, and that way he will have that to take to court with him,''
she said.
   She said she was having problems with a new computer system but
added, ``I am determined to clear this before I leave today.''
   As for Whitehead, he was sentenced Jan. 26 to 7{ years in prison
after his 10th drunken-driving conviction.

<HEAD>Bush Names Career Diplomat to Mexico, Despite Objections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to nominate career
diplomat John Negroponte as ambassador to Mexico, the White House
announced Tuesday, despite objections in that country.
   When word spread last month of Bush's intention to nominate
Negroponte, a number of prominent Mexicans recommended that their
government reject the appointment because of his role in supporting
the Reagan administration's Central America policy.
   Negroponte served as ambassador to Honduras during Reagan's first
term and later worked as deputy director of the National Security
Council.
   Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari held a
friendly meeting after Bush's election last November but the
prospective appointment of Negroponte has still become an issue
between the two governments.
   Negroponte's strong identification with Reagan's Central America
policy comes against a background of long years of Mexican hostility
to the U.S. approach to that region.
   The criticism has come from both the right and left.
   ``National authorities have the right to keep officials who are
highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming
posts in Mexican territory,'' said Diego Fernandez, a leader of the
conservative National Action Party.
   Amalia Garcia, of Mexico's largest leftist party, also urged
Salinas to reject the appointment.
   And a member of the center-left Authentic Party's congressional
delegation, Oscar Mauro Ramirez, said Negroponte is an expert in
combatting Latin American ``libertarian forces.''
   The uproar over Negroponte prompted the outgoing U.S. ambassador
to Mexico, Charles Pilliod, to predict that relations are ``going to
improve further'' because Negroponte ``has always done his job with
efficiency and dedication.''
   Negroponte said Tuesday in a telephone interview, ``I am very
honored that President Bush has nominated me for this extremely
important position. If confirmed by the Senate, I sincerely hope
that during my tenure as ambassador I can make a positive
contribution to U.S.-Mexican relations.''
   The most difficult issue facing the two countries is how to deal
with Mexico's $103 billion foreign debt. Another problem is Mexico's
objection to a U.S. plan to dig a ditch near San Diego to reduce
border crossings by drug smugglers and illegal immigrants.
   Negroponte, 49, was deputy assistant to Reagan for national
security affairs, beginning in 1987, and before that served two
years as assistant secretary of state for oceans and environmental
and scientific affairs.
   He was ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985. He entered the
Foreign Service in 1960 and served in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Greece and
Ecuador and as a member of the U.S. delegation to the Paris peace
talks on Vietnam in 1968-1969.

   A government regulatory agency concluded
Tuesday that the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures
market, does a poor job of detecting abuses and investigates
potential violations sluggishly.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reviewed the
board of trade's performance from July 1987 to April 1988, said the
board's routine computer surveillance program was ``not properly
tailored to efficiently identify potential trading abuses.''
   ``The (commission staff) believes that significant modifications
to the (surveillance) program are necessary for ... an effective ...
system,'' the report said. It called on the exchange to expand the
number of futures contracts reviewed per month, the amount of
trading activity examined each day and the number of traders
analyzed.
   A similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last review
of the board of trade in 1986, but received little public attention.
However, the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in Chicago
is reviewing evidence from a two-year FBI undercover investigation
of widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In reaction to the FBI probe, Congress is closely scrutinizing
both the Chicago markets and the commission's oversight of them. The
agency's legislative authorization expires Sept. 30 and Congress may
demand reforms before passing it.
   The commission praised the board of trade on several points,
saying it effectively collects information on and monitors general
market activity, it thoroughly investigates specific complaints from
customers or referrals from other traders and it levies appropriate
punishments for violations.
   However, the agency said ``the exchange did not interview all
individuals who might have had knowledge of questionable activity''
and it noted ``undue delays in completing investigations.''
   ``The completion of numerous ... investigations was unduly
delayed because of the lack of timely supervisory review,'' the
report said.
   In response to the report, board of trade officials noted that
the exchange's directors voted earlier this month to spend $1
million this year to improve the exchange's computerized trade
reconstruction system, which is designed to catch improper trades.
   Officials estimated then that the system was about 90 percent
effective in catching abuses. They said the upgrade would increase
the system's effectiveness to 100 percent.
   They also noted that over the past three years the exchange has
expanded its investigative office by 75 percent.
   ``We are always looking for constructive criticism about our rule
enforcement record from the CFTC,'' Board of Trade President Thomas
R. Donovan said in a statement.
   The CFTC report took note of the improvements, but said, ``It is
too soon to evaluate the changes.''
   Meanwhile, Reps. Glenn English, D-Okla., and Thomas Coleman,
R-Mo., on Tuesday asked the CFTC to delay approving new futures
contracts until the completion of a House Agriculture Committee
review of the agency and the FBI probe.
   Eric Hauser, an aide to English, who is in charge of the
committee's review, said the request would affect three active
applications for new foreign exchange futures contracts filed by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday denounced as
``vicious rumor'' allegations against Defense Secretary-designate
John Tower and declared they had been ``gunned down'' by a thorough
FBI report. A Senate committee vote on the embattled nominee was
tentatively scheduled for Thursday.
   Urging the Senate to move ``forthrightly'' on the nomination,
Bush said at a news conference that he had personally reviewed
portions of the FBI report into Tower's alleged drinking,
philandering and financial improprieties.
   ``What I got from it was that there has been a very unfair
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up,'' the president said.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile,
scrutinized the report, which the White House forwarded to committee
chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking Republican John Warner of
Virginia late Monday.
   The two senators said in a statement that the committee would
meet in a closed session Wednesday and hoped to vote Thursday
``assuming that members of the committee have read and analyzed the
latest FBI report.''
   Asked about the closed committee session, Nunn later told
reporters: ``I want to hear what other people think too. This is a
committee decision, not a decision by the chairman or the ranking
members. All the members will have access to all the information.''
   One Republican on the committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
said he had reviewed the FBI's findings and saw nothing to
disqualify Tower. ``I do not understand the problems that others
have, and I hope they will be more specific,'' he said.
   Another committee GOP member, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming,
said he read the report and his reaction was ``one of deep, personal
anger ... at the system which permitted so many unsubstantiated
charges.'' Wallop told The Associated Press that the allegations
have proven to be ``unfounded and mean-spirited,'' and said he plans
to vote for Tower.
   And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said ``we ought to
have a unanimous vote'' for Tower.
   But Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a prominent conservative, said
Tower should withdraw his nomination because he has lost the
credibility needed to promote Bush's defense agenda.
   ``I think John Tower has a substantial problem,'' Edwards told
reporters. ``I don't think that has anything to do with who he's
sleeping with or whether he has one glass of wine before he goes to
bed or two.''
   Edwards said the question is whether Tower, a former Republican
senator who once chaired the Armed Services Committee, can be
credible in dealing with defense contractors after accepting nearly
$1 million from major weapons manufacturers as a consultant since he
left the Senate in 1985.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser,
acknowledged in a briefing that policy-making is being undermined
because Bush has not been able to assemble his full team of Pentagon
and State Department officials.
   ``I think it is in a way unfortunate that the president doesn't
have his national security team in place as yet. ... Of course, that
is a problem in making new policy,'' Scowcroft said. ``But we're
moving ahead, and I'm comfortable with that.''
   Bush, responding to reporters' questions at the White House, said
he was ``convinced that he (Tower) is not only capable of doing this
job, but will do it in an outstanding way.''
   Published reports have said the FBI found that Tower drank
excessively in the 1970s, but no longer does so. Asked about that,
and whether the former senator had undergone treatment, Bush replied:
   ``I say there is no evidence of any kind of the disease _
alcoholism. None. None whatsoever.''
   Bush said the report ``speaks to the fact that a lot of the
charges ... I'd say all of these charges that we've read about _
have been rumor, and a lot of it vicious rumor.''
   The president said the allegations against Tower ``that have been
hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of fact.''
   ``I've seen nothing in there that would make me if I was a
senator, vote against Senator Tower,'' Bush added.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine told reporters he
didn't know when the committee would act on the nomination and said
the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been ``at the request
of the White House.''
   Warner said he met Monday night with Kenneth Adelman, the former
arms control chief who in published reports last week was critical
of Tower's conduct as a U.S. negotiator in Geneva. Warner said
Adelman had expressed an opinion based on facts the committee
already had in its possession.
   In another development, the House Commerce and Energy oversight
and investigations subcommittee met Tuesday with former arms control
chairman Max Kampelman as part of the panel's separate inquiry into
Department of Energy security clearances.
   The House subcommittee is planning a closed session Wednesday
with Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer. Indahl had
been sent to Geneva in 1986 to investigate allegations of security
breaches in the U.S. delegation while Tower was a member of the
contingent.
   Indahl told investigators Sunday that the separate probe had
turned up allegations against Tower, said congressional sources, who
requested anonymity. At that meeting, the sources said, Indahl
corroborated a report that Tower, while in Geneva, had used his
secretaries as mistresses.
   Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported in Tuesday's editions
that as a senator from Texas Tower profited from a lucrative oil
investment arranged in 1981 by a Corpus Christi lawyer whose son
Tower recommended for nomination to the federal bench.
   Bush, asked about the report at his news conference, said, ``I
never heard such a report and ... you're telling me something I
don't know anything about.''
   A spokesman for Tower on Tuesday denied there had been any ``quid
pro quo'' involving the oil investment and the judicial nomination.

<TEXT>
   Leading dissident Vaclav Havel was
convicted Tuesday for his role in a banned rally and sentenced to
nine months in jail in a trial that drew criticism at home, in the
East bloc and the West.
   In a six-hour trial, Judge Helena Hlavata found the
world-renowned playwright guilty on charges of inciting citizens to
take part in banned demonstrations and obstructing police officers.
   Havel was taken into custody Jan. 16 after gatherings in central
Prague, and his continued incarceration has sparked unprecedented
calls for his release at home and abroad.
   The prosecutor had demanded a one-year sentence for Havel and a
fine of about $2,500. But Ms. Hlavata decreed a nine-month sentence,
which Havel appealed, and said no fine was necessary.
   Each time Havel was brought to the courtroom during three breaks
in the trial, supporters kept in an adjacent stairwell by police
yelled ``Long Live Havel!'' and demanded his freedom. Western
reporters outside the courtroom said at least three people were
detained.
   In another courtroom, seven other dissidents face hooliganism
charges from their attempt to lay flowers Jan. 16 in memory of Jan
Palach, a student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. That trial was adjourned until
Wednesday.
   In a closing speech, Havel defiantly declared he was not guilty
of inciting people to attend a commemoration Jan. 15 for Palach in
Prague's Wenceslas Square or of ignoring appeals to leave the square
the next day.
   ``I do not feel guilty, but if punished, will accept the sentence
as a sacrifice for a good cause, nothing in the light of the
ultimate sacrifice of Jan Palach,'' Havel said.
   He rejected what he said were prosecution attempts to label him
``anti-socialist and anti-state,'' saying these labels have ``lost
any semantic meaning'' through overuse.
   ``In different stages of life, three general secretaries were
labeled like this _ Slansky, Husak and Dubcek,'' Havel said,
referring to former Communist Party chiefs Rudolf Slansky, executed
after a show trial in the 1950s; current President Gustav Husak; and
Alexander Dubcek, who headed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968
but was replaced by Husak in 1969.
   Havel, a founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement who has
spent four years in jail after being convicted of sedition, said the
movement always had sought peaceful dialogue with the authorities.
   ``Warning voices of this kind were not listened to, and today the
present power harvests what it has sown, the fruit of its proud
attitude,'' he said.
   Among the two dozen people in the tiny, drab courtroom were
Havel's wife, Olga; his brother, Ivan; and Ivan's wife, Dasha. The
only journalists were four Czechoslovak reporters, a Soviet reporter
and a correspondent from The Associated Press.
   The family, which has not been allowed to visit Havel in jail,
was granted a five-minute chat after sentencing. Ivan Havel said his
brother was ``touched by the support'' he has received inside and
outside Czechoslovakia.
   Seven witnesses were called, including plainclothes police
officer Maj. Peter Zak, who said he had seen Havel around the square
before arresting him.
   The prosecution argued on the charge of obstructing police
officers that Havel failed to obey warnings to leave the square.
Several hundred had formed there Jan. 16 after the other dissidents
were arrested for trying to lay the flowers.
   Until August, when 10,000 people marched in Prague on the 20th
anniversary of the 1968 invasion, there had been no mass protests in
the city for 19 years.
   Seven of the other dissidents on trial are members of Charter 77
and other independent groups formed in the last year in what
activists say is a sign of the increasing dissatisfaction and thirst
for reform in Czechoslovakia. An eighth, Dana Nemcova, is
hospitalized and will be tried separately.
   The case against Havel on the incitement charge centered on an
appeal broadcast via Western radio stations after he received an
anonymous letter on Jan. 9. The letter purported to be from a group
of students who said they would use a commemoration for Palach Jan.
15 to repeat his act of self-immolation.
   Havel argued he had a responsibility to dissuade anyone from such
an action and said he telephoned the appeal to the Western radio
stations after his efforts to get it on Czechoslovak state TV failed.
   Ms. Hlavata read transcripts from Radio Free Europe and the
British Broadcasting Corp. to support the prosecution case.
   A crowd of 5,000 people gathered Jan. 15 on Wenceslas Square and
was broken up by riot police using batons, tear gas, water cannons
and dogs.
   Other demonstrations occurred that week in Prague at the same
time Czechoslovakia had committed itself to new human rights accords
at a Helsinki conference in Vienna.
   The International Helsinki Federation, whose representatives from
the United States and Austria were denied permission to attend the
trial, said Havel's jailing contravened the 1975 Helsinki Final Act
and the Vienna accords.
   In Hungary, where the Communist Party has legalized independent
groups, the official Writers' Union protested Havel's detention in a
public letter.
   In Czechoslovakia, more than 2,000 intellectuals, some of them
party members, signed a petition calling for his release.
   The banned, rightist Confederation for an Independent Poland
organized a rally that drew about 1,000 people to the main square of
Krakow, Poland, to hear speeches supporting Havel, said Robert
Bogdanski, a spokesman for the Solidarity Information Service. He
said authorities detained four people.
   The West German government condemned Havel's sentencing, saying
it violates the spirit of recent human rights accords.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said in a statement in
Stockholm that the sentencing indicates Czechoslovak authorities
``don't respect the commitments they have made regarding human
rights.''
   Karel Kyncl of the London-based monthly magazine Index on
Censorship said on British Broadcasting Corp. TV news: ``It's
turning the clock back to Stalinism.''

   Leftist guerrillas attacked the
country's most important army base and an engineer detachment
Tuesday, killing eight people and wounding 17.
   The attacks came as representatives of El Salvador's major
political parties met in Mexico with top commanders of the guerrilla
army to discuss a modified insurgent electoral proposal the rebels
say could end the war.
   ``Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only
continue, but will escalate,'' said the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front's radio.
   The 9-year-old war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of
them civilians.
   The early morning attack on the 4,000-member 1st Brigade's
headquarters was the fifth on a major military installation in this
capital since November. With jurisdiction over the capital and its
environs, the brigade headquarters is considered the country's most
important military installation.
   The commander of the 1st army brigade reported no casualties
inside the downtown base and that damage was negligible, but he
refused to allow journalists inside.
   The rebels used two pickup trucks fitted with catapults. The
detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs and
simultaneously blows up the vehicle.
   The explosion of one of the vehicles killed Pedro Martinez, about
70 years old, and his wife Maria Teresa, about 65, who lived in a
house near the headquarters.
   The rebels also attacked the headquarters of the Detachment of
Engineers in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.
Officers there said three soldiers, including a major, were killed
at Zacatecoluca; one civilian and a Civil Defense trooper were
killed in fighting nearby.
   Martinez's body lay on the sidewalk in front of his humble home
an hour after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded at 6:20 a.m.
   Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the first brigade, said Mrs.
Martinez, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died on the way to
the hospital. He said three people, all civilians were wounded by
the explosions.
   The explosions broke windows, gouged walls and blew doors off
hinges in 12 homes.
   In Zacatecoluca, guerrillas and soldiers battled for three hours
before dawn around the engineers' base, according to officials
there, including base commander Col. Benjamin Canjura.
   He said Maj. Donald Sampson was killed in the fighting. Three
other soldiers were reported killed when a rocket-propelled grenade
hit the truck in which they were traveling. One civilian and one
Civil Defense trooper were killed in a clash in a nearby village.
   Canjura said 13 soldiers and one civilian were wounded in the
fighting. There was no immediate word on guerrilla casualties.
   In Mexico, the guerrillas proposed that elections be postponed
from March 19 to June and that a cease-fire be insituted. It was a
switch from previous demands the election be postponed until
September, but left constitutional problems unresolved.
   The constitution calls for President Jose Napoleon Duarte to
leave office on June 1; right-wing and center political parties have
opposed any change in that date and the army has hinted of a coup if
Duarte overstays.
   The guerrillas say the parties are hiding behind the constitution
because they don't want to negotiate seriously.

   Israeli-allied militiamen clashed with
pro-Syrian Moslem militiamen Tuesday in the first major outbreak of
hostilities this year, police said.
   Also Tuesday, five people were wounded in shelling by
Israeli-backed militiamen in a Shiite Moslem village after a
guerrilla attack, police reported.
   They said militiamen of the mainly Christian South Lebanon Army,
Israel's proxy militia in southern Lebanon, and pro-Syrian Sunni
Moslem gunmen of the Popular Liberation Army traded artillery in the
hilltop Kfar Falous village south of Sidon.
   Police did not have an immediate casualty figure from the Kfar
Falous fighting. They said a few shells fell in orange groves in
Sidon, inflicting damage but no casualties.
   Kfar Falous is the forwardmost position held by the SLA in
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   The two militias have clashed frequently around Kfar Falous in
the last three years, but they have refrained from mounting ground
assaults against each other.
   In the other incident, police said pro-Iranian Shiite
fundamentalist guerrillas attacked South Lebanon Army positions in
the hilltop villages of Alman and Shoumarieh inside the security
zone.
   The guerrillas fired four Katyusha rockets at the two positions,
touching off a three-hour clash with machine-gun fire, they said.
   South Lebanon Army militiamen and Israeli troops retaliated by
shelling Zawtar, four miles from the southern market town of
Nabatiyeh.
   Police said among the casualties were a 54-year-old man and his
wife and daughter, who were injured when a mortar round slammed into
their house.
   In another development, a Norwegian humanitarian organization
appealed for the release of doctor Jan Cools, one of its officials
who was kidnapped nine months ago.
   ``We want to appeal to all good forces in Lebanon to help us in
our efforts to have Jan Cools released,'' said a statement released
by the Norwegian Aid Committee at a news conference in west Beirut.
   The organization, known as NORWAC, provides humanitarian and
medical support to Palestinians.
   Cools, 32, a Belgian physician working with NORWAC, was abdcuted
last May 21 near the southern port city of Tyre after leaving his
clinic in the nearby Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp.
   A group calling itself Soldiers Of Justice claimed responsibility
for the abduction. It has not made any demands in return for his
release.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Asking Whether 1950s Political Trials Were Rigged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders have asked historians
and jurists to determine whether political trials in the 1950s were
rigged, an official said Tuesday.
   The move could be a step toward rehabilitating leaders of the
1956 anti-communist uprising, some of whom were executed and buried
in unmarked graves.
   The Communist party leadership, on the second and final day of a
Central Committee meeting, also heard a report on the new
constitution, which is to leave out any reference to the leading
role of the party and allow a multi-party system.
   Gyoergy Fejti, secretary of the party Central Committee, said the
party has asked that a panel of legal experts and historians look
into the period from 1946 to 1962 to ``expose any possibility of
rigged procedures'' at trials conducted during that period.
   ``In search of a public consensus, we must strive to see that
suitable amends are made to those affected within the rehabilitation
process,'' Fejti told a news conference at the close of the meeting.
   But he appealed for patience and understanding, saying the
historical review would ``take time and we don't know what the
results will be.''
   The announcement came less than 10 days after the 108-member
Central Committee partially reassessed the 1956 revolt. That meeting
was provoked by leading reformer Imre Pozsgay, who said the revolt
that for 32 years was termed a counterrevolution was a popular
uprising.
   The leadership of the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers'
(communist) Party reached a compromise formulation saying the revolt
had both popular and counterrevolutionary elements.
   The revolt, led by Imre Nagy against the regime of the Stalinist
Matyas Rakosi, started Oct. 23, 1956, and was brought to a bloody
end Nov. 4 that year when it was quashed by Soviet troops.
   Nagy and his associates were executed in June 1958. According to
a Ministry of Justice decree issued at the time, he and his
associates were sentenced to death for ``conspiracy to overthrow the
Hungarian People's Democratic System.''
   There have been repeated calls in Hungary for the rehabilitation
of Nagy and his associates. Authorities announced recently that they
would allow their reburial in marked graves.
   The purpose of the meeting ending Tuesday was to review main
concepts in the new constitution that will allow a multi-party
system, place greater emphasis on human and civil rights, and
strengthen political institutions, including giving the president
and Parliament a larger role.
   Fejti presented the main concepts of the new constitution, which
is to be adopted next year.
   ``We do not see the need and sense of the constitutional
formulation on the leading role'' of the Communist party, he was
quoted by the official MTI news agency as saying.
   However, he added that this ``does not mean that the HSWP
(Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party) renounces the political effort
and intention that it wishes to remain the determining factor of the
social processes,'' MTI said.
   Justice Ministry officials said in December that the draft of the
new constitution did not contain a reference to the leading role of
the party.
   Fejti said it is necessary to set down in the new law the
criteria that groups will be allowed to form if they are ``in
harmony with the values and efforts formulated in the constitution.''

<HEAD>Agency Says Too Little Government Focus on Nuclear Weapons Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department's master plan for
refurbishing its nuclear weapons plants puts too little emphasis on
environmental cleanup at the decrepit facilities, a General
Accounting Office official told a House panel Tuesday.
   J. Dexter Peach, the GAO's assistant comptroller general, also
raised questions about the department's proposal for building two
new nuclear reactors to produce tritium, a perishable gas used in
the manufacture of nuclear warheads.
   The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, has prepared more
than 50 reports on pollution and operational problems in the weapons
industry since 1981 and has been critical of the Energy Department's
past management of arms plants.
   Peach told a House Armed Services subcommittee that the Energy
Department's plan, if carried out, would revitalize the nation's
nuclear weapons complex by the year 2010 but would leave key
environmental problems unsolved. The plan envisions spending at
least $244 billion over the next 21 years, with $32 billion is
earmarked for cleaning up environmental damage.
   ``In our opinion, the plan does not adequately address the
cleanup of existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as
they are retired from service,'' Peach said.
   The Energy Department plan was endorsed by former President
Reagan shortly before he left office. President Bush has not said
whether he supports it.
   James D. Watkins, Bush's designated energy secretary, has not
commented publicly on the modernization report, but he was almost
certain to face intense questioning about it at his Senate
confirmation hearing Wednesday.
   Peach, in his testimony, said Congress should closely review the
Energy Department's announced plans to build two new reactors to
produce tritium. The department's only existing tritium-producing
reactors are shut down because of safety and technical faults, and
they are expected to be permanently retired in the 1990s.
   The Energy Department wants to spend $6.8 billion to build the
two new reactors. Some critics have questioned the need for both
reactors, in view of the possibility that future U.S.-Soviet arms
control deals could reduce the need for tritium.
   Troy E. Wade II, the department's acting assistant secretary for
defense programs, told the House panel the high cost of building the
new reactors was justified.
   ``It is an issue of capacity ... to assure the necessary supplies
over the next two decades,'' he said, adding that it would be
prudent to have new reactors based on two different technologies in
order to guard against possible failures.
   Peach criticized the Energy Department master plan for failing to
spell out how, and over what time period, the environmental damage
caused by nuclear weapons production _ such as contaminated soil and
groundwater _ could be cleaned up.
   ``Uncertainty still exists not only regarding the size of the
problems but also regarding the extent to which DOE sites can be
cleaned up. Some locations may be irreversibly contaminated,'' Peach
said.
   Peach said the master plan calls for spending $401 million in the
coming budget year on environmental cleanup that eventually will
cost up to $70 billion.
   Several members of the House panel, including John Spratt,
D-S.C., also criticized the Energy Department, saying it has put
more emphasis on nuclear materials production than on safe and
environmentally sound operations.
   Ray Berube, the department's deputy assistant secretary for
environment, said, ``There is no current immediate public health and
safety risk'' posed by the weapons plants. He said there would be a
threat if the environmental issues were put off.
   Wade, meanwhile, said the department still expected to restart at
least one of its tritium-producing reactors, at the Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina, by the end of the year. He said a firm
timetable would be available next month.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Portrays Self as Gorbachev Backer in Electoral Show-Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick former Moscow party
chief, called himself a close supporter of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies Tuesday as he sought to represent the capital
in a new legislative body.
   Yeltsin, fired by Gorbachev in November 1987 after he criticized
the Communist Party's style of leadership, was one of 10 candidates
for nomination to go before an electoral commission of almost 900
members in the chandelier-lit, red-and-white Hall of Columns in
downtown Moscow's House of Unions.
   ``From the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics, I
fully support him,'' Yeltsin said. ``From the viewpoint of the
strategy of internal politics, fully. From the viewpoint of tactics,
I have my own opinion.''
   ``That's only natural,'' he added.
   The burly, 57-year old Yeltsin's shock of white hair stood out at
the podium and his voice boomed through the hall.
   The commission is one of the stages set up by a confusing
electoral law approved last December. Candidates for a new
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies nominated by workers'
collectives must pass through the commissions before they are placed
on the ballot for the March 26 election.
   The commissions can place all the candidates on the ballot, or
limit it to any number. The House of Unions gathering met late into
the night to choose the slate for a seat in the congress that will
represent all of Moscow.
   It originally was to consider the candidacies of human rights
campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov and Politburo member Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, but both pulled out. Sakharov demanded to be considered
as a candidate from the Academy of Sciences, and Vorotnikov opted to
run in Voronezh, a city south of Moscow.
   While one commission met in the House of Unions, another reviewed
a list of candidates for a Moscow district that included
controversial editor Vitaly Korotich of Ogonyok magazine.
   Yeltsin, who became first deputy chairman of the State
Construction Committee after falling out with Gorbachev, still has a
large following in Moscow.
   Dozens of his supporters held Yeltsin's portrait and banners at
police barricades around the building, and Yeltsin's seven-minute
address to the electoral commission was interrupted six times by
applause.
   But Yeltsin faced stiff competition from Yevgeny Brakov, director
of the giant ZIL automobile factory, and former cosmonaut Georgy
Grechko.
   Brakov presented a mainstream program supporting Gorbachev's
reforms and focusing on the need for better supplies of food and
consumer goods.
   He was nominated by 33 workers' groups compared to 19 for Yeltsin.
   Several Brakov supporters taunted Teltsin, saying they did not
want a candidate who was not a Moscow native.
   Yeltsin built his career in the Ural Mountains city of Sverdlovsk
before moving to the capital in 1985.
   Under the election law, candidates may be nominated in more than
one geographical area in the initial campaign stages. Yeltsin also
has been nominated in Sverdlovsk where he could stand a better
chance of being elected than in Moscow.
   Until he was removed as a candidate member of the party's ruling
Politburo in February 1988, Yeltsin was one of the staunchest
backers of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.
   But Gorbachev accused him of being overly ambitious and blaming
others for his mistakes.
   Yeltsin said in his speech that bureaucrats seeking to retain
their privileges comprised the biggest danger to reform. He urged
that the number of government ministries be cut.
   Yeltsin said the Soviet Union must create a system that will not
allow Stalinist abuses in the future.
   Hospitalized with heart trouble after being dismissed as Moscow
party chief, Yeltsin said he now was ``physically healthy and ready
to fight.''

   Thousands of survivors from the 1984
Bhopal gas disaster marched on the capital Tuesday and demanded the
reversal of a settlement with Union Carbide Corp. that was less than
one-sixth what the government asked for.
   About 2,500 protesters blocked the road to the Supreme Court,
which on Feb. 14 instructed Union Carbide to pay $470 million as
full and final settlement of all claims arising from the leak. The
government had asked for $3 billion.
   Placards depicted Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on his knees before
a devil throwing a coin. They proclaimed: ``Slave India Salutes
Killer Carbide.''
   A spokesman said the protesters made the 16-hour journey by train
from Bhopal ``to seek justice and relief'' for the world's worst
industrial disaster, which has killed at least 3,403 people by
government count.
   More than 20,000 people are listed as seriously affected by the
leak of methyl isocyanate on Dec. 3, 1984. Deaths attributed to it
continue at the rate of at least one a day. More than 500,000 damage
claims have been filed.
   Some of the demonstrators had not eaten since the train journey
began Monday afternoon. At least five protesters were admitted to
hospitals Tuesday suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion,
said V.C. Shukla, a member of Parliament from the opposition Jan
Morcha (National Front) Party.
   Many more in the crowd looked ready to collapse and talked
between gasps for breath. They complained they had no water to drink
since arriving in New Delhi.
   Riaz Ahmed Qureishi, who lost two children in the gas leak, said
the protesters did not accept the award and demanded the hanging of
former Union Carbide chariman Warren Anderson.
   ``Killers of one prime minister are hanged, but killers of
thousands of people escape with only a small payment,'' he said,
referring to the Jan. 6 hangings of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   The government is working on how to divide the award among those
who have claimed damages from the Danbury, Conn.-based company whose
Indian subsidiary owned the plant.
   Kaushalya Ahirwal, a leader of the women's wing of the Welfare
for Bhopal Gas Victims group, said she did not know the amount but
it was ``very little.''
   ``My husband is very ill, in hospital. My sister died and my
mother is blinded, but we have got no money,'' Mrs. Ahirwal said.
   ``We have been betrayed by the court,'' said Shukla, a former
chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located.
   He said the protesters will march to Parliament on Wednesday and
would ask the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
   ``We are outraged that the government should have agreed to the
order without consulting even the relief agencies,'' Shukla, the
opposition legislator, said. ``After losing four years, what was the
sudden hurry to settle for so little?''
   Parliament opened a three-month session Tuesday, and President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman made no mention of the Union Carbide
settlement in his opening speech.

<HEAD>Missile Impasse Leads to New Summit, Thatcher Praises EEC Stance
on Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of West Germany and
Britain on Tuesday unexpectedly scheduled an April summit meeting
after two days of face-to-face talks failed to resolve differences
over nuclear missiles.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher unsuccessfully tried to
persuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl to go forward with the replacement
of short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany.
   At the end of the talks with Kohl in Frankfurt, Mrs. Thatcher
also confidently predicted that the European Economic Community's
withdrawal of top-ranking diplomats from Iran will be ``very
successful.''
   The 12 EEC nations decided on the move after Iran called for the
death of author Salman Rushdie, author of the novel ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which Moslems believe is blasphemous.
   During a post-summit news conference, Kohl and Mrs. Thatcher
faced a round of questions replacing the approximately 600 Lance
nuclear missiles in West Germany.
   ``Constancy is a very good factor,'' Mrs. Thatcher said,
referring to her government's insistence on replacement of the
missiles. ``Constancy and consistency in politics are very strong,
very rare, alas all too rare.''
   In a joint statement, the two leaders reaffirmed the stance of
the March 1988 NATO summit, which called for nuclear weapons to be
``kept up to date where necessary.'' They also agreed to meet in
April in Kohl's hometown of Oggersheim to discuss the missile issue.
   ``We shall meet again before the next NATO summit (in May) with
the objective of making it a success. And I don't think we can go
further than that at present,'' she told more than 150 journalists
gathered at Frankfurt's City Hall.
   Last week, Kohl and visiting U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker attempted to minimize differences over the missile issue.
   Kohl wants the decision on replacing the weapons put off until
1991 or 1992, after next year's national elections.
   NATO calls the plan ``modernization,'' but West German officials
say it really is the replacement of the aging Lance missiles with
new longer-range missiles capable of traveling about 300 miles. The
Lance missiles, pointed at East Germany and Czechoslovakia, have a
range of nearly 75 miles.
   West Germany fears that replacing the missiles could derail
efforts to improve East-West relations.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men arrested at the home of
black activist Winnie Mandela appeared in court Tuesday on charges
of murder, abduction and assault.
   Jerry Richardson and Jabu Sithole were not asked to enter pleas
at their arraignment in Soweto Magistrates Court. Their case was
postponed for a week.
   It is part of a growing scandal surrounding the wife of jailed
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and a group of
unofficial bodyguards who lived at her home in Soweto, the huge
township outside Johannesburg.
   In a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview broadcast
Tuesday, Mrs. Mandela again denied involvement in the murder of
14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei and accused South African
authorities of trying to divide the country's black majority to make
it easier to release her husband.
   ``It would suit the government to release Comrade Mandela to this
present situation where he has nowhere to go to in the sense that
here he would find a community he led 26 years ago as divided as
ever,'' she said.
   The BBC said the interview was conducted ``within the last 24
hours'' at her home in Soweto.
   ``That it could even be dreamt that I would be responsible for
the murder of a child when I have spent all my life fighting against
these injustices appalls me,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mandela said police have not so far questioned her about the
killing.
   Sithole was a member and Richardson described himself as coach of
the bodyguards, who called themselves the Mandela United soccer club.
   Anti-government leaders last week accused Mandela United of
waging a ``reign of terror.'' They renounced Mrs. Mandela, and urged
their followers not to associate with her.
   Richardson and Sithole are accused of helping to beat up four
blacks at Mrs. Mandela's home in December. One of them, Seipei, was
found murdered in January.
   The three surviving young men have implicated the bodyguards in
their abduction and also say Mrs. Mandela ``was involved,''
according to their lawyer.
   Police raided Mrs. Mandela's house before dawn Sunday and
arrested four men, including Richardson and Sithole. The other two
have been released.
   They reportedly removed a pair of blood-soaked sneakers, a knife,
clubs, whips, and a pair of gardening shears. Police also took
samples of what state radio reported were bloodstains from the walls
of some back rooms where the bodyguards lived.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has denied being at home when the three men and
Seipei were brought there. But she has defended their abduction and
said they probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged
homosexual activities at the Methodist Church residence where they
lived. The church denies her allegations.
   In a related development, a former member of Mandela United has
been charged with the killing of another team member.
   Andrew Ekaneng, 20, appeared briefly in court Monday but was not
requested to enter a plea to a murder charge in the death of Maxwell
Madonda, who was fatally stabbed last week in Soweto.
   Ekaneng had a knife wound that stretched from one ear to the
other, the South African Press Association reported. The independent
news agency said members of Mandela United attacked their former
colleague and left him for dead, but he survived.
   Last week, Mrs. Mandela followed her husband's instructions and
decided to remove the bodyguards from her home.
   The scandal has damaged the credibility of a woman who was at the
forefront of the fight to end white minority rule in South Africa.
   Her husband, the country's most revered black leader, has been
jailed for 37 years of their 40-year marriage. Mandela is serving a
life sentence for plotting to sabotage the government.

<HEAD>Gun Owners Seek Court Action Against City Gun Bans</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with quotes from afternoon news conference. Adds

<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven gun owners assisted by the
National Rifle Association prepared Tuesday to ask the California
Supreme Court to rule that state law pre-empts city bans on
semiautomatic rifles in Stockton and Los Angeles.
   The two cities enacted ordinances this month after a gunman
killed five children and wounded 30 other people at a Stockton
elementary school on Jan. 17.
   The gun owners, including two Stockton residents and two Los
Angeles police officers, prepared to file suit directly to the state
Supreme Court because the two cities and other communities that have
enacted similar laws are in different state appellate districts,
said Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the NRA.
   The case belongs in the high court because it is of significant
statewide importance, Gardiner said.
   Four of the plaintiffs told a news conference at a Universal City
hotel that the city ordinances take away rights and instill fear
that the bans will lead to action against other types of firearms.
   Gardiner and the gun owners said that rather than controlling
guns, the justice system should deal more strongly with criminals
such as the Stockton gunman, Patrick Purdy, who killed himself after
the schoolyard massacre.
   ``I'm paying the price that unfortunately the man who committed
the crime in Stockton is not alive to pay,'' said Bill Hilburn, a
Department of Energy engineer who lives two miles from the Stockton
school. ``Nobody is more outraged about what happened in my
hometown.''
   Tony Acevedo, 35, complained that the Stockton City Council's
action makes him a criminal for owning such weapons.
   Donald Castillo of Los Angeles, an aerospace electronics
engineer, said he was interested in target shooting with such guns
and he worries the bans will lead to attacks on other civil
liberties.
   ``I'm here because I'm scared to death,'' Castillo said.
   Andre Coulombe, a financial consultant in Los Angeles, said he
works with a youth Explorer group and fears he will no longer be
allowed to engage in such activities as firearms instruction, which
he says teaches discipline.
   Gardiner identified the other three plaintiffs as Robert Feeley,
a Los Angeles lawyer, and Sgt. Louis Salsedo and Officer George
Luczy, both Los Angeles police officers.
   Los Angeles officials said they will delay any attempts to
enforce the ban on possessing the weapons until March 1. Several
other proposed gun bans are being considered in various committees
of the Legislature.
   The NRA counsel asserted that the city bans are really against
all semiautomatic rifles. He said the mechanism of the so-called
military style assault rifles are the same as other types of
semiautomatic rifles. The only real difference, he said, is that the
military-style weapons have certain ``external additions'' like
bolts on the barrels or attaching bayonets.
   Gardiner preferred to use the term ``self-loading'' rather than
semiautomatic and asserted that semiautomatic weapons that have come
into question are not assault rifles. He said only the fully
automatic military versions of those guns, which fire repeatedly
rather than once with each trigger pull, are assault rifles.
   ``The whole thing is largely a media creation and needs to be
treated as such,'' Gardiner said.

<UNK>Newspaper: East German Border Guards Killed Man In Berlin Wall Escape
Attempt</UNK>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German border guards shot and
killed a 22-year-old man attempting to flee over the Berlin Wall, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The mass-circulation Bild Zeitung tabloid said a companion was
severely wounded when troops fired more than a dozen shots at the
pair as they attempted to overcome barriers that divide the city on
the night of Feb. 6.
   A West Berlin police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity
said witnesses reported hearing about 10 shots fired near the wall
that night.
   Police said the witnesses observed border guards carrying a man
to a car and forcing another man to accompany them.
   The police spokesman said officials could not confirm the
witnesses' report.
   Bild said communist East German officials denied the reports and
contended only a flare was shot into the air, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper did not give sources for its report, to appear in
its Wednesday editions. A copy of the report was telexed to other
news media in advance Tuesday night.
   At least 77 people have been killed trying to escape over
communist-built barriers blocking off West Berlin, according to
Working Group August 13. The human rights organization took its name
from the day East Germany began building the wall Aug. 13, 1961.

   A former teacher who admitted molesting boys as
young as age 8 while he worked at a Bureau of Indian Affairs school
told Congress Tuesday he was surprised it took authorities so long
to stop him.
   Paul Wade Price, who is serving the third year of a 10-year
prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to one count of child
molestation, said in the videotaped testimony he molested at least
25 students over the 14 years he taught at the Cherokee Elementary
School in western North Carolina.
   Price said his victims were primarily boys aged 8 through 12.
   ``One, that was the age group I was teaching. And, secondly, I'm
sure that there was the possibility that younger children don't
generally tell things, as the older children do,'' he said under
questioning by Ken Ballen, chief counsel to a special investigative
unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   Price has been a prisoner at the Butner Federal Correctional
Institution in Butner, N.C., since 1986.
   The testimony came in the third week of hearings by the
committee, which has been looking into various alleged misdeeds on
Indian reservations, within the BIA and among other agencies that do
business with Indians.
   After hearing testimony on contracting irregularities and
organized crime involvement in Indian gaming operations, the
committee is now concentrating on the problem of child sex abuse on
reservations.
   Price told Ballen he was surprised that he could continue his
activity on and off for 14 years .
   ``This is strictly hindsight,'' Price said. ``Looking back it
certainly is a phenomenon that is hard to understand.''
   In 1974, as a provision for receiving federal aid, Congress
required the states to enact laws mandating that individuals who
suspect sexual abuse in a school report it to the authorities. But
there is no such federal law and state statutes do not apply to
Indian reservations and BIA schools.
   Two teachers testified that they knew or heard rumors of Price's
activities, but despite complaints to school authorities, nothing
was done until the FBI began its investigation in 1985 following a
mother's complaint.
   The mother, Keneithea Haigler, said that when she told the school
superintendent that her 8-year-old son had been molested by Price,
``they let me know that they knew what this teacher was doing and
they were just waiting for some mother to come in and do something
about it.''
   Another mother, Patricia Tramper, said Price threatened the boys
if they discussed the matter with their parents.
   Price, who was unemotional during his taped interview, said at
its close that he believes he always wanted to get caught because he
could not stop himself from his activities.
   ``I've had time, of course, in prison to reflect over this and te
seriousness of it,'' he said.
   ``Fondling is, you know, in my mind, I was thinking, it really
doesn't hurt anybody. But I know now how much it does hurt,'' he
said.
   ``We just must find a way to help the children first _ and of
course the molesters also _ above all, the children, who really
don't know what they're getting into,'' he said, telling the panel
that he himself had been molested at the age of 8.
   Later, witnesses from the BIA said that despite a new policy
requiring school personnel to report cases of sex abuse, the BIA
does not get much information. William Mehojah, BIA branch chief for
Indian elementary and secondary school programs, said no
disciplinary action has ever been taken for failure to report.
   Mehojah and the others advocated enactment of a federal law
similar to those in the states, making failure to report alleged sex
abuse a crime. The opinion was echoed by two FBI agents who
investigate crime on Indian reservations in Arizona and the Dakotas,
and law enforcement officials working for the BIA and local
authorities.
   FBI agent David Small said interviews with pedophiles have
indicated that child molesters gravitate to Indian reservations
because there is little supervision and they usually are in remote
areas, making it easy to prey on children.
   Robert Haley, general chairman of the Indian law enforcement
section of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said
investigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by tribes
which refuse to let the children off the reservation to testify.
   Mehojah said many teachers have gone to work before background
checks were complete because of paperwork delays.

<TEXT>
   A former education adviser to Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis was sentenced Tuesday to a seven- to 10-year state prison
term on an array of corruption charges, or three years on top of his
current federal prison term.
   Allowing for early release, the judge who sentenced Gerard T.
Indelicato said he anticipated the former Bridgewater State College
president would spend 2{ years behind bars on the federal and state
charges, then serve a lengthy probation.
   Indelicato administered an adult education program designed to
help immigrants and the illiterate. He was considered the mastermind
of a plan that involved paying inflated classroom rent and receiving
some of the money back, taking the salaries of fictitious employees
and skimming funds intended to pay for classroom renovations.
   Led into court in handcuffs, Indelicato pleaded guilty to eight
counts of forgery, larceny, conflict of interest, filing a false
income tax return and lying to the state. Under a plea bargain
arrangement, Indelicato was spared a trial and 33 other counts were
placed on file. Under Massachusetts law, the state reserves the
right to prosecute those charges at a later date.
   On the two forgery counts, Superior Court Judge Robert W. Banks
imposed a sentence of 7 to 10 years in the maximum-security prison
in Walpole, with three years to be served, after Indelicato finishes
the federal term. Under state law, Indelicato would be eligible for
parole after one year.
   On the other six counts he pleaded guilty to, Indelicato received
concurrent sentences that would have totaled 18 to 25{ years if
imposed consecutively.
   The 42-year-old Norwood resident is serving his federal prison
term in Pennsylvania.
   Indelicato's attorney, Steven Brooks, called the sentence
``severe'' for a public official who ``made a few mistakes,'' but he
did not say whether he would appeal.
   As a special assistant to the governor, Indelicato is the
highest-ranking Dukakis administration official to face criminal
charges. Dukakis has publicly condemned Indelicato's actions and
said his administration cooperated in the state and federal
investigations.
   Last July, Indelicato was sentenced to 2{ years in prison after
pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in Boston to five charges of
conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme involving his
brother and two other men to skim more than $80,000 from the adult
education program funded by the federal government and run by the
state.
   His case centered on activities that began between 1979 and early
1983. He was Dukakis' education adviser from February 1983 to
September 1986.

   The United States will send $20
million worth of military equipment in the first U.S. military aid
to Argentina since the 1982 Falklands conflict, the Ministry of
Defense said Tuesday.
   Ministry spokesman Horacio Altamirano said the equipment included
spare parts for about 20 helicopters and 200 armored personnel
carriers.
   The deal was signed Tuesday by Gen. Fred Woerner, chief of the
U.S. Southern Strategic Command, and Argentina's army chief Gen.
Francisco Gassino, Altamirano said.
   The U.S. Embassy did not return phone calls for comment.
   The aid is the first since Argentina and Britain clashed in 1982
over the South Atlantic islands that Britain owns and calls the
Falklands, and Argentina claims and calls the Malvinas. The United
States supported Britain in the conflict.
   Argentina's military budget has been cut in half to about 2
percent of the gross domestic product since civilian President Raul
Alfonsin took office in December 1983, ending a military regime that
had been in power for nearly eight years.
   Officers have complained about not having enough money to draft
and train recruits, fly jets or buy the parts needed to keep
foreign-made equipment running, including M-113 armored personnel
carriers and Bell helicopters.
   The lack of equipment and the low military budget in general was
one of the reasons cited by army rebels for an insurrection last
December.
   Defense Minister Jose Horacio Jaunarena personally requested U.S.
military assistance on a trip to Washington last October during
which he met with then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   U.S. military assistance to Argentina was sharply restricted
beginning in the late 1970s because of human rights violations
committed by the military regime trying to eradicate subversion.
   The juntas bought the guns, planes and ships they wanted from
European and Middle East suppliers.

<TEXT>
   The new leader of Paraguay has promised to help
fight drug trafficking and cooperate in hunting Nazi war criminals
who may be hiding in the South American nation, the first
congressman to visit Paraguay since the coup said Tuesday.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said Gen. Andres Rodriguez told
him during an hour-long meeting last week that Rodriguez ``wants to
change the reputation of Paraguay as a refuge for thieves and
scoundrels to a very different, more positive place.''
   ``In our conversation, the provisional president was very
specific. He even assured me that he is willing to receive requests
from those who hunt war criminals, because he wants to end
Paraguay's historic reputation as a haven for ex-Nazis, drug dealers
and Third World dictators,'' Morrison said.
   The congressman said Rodriguez also promised to help fight drug
trafficking. Paraguay is known as a key money-laundering center for
cocaine profits and there have been reports that Rodriguez received
some of the profits.
   But Morrison, who later in the day briefed State Department
officials on his visit, cautioned that the Bush administration
should ``base its policies toward Paraguay on future actions,'' not
promises.
   ``I'm not in any position to make a judgement about what's inside
his head. I think we have to judge him by the actions he takes,''
Morrison said. ``There have been steps, and they're not
insigificant.''
   Rodriguez, 65, ousted President Alfredo Stroessner in a coup Feb.
3. Stroessner came to power in a 1954 coup and used torture to
repress political opposition in his early years of power. Later, he
eased up on the most blatant human rights violations, relying on
harassment, detentions and explusions.
   Rodriguez already has vowed to respect human rights and pledged
to respect freedom of the press. ABC Color, a prominent
investigative newspaper shut down for nearly five years, has been
allowed to reopen.
   But many are skeptical about how far reform will go under
Rodriguez, who until recently was an ally of Stroessner and who does
not consider the former president a dictator.
   This week, Rodriguez said elections will be held May 1 despite a
request by the opposition to delay them. Opposition party leaders,
who had little chance under Stroessner's election rules, wanted more
time to organize. They are considering an election boycott.
   Morrison said the quick election in the wake of the coup ``is
clearly favoring the (majority) Colorado Party (of Rodriguez) over
the opposition. ... But there are many people who would say that
even a signficant delay of several months wouldn't be likely to
allow the opposition to overcome the problem of years and years of
being out of power.

<HEAD>Southern Province Said On Verge Of General Strike Over Ethnic Conflict</HEAD>

   Thousands of ethnic Albanians stopped
work or went on a hunger strike in troubled Kosovo province Tuesday,
protesting alleged anti-Albanian policies, official media and
sources said.
   Official sources interviewed by telephone in the regional capital
of Pristina told The Associated Press that the southern province is
``on the verge of a general strike.''
   Also Tuesday, the official Tanjug news agency reported a police
official beat up a journalist who wrote about alleged corruption,
one of a string of recent attacks on Yugoslav reporters.
   The protest in Kosovo was triggered by a hunger strike of more
than 1,000 ethnic Albanian miners who refused to leave their pits at
the Trepca lead and zinc mine. The miners allege discrimination by
communist authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic, Serbia, of
which Kosovo is an adminstrative part.
   Thousands of other ethnic Albanians in the economically depressed
province walked off their jobs in other Kosovo towns Tuesday in
support of the miners' demands that the Communist Party chiefs of
Yugoslavia and Serbia, Stipe Suvar and Slobodan Milosevic, come to
talk with them, media reports said.
   The Trepca miners near Titova Mitrovica, 125 miles south of
Belgrade, protested the official Serbian policy that labeled them
``demonstrators, nationalist and separatists'' when they took to the
streets last November, the state Tanjug news agency said.
   Medical teams were sent to the Trepca mines where some of the
protesters have refused to take water and food for the past 24
hours. The provincial communist leadership has opened an emergency
session to discuss the labor unrest, Tanjug said.
   ``Although ventilation in the shafts is being maintained, the
potential danger of an accident in the mine is very real,'' Agim
Bajrami, a Trepca employee, told the AP, adding that the miners had
sealed off all the pit entrances not allowing anybody in.
   The ambitious Serbian party leader, Milosevic, has been seeking
to curtail the autonomy of Kosovo, which won broad independence from
Serbia by the current Yugoslav constitution adopted in 1974.
   Serbian leaders want more control in Kosovo to protect the Slav
population allegedly persecuted by the ethnic Albanians, who make up
85 percent of the province's population.
   In November, the Trepca miners marched to Pristina to protest the
dismissal of some top provincial officials as demanded by Serbia's
leaders and were joined by up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians.
   In the southern republic of Montenegro, reporter Milovan Brkic
was assaulted Monday in the police headquarters in the capital
Titograd by Ratko Micunovic, a department head of the state security
police, Tanjug said.
   Brkic, who had published a story claiming Micunovic and other
state security officials were corrupt, lodged a formal complaint and
was assaulted again by a group of unindentified thugs waiting
outside, Tanjug said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of
severe head and other injuries.
   Police said Micunovic was suspended from duty pending an
investigation, Tanjug reported.
   Last week, a woman television reporter was beaten up by an
unindentified attacker who first vilified her for a recent program
in which she presented the Albanian viewpoint in Kosovo.
   Last month, a police cordon prevented several dozen rowdies from
breaking into the Belgrade offices of the Zagreb Vjesnik daily,
angry about allegedly critical stories about Serbia's policies in
Kosovo.

   Police blocked about 80 students marching
to Parliament on Tuesday with a petition calling for free elections.
An opposition activist said at least 15 people were detained.
   Four more people were detained in Krakow at a demonstration in
support of Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel, who was sentenced
in Prague on Tuesday to nine months in prison on charges stemming
from a Jan. 16 protest there.
   Two banned political groups, the leftist Polish Socialist Party
and the rightist Confederation for an Independent Poland, organized
the Warsaw demonstration.
   It began with a rally at Warsaw University of about 200 young
people, who signed the petition calling for free elections and
legalization of their groups. Then 80 to 100 of them began walking
toward the Sejm, or parliament, about one mile away.
   Police blocked the students after they walked a short distance to
a major intersection and wrestled some of them into police vans.
   Leszek Moczulski, leader of the Confederation, said at least 15
people were detained and three were still held by evening.
   Moczulski said police beat one Confederation activist, Slawomir
Gasior, as he was being detained.
   The Confederation also organized a rally in Krakow's market
square, where about 1,000 people gathered to hear speeches
supporting Havel, said Robert Bogdanski, a spokesman for the
Solidarity Information Service.
   He said police quickly blocked a march toward former offices of
the security services and detained three students.
   Bogdanski said a fourth person was detained when other protesters
were dispersed while marching toward the police chief's apartment.

<HEAD>Britain Outraged at Romanian Behavior, Warns of Damaged Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Tuesday accused Romania of
``outrageous'' behavior and said relations could be damaged over the
alleged manhandling of the British ambassador by Romanian militiamen
last month.
   Romanian Ambassador Stan Soare rejected the British account of
the Jan. 27 incident during a frosty 30-minute interview with
Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave on Tuesday, the Foreign
Office said.
   The office said militiamen stopped British Ambassador Hugh
Arbuthnott on Jan. 27 when he tried to deliver a letter to historian
Doina Cornea, Romania's most prominent dissident, at her home in
Cluj, Transylvania. It said they ``pushed and manhandled'' him and
told him he could not proceed.
   Mrs. Cornea has been under house arrest since last fall after she
wrote a letter to Western newspapers protesting President Nicolae
Ceausescu's plan to raze 7,000 villages and replace them with
agro-industrial complexes.
   The Foreign Office said Britain's previous diplomatic attempts in
the Arbuthnott case were unavailing.
   Soare said Arbuthnott infringed traffic regulations and Mrs.
Cornea's activities were a matter for Romanian authorities alone, a
Foreign Office spokesman reported on condition of anonymity.
   Waldegrave said Mrs. Cornea's circumstances were a matter of
legitimate interest for Britain and were covered by the final
document of the European Human Rights conference in Vienna, which
Romania signed, the office said.
   Soare was told the overall Romanian response to the incident was
outrageous, the Foreign Office said.

   Severe thunderstorms rumbled across the southern Atlantic states
Tuesday, bringing strong winds and at least two tornadoes to the
Carolinas.
   Warm and humid air rushing northward ahead of a cold front set up
favorable conditions for severe weather. Severe thunderstorm and
tornado watches were in effect for several hours along the middle
and southern Atlantic coast.
   Tornadoes touched down in Fayetteville, N.C., near the Cape Fear
Valley Medical Center, but no injuries were reported. A tornado also
touched down near Benson, also in eastern North Carolina.
   Elsewhere around the state, strong winds ripped through Anson,
damaged a school in Morven, knocked down trees and power lines at
Cordova and in Johnston County, and damaged mobile homes and
outbuildings in Lee and Moore counties and near Greenville and
Williamston.
   Wind gusts were clocked at near 70 mph Tuesday morning at
Charleston, S.C. Wind gusts of 81 mph occurred at Rocky Mount, N.C.
Strong winds lifted a mobile home off the foundation near Barnwell,
S.C.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted for parts of eastern
Virginia, eastern and southern Maryland, southern New Jersey and
much of Delaware.
   Heavy rain was reported during the morning in southern Georgia
into the Florida Panhandle. Nearly 4{ inches of rain was reported
Tuesday morning at Mary Esther, Fla., and 3{ inches at Macon, Ga.
   Rain was widespread from the Ohio Valley into New England. More
than 1} inches fell during a 24-hour period at Huntington, W.Va.,
and up to 3 inches in Kentucky. Numerous streams and creeks were
flooded in southeast Kentucky.
   Snow showers were widely scattered from the northern Plains into
the Great Lakes. Widely scattered showers occurred along the Pacific
coast and snow was scattered over the Cascades of southern Oregon
into the Shasta Siskiyou Mountains in Northern California.
   High temperatures included 75 degrees at Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
which broke a record for the date of 71 established in 1891, and a
record 86 degrees in Miami.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Alexandria, Minn., to 88 degrees at Melbourne, Fla. The
nation's low was 5 below zero at Grand Forks, N.D.
   In the forecast for Wednesday was rain widespread along the
Eastern Seaboard, showers and thunderstorms from the Carolinas into
Florida, and rain widespread across the Northwest. Snow showers were
expected to be scattered from the eastern Great Lakes region into
the Ohio Valley, and most numerous from central West Virginia
through western Pennsylvania into northern Vermont.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s or 50s across much of
the nation, except single digits and teens from the northern Plains
through the upper Mississippi Valley into the upper Great Lakes, 20s
and 30s from the northern High Plains through the middle and lower
Missouri Valley, the middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys into the
eastern Great Lakes. Highs should reach the 60s from central
California through the southern Great Basin of Nevada and western
Utah into the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and across northern
Florida, and into the 70s from Southern California into the southern
Plateau, and across central Florida. Highs were expected to be in
the low to mid 80s across the Arizona deserts and across southern
Florida.

   Angry Amazon Indians thrust lances and
machetes at government electric power officials Tuesday in a second
day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would
flood tribal lands.
   More than 500 Indians from 37 native groups packed the city's
community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east
Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The meeting is the first united political movement by the native
tribes, and seeks to block construction of the Kararao dam on the
Xingu River, an Amazon tributary. Brazil says the energy is vital
for development in this land of 144 million people.
   Tempers flared when Jose Lopes, engineering director for
Eletronorte, the government Amazon power company, told the Indians
the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level.
   ``You're lying! Everything you say is a lie!'' shouted Tuira, a
Kayapo Indian woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a
machete in Lopes' face.
   Her words in Kayapo were translated into broken Portuguese by
Chief Paulo Paiakan. He said her gesture is ``one of our traditions,
it does not mean war.''
   Kayapo warrior Uh-Te also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust
a red-feathered lance at the company offical.
   ``We don't know what energy means. I was raised on game, fish and
wild honey in the forest. Why didn't you consult us about the dam?''
said Uh-Te with Paiakan translating.
   The Indians, some wearing a green-and-yellow feathered headresses
and black warpaint on their faces and bodies, raised their war clubs
in a sign of agreement.
   Lopes said Eletronorte was preparing an environmental impact
report on the Kararao project. ``If the dam affects Indian land, it
must be approved by congress,'' he said.
   Brazil's Indian population has been decimated by development
projects such as hydroelectric dams and the Trans-Amazon highway.
There are about 220,000 Indians left in Brazil, down from an
estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by Portuguese
explorers in 1500.
   ``The dam is not a reality until construction starts,'' and that
won't happen for at least five years,'' Lopes said. He said
Eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested Amazon dams at
Babaquara and Iriri.
   Chief Paiakan also complained that Indians had not been consulted
about the name of the dam. Kararao is a Kayapo war cry, he said.
``To our youths, the government is calling us to war,'' Paiakan said.
   Lopes promised the project would be given a ``white name.''
   Earlier in Brasilia, Interior Minister Joao Alves said the
government would not consider stopping the Kararao project. He said
the dam was fundamental for Brazil's future and would dislocate only
about 280 Indians.
   Kararao will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity, Alves
said _ second only to the Itaipu dam, the world's largest, located
on Brazil's southwestern border with Paraguay.
   Brazilian and international environmental groups attending the
five-day meeting said the Kararao project was probably unstoppable.
   ``I don't think it's likely they'll stop construction of Kararao.
But that doesn't mean the meeting is a waste,'' said Barbara
Bramble, a director of the Washington-based National Wildlife Fund.
   ``This could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances
among Amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live
in.''
   Joining the protesters was British rock star Sting, who told the
Amazon Indian chiefs he was starting an international campaign to
raise money to create a huge Amazon National Park. He said the
campaign would begin April 12 in Paris.
   ``I'm not here on behalf of one people. If the rain forest dies
all of us are in danger,'' Sting said.
   He said he got permission for his project from President Jose
Sarney.

   Harold Penman, 32, of Faribault, was instructing his co-worker on

<TEXT>
   More than 50 people were injured
Tuesday in a clash by rival workers in the southeastern city of
Ulsan over resumption of work at South Korea's largest shipyard,
news reports said.
   The national news agency Yonhap said fights broke out when about
1,500 pro-management workers stopped about 1,000 militant unionists
from obstructing operations at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
   Labor disputes over wages have crippled shipyard operations since
December.
   In Seoul, riot police dispersed about 1,000 subway workers who
rallied in a downtown plaza, protesting that management suppressed
free labor union movements. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   A Labor Ministry report meanwhile said Tuesday that the gulf
between labor and management over wages will lead to more and longer
disputes this year.
   The report, submitted to the National Assembly, said 116 labor
disputes have taken place so far this year, compared to 88 during
the same period last year, and the average duration of disputes
increased from five days to 10.
   On the political side, radical students threw hundreds of
firebombs and attacked riot police with clubs and steel bars Tuesday
at an anti-government, anti-U.S. rally in this capital city.
   The number of injured was not reported.
   About 300 students shouting ``Drive out Yankees!'' and
``Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' fought police for an hour in
front of the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. Students attacked
police with rocks and clubs and police fought back, also throwing
rocks and swinging clubs.
   The protest came four days before the first anniversary of the
Roh government and less than a week before President Bush's visit.
   The government has warned that violence will not be tolerated and
protesters will be harshly punished.
   Student radicals, a small but vocal minority on campus, have
little support.

   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas on Tuesday
killed one soldier and wounded three, police said, in the outskirts
of this Andean city where the prime minister urged residents to
ignore a guerrilla strike call.
   Police said the guerrillas buried explosives on a road in
northern Ayacucho and exploded the charge as the soldiers passed in
a troop truck.
   Elsewhere, rebels Monday fatally stabbed four women and two men
in Huichinga, a hamlet 50 miles northwest of Ayacucho, in
retaliation for selling cattle to the government, police said.
   ``We cannot permit the threat of violence to paralyze a city,''
said Prime Minister Armando Villanueva. He promised police
protection from the guerrillas, who threatened reprisal for those
not following their weeklong strike announced Monday.
   An Associated Press reporter on the scene said most business were
closed early Tuesday but began reopening during Villanueva's visit.
   A similar strike called in November by the Shining Path, whose
stronghold is the Ayacucho region, paralyzed Ayacucho for a week.
   More than 12,000 people have been killed in the Shining Path
guerrilla group's 9-year-old insurgency, which has increasingly been
oriented toward disrupting Peru's fragile economy.

<TEXT>
   The president of the American Federation
of Teachers says that unions haven't been quick enough in keeping up
with changes in the workforce.
   And Albert Shanker espouses unorthodox methods of restoring the
stature of unions in the workplace, including the schools where his
members teach.
   Among his proposed changes in the education system are abolishing
the Department of Education and placing its duties in the Labor
Department, firing incompetent teachers and transforming high
schools into campuslike environments where students have some
flexibility in choosing classes.
   ``In this country we go on the pendulum swing system,'' Shanker
said Tuesday during a breakfast meeting with reporters covering the
AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting here. ``First we had tough schools
with rigorous standards where most kids are pushed out. Then we move
to soft schools where everybody graduates but very few learn
anything.
   ``Now we go back to the other way,'' Shanker said. ``It's pretty
clear that if you have two ways of doing things and neither is
working it's time to find a third way.''
   That third way, in Shanker's view, might include ideas unions
have traditionally opposed, including the use of part-time teachers.
A shortage of qualified math and science teachers has made the use
of part-timers a viable approach that labor should support although
those teachers are unlikely to join the union, Shanker said.
   ``We have to encourage non-traditional methods,'' said Shanker,
who has been president of the 690,000-member AFT since 1974.
   He carries that approach over to overall union organizing, a
once-militant union leader calling on his colleagues to relax the
standards he says are partly to blame for the declining share of
unionized workers in the United States.
   ``Unions themselves have not adequately recongnized the changing
of the labor force,'' Shanker said. ``It's the failure in many cases
to switch the nature of your appeal fast enough.''
   As the demographics of the workforce change to include fewer
workers in high-risk factory jobs and more in white-collar
professions, unions must change equally fast to appeal to
professionals, Shanker said.
   Included in those changes, he said, should be new membership
categories such as associate memberships that would offer workers
who are not members of a collective bargaining unit some union
services.
   That concept is the subject of a heated internal debate that
delayed the scheduled release this week of a major report on labor
organizing. Hard-liners object to the concept of associate
memberships on grounds that labor is conceding too much in its drive
to fill up membership rolls.
   Shanker will get a chance to discuss his proposal to merge the
Labor and Education departments with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
on Wednesday, when they visit a Dade County school that is part of a
highly successful pilot program that gives teachers a say in school
budgets and management.
   ``I think we have to treat these kids as though they are
workers,'' Shanker said. ``We need to create the perception that
school is a good place for them.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Calls On Bulgaria to Improve Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International appealed to the Bulgarian
government Tuesday for information about ethnic Turks imprisoned
mainly for peacefully opposing a forced assimilation campaign.
   The London-based human rights group said some members of
Bulgaria's Turkish minority have been jailed on terrorism or
espionage charges for protesting a name-changing policy which took
effect four years ago, and some have been tortured.
   Many were among hundreds arrested in 1984 and early 1985 for
resisting or protesting the assimilation campaign, which restricted
language and religion and forced Turks to give up their Islamic
names.
   ``The Bulgarian authorities have charged many with criminal
charges like `terrorism' or `hooliganism' but Amnesty International
believes that the real reason for their imprisonment may be their
non-violent opposition to the assimilation campaign,'' the report
said.
   In addition, an increase in independent human rights activities
in the past year has been followed by a crackdown on activists,
Amnesty warned in a report.
   Amnesty International said Bulgaria ratified in 1970 the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which
guarantees free expression, association and movement.
   ``Amnesty International is calling on the government to end
violations of these basic rights,'' it said in the report.
   The group seeks information on more than 150 prisoners, mostly
from the 900,000-strong ethnic Turkish minority which makes up about
10 percent of the population, said the report.
   Since 1984, the Bulgarian government has denied that a Turkish
minority exists in the country. It also says there are no human
rights abuses.
   Ahmed Hasanov Aptullov, a 29-year-old philosophy lecturer from
Sofia University, and three others were arrested after producing
leaflets in 1986 rallying Turks to oppose the assimilation, Amnesty
International said.
   They were imprisoned for eight to 10 years each. Amnesty
International considers them prisoners of conscience, the human
rights group's term for people who use non-violent means to express
themselves.
   The report described in detail the cases of 11 prisoners of
conscience, and said Amnesty International seeks information on
another 144 prisoners.
   The group said another prisoner of conscience, Ismail Mehmedov
Hyuseinov, was arrested in 1985 for refusing to accept his new name
and applying to emigrate to Turkey.
   He was badly beaten in prison but released to internal exile
after losing 88 pounds on a hunger strike. The government said he
was freed in 1987, but Amnesty International said it has been told
he remains in exile in northwest Bulgaria.
   Other prisoners have been tortured by prolonged beating on the
soles of the feet, the report said.
   Amnesty International said it has long been concerned about
prisoners of conscience in Bulgaria, and welcomed the recent
dialogue begun with the Bulgarian government.
   It said Bulgarian authorities supplied information in 1987 after
repeated requests by Amnesty International. The group met with some
officials, including a newly formed Committee on Human Rights, in
1988.
   The report said concerns remain and reliable information has been
scarce because of censorship and contradictory official statements.
Name changes have made identification difficult.

   A bomb exploded Tuesday inside a
restaurant in Colombo, killing four people, and a shopkeeper was
shot and killed as Sinhalese extremists protesting last week's
Parliament election tried to force a strike.
   Police and military officials said extremists set fire to 10
government-owned buses and hurled smoke bombs in and around the
capital.
   The government declared a security alert and appealed to
residents not to give in to the threats by the extremists, state-run
radio reported.
   Most shops owned by Sinhalese, the island's majority ethnic
group, stayed open, but many Tamil and Moslem shopkeepers heeded
warnings issued by the extremists and kept their establishments
shuttered.
   A bomb concealed in a bag exploded inside the restaurant at
Narahenpitiya, about four miles east of Colombo city center, killing
four people and injuring eight others.
   A Sinhalese cashier who did not heed the strike call and kept his
store open was shot and killed in Colombo.
   The deaths were blamed on the radical Sinhalese group, the
People's Liberation Front.
   Police and military officials said the front, which has been
waging a campaign of assassinations and intimidation against the
government, had distributed leaflets calling for the strike to
protest the Feb. 15 Parliament election.
   The front had vowed to disrupt the election, which gave President
Ranasinghe Premadasa's United National Party 125 of 225 seats. More
than 1,000 people were killed during the five-week campaign.
   Police blamed most of the slayings on the front and said others
were the work of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil
separatist group that also had vowed to disrupt the election.
   More than 10,000 people have died in ethnic violence since the
Tamil insurrection started in 1983. Efforts by Premadasa's
predecessor, President Junius R. Jayewardene, to make peace with the
Tamils prompted a Sinhalese backlash spearheaded by the People's
Liberation Front.
   Premadasa and Jayewardene are Sinhalese, as are most top
government and military officials.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Tamils account for 18 percent and Moslems 7 percent.

   President Bush, preparing Tuesday to visit
Asia, defended Japan's right to invest in the United States despite
indications that many Americans consider Tokyo a greater threat than
the Kremlin's military power.
   Meanwhile, Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said the president intends to use his five-day trip to Japan, China
and South Korea that starts Wednesday to underscore ``that the
United States is an Asian power.''
   Brushing aside a suggestion that Bush is taking off on his first
overseas voyage before he has put in place a cohesive foreign
policy, Scowcroft said the president ``is not trying to make quick
headlines'' but instead wants to shape policies that ``will aid us
in where we think we'd like to be at the end of the century.''
   Scowcroft made public an ambitious agenda of a dozen 15-30 minute
meetings in Tokyo between Bush and kings, presidents and prime
ministers from around the world who will join in attending the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, who died Jan. 7. More than 150
countries will be represented at the funeral.
   Bush, asked at a news conference how he would reassure Americans
who think the Japanese ``are buying and are owning too much of the
United States economy,'' pointed out that Japanese investment in
this country ranks third behind that of Britain and the Netherlands.
   Bush said he reassures worried Americans by telling them ``that
it is important if we believe in open markets that people be allowed
to invest here, just as I'd like to see more openness for American
investors in other countries.
   Bush suggested that Japan's purchase of U.S. government bonds
helped this country's finances. ``We have horrendous deficits and
foreign capital joins domestic capital in financing those
deficits,'' he said.
   Bush said the United States must do more to remove barriers in
foreign markets to American goods.''
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published Tuesday said that more
than 40 percent of those who responded in the telephone survey of
1,512 adults said they saw Japan's economic power a greater threat
than the Soviets' military power.
   Scowcroft said Bush ``will take advantage of the presence of over
60 heads of government or state to hold discussions with as many as
time permits.''
   He ticked off scheduled meetings with the leaders of Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Singapore, Pakistan, Thailand, West Germany, France,
Belgium, Turkey, Brazil and Nigeria, and said more may be added.
   Many of those countries have pressing problems _ the Brazilian
economy, for example, is strained by debts owed to U.S. banks and
the Japanese. Scowcroft did not predict any agreements as a result
of the talks, but he said the mere act of personal contact at the
top could ease the way for future agreements.
   ``What I'd like to underscore is the importance here, not with
how long the meets necessarily are and how much substance, but the
significance of a face-to-face opportunity to get, at least, out on
the table a few issues for discussion,'' he said. ``That's very,
very important and it eases the sense of communication between
countries after that if you've had this kind of personal contact.''

<HEAD>U.S. Airman Questioned in Shooting, Third Incident Near Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. airman was being questioned
Wednesday in connection with the air gun shooting of a South Korean
citizen near a U.S. air base, the third incident involving American
servicemen in the same area, U.S. officials said.
   U.S. officials at Kunsan, a provincial port city about 130 miles
southwest of Seoul, said Air Force Sgt. John D. Wilson was being
held for investigation in the case.
   Wilson is with the 8th Equipment Maintenance Squadron and is
stationed at Kunsan Air Force Base. No hometown was available.
   Newspapers in Seoul quoted Yun Chun-ho, 33, a farmer, as claiming
Wilson fired at him Monday when he shouted and gestured to prevent
the airman from aiming his gun at two women passers-by. Yun was
wounded slightly in the thigh, newspapers said.
   ``The latest incident came as anti-American sentiment is running
high,'' said Wednesday's Korea Herald.
   An investigation was still under way in the involvement of U.S.
servicemen in two apparently unrelated deaths of Korean citizens
last week. Those deaths brought violent anti-American protests and
the city was placed off limits to U.S. military personnel.
   U.S. officials said restrictions were lifted Tuesday, but a
midnight weekday curfew was imposed for the 3,500 military personnel
stationed at Kunsan Air Base.
   On Feb. 11, a mushroom grower, Chong Pan-yong, 54, died after an
altercation in a residential area of Kunsan. Police said Air Force
Tech. Sgt. Bruce A. Harayda, 29, of Bridgeport, Conn., was being
questioned.
   On Feb. 15, a military vehicle driven by Army Spec. Dale J. Green
of the 501st Signal Company struck and killed Song Yun-jae, 36, on a
city street. Green is stationed in Kunsan.
   Students staged rallies and clashed with riot police to demand
that South Korean police punish the U.S. soldiers for the two deaths
and the United States pay compensation to the Korean families.

<HEAD>Conspirator Says Move Was Planned Against Marcos In December 1985</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military officers plotted for months
to oust President Ferdinand Marcos and sped up their plans after the
public was angered by cheating in the 1986 election against Corazon
Aquino, a leading conspirator said Wednesday.
   Navy Capt. Rex Robles said reform-minded officers initially
planned to establish a transitional council to run the country until
new elections could be held. Later, they threw their support to Mrs.
Aquino.
   In an interview with radio station DZRH, Robles said the Reform
the Armed Forces Movement planned to move against Marcos in December
1985 but postponed their move after he called a ``snap'' election
for the following February.
   ``So we decided to postpone until sometime after elections,
around April or May in the summer,'' Robles said. ``When there was a
backlash (against) cheating in the elections, we accelerated it.''
   Robles made the remarks on the third anniversary of a military
mutiny, when officers led by then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile
and then-Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos announced they
were breaking with Marcos.
   That triggered a massive popular uprising, during which hundreds
of thousands of civilians poured into the streets to defend the
mutineers against Marcos' troops. Marcos fled Manila three days
later for exile in Hawaii.
   Enrile and Ramos declared their support for Mrs. Aquino. Both she
and Marcos claimed victory in the elections of Feb. 7, 1986, which
the Roman Catholic hierachy and foreign observers said were marked
by unprecedented fraud.
   ``Our plan was if we succeeded in ousting Marcos or asking him to
step down, we would set up a transition council, either five to
seven members,'' Robles said. ``Our agreement was whoever joined the
transition council would not run in the election which we would hold
because it would be unfair.''
   Robles did not explain why the officers dropped the transitional
council in favor of Mrs. Aquino. The reform movement included former
Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, sought in the violent August
1987 attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Movement members frequently have complained that they were never
given credit for their role in ousting Marcos.
   In the interview, Robles said Marcos found out about the plot but
was uncertain when it was to be launched. Robles said the
conspirators leaked a series of possible dates to confuse Marcos'
supporters and force them into a series of security alerts.

<HEAD>Former Klan Leader Likely Member of GOP Legislative Caucus</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Duke's opponent filing motion
challenging residency in district, Duke reax, tightens. No pick up.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly elected state Rep. David Duke's
opponent filed a court motion Tuesday seeking to block the former Ku
Klux Klan grand wizard from taking the legislative seat he won last
Saturday.
   The motion filed by homebuilder John Treen asks that Duke's
candidacy be declared illegal because he lives outside the New
Orleans district that elected him. State law requires a one-year
district residency by candidates.
   District Judge Clarence McManus said he was studying the request
and probably would decide the matter Wednesday morning.
   Duke said late Tuesday that he met the residency requirements
``in every respect. It's a frivolous challenge.'' Duke has said he
has proof he lived in the district, a nearly all-white bedroom
community of New Orleans.
   Earlier Tuesday, state GOP legislative leaders said Duke probably
would be accepted by Republicans as one of their own if he's seated
in the House when it convenes for a special session Wednesday. A
freshman independent had said he would raise the residency issue,
but Democrats and Republicans alike had said they didn't expect the
move to succeed.
   Both Duke and Treen ran as Republicans.
   Treen's motion, filed along with a district resident, asks that
Treen be declared the winner. According to the motion, Duke listed a
home address outside the district when he qualified as a Democratic
primary candidate for president on Jan. 15, 1988, and for state
primaries.
   The motion also asked for a temporary restraining order
forbidding the secretary of state from certifying Duke as the winner
until McManus decides whether Duke fulfilled the residency
requirements.
   However, the secretary of state's office certified the results
Tuesday after Jefferson Parish Registrar Sam Altobello officially
counted the votes from Saturday's race and found Duke's 227-vote
margin of victory intact.
   Duke gave the thumbs up and smiled broadly Tuesday at the
announcement.
   ``I'm just really proud to live in America,'' Duke said. ``I'm
also looking forward to an end to the hoopla.
   ``I'm anxious to meet with the legislators,'' he said. ``I have a
lot to learn.''
   If the Republican Legislative Caucus lets him in, Duke will be
one of 18 Republicans in the 105-member House. There are six
Republicans in the 39-member Senate.
   Also Tuesday, Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater softened
his aggressive campaign to drive Duke from the party, saying he
feared such a public forum might be exactly what the man wanted.
   Republican legislators Tuesday said they saw no reason to reject
Duke from the caucus despite Atwater's repudiation of him as a
``charlatan.'' The Legislature convenes in special session Wednesday
to take up tax issues.
   Rep. Odon Bacque of Lafayette said Monday he intended to
challenge Duke on grounds that he did not live in his district for
the required year.
   ``We will see if Mr. Duke is what he says he is or what the media
says he is,'' said Rep. Peppi Bruneau of New Orleans, GOP caucus
chairman. ``If he's what he says he is, he has no problem. He got to
the House the same way everybody else did.''
   There is at least one precedent for a state legislature refusing
to seat a member because of his views, said Dan O'Connor of Atlanta,
a spokesman for the Southern Legislative Conference of the Council
of State Governments.
   Julian Bond was barred from taking a seat in the Georgia
Legislature in January 1966 because of his opposition to the Vietnam
War. The U.S. Supreme Court in December 1966 said Bond had to be
seated since the only issue was his political views.
   Both President Bush and former President Reagan endorsed Treen in
the runoff election. After Duke won, Atwater vowed to have Duke
censured and barred from using the GOP name.
   A resolution is expected to be adopted by the party's 11-member
executive council, which will confer by telephone Friday.
   At a brief news conference Tuesday, Bush conceded his involvement
might have been viewed by Louisiana voters as ``improper or
overkill.''
   Duke, 38, registered as a Republican days before filing as a
candidate. He left the Klan in 1980 but remains the president of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, which he
describes as a civil rights group for everyone.
   I'm certainly not the David Duke I was during my years in the
Klan but I'm certain I've grown like all people do, mentally,
spiritually,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday in Baton Rouge.
``I believe in the civil rights of all people. I think the criticism
I've endured will be muted by my activities in the House of
Representatives.''
   ``We can't be responsible for what he did before he was
registered as a Republican,'' said Rep. Art Sour, a Republican. ``I
don't understand what Atwater is talking about. Censure him for
what? The only control we have over him is what he's done since he's
been a Republican.''
   Democratic Rep. Ron Gomez, legislative party leader, said he
hoped Duke would be seated without problems.
   ``If anyone wanted to challenge Duke they should have done so
when he qualified as a candidate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Aims To Keep Grammys Attracted to City</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with comment from head of New York
Grammy festivities last year. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `There were...'.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Grammys return to Los Angeles after being wined
and dined last year in New York, and the word is out _ the City of
Angels is going to have to show the music academy an especially good
time.
   ``The Grammy Awards and the Emmy Awards and the Academy Awards,
they just kind of come and go and Los Angeles does its thing,'' said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences.
   But that laid-back attitude is disappearing after the awards show
won the keys to the city in New York last year. Mayor Ed Koch said
he would like the music folks back in the Big Apple at least every
other year.
   ``What we tried to do was turn a one-night event into a four or
five evening event, to encourage people to come to the city,'' said
Jonathan Tisch, chairman of the New York Host Committee for the 1988
Grammy Awards.
   ``There is a lot of prestige, but you certainly cannot ignore the
financial aspect,'' said Tisch, president and chief executive
officer of Loew's Hotels.
   He estimated Grammy visitors and the television show brought
about $40 million to the city.
   ``There were some very interesting and culturally lifting
moments, and that was one of the things that New York really
provided. It makes the nominees feel really special,'' Greene said
recently.
   For the first time, Los Angeles has countered New York's
hospitality with its own friendship campaign, consisting of several
events revolving around Wednesday's awards ceremony.
   This year's three-hour awards show will be broadcast live on CBS
beginning at 8 p.m. EST. Top nominees include folk singer Tracy
Chapman with six nominations and jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin with
five. The show's host will be comedian Billy Crystal.
   The awards are voted by the Los Angeles-based academy's 6,000
members for the best musical performances and songwriting. This is
the 31st year for the awards, and the show has been held in Los
Angeles every year except five.
   This year, the Los Angeles Welcomes The Grammy Awards Committee,
a panel of business leaders selected by Mayor Tom Bradley, is
overseeing receptions and making sure the Grammy folks are welcome
in Los Angeles.
   It's the same formula used by Bradley to attract the Olympics to
Los Angeles in 1984.
   ``What we see is a foundation for building a longer-term
relationship,'' said James L. Stewart, executive director of the
Grammy committee, which has raised $200,000 from businesses to pay
several events.
   Stewart said the academy's directors decide where to hold the
awards ceremony, and none of the possible host cities have a chance
to make bids.
   The committee's events included a Grammys In The Schools program
held Friday at Hamilton High School, where a music academy attracts
students from all over the 300-square-mile Los Angeles school
district. Performers included composer-conductor Henry Mancini, jazz
drummer Stix Hooper and ``Tonight Show'' saxophonist Peter
Christlieb.
   A Grammy Night On The Town on Sunday showcased jazz in the City
of Angels, with performances throughout the city by Benny Carter and
his trio, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, singer Billy Eckstine, and Art
Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.
   During a gala reception Monday at the Gene Autry Western Heritage
Museum, the music academy's President's Award was given to Autry.
   Stewart said the host committee, representing the city but not
funded by it, made political sense.
   ``An activity like the committee ... most people would not
consider that to be an appropriate public funds expenditure,'' he
said. ``But bringing together the civic leadership of this city to
do something like this is highly appropriate.''
   No matter what Los Angeles does to make the Grammy guests and
show feel welcome in the city, Greene has made it clear he is
ambivalent about where the show should be held.
   ``As far as the show itself, Los Angeles and New York are each
centers of music, centers of culture,'' Greene said. ``We don't have
a problem booking the show at either location.''

   A university employee was killed in
battles between police and students protesting government austerity
measures and the purported police slaying of a student, newspapers
said Tuesday.
   More street violence Tuesday was reported by the El Nacional
newspaper.
   Student leaders from Central University in Caracas told reporters
they were protesting an economic reform package announced by the
government that eliminated subsidized prices on most goods.
   They also complained that an engineering student died at the
hands of local police and that a vagrancy law allowed police to
detain and jail people without trial for periods that could run into
years.
   The students said law authorities vowed to apply the vagrancy law
more forcefully to keep criminals off the streets.
   The student leaders told reporters that a university employee,
whom they identified as Carlos Yepez Perez, was killed in cross fire
by a bullet fired by police in battles with students Monday night.
   No reports emerged of other injuries and no confirmation or
denial of the employee's death came from police sources.
   Student leaders said they expected the riots to continue and that
they planned a joint march with students from across the country.

   Rescuers used a helicopter,
bulldozers and bridge-building equipment in an unsuccessful search
Tuesday for the eight people aboard an Air Force cargo plane that
crashed and burned in a swamp.
   An officer who waded through 5-foot-deep water to reach the site
said no bodies were found and it was unlikely anyone could have
survived.
   ``From the looks of it, that's the conclusion any reasonable
person would draw,'' said Col. Howard Oakes, commander of Eglin Air
Force Base in the Florida Panhandle.
   The four-engine C-141B jet, based at Norton Air Force Base at San
Bernardino, Calif., crashed Monday night about four miles north of
Hurlburt Field while on its landing approach.
   Seven crew members from Norton were on board. Also, a retired
military passenger boarded during a refueling stop in Colorado
Springs, Colo., officials said.
   Air Force civil engineers planned to work through the night with
bulldozers and other heavy machinery to build a half-mile dirt road
through the swamp and bridge a creek so vehicles could reach the
crash site Wednesday.
   The site is within Eglin's 720-square-mile military reservation,
which is used for training maneuvers and weapons testing.
   ``The C-141 location along with heavy rains that have been
falling since the crash are hampering rescue and recovery efforts,''
said Technical Sgt. David Torrence, an Eglin spokesman.
   Rescuers arrived by climbing down a rope from a hovering
helicopter or by wading through water and underbrush, Torrence said.
   Oakes said the front part of the aircraft was severely damaged
and its left wing was completely sheared off. The rear two-thirds of
the plane was visible, but the nose was obscured by thick foliage,
he said.
   Army Rangers who have a camp on the reservation were conducting
manuevers in the area and were the first to arrive, about 30 minutes
after the crash, Oakes said.
   ``They saw the fireball,'' he said.
   Small fires burned hours after the crash. No munitions were
aboard, said Col. Dale Stovall, commander of the 1st Special
Operations Wing at Hurlburt.
   An Air Force safety team is investigating the accident. Stovall
said there were severe thunderstorms in the area at the time, but he
declined to say if weather figured in the crash.
   The $32 million C-141B is capable of carrying up to 200 soldiers
in combat gear. The huge aircraft has a wingspan of 160 feet and is
168 feet long. The only U.S. cargo plane larger than a C-141 is the
C-5A Galaxy.

<HEAD>Robin Williams Receives Hasty Pudding Award at Harvard</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto EX10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Robin Williams accepted the 1989
Man of the Year Award on Tuesday from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals,
and found a new use for the Harvard University group's traditional
gift, a brass pudding pot.
   ``The country's only a trillion dollars in debt. Please help,''
he said as he passed the pot around at a news conference.
   Williams wore a rainbow-colored brassiere and wig and shared a
stage with female impersonators as he accepted the prize, which
recognizes a ``lasting and impressive contribution to the world of
entertainment.''
   ``I'll put it on the shelf,'' he promised.
   Hasty Pudding, the nation's oldest undergraduate dramatic
organization, gave an identical brass pot and its Woman of the Year
Award to actress Kathleen Turner last week.
   Williams received his award before the curtain went up on the
Hasty Pudding's 141st annual musical farce, a spoof on Prohibition
called ``Whiskey Business.'' As always, the show has an all-male
cast, including many students dressed as women.
   Since gaining fame as Mork in the television series ``Mork &amp;
Mindy,'' Williams has gone on to success in films including ``The
World According to Garp'' and ``Moscow on the Hudson.'' His
portrayal of Adrian Cronauer, the comic disc jockey in ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' earned him a Golden Globe best-actor award and
an Academy Award nomination in 1987.
   Williams said Tuesday he hadn't expected to win an Oscar: ``I
didn't think I had a shot. It's just like Gary Coleman joining the
NBA.''
   He said he believes comedy generally receives less recognition
than it should.
   His latest movie, ``The Dead Poets Society,'' is scheduled for
release in June. Williams said he portrays a teacher of English
literature in a private boys' school in 1959, a role with ``some
humor, more drama.''
   Hasty Pudding mebers advised Williams, who as Mork used to drink
water with his finger, that he would be allowed to drink from the
pudding pot with his finger. But they said cooking anything in the
brass vessel could be a problem. When past man-of-the-year recipient
Steven Spielberg tried it, his melted.

   Storms and tornadoes besieged the South on Tuesday, ripping a
roof off an elementary school in North Carolina, causing sewers to
back up in Alabama and dumping still more rain on flood-weary
Kentucky and Tennessee.
   A mass of warm and humid air spawned the severe storms and
twisters in a wide band from the Gulf Coast states to New England,
with Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas the
hardest hit.
   In North Carolina, a house under construction near Lillington
collapsed in the high winds, killing one worker and injuring three
others, authorities said.
   Wind tore off a quarter of the roof at a one-story elementary
school in Morven, N.C., while classes were in session, said
sheriff's dispatcher Elaine Lear in Wadesboro. No one was injured,
and pupils were sent home.
   ``We had just had our tornado drill last week so that children
knew exactly what to do,'' said school secretary Gloria Truman.
``They were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15
seconds. They were perfect. You could not ask for them to be any
better.''
   Also in south-central North Carolina, the wind flipped over
several small planes at Anson County Airport. Four people received
minor injuries when the wind tossed around trailer homes near Eagle
Springs and Zion's Grove, said a dispatcher.
   Up to 3,500 customers were without electricity in the Rockingham
and Wadesboro areas, Carolina Power and Light spokesman Kyle Hampton
said.
   Temperatures reached the high 80s in some Florida cities Tuesday,
but a cold snap was expected to push readings into the teens by
Wednesday. The forecast forced the National Weather Service to
cancel its annual statewide tornado drill planned for Wednesday
because severe weather was on the way.
   ``You don't want a test going on when you have the real thing,''
said forecaster Ray Biedinger.
   Kentucky and Tennessee, which logged up to 11 inches of rain last
week, received more rain Monday and Tuesday, sending rivers rising
again. Temperatures were expected to dip below freezing overnight.
   The storm system dumped more than 3 additional inches of water on
parts of southern Kentucky before rains began to subside Tuesday
afternoon.
   South of Louisville, crews lowered a second pump by helicopter to
the Lebanon Junction levee after the Rolling Fork of the Salt River
overflowed its banks. Officials said the pump being used to remove
flood water from inside the levee couldn't keep up with the latest
rainfall.
   Police said the rain has contributed to the death of at least two
people in Kentucky _ a 19-year-old woman killed when her car hit a
truck on a rain-slick highway and a man whose van was swept away by
flood waters Thursday. Officials were still searching Tuesday for a
second man who had been in the van.
   In western Kentucky, the Green River crest is being delayed by
flooding on the Ohio River, which was expected to crest at Owensboro
at 44 feet, 4 feet above flood stage.
   The Ohio's high level has backed up operations at the Owensboro
Riverport Authority. Grain can't be loaded onto barges again until
water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a fixed
loading spout, said port director Janet Douglas. She didn't expect
normal operations to resume until later in the week.
   The neaby Owensboro Grain Co. can load barges because its dock is
on higher ground, said traffic manager Ron Edge, but the high water
levels have prevented unloading incoming soybean shipments.
   Heavy rains blocked sections of at least 170 roads in 56 of
Kentucky's 120 counties on Tuesday, said Don Armstrong, a spokesman
for the state Division of Disaster and Emergency Services. He said
as many as 2,000 Kentuckians have evacuated their homes since last
week. The exact number was unknown because many people left on their
own.
   Storms brought 2 more inches of rain to parts of Tennessee,
flooding a few roads, but no evacuations were ordered, authorities
said.
   In southeastern Alabama, a tornado cut a path about a mile long
near Wicksburg early Tuesday, damaging several roofs and bringing
down trees and power lines, said Bobby Clemmons, director of
emegency management services in Houston County. School in the mostly
rural county was called off.
   The heavy rain flooded streets and homes in Florence, Ala., in
the northwest corner, causing the sewer system to overflow, but only
one family was evacuated, said George Mangum, director of Lauderdale
County Emergency Management.
   In South Carolina, high wind swept through Lexington and
Chesterfield counties, overturning mobile homes and uprooting trees,
authorities said.
   The storms may have spawned a tornado that a Chesterfield County
deputy saw touch down near Jefferson, said Everette Campbell, the
jail administrator for the sheriff's department. Several trailers
and turkey barns were damaged but no injuries were reported, he said.
   About 500 utility customers in southwest Georgia were without
power Tuesday morning, but service was restored to all but a few
isolated areas by midday, said Teresa Callaway of Pataula Electric
Membership Corp.

   Climatologists say it may take two decades to
learn whether the greenhouse effect causes summer heat waves, and
until then any government response to slow down global warming is
just a gamble.
   A House Energy and Commerce panel, in testimony prepared for
delivery today, has learned that experts differ over whether the
gamble is worth taking now.
   At stake could be new and expensive environmental actions to
reduce gases that trap heat like a garden greenhouse roof.
   In 1988, the earth experienced a series of climate-related events
that some experts have long associated with the buildup of
``greenhouse'' gases: prolonged drought, heat waves, forest fires, a
super hurricane and flooding in Bangladesh.

   Camouflaged combat fatigues replaced pastel
nursing uniforms at the state-run General Hospital, where the Rhode
Island National Guard was called in to replace striking workers for
the second time this year.
   ``The Guard is prepared to stay there as long as necessary,''
said Patrick Kirby, chief of staff for Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, after
nurses and attendants at the 480-bed hospital walked out in a
contract dispute Monday.
   Seven of the 110 Guard troops sent to the hospital had nursing
training; the rest were given non-medical tasks such as feeding,
washing and dressing patients.
   ``I think it's a very dangerous situation for patients, in fact I
think it's life-threatening,'' said Thomas Romeo, director of the
state Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals. ``Not
all the individuals up there right now know exactly what they're
doing. There's not a lot of tolerance for error.''

   Texas, battered by crises in oil, real estate and
savings and loans, has a new woe: dozens of insurance companies are
insolvent and one of the state's largest insurers has collapsed.
   The $54 million failure of National County Mutual Fire Insurance
Co., the costliest in Texas history, has triggered a state inquiry
into the state Board of Insurance and the industry itself.
   With 42 Texas-based insurance companies and 98 that do business
in the state being liquidated, fears are growing that Texas insurers
are following the same road as savings and loans.
   ``The potential is there,'' says state Rep. Eddie Cavazos,
chairman of budget and oversight for the House Insurance Committee.

   The federal foreign aid agency says the time
has come for a radical reshaping of the way the United States
allocates the billions of dollars a year it passes out to other
nations.
   The recommendation was contained in a 158-page report issued
Monday by the administrator of the Agency for International
Development, Alan Woods.
   ``The challenges of today's problems, and tomorrow's, cannot be
met with yesterday's solutions, suitable as they may have been to
yesterday's problems,'' the report said.
   The study, which made no specific recommendations for policy
changes, said the aid program no longer seems able to fulfill its
original mandate of helping poor countries achieve the transition
from dependency to self-sufficiency.

   Ronald Reagan's presidential powers should have
been transferred to then-Vice President Bush following Reagan's
shooting in an assassination attempt, Reagan's former doctor says.
   Discussing points he made to a University of Virginia study
panel, Dr. Daniel Ruge said Monday that ``it never occurred'' to him
at the time to press the issue with Reagan's top aides.
   Kenneth W. Thompson, head of the Miller Center for Public Affairs
at the University of Virginia, said he hopes there will be no
repetition of the disorganization that followed Reagan's March 30,
1981, shooting by John W. Hinckley Jr.
   The situation was typified by then-Secretary of State Alexander
M. Haig Jr.'s declaration that ``as of now, I am in control, here in
the White House.'' Haig said this as Bush was headed back to
Washington from Texas on that fateful day.

<TEXT>
   What if television news had been around to report
on historic events, such as the Crusades?
   The producers of ``Timeline'' asked that question, and the
result, a six-part series on PBS, premieres tonight.
   The answer is _ it would look pretty dumb.
   The series premieres tonight with ``The Crusades, 1187.'' The
other episodes, airing in coming weeks, are ``The Black Death,
1361,'' ``The Vikings, 1066,'' ``The Fall of Byzantium, 1453,''
``The Mongol Empire, 1247'' and ``Granada, 1492.''
   If this is what it takes to make people swallow history lessons,
we're doomed. Anyone dim enough to need former network newsman Steve
Bell _ dressed in Medieval costume, no less _ to explain the Plague
in sound bites, will sit still only long enough to realize this is
not the Monty Python sketch it at first appears, then switch to
``Who's the Boss?''
   The only immediate use for the six-part series would seem to be
presenting it to caged junior high schoolers.
   First, there's the problem of making what is basically a
historical documentary look like a news report, so there are
confusing graphics on top of various scenes declaring the footage
``File'' or ``Live'' _ from the year 1187, or whatever, of course.
Correspondents in period costume _ with names such as Owen of
Canarfon or Siboletto of Zimbabwe _ also confuse the viewer since
they are intercut with ``interviews'' with participants in the
events. Then, if that weren't enough, we're presented with
explanations of past events that led up to the ``current''
situation, labeled ``91 years ago,'' for instance.
   The history lesson is perfectly serious _ even though it seems
John Cleese will appear at any moment _ but there are lame attempts
at humor. The programs are interrupted occasionally by period
``commercials,'' such as one hawking chimneys, a new concept.
   The dramatizations are impressive in their careful attention to
authentic detail in the costumes and sets _ if not in the rather
overly enthusiastic acting. The series was taped on locations in
Turkey, England and Spain.
   But the programs are extremely wordy. The basic problem with
``Timeline'' is that it ultimately is not like television news _
television news would never bombard viewers with so much information.

   Elsewhere in television:
   HOW GOOD IS YOUR CHILDREN'S SHOW? _ You've got a new children's
program, but you don't know if it's good or not. What do you do?
Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, has
five questions producers and presenters of children's programming
should ask themselves:
   1. Does the program have something to say instead of just
something to sell?
   2. Would you submit it to an international animation or film
festival for an award?
   3. Would you put it at the top of a list for the lawyer who is
defending you against a station's challenge?
   4. Would parents tape it if their children were at the dentist?
   5. Would you mention it by name if your child's teacher asked you
what you do for a living?
   Charren presented the list at a recent National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences dinner where she was awarded the
Trustees' Emmy Award for her watchdog efforts on behalf of youthful
viewers. ...
   ``BABAR'' ON HBO'' _ Home Box Office, which has gotten into the
children's programming business with good results so far, is giving
the beloved children's book character, Babar the elephant, his own
series. The series, based on the 28 stories written by painter Jean
de Brunhoff and his son, Laurent, will premiere April 2. ...
   THE FAMILY THAT WATCHES TOGETHER, ISN'T _ According to Nielsen
Media Research, families with pay cable and children _ not
necessarily in that order _ are more than twice as likely as other
households to watch more than one set at the same time. Prime time
was the most popular time for watching more than one set, presumably
with the kids in one room and the parents in the other. ...
   CNN IN THE U.S.S.R. _ CNN's international news compendium ``CNN
World Report'' made its debut on Soviet television as part of
``Mezdunardony Televestnik'' or ``International TV Herald'' last
month. The half-hour program, anchored by Soviet host Al Gurnov,
utilized CNN-provided reporting on the worldwide spread of AIDS.
Soviet television will continue airing its version of the program
monthly until May, when it becomes a bi-weekly series. ``CNN World
Report'' is comprised of reports from various broadcast news
organizations around the world, and many other nations make use of
the reports in their newscasts.

<HEAD>The Fed's Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To lean into the winds of inflation, even taking
the risk that the economy will fall flat on its face. To reinforce
economic reasoning and bolster its strength when political spending
dreams get out of hand.
   These are two of the historic missions of the Federal Reserve, an
always controversial, often misunderstood, sometimes misguided
powerhouse.
   It has no set image. To some people, including the presidents who
nominate its chairmen, it is an arrogant bully; to others, it is a
nervous nellie, its worry-red eyes seeking economic dangers hidden
from the perception of others.
   In this regard, it has been accused of removing the punch bowl
just as the fun begins _ which is to say that at the height of the
economic celebration it seeks to keep its head so that everyone can
drive home safely from the party.
   It reports to Congress, but some congressmen have railed against
it and had no impact at all. It keeps secrets; rarely is there a
leak of inside discussions. And seldom does it explain its moves in
great detail.
   Oddly, the Fed's reticence gets it more space in the media than
almost any member of Congress or any Cabinet officer could command.
It also is the subject of endless speculation in the investment and
political communities.
   Generally, it maintains an intellectual aloofness from political
assaults. On the other hand, it has been accused again and again of
timing its economic moves to help re-elect the incumbent party _ of
creating election year booms.
   The Fed thus has many faces and many images at different times,
but not now. Seldom has its mission been more explicit: It is going
to face down the threat of inflation by slowing the American
economy's growth rate.
   Moreover, it intends to get the job done before inflation does
work its way into the economic marrow. Not forgotten is the 1970s
experience, when the Fed, for whatever reasons, allowed inflation to
gather such steam it took the highest interest rates of the century
and a deep recession to stop it.
   As usual, it has supporters and dissenters, and sometimes the two
are combined. Wall Street is said to gain confidence from the Fed's
position on inflation, but some of those Wall Streeters are
attracting the money of clients with forecasts of economic growth
much higher than that prescribed by the Fed.
   Many people, including respected economists and even President
Bush, feel the inflation danger is overstated. By his actions as
chairman, Alan Greenspan couldn't disagree more; relentlessly, he
has forced up interest rates.
   Such action, it often is contended, threatens to replace one
danger, inflation, with another, recession. Judging by its actions,
the Fed agrees that there are indeed two dangers, and that recession
is the more acceptable.
   So far, the Fed's anti-inflation policy not only hasn't stopped
the economy in its tracks but hasn't been able to slow the growth
rate to a target of only 2.5 percent or thereabouts. Many economists
still expect growth of 3.5 percent this year.
   As the Fed seems to view the situation, growth at 3.5 percent
would so stress on the nation's plant capacity and labor force _ in
both instances compelling the use of the least efficient of each _
that price increases would follow.
   But critics, as there always are when the Fed is involved,
contend that by raising interest rates the Fed will force companies
to forego investments in greater plant capacity and more efficient
technology and methods.

   Just a 20-minute walk east from the spires of
London's high finance and the dome of St. Paul's, signs of England
melt away into the sounds and smells of the Asian subcontinent.
   The mosque's wailing call to prayer drowns out the the toll of
the church bell, swishing sari robes replace pinstripes and the
scents of roast lamb and spice perfume the air in Brick Lane _ the
``new world'' for Britain's latest immigrants, people from
Bangladesh.
   Since the first Bangladeshis stepped off the boats three decades
ago, some 30,000 have streamed into this part of London's East End.
Like the Jews once predominant here, they have struggled to learn
English, find shelter and work, and preserve their culture.
   A century ago Brick Lane was an area of infamous squalor, where
Jack the Ripper stalked his victims. In World War II it was heavily
bombed, and soon Jews began moving out, leaving the low-built houses
and narrow streets to what has become the largest single
concentration of Britain's 160,000 Bangladeshis.
   Initially arriving for transient work, they have brought
families, built five mosques in a square-mile area of Tower Hamlets
borough and opened leather shops and grocery stores filled with
chutneys and mangoes. One mosque used to be a synagogue.
   Having laid down roots and grown in number, the Bangladeshis have
also discovered self-assertiveness, and have adopted a higher
profile in demanding their rights as Moslems.
   They want more sexual segregation in state-funded schools where
their children are in the majority, as well as government money for
their private schools.
   Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' became an issue in
mid-Februar among the Bangladeshis.
   Not all supported Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call to kill
Rushdie and his publishers. But they were vociferous in denouncing
the novel as an insult to their faith, Islam.
   In many ways the issue wasn't about Rushdie's book, said Iqbal
Wahhab, editor of the Asian Herald, an English-language weekly.
   ``It was about the reassertion of Moslem values onto British
society which they feel have been ignored.''
   The Bangladeshis have begun to shed the immigrant mentality and
think of England as home.
   ``Five, 10 years ago, our people send all money to Bangladesh and
think `I'm just working here,''' said Siraz Miah, a 28-year-old
whose tiny leather factory is up a narrow staircase strewn with
leather scraps.
   ``Now we think it's our country. Now people have house and
business. Now is better.''
   His 12 workers stitch 300 jackets a week on old sewing machines,
surrounded by head-high piles of hide and the acrid smell of
chemicals. They are among the fortunate. Twenty-seven percent of
East End Bangladeshis are jobless.
   It was factories like this that prompted Prince Charles, during a
1987 visit, to liken Brick Lane's workplaces to subcontinent
sweatshops.
   Something must be done, said the heir to the British throne, and
the business community responded with 1.5 million pounds ($2.6
million) in donations for job-creation projects.
   Syed Bodrul Islam, who works the Tower Hamlets Center for Small
Business, a job-promotion agency, says his focus is with the younger
generation like Miah.
   A former social worker, Islam helps his clients apply for
interest-free loans for businesses, ranging from shops to market
stalls.
   ``Many were not educated, even in Bangladesh,'' he added. ``But
the younger generation are very important.
   ``The old people who came years ago have a lot of problems. They
can't read or write. ... Some came over with 5,000 or 6,000
pounds,'' $9,000 to $17,000 in 1960.
   Arriving mostly from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh, formerly
East Pakistan, many early settlers were ship's cooks, with few
skills and little English, who came alone intending to return home
someday.
   Families followed, sometimes nearly a decade later because of
Britain's tightening immigration laws, and a community grew. Now
their children speak with Cockney accents.
   ``We have heard that Moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go
to discos. It's worrying us _ what comes next?'' said Daslim-Ali, a
leader of the East London Mosque near Brick Lane.
   Others trust the collective identity forged in Brick Lane to
teach the children.
   ``Nowadays lots of Bangladeshis are here, so our children know
how we behave,'' said Taiyabur Rahman, 55, who came in 1959 to open
the first Bangladeshi travel agency in London.
   ``As long as our children are with us, they won't be lost.''
   But while life improves, problems remain.
   Racist violence, a threat wherever Britain's 800,000 Asian
immigrants are clustered, is acute in Tower Hamlets. The Tower
Hamlets Association for Racial Equality says it received about 2,500
complaints of racial harassment in 1987, mostly over beatings and
broken windows. It reported seven arson attacks on Asian homes, none
of which caused injuries.
   Speaking little English and a dialect that has no written form,
immigrants are often cut off from police, jobs and social services.
   With a birthrate five times above the national average, men must
feed five to seven mouths on the lowest average wage of any ethnic
minority in Britain, a 1987 House of Commons report said.
   But it noted the ``strengths of the community, particularly its
culture and extent of self-help within families.''
   The district still has a few reminders of its Jewish past _ an
all-night bagel shop or the J. Minsky and Sons textile store. But
the Jews do not seem bitter about the newcomers.
   Sidney Minsky, whose father started the business in 1902, eagerly
shows a visitor around Asian stores in old tenements.
   ``The Asians show you how a business can be run,'' he said.

<HEAD>Primeval Forest is Last Refuge for Lowland Gorilla</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYANGA, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is as remote a
place as you can get in Africa. The large-scale map of the Bayanga
region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a
single paved road.
   In this heart of darkness, hundreds of miles from the nearest
village, man's closest relative in the animal kingdom, the lowland
gorilla, has found his last refuge, a sanctuary of sorts from Pygmy
tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide.
   The gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under
tough protection in the Central African Republic. But the government
has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective
laws.
   There are two main groups of gorillas in Africa: the mountain
gorilla in Rwanda and eastern Zaire _ whose habitat and life style
have been fully explored _ and the lowland gorilla who remains
largely a mystery.
   The mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually
allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human
beings.
   The lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive, explains
Richard W. Carroll of the Yale University School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies in New Haven, Conn.
   Carroll, who has made the gorilla his life's work, rarely gets
close enough to strike up an acquaintance. In more than five years'
work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla, Carroll
has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest.
   He estimates that a desolate area of 40,000 square miles of
forest where the Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Congo
meet may still have at least 90,000 gorillas permanently settled
there. With the exception of rare logging camps along he rivers,
there is no human activity in this area, and the gorillas have until
recently remained undisturbed.
   In recent years, the logging camps have developed, and there has
been ``heavy illegal poaching'' for meat and the ivory of elephants
who are the other main inhabitants of the region.
   In the central market in Bangui, the Central African capital 220
miles to the east, stands are piled high smoked monkey meat, a local
delicacy.
   ``Gorillas taste like monkeys, only better,'' said Pierre Somse,
who is Carroll's Pygmy guide. ``And there is more of them.''
   Carroll, who lives in Bayembe with his wife and 3-year-old
daughter, has been trying to teach the Pygmies why the gorillas are
best left alone. It's an almost hopeless task.
   The Pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows. But
larger Africans, those brought in to work the logging camps, use
rifles and even machine guns, Carroll said.
   ``They bribe the Pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and
liquor. In some areas, we find snares made of cables stolen from the
logging companies every few yards along trails used by the
gorrillas.''
   The gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the ever-present
ginger-like Aframomum shrub, the fruit of tropical trees and the
eggs of termites.
   ``It's quite common to see a 400-pound silverback gorilla climb
more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit,'' Carroll
said. ``They love that more than anything.
   ``They will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there.''
   In some areas on the ground, gorilla nests are visible every five
or six yards. But the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human
being approach.
   Carroll has been trying to persuade the Central African
government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern
tip of the country. But in reality, the effort is useless unless the
other two governments in the area, the Congo and Cameroon, cooperate.
   Meanwhile, the poaching goes on. Even poorly paid wildlife guards
sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and
elephants. And the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the
poachers from the guards.
   ``It would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals,''
Carroll said. ``We have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close
to them, and even then we don't see them 'til we are a foot or two
away. With a radio, we could find a place ahead of them and watch
them coming.''
   He said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials,
and, as such, are by far the closest animals to man.
   But he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of
control and the inability of local governments and European and
American organizations to stop the poaching.
   ``Recently we were in a camp on the Sangha River, where it forms
the border with the Congo. A Congolese gunboat came up the river and
ordered us to get out of there. We were clearly in the C.A.R.
(Central African Republic). But quite obviously, we were interfering
with their poaching.''

<HEAD>Green Consumer Movement Gains Momentum in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``green consumer'' movement is gaining momentum
in Western Europe, and environmentalism is becoming mainstream.
   Now many Europeans need only to go to the neighborhood
supermarket if they want organically grown vegetables, low-mercury
batteries, or what have become known as environment-friendly diapers
and cruelty-free cosmetics, those marketed without being tested on
laboratory animals.
   Consumers increasingly are demanding products that don't ``cost
the earth,'' and companies are seizing the new opportunity, experts
say.
   ``People realize that by exercising choice on the high street
(main street) they can change the way the environment is treated,''
said Virginia Bottomley, a British environment official.
   ``There's a growing acceptance that we can't go on using and
destroying the world's natural resources.''
   She was one of 11 speakers at a recent London conference of
officials from government, industry and environmental groups called
``Attracting the Green Consumer.''
   Robin Sadler, an advertising consultant, told the conference:
``Green issues are not just flavor of the month. This could become
the world's central project for the next century.''
   Here are just some of the steps governments have taken:
   _The 12-nation European Economic Community and 23 other countries
have committed themselves to cutting back the use of CFCs, or
chlorofluorocarbons, by 50 percent by the end of the century. CFCs,
used as propellants, are thought to deplete the earth's protective
ozone shield.
   _Italy plans a 100-lire (8-cent) tax on consumers for each
non-biodegradable plastic bag they take from the store.
   _The Netherlands is offering tax breaks to people who buy cars
that meet strict anti-pollution standards.
   _West Germany for years has put ``Blue Angel'' labels on products
that meet its environmental standards. The Scandinavian countries,
the Netherlands, France, Japan and Canada are following suit.
   Queen Elizabeth II has switched her fleet of cars to lead-free
gasoline, and her son Prtince Charles has banned aerosol sprays from
his home.
   Green consumerism offers many opportunities to companies, but
confronts them with a complex market, the experts said.
   ``The highest levels of concern are shown by the more affluent
groups of society,'' said Dorothy MacKenzie, a marketing expert. But
``there are lots of different green consumers. They are motivated by
different concerns and have widely different patterns.''
   They range from 1960s-style hippies and current-day ``guppies''
(green yuppies) to mothers concerned about their children's future,
she said.
   The green opportunities mean companies can make money directly,
by selling green products, as well as indirectly, by enhancing their
reputation.
   ``Our reputation clearly helps our business,'' said John Hume,
director of Johnson Wax Ltd., the British subsidiary of the
similarly named U.S. household products maker. His company removed
CFCs from its aerosols in 1986, a costly exercise, and labels
products environment-friendly.
   Disposable diapers are one of the latest products to go green and
earn the reputation of being environment-friendly. Procter and
Gamble, joining other companies, is selling chlorine-free diapers in
six countries. The chlorine-processed diapers contain tiny residues
of the highly poisonous chemical dioxin.
   Safeway PLC, no relation to the U.S. supermarket chain, has
removed contentious or detrimental ingredients from its own
products, such as artificial color in its own-brand orange soda.
   It also recycles its cardboard and offers its customers free,
recycled paper bags. It has built a CFC-free refrigeration center in
Scotland.
   The British confectioner Cadbury Ltd. is among companies that
have opted for a link with a worthy cause. In 1985 it began donating
a percentage of sales of a chocolate Wildlife Bar to the World
Wildlife Fund to help endangered animals. The animals are depicted
on the bars' labels.
   Research has found that consumers are willing to pay more for
environment-friendly products.
   Marek Mayer, an expert on environmental issues, said some West
German retailers are believed to charge more for products that carry
the ``Blue Angel'' label, even though some of these products are
cheaper to make.
   Julia Hailes, co-author of ``The Green Consumer Guide,'' said
green products initially will cost more, but their prices will
decline as they are mass-produced.
   Despite green consumerism's growing momentum, both consumers and
companies remain reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly, the experts
said.
   Organic produce still represents less than 5 percent of Safeway's
total produce sales, said Tony Combes, a director. The government's
Mrs. Bottomley lamented that only 2 percent of the auto fuel
consumed in Britain is unleaded.
   ``People will not do what they say they do for the environment
unless its very easy,'' Sadler said. ``Personal benefit may still be
the key to adopting green issues. The idea of doing something for
the common good is still not a motivation for people yet,
unfortunately.''
   The experts said the threat of consumer criticism is very real.
   ``There's a very great danger that we could have an inconsistency
here of polluting the environment while producing green products,''
Hume said. For instance, he added, lead-free gas might reduce air
pollution, but its manufacture produces at least one highly toxic
byproduct.
   Walter Guthrie, a manager at Boots MicroCheck Group, a chemicals
maker, said: ``Some manufacturers have made preservative-free claims
when the product didn't need to be preserved in the first place.
These attempts to mislead the consumer should be actively
discouraged.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Time was the telephone came in one basic shape
and, like Henry Ford's Model T, in one basic color, black. It had
simple functions. It tied neighborhood and family together with
voices, the whispered devotions of lovers, the reassurance of
distant parents, the first words of a grandchild, a reminder that a
bill was due, an order for groceries. But look what's happening to
it now.

   Beware the telephone. TV ads may tease and
promise adventure at the fingertips. But it's call now, pay later,
when the monthly bill shows where late night loneliness and the
pursuit of romance dug into the wallet.
   That once-friendly instrument, masquerading in the colors of the
rainbow and shapes that range from computer clever to Space Age
gothic, is at your service with services you never dreamed you'd
want.
   Everything from pay-as-you-talk to Santa to pay-as-you-dream
about sex.
   A firm in Seattle brought down the wrath of parents with a
half-hour Christmas show featuring Santa Claus. Children were told
to hold their telephones toward the screen, whereupon tone-activated
signals dialed up that jolly old elf so the kids could chat with
him, while the computer logged and charged for the calls.
   Things have changed in the telephone world, not so much because
the changes are needed, but because they are possible. And
profitable.
   Today's telephone junky can have intimate chats with all kinds of
strangers.
   Now a whole new series of 1-900 numbers are opening up. On some
you are a quiz show guest, answering with your push-button phone to
maybe win a prize. But you pay for the call, perhaps $2 for openers
and more if you stay on the line.
   A simple call on one adult sex line in New York City can run $20
or more, whether you talk or not.
   The telephone has spawned a new business that some say is
eclipsing $400 million a year and growing. An evening of letting
your fingers do the walking can ring up a $200 phone bill in a
couple of hours.
   The same comforting device that gave you grandma's warm and
comforting voice now gives you everything from strange sex to sexy
strangers, from gays in search of companionship to high school kids
on a high.
   It offers up the stock market, the latest interest rates, advice
on mortgages. Its recorded voices tell you what meetings there are
in your community, where to shop for an auto loan, when to get up,
how to pray, what your biorhythms are, when your stars are
favorable, when they are not, how to get a date whatever your sexual
or racial choice, who is going to win the Super Bowl and what the
point spread is, where to get free money for college.
   Dial and get the latest jokes, the top horse racing picks,
lottery results, a daily diet, skiing bargains, sports scores,
government job openings, insults, wine choices, movie reviews, soap
opera reviews, music trivia, sports trivia, trivial trivia.
   That's not all.
   On the gab lines you can chat with strangers, search for a date,
leave your number for promised human adventure, dispel in seven
push-button digits that most universal of all human conditions,
loneliness. And if one is too shy, dial the adult lines (in New York
there are more than 200 of them) and become an aural voyeur to kinky
sex, erotic fantasy. From their lips to your ear, and only the
telephone billing computer will know.
   It is 5:30 a.m. in New York City and CBS has sandwiched in
between its late-night rerun and morning business shows a commercial
or two showing a black-dressed villain and a pretty blonde a la
Perils of Pauline urging viewers to call a certain 970 number and
rescue this damsel from certain boredom.
   When the number is reached (after several tries) a woman's voice
says the call will cost $5 unless you hang up now. Then you are
assigned your personal code number and given another telephone
number to call. After several tries again, you enter your code, then
push another number as instructed and finally reach a young,
breathless voice named Linda. She is apparently ready to field your
favorite fantasy, although she volunteers nothing.
   You find that she is a 22-year-old college graduate (political
science) from a New York state university, is thinking about joining
the Peace Corps, and is saving money to go to Europe to visit a
friend.
   You hesitate to ask, ``What's a nice girl like you doing in this
racket,'' and inquire instead, ``Are you well-paid for this?''
   She answers no. Then someone steps in and terminates the call.
Either time was up or the questions were going too far.

   Three weeks later the television invitation to call carries a
sotto voce addendum: ``Ten dollars a call.''
   This particular operation is offered by one of a group of
companies, known usually as Omni Phone Inc. of Seattle, although in
Texas the name is HDL Inc. The marketing and promotion is handled by
a firm called the Megaquest Group, based in Seattle. The companies
employ about 500 people and operate in about 30 cities domestically,
plus all of Canada and in London, Rotterdam, Paris and Australia.
   One of the satellite companies, Phonequest, was the one that
engineered the Santa calling show. It was syndicated to 30 domestic
and four foreign markets. When the Seattle station began getting
irate calls, it quickly ran a warning to children with the printed
words telling them to ask Mom and Dad first. Why did Phonequest,
which has used the program for four years, rely on the electronic
dialing technique? A spokesman said it was to prevent children from
dialing the wrong number.
   When one of the firm's 970 numbers in New York City was dialed
and reached after several abortive tries, a pretentiously sexy
female voice answered and offered to be companionable. When the
phone bill came in, it registered four calls and two additional
minutes. The charge was $79.80, even though three of the calls never
produced an answer. When the number was called back, post billing,
this was the conversation:
   Hi, welcome to party line.
   How much does this call cost?
   You didn't hear the recording?
   There was no recording.
   Nineteen ninety-five.
   Goodbye.
   That number also was advertised on television, with an attractive
young woman adding under her breathless message, ``$19.95 a call.''
It so happened that particular number was another Omni Phone
enterprise. Betsy Superfon, known erroneously in the trade as
``Betsy Superphone,'' is chief executive officer of the
Seattle-based firm.
   She says the company offers everything from soap opera updates to
joke lines, from dial-an-insult to group access lines. She outlined
plans to go into other areas with information storage and retrieval
via voice, a kind of telephone postal service, as well as
interconnections between computers, and varying menues available on
a single line to get specific data, for instance in sports, that the
caller desires.
   There is also a proposal to acquire her firm from herself and
partners Joel and Rebecca Eisenberg. They claim a 1987 net income of
not less than $4 million. The would-be acquirer is a Texas firm
called WurlTech Industries of Houston, which is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange as a billiard table manufacturer. It was
recently quoted at about a dollar a share.
   Of the unanswered but charged-for calls, Ms. Superfon said she
would refund any justifiable costs on receipt of a complaining
letter. She said there is a quality control program to prevent such
errors.
   Would she continue the current gab line and adult services in
light of her future plans?
   ``Absolutely. People are lonely, have been lonely and always will
be lonely.''
   Besides, for many people the phone lines provide a real service
for companionship, even though many of the people who link up by
voice rarely see each other. ``Telephones are really safe,'' she
says.
   There is already the beginning of a second generation of
telephone-line dating. From New York City comes word of a ``Fax,''
or facsimile-transmitter club, which for a few hundred dollars will
let you fax your message to someone else's fax, and never hear their
voice if you don't want to.
   Industry-wide, most dial-it entrepreneurs would talk only on a
not-for-attribution basis.
   Chris Elwell, editor of the Information Industry Bulletin, one of
the few authoritative sources in the dial-it industry, says using
the telephone for information is nothing new. New York telephone
operators have been giving the time of day since the late 1920s,
with the weather and traffic information following. The old operator
and the party line were avenues for news and gossip.
   Advertising is a major expense for today's purveyors. Small
operations rely on word-of-mouth and matchbook covers to pass on
tantalizing phone numbers.

   Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are
interrupted with all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive
young women, purring, ``There's a party on your line whenever you
want. Call as often as you want.''
   Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in
advertising, but the expansion and invasion of the information
telephone services, sanctioned by state and local authorities, is
becoming troublesome to many.
   In California, the state legislature and the Public Service
Commission made it mandatory for the telephone company to block
lines to such calls at the customer's request. Pacific Bell has a
suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn operators to force them to
cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging Pacific Bell's
reputation.
   New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk
lines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off
disruptive or obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it
doesn't seem to work on others.
   New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residences
for free. Until this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses must
pay $10 and up, depending on the number of lines.
   The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the
customer complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without
parental permission. After that, the customer is urged to have the
line blocked, or keep their youngsters off the phone.
   The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether
the dial-it service collects or not. One West Coast company says
uncollected calls cost it $400,000 a year.
   Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlanta
in 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts.
   The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach Vilma
Lantiqua, a 49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout
in New York City. Her son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill,
calling various party lines. In desperation she put the phone in her
daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night in January, Sergio broke
into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangled
her, police said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring in
which a California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in the
Los Angeles area, is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements
of freedom of speech.
   The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans
sexually explicit telephone message services. The law prohibits any
obscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes over
interstate lines. It provides for fines up to $500,000 and prison
terms up to two years.
   Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number of
area phone companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the
telephone information business in general, are planning to curtail
or segregate the pornographic and gab lines.
   The revenues are important. One New York state official said the
information services help subsidize the general telephone services.
   Those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious than
other gab lines. They permit callers to talk with a group or
``barhop'' by pressing a designated key on push-button phones. One
operator of such lines says they perform a real service, all the
more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic.
   ``Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good
thing to do,'' he says. ``Gays take this more seriously than do the
straights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines.''
   Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best.
Quality equipment is expensive, some devices running $2,000 a line
or more. They force a telephone line, capable of carrying two
voices, to carry six to eight.
   Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to
fruition, some fail for lack of continuing innovation. It is a
copycat business. Some reserved lines are still vacant. There are
thousands more available.
   The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead
bodies, lost fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out
there, each a potential market.
   Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western
states. Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are
showing up.
   But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller
says, ``It's cheaper than going out.''
   Or was.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ At Costello's Restaurant, a New York watering
place where celebrities are legendary, Herbie has found a home at
age 83. He is, by popular acclaim, the World's Worst Waiter. His
customers would have it no other way.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herbie Pischler stands at the counter,
motionless, his back to the thinning crowd. His pencil rests idly on
his order pad.
   Is he adding a check? Figuring his tips? No. The noonday rush has
been wearing on Herbie. He is taking a nap.
   Give him a moment. Soon his head will jerk upward and he will
resume his slow shuffling among the tables at Costello's Restaurant
in effortless affirmation of the title his fans have voted him: the
World's Worst Waiter.
   Those who dispute the title point out Herbie's occasional
displays of dining room efficiency.
   Should a customer ask for another roll, for example, Herbie often
reaches in his pocket where he keeps a supply, saving all those
steps to the kitchen. When one customer asked what the creamy stuff
was on his sandwich, Herbie scooped up some on his finger and licked
it. ``Butter,'' he said, and shuffled on.
   The restaurant was founded in 1928 by Tim and Joe Costello, Irish
immigrants of happy memory, who discovered shortly after stepping
off the boat that running a speak-easy was more profitable than
driving a truck.
   From the beginning the genial Irishmen attracted an assortment of
New Yorkers who appreciated a stalwart drink, an uncomplicated menu
and good cheer.
   Costello's walls are decorated with original works by America's
most noted cartoonists, beginning with James Thurber, and its roster
of regulars over the years included Ernest Hemingway, John
Steinbeck, A.J. Liebling, Charles Addams, Walt Kelly and legions of
uncelebrated working folk, always a most tolerant clientele.
   Herbie found a home there. That was 22 years ago, the longest he
has ever held a job. In all that time, few have learned his last
name. He is just Herbie.
   He won the title of World's Worst Waiter back in 1974, by popular
acclaim of awed customers who observed him at work and also learned
something of his past.
   No official document certifies the title, but in 15 years no
challenger has come forward and so the folks at Costello's figure it
is Herbie's by default. A clipping on the wall from a British
publication is documentation enough that the title is truly
international.
   You will hear no criticism of Herbie at Costello's. Instead, a
pastime among a group at the end of the bar is to make side bets on
whether Herbie gets the right order to the right customer, without
accident.
   ``Herbie's completion rate,'' says Tim Costello, the proprietor
and son of the founder, ``is about 75 percent.''
   ``I'm not as young as I used to be,'' Herbie replies. ``At my age
you're bound to make a few mistakes.''
   Herbie will be 83 on July 31. He was born in Ludwigshafen,
Germany, where the zeppelin made its appearance at about the same
time. In fact, Herbie and the zeppelin are of similar design, sort
of egg-shaped. Herbie, asleep or awake, stands 5-foot-6, a wizened
gnome with thin gray hair and hazel eyes.
   At 16, he took a job as cabin boy on a German merchant ship and
made his way to Argentina. In time he became second steward on the
presidential yacht docked in Buenos Aires, where his true greatness
was first noticed.
   Is the report accurate, he was asked, that he spilled a bowl of
soup on the Prince of Wales who had come aboard for a state dinner?
   ``No,'' says Herbie, ``It is not true. I spilled the soup on the
colonel sitting next to him. Only a little got on the prince.
   ``It was not my fault,'' Herbie hastens to add. ``The carpet
tripped me.''

   Jobless, Herbie wandered around Europe and in 1929 came to
America. Not a good year to find a job. Herbie joined the Army and
became a mess cook, as they are called, in Herbie's case perhaps
aptly.
   When the Depression wound down Herbie left the Army and resumed
the career that led to his deserved acclaim.
   He began as a dishwasher in New York and worked his way to the
bottom, building an impressive resume.
   ``I worked at the old Plaza Hotel, the Ambassador, the English
Grill, the Astor. Then I went to Florida and worked in the fancy
places at Miami Beach.
   ``I went to Chicago and worked at the Edgewater Beach Hotel. I
worked in West Virginia, at the Greenbrier. You know the
Greenbrier?''
   Were you a good waiter, Herbie?
   ``One of the best. You couldn't work at those places unless you
were one of the best.''
   Were you ever fired?
   ``Never. Never.''
   Why did you move around so much?
   ``When you are young, you must move. You must...adventure!''
   Did you ever have any noteworthy adventures at any of those
places?
   ``Are you asking did I spill a pot of coffee on that columnist
guy, Walter Winchell? Yes, I spilled the coffee.''
   The carpet's fault?
   ``The carpet's fault.''
   A few more stains on the linoleum _ happily, Costello's has no
carpet _ or on Herbie's pants and shirt sleeves for that matter, are
viewed here merely as badges of honest, if at times maladroit, labor.
   Indeed, Tim Costello and his partner, Pete Tully, consider Herbie
and his WWW title as an asset.
   It is a rare attitude in this bottom-line town where family-owned
restaurants with individual traditions and values have become almost
extinct.
   Since Prohibition's repeal in 1933, Costello's has had to move
three times to stay alive, but never farther than half a block. It
has been at its present spot at 225 East 44th since 1974. With each
move, its most cherished movable treasures went with it _ the bar,
the back bar, the Thurber drawings, Herbie.
   The bar is of cigarette-scarred oak rubbed to a warm patina by
three generations of elbows.
   Three generations of mementos decorate the back bar. Above an
array of bottles rises a clutter of photographs and testimonials,
and above these hang an assortment of gifts from grateful customers.
   They include a cavalry saber from the Spanish civil war; a ``TC''
branding iron from Stanley Walker, New York editor turned Texas
rancher, and the remains of a blackthorn walking stick that
Hemingway broke over the head of John O'Hara in 1944, not in anger
but on a bet.
   The story, from an eyewitness, is that O'Hara claimed blackthorn
was the only wood that couldn't be broken over an Irishman's head.
Hemingway bet he could break that very stick over the head of that
very Irishman.
   He padded O'Hara's head with napkins, laid the stick on the
napkins and took hold of each end. ``Brace yourself, John,'' he
said, and pulled down until the stick cracked.
   At Costello's, legends abound.
   Herbie, the World's Worst Waiter, is already one of them.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ America's love affair with the robot apparently
has gone sour. Orders for the mechanical marvels have been on the
decline in recent years after reaching a peak in 1984. One reason
is, robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant to
invest large amounts of money to develop smarter models.

<TEXT>
   Scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot
the wave of the future. It would free housewives of drudgery and
fill factories with a tireless steel-collar work force. But in many
ways, the wave has been a washout.
   Robots can paint cars, salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in
brain surgery, but they're still pretty dumb. And they are far from
the science fiction promise of comic books and movies.
   ``Robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago, but that
doesn't necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an R2-D2 or
C-3PO,'' says Raj Reddy, director of The Robotics Institute at
Carnegie Mellon University, referring to the robot characters in the
movie ``Star Wars.''
   Orders for American-made robots have been falling since their
peak of $501 million in 1984, according to the Robotics Industries
Association.
   Experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just
buying a robot and putting it on the assembly line. In addition,
they say, some industrial robots are too complicated and prone to
failure and, when they do work, they don't always fit in with
factory operations.
   About 33,000 robots work in the United States, mostly in
manufacturing, with automakers buying at least 40 percent, says
robots association spokesman Jeffrey A. Burnstein.
   ``It's not a revolution. It's an evolution,'' Burnstein says.
``Robots are another new, productive technology in the same way that
computers were.''
   Japan is the world's leading robot user, followed by the United
States, West Germany and France.
   ``Robots are still dumb,'' Reddy says. ``They're dumb because we
haven't taken the trouble to put the pieces together, not because we
don't know how. That takes money and time and effort, and we don't
have the money.''
   But today's robots can:
   _See. They don't see like humans, but they can recognize forms
and shapes and measure distances through sonar, ranging devices and
lasers.
   _Hear and speak. They use computers that recognize thousands of
words.
   _Smell. Their sensors can detect smoke or fumes.
   _Move. They most often roll on wheels, but some models hop on one
leg and others walk with as many as eight legs, ambling like a
spider on uneven terrain.
   _Touch. They can recognize texture and the force of a movement,
such as pressing.
   Many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree,
but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them has
been difficult.
   In addition, scientists have found it's difficult to match human
abilities that most people take for granted, such as the dexterity
of a finger or the ability to identify objects.
   ``The rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy, then
it's usually difficult,'' says Takeo Kanade, co-director of the
Carnegie Mellon institute. ``The list of things that robots can do
better than humans is much, much shorter than the list of things
robots cannot.''
   Industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision,
including welding, assembling, painting, packaging and loading, yet
Burnstein estimates that less than 5 percent of American companies
have installed even one robot.
   Japanese companies, which have installed more than twice as many
robots as American companies, have been more willing to invest in
robots that take years to pay for themselves, Burnstein says.
   ``Robots are very expensive to make and they can do very
little,'' says Hans Moravec, senior research scientist at Carnegie
Mellon. ``It's hard to find a job for them that actually pays off.''
   Moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect.
   ``The robots working on the assembly line today might well be
compared to spiders,'' he says. ``They do their jobs competently,
but it's a narrow job.''
   Industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing
goes wrong, forcing humans to their aid, says Donald Michie, chief
scientist of the Turing Institute of Glasgow, Scotland, which
conducts research into artificial intelligence.

   Michie is trying to develop computers that learn from experience
_ a technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing
circumstances and learn from mistakes.
   Moravec believes technology will enable robots to have human-like
intelligence in about 50 years.
   Service robots, a new breed, are moving off the factory floor to
handle work in hazardous environments, help the disabled, or just
sweep floors. Underwater robots are examining lake bottoms and doing
risky deep-sea work.
   Doctors at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, Calif., have
performed more than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm
that guides surgeons as they drill into the skull.
   Research is under way at Carnegie Mellon on a six-legged robot to
explore the surface of Mars in the next decade and on a car that can
drive itself. University researchers also made robots to remove
radioactive waste from the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant
near Harrisburg.
   K.G. Engelhardt, director of the university's health and human
services lab, is developing a robotic work station that allows the
disabled, especially those without the use of their hands, to work
in an office. The station should be marketed by the end of the year,
selling for less than $50,000, she says.
   Tish Pferdehirt, 44, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in
Pittsburgh, helps test the station. With paralyzed legs and only
limited use of her arms, she knows first-hand the benefits of such a
helpmate.
   ``It does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for
me, to turning off a radio, to picking up a file and putting it in
an in-out box,'' she says.
   The work station has an arm that turns, bends and swivels as Ms.
Pferdehirt speaks commands into a microphone. It fetches things,
looks up telephone numbers and dials the phone.
   Ms. Engelhardt hopes to make the robot work on projects
independently, such as shredding paper, when she is not there, thus
making it more valuable.
   Joseph F. Engelberger has big corporate backers for his service
robots.
   Projects in the works at Engelberger's Transitions Research Corp.
of Danbury, Conn., include development of robots that will sweep or
scrub floors in airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for
pharmacists in mail-order warehouses.
   Another Engelberger robot is Help-Mate, a nurse's aide that
delivers meals to hospital patients and makes other deliveries, such
as taking a urine specimen to a lab.
   Help-Mate, designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it
moves by itself on wheels, is being tested, and Engelberger said it
will go on sale for $40,000 by year's end.
   Engelberger hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream
robot: a $50,000 household helper that would prepare light meals,
clean house and clear snow. But he can't figure out how to teach it
to make beds.
   He estimates it would take up to $14 million and 2{ years to
develop, but American companies so far have been unwilling to make
the initial investment.
   Engelberger helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years
ago, but the history of the automaton goes back farther.
   ``The whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old,''
Moravec says. ``There were clockwork automatons built by Swiss and
French clocksmiths in the 18th century and 17th century.''
   The term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science fiction story
by Isaac Asimov from the word robot, which was coined in 1921 by
Czech playwright Karel Capek.
   In 1954, American inventor George Devol filed a patent for a
programmable robot arm whose movement was controlled by punched
program cards. In 1958, Devol and Engelberger formed a company to
build the machines.
   Their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a General
Motors Corp. plant.
   Engelberger says visions in the 1950s of a robot-filled world
fizzled when the promises outran technology.
   ``Everything was supposed to become automated,'' he says. ``It
was all blue sky, but the technology wasn't available. The
technology is just becoming available, but I have a difficult time
convincing people we can do it today.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For centuries they were the playgrounds of the
rich, but in recent years the lavish health spas of West Germany
have depended mainly on the aging and infirm who could take the
waters at government expense. Now the pendulum is swinging again and
guess who gave it a big push. Health-conscious yuppies, known among
Germans as ``Schickimickis,'' have discovered the spa scene.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   West Germany's most-famous
health spas, like this 19th century playground for the rich, royal
and renowned, are enjoying a renaissance among an emerging class of
European yuppies.
   ``Take a look _ and get looked at,'' is one of the advertising
slogans luring a hedonistic crowd into the spa social scene that for
the past 30 years has been dominated by the weak and aging.
   In a period of federal belt-tightening, the resorts that in the
postwar years have focused on government-sponsored health care are
now turning back to the healthy and wealthy who bestowed their
original fame.
   A modest trimming of social security benefits that took effect
with the new year promises to cut into the ranks of 8.4 million
``cure guests'' who take the waters each year in West Germany.
   But administrators of the most distinguished baths say they had
long been expecting fiscal conservatism to catch up with the cushy
health care system.
   Some, like Baden Baden, Bad Aachen and Wiesbaden, have begun
catering to a new generation of guests, a younger crowd of
well-heeled professionals known among Germans as ``Schickimickis.''
   Sequined and tuxedoed, the elite envoys of the 30-to-40 set
saunter and gamble in the path of Feodor Dostoevski and Kaiser
Wilhelm in Baden Baden's glittering casino. Dwindling in number are
the elderly and ailing bingo players in an adjacent parlor of the
Kurhaus.
   A sprawling seven-pool, glass-enclosed ``bathing temple''
completed three years ago draws 1,500 guests a day, increasingly
from among younger couples and singles who come here for long
weekends to play tennis, relax and flaunt their newfound prosperity.
   Hans Berg, manager of the German Bathing Association office in
Bonn, says the spas are attracting a broader group of guests and
becoming less dependent on the publicly insured clientele.
   Under the 1956 legislation that set up today's elaborate social
security net, West Germans are entitled to a spa treatment as often
as every three years if their doctors recommend it.
   Until this year, the federally funded health insurance network
paid the full cost of a three- or four-week bathing cure for those
recuperating from illness or taking a respite from the stresses of
work or family life.
   Cure clients must now pay 10 percent of the cost of their
treatments, which run an average of $2,750 for four weeks, plus most
of their hotel and food expenses.
   ``We don't know exactly what effect the changes in the law will
have on the industry, and we hope this isn't too strong a blow,''
Berg says. ``But we have been enjoying a steady growth over the past
year or two of younger visitors, and by younger I mean those in
their 30s who want to go away for a few days for a small vacation
rather than a cure.''
   Josef Bartholemy, Baden Baden's spa association general manager,
contends the cutbacks are shortsighted.
   ``Some of those who would benefit from rest and recuperation will
put off taking a cure because of the expense, then end up in the
hospital which will cost more for a few days than a preventative
cure,'' he says.
   But spa administrators expect that a trend among younger Germans
to take better care of their health promises to more than compensate
for an expected drop in visits by guests on social security.
   ``The changes in our clientele have had a positive economic
effect,'' says Sigrun Lang, chairwoman of Baden Baden's spa
association. ``While the guest here for a publicly funded cure is
often on a restricted budget during his four-week stay, those
staying for a three-day convention or a long weekend tend to spend a
lot in the shops and the casino.''
   A slender, 40-ish executive, Mrs. Lang says the more successful
spas are cashing in on the younger generation's growing absorption
with health and appearance.
   Despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, a new
affluence is visible among the younger, college-educated crowd in
major cities like Hamburg and Munich. And like their baby boom
contemporaries in the United States, West Germans in their 30s and
early 40s are gradually moving into the upper echelons of government
and industry.
   Foreign guests continue to account for more than a quarter of the
spa patronage, with wealthy Americans, Arabs, Japanese and Europeans
replacing the Russian nobility of the last century.
   Fewer turn to the mystic healing effects of water to cure serious
illnesses these days, but the younger generations frequenting the
spas are bringing along new health challenges for the resorts to
tackle.
   The opulent art deco complex at Bad Nauheim, for example, now
offers a program to break the smoking habit.
   Bad Mergentheim, nestled in a scenic valley of vineyards along
the famous Romantic Road, attracts a new clientele with its
weight-reduction course.
   Bad Aachen, at the three-nation crossroads with Belgium and
Holland where Charlemagne took the waters 1,200 years ago, now
offers stress-management clinics.
   Managers of smaller spas and the hotels and restaurants supported
by cure guests are nervous about the effects of the streamlining.
They point out that only a few dozen of the 264 officially
recognized health spas in West Germany are esteemed enough to get by
on the clientele that pays its own way.
   ``There is no other industry here except the spas,'' says Elke
Requeer, treatment director at the city cure house in Bad
Muenstereifel, a scenic hamlet in the foothills of the Eifel near
the border with Belgium. ``We don't get a lot of younger visitors
here because most of our patients are elderly and the atmosphere
must remain quiet.''
   School director Anita Meinhardt of Fulda, taking a cure at Baden
Baden this winter at her own expense, said the federal cutbacks are
unlikely to deter those strongly in need of rest and may encourage
more personal responsibility about one's health.
   Referring to her countrymen's propensity to drink and smoke more
than other Europeans, she contended that, ``One shouldn't expect the
government to provide an all-expense-paid cure for a lifetime of bad
living habits.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He trudged the frozen wilderness around the Great
Lakes in the middle of the 19th century, spreading the Christian
religion among the Indians. While establishing his missions, Bishop
Frederick Baraga also put the spoken tongues of the Ottawa and
Ojibwa Indians into written words. Some say he performed miracles
and for years have been urging the Roman Catholic Church to have him
canonized as a saint.

<DATELINE>L'ANSE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholars count the miracles and Pat and Myra
Ellico count the winters as Michigan's ``Snowshoe Priest'' travels a
long path toward possible sainthood.
   To many around here, Bishop Frederick Baraga, a Roman Catholic
missionary who spent a lifetime converting Indians to Christianity
in the 19th century, is a saint already. They believe canonization
of Baraga is inevitable.
   ``There isn't much doubt in our minds. We believe he is a
saint,'' says the Rev. Guy Thoren at the Sacred Heart Church in
L'Anse, where Baraga built his last mission.
   Thoren's mother was part of the first move to canonize Baraga
that began 37 years ago. Since then, the church has approved
Baraga's writings and has verified his sanctity. Now it must accept
the miracles.
   ``Either it will be very soon, or it will be an extremely long
process,'' says Regis Walling, who for five years has gathered
Baraga material and sent it to Rome. ``I have no doubt that it will
happen.''
   While Walling works for the Catholic diocese, Pat and Myra Ellico
keep the faith at the Baraga Shrine in L'Anse.
   The elderly couple sells trinkets to the tourists who stop at the
shrine to see a 35-foot brass and copper statue of the traveling
priest. When they can, they sit strangers down over hot tea and
cookies and tell them of their candidate for sainthood.
   Baraga was born in 1797, the son of wealthy landowners in
French-occupied Slovenia, now a part of Yugoslavia. The young priest
left a fractured church in his homeland in 1830 to establish
missions among the Ojibwa and Ottawa Indians in the Northwest
Territory.
   He spent 23 years among Indians and settlers on Lakes Michigan
and Superior, traveling hundreds of miles by canoe, snowshoe and
even ice floe, spreading the Gospel and putting the Ottawa and
Ojibwa tongue into written words.
   Baraga used the Indians as guides. He also relied on them as
rescuers, for sometimes he was found to be wandering in circles in
the winter wilderness.
   His feats are legendary to the people of the northern woods,
where a county, town and state park are named after him.
   The Yugoslavian people also remain keenly aware of their native
son. They send representatives to Marquette each year for ceremonies
remembering him.
   But Baraga sometimes encountered hostility among the Native
Americans he worked with. Their reaction, then and now, has been
mixed.
   ``There are those who realize the Chippewa (Ojibwa) would have
moved West or simply disappeared if it hadn't been for him,''
Walling says. ``He helped save them by giving them a written
language.
   ``Then, there are some who feel all white men, missionaries
included, led to the destruction of the Indian nation. Actually, I
think the real cause was alcohol.''
   ``I guess there is mixed feeling,'' says the Rev. John Hascall, a
Catholic priest who is also an Ojibwa pipe carrier (religious man)
and president of the National Takakwitha Council based in Montana.
   Missionaries came close to robbing the Ojibwa and other Indians
of their native beliefs in God, or Kije Manito, the Great Spirit,
Hascall says.
   ``Baraga did not understand that,'' he adds. ``He thought he was
converting pagans.

   ``I'm not demeaning Father Baraga. Anybody bringing Christ would
enrich us. His every effort was to build us up, which he really did
accidentally by preserving our language. He was a man who was
sincere, which made him in the Indian way a holy man.''
   Donald LaPointe, a 58-year-old Ojibwa, grew up with the Baraga
legend, handed down from his father and grandfather.
   ``They held him in reverence,'' he says. ``One of my earliest
memories was seeing a picture of him.''
   Baraga built homes and schools for the Ojibwa and purchased 500
acres of land for the tribe, LaPointe says. Just recently the
Keweenaw Bay Tribe obtained the deed for the land from the Marquette
diocese.
   Today, Baraga's outpost at L'Anse is surrounded by an Ojibwa
reservation where children read their history in the language Baraga
penned.
   Summers at the shrine are crowded with tourists, but winter
leaves the Ellicos alone with a friendly Doberman pinscher named
Hans and the silent Baraga statue, shrouded in snow.
   Schoolchildren come out now and then to burn candles by the
shrine. A state plaque nearby marks an ancient Indian trail that
heads south to Wisconsin. At least one missionary is believed to
have died on the frozen path.
   This is the time of year the Ellicos, who have tended the shrine
for 14 years, notice the increasing cold and dream of retiring and
moving south.
   Pat and his brother once envisioned a tourist motel and
restaurant on the bluff overlooking Keweenaw Bay, but his brother
died and the Bishop Baraga Foundation asked if he would donate land
for the shrine. Pat Ellico agreed.
   Artist Jack Anderson's robed priest stands high on a giant
metallic cloud, atop copper arches that end in five tepees, one for
each of the Indian missions Baraga founded.
   To Walling, Baraga's own life was the greatest show of divine
intervention.
   ``That he survived under the conditions he lived _ that was more
a miracle than anything else,'' she says. ``He traveled from L'Anse
to Duluth, Minn., on snowshoes. His eyes froze shut and he survived
with no harm.''
   Walling has given Rome other evidence, though. From there, a
Franciscan priest, Father Bruno Korosak, sends them on to the Sacred
Congregation of Saints.
   ``There are over 110 very strong cases of miracles or
intercessions,'' Walling says.
   One involved Baraga County Clerk Bernard Lambert, who led the
effort in the early 1970s to build the Baraga shrine, Thoren says.
Lambert, who was crippled with arthritis at 28, died last year.
   ``He was totally invalid and then he walked,'' Thoren says. ``I
believe the statue was done in 1971 in thanksgiving.''
   The Catholic community has not waited for Rome to begin sending
prayers to Baraga. The faithful carefully pass among themselves
relics of his existence: thread from his woolen socks and splinters
of wood from his burial casket.
   A Hubbell woman's cancer completely vanished after she prayed to
Baraga with thread from his socks in her hands, Walling says.
   ``My mother had a thread,'' Thoren says. ``When my brother became
a sky diver, she gave it to him. Then he gave it to a friend who was
dying of cancer.''
   The cancer victim died, but the thread was preserved, a precious
token.
   If the miracles are accepted, Baraga's writings must be presented
in a document that explains the context of his work, a process
Walling says is two-thirds complete. Then the real journey begins,
as the Vatican considers Baraga first for veneration, beatification
and finally canonization.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's one of 3,000 to 4,000 tiny publishing houses
across the country, mom and pop operations that are looking for
quality, not quantity, and not expecting to make a lot of money. And
at the Holy Cow! Press, Jim Perlman is bullish on imagination,
controversy and minorities.

   Holy cow! A one-man publishing house milking
the Midwest for poetry and prose and not pulling for a best-seller?
   Yep, and they call it just that: Holy Cow! Press.
   Ask the boss, Jim Perlman, the owner, publicity agent, production
department, accountant and lone editor.
   ``If I really wanted to make a lot of money I'd publish
cookbooks, self-help, or a lot of childrens books,'' he says.
   Instead, Perlman focuses on the literary works of a select group
of writers who explore controversial issues and experiment with
ideas. He settled on Holy Cow! as a moniker for its shock value and
because it reflects the Midwestern roots of his writers, most of
whom are women or non-white.
   ``I like risk-taking,'' says Perlman, who works out of his rented
home. ``I still think that poetry is where important new
ground-breaking philosophies are going to come out.''
   The Minneapolis native founded the press in 1977 between stints
as a student at the University of Arizona and the University of
Iowa. In August he moved the business to Duluth, where his wife,
Deborah Petersen-Perlman, works as a communications professor at the
University of Minnesota-Duluth. The couple have three children under
the age of 6.
   ``He's terrific,'' says Rachel Tilsen of Hudson, Wis., a member
of Midwest Villages and Voices, a competing small press based in
Minneapolis. ``He's very respectful of the writer and he has a very
creative image of the finished book and a wonderful knowledge of
language. He puts it together.''
   Tilsen's mother, 88-year-old Meridel Le Seuer, is one of the
poets and storytellers in whom Perlman has taken an interest.
Perlman delights in her activist background, including her being
blacklisted by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare.
   ``I really don't want a best-seller,'' Perlman says. ``It would
take up a lot of time and I just don't want to be famous for one
book. I really want to do work with high literary standards.''
   Perlman pores over 30 to 40 manuscripts a month but packages only
six to eight books a year. To avoid the foreclosure that would be
certain if Holy Cow! published only poetry, Perlman says he is
beginning to dabble in quality childrens books.
   Reprints of Le Seuer's ``Sparrow Hawk,'' a historical tale about
a young American Indian, and ``The Story of Johnny Appleseed'' are
already on the market. Perlman plans to reprint other Le Seuer books
about Davy Crockett, Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln's mother.
   Dan Odegard, owner of Odegard Books in Minneapolis, says Holy
Cow! is one of about a dozen independent presses in Minnesota that
publish books rich in literary value.
   ``They fulfill a market that wouldn't be filled by large
publishers,'' Odegard says.
   Reviews are important to Perlman because he rarely sees monetary
rewards. He says Lewis Hyde once wrote in The Nation magazine that
Holy Cow! was one of the best small presses in the United States.
That's no small accomplishment considering the country supports
between 3,000 and 4,000 independent publishers, the majority of
which are run by one or two people.
   ``A good review, to me, says it has some value, even if it
doesn't sell,'' Perlman says.
   Perlman, who welcomes suggestions from his authors about the
design of their books, says his most disappointing experience came
when he endured an abrasive, pompous writer only to have the book
fail commercially and critically. He declined to be specific.
   ``You just don't know how it's going to be received,'' Perlman
says. ``Sometimes a book just lies there acting like it's dead.''
   Other times it flies. Brother Songs, a poetry anthology written
by men about father-son, brother-brother and other male
relationships, has sold 6,000 copies since its first printing in
1979 to become Holy Cow!'s most successful title.
   Perlman says the book is, ``One of my answers to the feminist
concerns from a male point of view.''
   Other Holy Cow! books in print or nearing publication are ``Star
Quilt,'' a book of poems by Roberta Hill Whiteman, an American
Indian studying at the University of Minnesota; ``Fun and Games,'' a
collection of short fiction by black writer Clarence Major, and
``The Invisible Musician,'' poems by Ray A. Young Bear, a resident
of the Mesquakie tribal settlement near Tama, Iowa.
   ``I found the most passion in the work of minorities,'' Perlman
says. ``I don't think that many white writers can see from the top
side what's going on in the culture.''
   So what makes Brother Songs and other poetry by Holy Cow! good?
   Perlman says he's bullish on imagination and clarity. Subject
matter is a close second.
   And when it's all wrapped in a binding, it better be as wholesome
as fresh milk when it comes to spelling and grammar.
   ``That's real important to me,'' Perlman says. ``Most of my
creative talent goes into editing.''
   If a Holy Cow! book sells for $10 at bookstores, Perlman is
likely to receive about $4.50 from each sale. From that he must draw
his salary, pay for production and publicity and dish out royalty
fees to the authors, who are paid cash advances in some cases.
   He's usually satisfied if a poetry book sells 1,500 copies and a
book of prose 3,000 to 4,000 copies, but there are no guarantees.
   Because he sinks what little profit there is into the production
of more books, Perlman says he is seeking non-profit status from the
Internal Revenue Service. As a non-profit enterprise, Holy Cow!
would be in a better position to seek grants from tax-exempt
philanthropic organizations and give Perlman enough cash to hire a
staffer and increase his volume to about 10 books a year.
   ``I'm not a capitalist pig,'' Perlman says. ``But I hope within
the next year or two I can make a regular working wage.''

   Brian Dennehy is at a point in his acting
career where he no longer needs to do television, yet unlike many
film stars he refuses to turn his back on the small screen.
   His latest TV appearance comes Sunday in ``Day One,'' a
prestigious drama on CBS about development of the atomic bomb. He's
completing the feature film ``Street Legal,'' then he's off to
Moscow and Tokyo for stage appearances as Lopakhin in ``The Cherry
Orchard.''
   ``Most of television today is just a diversion,'' Dennehy says.
``I'm at a point where I'm not expected to do TV. My response is
that if decent, like-minded artists don't do TV we can't complain.
We have a social responsibility.''
   Dennehy says `Day One' is a balanced look at the decision to
build and drop the atomic bomb.
   ``It's an attempt to understand the enormous accomplishment in
building that weapon in 2{ years without computers,'' he says. ``And
it looks at the politics of deciding to use it. The Cold War may
become a historical artifact so it's important that we understand
how it started.''
   Dennehy stars as Gen. Leslie R. Groves, the man who built the
Pentagon and was the ramrod behind the super-secret Manhattan
Project. David W. Rintels produced the three-hour drama and wrote
the screenplay based on Peter Wyden's book.
   The movie also stars David Strathairn as Dr. J. Robert
Oppenheimer and Michael Tucker as Leo Szilard, with appearances by
Hume Cronyn as James F. Byrnes, Hal Holbrook as Gen. George C.
Marshall, Richard Dysart as President Harry S Truman, David Ogden
Steirs as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barnard Hughes as
Harry L. Stimson.
   Dennehy on this day is at a hilltop park in Culver City preparing
for a night's work on ``Street Legal.'' He'll soon be up to his
knickers in muck as a maverick police lieutenant who stumbles upon
an international political conspiracy. It's his first solo starring
role in a feature film.
   ``I'm sweating out finishing this picture so I can get to Moscow
for rehearsals,'' he says. ``I'm probably the only guy who plays
cops, jumps on a plane to rush to Moscow to show the Russians how to
play Chekhov with a British director.''
   Dennehy grew up in Brooklyn, where he was an all-city high school
football tackle and played the title role in a senior class
production of ``Macbeth.'' He got a degree in history at Columbia
University, then spent five years in the Marine Corps, including
eight months in Vietnam. Afterward, he worked at a variety of jobs
while honing his skills in off-off-Broadway plays.
   He made his film debut in ``Semi-Tough'' in 1977, followed with
roles in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' ``Foul Play,'' ``F.I.S.T.,''
``Butch and Sundance: The Early Years'' and ``10.'' Among his later
roles: ``Gorky Park,'' ``Best Seller,'' ``Silverado,'' ``Legal
Eagles,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``F-X.''
   Dennehy, who has three daughters from an earlier marriage,
recently married Jennifer Arnott, an Australian costumer designer he
met while doing ``Return To Snowy River.'' One daughter, Elizabeth,
is in the CBS soap opera ``The Guiding Light.'' She bears a striking
resemblance to Glenn Close, and since ``Fatal Attraction'' she has
had some difficulty being cast in commercials.
   Another daughter, Kathleen, is also an actress and has a small
role in ``Street Legal.'' His third daughter, Deidre, attends
medical school in Chicago.
   Dennehy starred in two TV series, ``Big Shamus, Little Shamus''
and ``Star in the Family.'' He was in the miniseries ``Pearl'' and
his most recent TV appearance was as a bounty hunter on an episode
of ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' under consideration as a spinoff series.
   ``I'm at the point where I can do what I want,'' he says. ``I
want to do good things. The tragedy of television is that there's so
little that is good. But the networks are in trouble and they're
turning back to creative people.''
   Back on the subject of his character in ``Day One,'' Dennehy
says, ``Groves is a fascinating guy. He believed in his country, he
believed in accomplishments, he believed in the work ethic. He
wasn't a very sophisticated man. He was the one man with the
extraordinary mind, intellect, discipline, leadership and ambition
to accomplish the task of building the bomb.
   ``People now tend to look at Oppenheimer as a Hamlet, who was
never certain about the bomb. Once the deed was done and the bomb
was dropped, Oppenheimer was a man who could not help but examine
what he did and feel a terrible guilt. Groves, on the other hand,
never doubted that it was necessary to save American lives.''

   Backstage at the American Conservatory
Theater, August Wilson takes a pull on a cigarette and ponders the
differences between regional theater and Broadway.
   ``One is about the work, and the other is about money,'' says the
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. ``Broadway and Broadway producers
could care less about the work, about the content of the work.''
   ``Their concern is `How are we going to get people into the
theater to see whatever it is?' It could be the worst thing
imaginable...That's the way the producers think.''
   He allows that there are some ``happy coincidences'' when quality
and profit overlap.
   Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``Fences'' enjoyed a
successful Broadway run and won a New York Drama Critics Circle
Award and a Tony.
   He won another Critics Circle award for ``Ma Rainey's Black
Bottom,'' which ran for six months but didn't make a profit. A third
Broadway show, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' closed at a loss
after a brief run.
   Those three plays are part of a cycle of 10 works Wilson is
writing about the black experience during each decade of the 20th
century. It was ACT's production of ``Joe Turner'' that brought
Wilson to San Francisco, and he liked what he saw in a cast led by
Roscoe Lee Browne.
   Wilson is in the enviable position of having many offers from
many quarters.
   He has just completed the first draft of his play about the
1960s, tentatively titled ``Two Trains Running,'' and is working on
the screenplay for ``Fences.'' He also has plans for some short
stories, a mystery novel, more poetry and a performance piece called
``Seven Guitars'' that he says will diverge from his more
traditionally structured plays.
   All this work flows from a man who grew up on the poor side of
town, dropped out of school in ninth grade, worked at odd jobs and
got started as a writer by jotting down lines in restaurants and
bars.
   But it is that background that makes Wilson what he is: a keen
observer of the sweat, grit, pain and injustice that marks life in
America's underclass.
   Although his father ``had a presence in the household,'' Wilson
was raised by his mother in Pittsburgh's Hill District, a melting
pot of Jews and Syrians, blacks and whites where he shared two rooms
with three sisters and two brothers.
   His first poems were written anonymously in the seventh grade to
a pretty classmate named Nancy Ireland.
   ``I would write these poems and leave them on her desk,'' he
says. That lasted until Nancy took up with a boy named Anthony. ``I
always figured that she thought Anthony was the one writing the
poems.''
   Nancy's loss was the world's gain as Wilson continued to write
poetry. Some were published in anthologies, and the author found he
``could always pick up a few dollars reading some poems here and
there.''
   But mostly he worked odd jobs. Terrible jobs. For some terrible
bosses.
   ``One time I was an elevator. I was not an elevator operator. I
was the elevator. A men's clothing store was on the third floor and
my job consisted of running from the first floor to the third floor
when anyone came in (to pick something up). They had three tailors
up there, so they stayed pretty busy.
   ``I didn't mind because I would read until someone came in.''
   In 1968, as black Americans were debating the character of their
culture and looking for ways to change their role in society, Wilson
felt a need to contribute as an artist and, with a friend, founded
the Black Horizon Theater. He knew nothing of theater at the time.
``So the first thing I did was to go to the library and find a book
on how to direct a play.
   ``Since we had a theater, I ran right home and said `Let me write
a play.' Well, I sat down and wrote a play and the characters did
not talk. And I said, `Well, this playwriting business is not for
me.'''
   He wrote a few one-act plays, then went back to poetry.
   To this day, he says he's familiar with only one play by
Shakespeare and one by Chekhov. He has never seen a play by Henrik
Ibsen, David Mamet or Sam Shepard. ``I've never read `Raisin In The
Sun,' either. I saw the movie.''
   The foundation of Wilson's writing, he says, is the blues.
   ``The reason I'm able to do what I do is because all the ideas
and characters come out of the blues. I listen to the music, which I
see as a cultural response of an entire people to the world that
they find themselves in.''
   In 1978, Wilson moved to St. Paul, Minn., and got a job writing
scripts for its science museum. An actress from the museum invited
him to see a play, and Wilson came away thinking he could do it
better. That gave birth to ``Jitneys,'' a play about gypsy cab
drivers in Pittsburgh.
   ``That was the first realistic play I wrote.''
   It was also the start of Wilson's 20th century cycle.
   ``Jitneys'' was set in 1971. ``Fullerton Street,'' set in 1941,
followed ``because I wanted to write about the clash of the rural
South and the urban North.''
   ``After that, I wrote `Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' which was set
in 1927. And I felt, why don't I just continue to do this. And then
`Fences' was the '50s.''
   ``Joe Turner'' was set in 1911. ``Piano Lesson'' takes place in
1936.
   His intent in ``Two Trains Running,'' which takes place in the
1960s, is to show the relationship of blacks to the rest of American
society.
   ``Once I had that as my focus, I discovered the relationship was
not very much unlike that of a slave community back during slavery.
Although there is freedom and the Emancipation Proclamation, a lot
of the relationships still exist. And so I thought I could show that
relationship and the real problem.
   ``The real problem in America is the labor problem. That's why
blacks were brought to America from Africa, as a labor system. Which
is ironic. At one time, all blacks were working. And now nobody's
working.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once banned by the Russian czars, the balalaika
is the most beloved musical instrument in the Soviet Union. Now a
Soviet orchestra on a tour of 40 U.S. cities is introducing
Americans to the sound produced by an instrument which is something
like a guitar, but with some big differences.

   There may be some Scots who can't bear the
bagpipe, but it's a rare Russian who bad-mouths the balalaika.
   ``The balalaika is the instrument most close to the Russian
soul,'' says Sergei Lukin, one of the 82 members of the Osipov
Balalaika Orchestra, which is on a tour of 40 American cities
through March 9. ``It is very tender, very touching. It starts
singing in the hands of a real master.''
   What's a balalaika? Well, it's a stringed instrument somewhat
like a guiter, but is triangular shaped, usually has only three
strings, and comes in a variety of sizes.
   Americans may remember the sound from ``Lara's Theme,'' on the
sound track of the film ``Dr. Zhivago.''
   Lukin plays the domra, which looks like a round-bodied banjo, its
flat front the size of a dinner plate. Many balalaikas sound best,
apparently, mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra.
   Lukin and other members of the Osipov, the Soviet Union's top
balalaika orchestra, were interviewed through an interpreter.
   ``We're doing all kinds of songs _ sad and merry. They all depict
the state of a soul,'' says Nikolai Kalinin, the orchestra's
conductor and artistic director.
   ``There are really rhythmic, energetic songs. You want to dance
when you hear them,'' adds singer Nadja Babkina, founder of the
Babkina Folk Ensemble, which is on tour with the orchestra.
   Miss Babkina, who wears her long hair dramatically forward over
one shoulder, says that in the 16th century, balalaika players were
dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were
thought to be diverting people's attention from the church.
   ``That's why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups
of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also,''
she says. ``Russian people tried to hide these instruments. In the
18th century someone said it was time to renew them.''
   ``Why don't you ask how to play it?'' asks Alexander Gorbachev,
41, holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man
named Nalimov, the Stradivarius of balalaika makers.
   Then he demonstrates, drawing his right index finger across the
strings like a violin bow.
   ``It is such a strong finger, he can even open a bottle,'' says
Sergei Butushin, who plays an array of horns that he has made, some
with bells made of cows' horns.
   ``I go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their
horns,'' Butushin says. ``We have several such places in Moscow.''
   The balalaika, used mainly for playing folk music, is more
popular in rural areas, but it is not unknown in the cities.
   Vladimir Byeloblotsky, 38, playing some jazz riffs on his bass
balalaika, says he was born in Moscow and heard the balalaika as a
child.
   ``I started playing contrabass, like in the symphony orchestra,''
he says. ``Then I was very fond of jazz and I played in a jazz
orchestra which went away from the Soviet Union and now is in the
United States. Now I'm playing this bass balalaika and I'm really
very happy. I think that is the thing I wanted to do.''
   Gorbachev, who plays ``prima balalaika,'' the main one of the
five sizes of balalaikas in the Osipov orchestra, started on the
accordion, like his father.
   ``I joined music school when I was 15 years old,'' Gorbachev
says. ``I heard balalaika and I liked very much the sound and I
started seriously studying this instrument. I was born in Moscow but
my relatives came from villages.''
   Conductor Kalinin explains that orchestra members and aspiring
members alike must audition each year. Seniority doesn't count. ``If
somebody proves not so good, he retires,'' he says.
   Accordion player Igor Konovalov says, ``I was born in 1941, when
the Germans were very close to Moscow in the Second World War. My
mother went to a village and I was born with an accordion in my
hands. At that time, in villages, it was the most popular
instrument. At night, people came out of their homes and sat on
benches and started playing.
   ``I started playing the gormoyan, which is a purely Russian
accordion, when I was 12.''
   Kalinin, 45, the orchestra conductor for 10 years, was once a
professional singer. His wife plays domra in the orchestra. The
youngest of their three children, now 5, waved his hands like a
conductor _ ``by a kind of inheritance,'' his father says _ before
he could talk.
   Butushin, whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier
balalaika playing, has been in the orchestra for 20 years, since he
was 15, and has been on all its American tours _ in 1969, '71 and
'77.
   Lukin, 31, started out playing the cello as a boy in music school.
   ``I was so small and the cello was so big and heavy, I thought it
was better if I played this domra,'' he says. ``Since then I deeply
love this instrument.''
   ``This domra player is the best in the Soviet Union,'' Kalinin
says. ``He's concert master in the orchestra. He treats his domra
like a beloved woman.''
   Lukin's wife also plays domra in the Osipov orchestra and in the
American concerts they play a duet, which they encore with a Scott
Joplin rag.
   The Osipov Balalaika Orchestra is the Soviet Union's biggest and
best, conductor Kalinin says.
   ``It was founded by Vassily Andreyev in 1919, consisting of eight
players.'' Kalinin says. ``He dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo.''
   Conductor Nikolai Petrovich Osipov later added other instruments
and commissioned composers. After his death in 1946, the orchestra
was named for him.
   The sound caught on outside the Soviet Union, Kalinin adds.
``After Andreyev led a tour, balalaika orchestras were formed in
countries all over the world.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Lean on Me''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Joe Clark, the principal of Eastside High School in Paterson,
N.J., decided that a baseball bat was as good an educational tool as
books. His controversial tactics are the focus of the new Warner
Bros. film ``Lean on Me.'' The movie is reviewed this week by
education writer Lee Mitgang, who has covered the Clark controversy,
and film critic Bob Thomas, in side-by-side reviews.

   Anyone who has ever met Joe Clark, the principal of Eastside High
School in Paterson, N.J., knows that he would never allow a film
crew into his school unless for the greater glory of Joe Clark.
   This is, after all, the same Joe Clark who in 1987 virtually
barred a state monitoring team from inspecting his building.
   So it's hardly a surprise that ``Lean on Me,'' a new Warner Bros.
film shot on location at Eastside and purporting to be based on the
``true story'' of the tough principal, turns out to be little more
than blackboard jungle propaganda aimed at vindicating Clark's
bat-and-bullhorn educational methods.
   Warner Bros. has sunk a long way since last April when it made
its commendable foray into the school world with the vastly superior
``Stand and Deliver,'' a film with twice the plot and a hundred
times more character development than this latest. ``Stand and
Deliver'' was about a high school math teacher in a Los Angeles
barrio school who proved that inner city kids respond to the same
kinds of positive things that rich kids do: adults who really care.
   Clark, by contrast, captured headlines in recent years as the
principal who restored order to an inner-city school described by
local prosecutors as a ``cauldron of violence.''
   In the seven years Clark has run Eastside, he has indeed tamed
this once graffiti-scarred school.
   His methods shocked some, but pleased many others, including
then-U.S. Secretary William J. Bennett whose frequent praise helped
make Clark a national celebrity. He prowled the hallways with a
baseball bat and bullhorn, suspended hundreds of students, and made
it clear to all that the sign in his office, ``One Way: My way'' _
applied to teachers and students alike.
   ``Lean on Me'' paints Clark as a principal who bleeds for his
kids, but will stop at nothing, including breaking labor and fire
laws, cursing out his superiors, and humiliating teachers, to
achieve his aims.
   Clark won headlines as a black educator who blamed his school's
problems on a failed social welfare system.
   Hardly have the opening credits finished rolling before the film
has made sure no one has missed any of these points.
   It opens with a brief shot of Eastside High in more idyllic days.
In 1967, the school was mostly white; boys wore ties. Clark, then a
young teacher, wore a dashiki.
   Twenty years later, we see a very different Eastside, with
graffiti covering anything standing still long enough to be
spray-painted, girls openly molested, drugs freely dispensed, fights
commonplace.
   Into the breach steps Clark. His challenge: brush aside the
small-minded politicians and school board, restore order, and raise
standardized test scores quickly enough to avoid a state takeover of
the school.
   Hey, no sweat.
   Morgan Freeman turns in a credible performance as Clark,
capturing nicely Clark's self-righteousness. The script by Michael
Schiffer doesn't leave much room for character development, but that
wasn't the point of this film, anyway. Clark himself had this to say
of Freeman as filming proceeded last June: ``He's a good actor but I
don't think anybody can fully portray me. There's only one Joe
Clark.''
   How true.

   If any critics' organization offered an award for The Most
Manipulative Director, the Lifetime Achievement Award would surely
go to John G. Avildsen. Consider his ability to rouse audiences to
anger, revulsion and especially, the overwhelming joy of victory
over impossible odds in such films as ``Joe,'' ``Save the Tiger,''
``Rocky,'' ``Neighbors'' and ``The Karate Kid.''
   The new Warner Bros. release, ``Lean on Me,'' is quintessential
Avildsen. From the very first frame, he grabs the viewers and plays
their emotions with the skill of a disc jockey at a disco turntable.
You cheer and weep tears of joy despite the realization that you are
being shamelessly used.
   The film is based on the headline-making career of Joe Clark, the
black educator who turned the Paterson, N.J., Eastside High School
from a ghetto jungle into a model of achievement, wielding a
symbolic baseball bat. Michael Schiffer's script obviously takes
liberties with the facts, since it is orchestrated in a series of
audience-stirring sequences.
   Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) is a zealous teacher whose fierce
temper and outspokenness has relegated him to being principal of a
white grammar school. When Eastside High is threatened with a
takeover by the state because of a dismal academic record, the mayor
(Alan North) and school superintendent (Robert Guillaume)
reluctantly enlist Clark as Eastside principal.
   Clark begins by ousting all the drug dealers and goof-offs,
painting over the graffiti, and haranguing both students and
teachers. He goes overboard, alienating his staff and making an
enemy of a power-hungry activist (Lynne Thigpen). Clark is jailed
for locking the school doors (to keep out drug dealers), but you can
guess who triumphs in the end.
   Schiffer, who also wrote the slambang ``Colors,'' has provided a
messy screenplay, overloaded with shouted speeches and offering an
improbably sentimental climax that would make Frank Capra seem like
Chekhov. But for those willing to leave cynicism at home, ``Lean on
Me'' can be a moving experience, thanks in large part to Morgan
Freeman's powerful presence. He is a marvel of raw energy commanding
force.
   Beverly Tyler has the relatively thankless role of Clark's
long-suffering assistant but she performs admirably. The students
are uniformly great.
   Norman Twain produced the film which is rated PG-13, mostly for
language and violent action. Refreshingly, the film makes little use
of expletives, which might have abounded in such a film. Running
time: 104 minutes.

   ``Poltergeist III'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. PG-13)
   
   ``Poltergeist III'' should have had all the flaws of its
predecessors _ cubed _ in the negative exponential fashion of
Hollywood sequels. It doesn't. It's excellent. (Sadly, it was the
last film for child star Heather O'Rourke, who died during surgery
after the movie's theatrical release.)
   In this episode, the spirit world's demonic preacher Kane (Nathan
Davis) is again determined to get Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) to
guide him ``into the light'' on the Other Side again. No problem;
you wouldn't have it any other way.
   Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), the chubby little medium from ``I''
and ``II'' returns to help Carol Anne, along with the doughty Tom
Skerritt and Nancy Allen, who play Carol Anne's devoted uncle and
aunt.
   Skerritt is the manager of a sleek, mirrored high-rise building,
the all-too familiar ``complex of shops, offices and apartments.''
So ... what if ... the evil spirit moves into the building? Why,
it's ... an Eighties nightmare!!! The building becomes a stunning,
surreal maze of endless-seeming stairwells, filled with mirrored
walls with spectral images, with crazy elevators that go crazy and
demonic cars in a frozen parking garage.
   Note that all the special effects were shot on-camera. Some of
them are ingenious and utterly simple _ and awfully scary.
   Director Gary Sherman couldn't get all the originals' stars and
couldn't afford the costly opticals and other lab effects, so he and
co-writer Brian Taggert went after something different and succeeded
brilliantly. Aces.

   ``A Fish Called Wanda'' (CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   One of the biggest box-office surprises of the season was ``A
Fish Called Wanda,'' a juicy jewel heist romp starring John Clease
(who also wrote the screenplay) and Michael Palin of ``Monty
Python'' fame, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis.
   ``Wanda'' is the type of comedy we long to see but only get once
every decade. It's wacky, sophisticated, obvious, raunchy,
irreverent, delicious and a laugh a minute.
   George (Tom Georgeson), Otto (Kline), Wanda (Curtis) and Ken
(Palin) pull a diamond heist and immediately set to double-triple
cross each other. Wanda and Otto set up George and get him arrested
for the crime. But before the cops take him off in cuffs, he hides
the key to the safety deposit box in which the gems are hidden in
Ken's fish food. Ken finds the key and hides it in the treasure box
in his beloved fish tank where his prize fish is an angel also named
Wanda. Stay tuned for a tragic scene later in the movie featuring
little Wanda.
   The only witness who can place George near the scene of the crime
is a little old lady who owns three tiny dogs. Ken decides to kill
her so she won't be able to testify. He misses three times. Go
figure. But the bit, as cruel and crazy as it is, is also one of the
funniest running gags on film.
   Cleese is George's defense counsel, Archie Leech. (Another gag
for film buffs.) Wanda decides to seduce Archie in order to learn
where George has hidden the loot. Only problem, she falls in love
with him.
   Otto, her true love, a maniacal former CIA operative who will
just about kill anyone who calls him ``stupid,'' keeps close watch
on Wanda and Archie _ like in putting stethoscopes to windows while
they attempt to make love inside.
   Kline is brilliant as Otto, who fancies himself an intellectual
because he reads Nietzsche. (But, as Wanda tells him, calling him
stupid is an insult to stupid people.) He prances, storms, postures
and leaps in and out of the type of character Cleese made
institutional as Basil Fawlty in ``Fawlty Towers.''
   Palin, as the animal-loving stutterer Ken, is a delight. Cleese
plays it pretty straight this time, but gets big laughs for his
Russian striptease and for the scene in which his wife comes home
just a little too early while Wanda is there.
   Curtis, however, is the weak link in an otherwise sprightly
flick. She has no timing for comedy. She's fortunate, though, in
having a superb cast to keep her afloat.
   Don't rent ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Buy it. This is a video to
see again, and again and again.

   ``Honky Tonk Angel'' (MCA) _ Patty Loveless
   
   Patty Loveless' crystal clear voice lends a subtle, rather than
overpowering, quality to her music. So ``Honky Tonk Angel,'' her
third album, doesn't score an immediate knockout.
   But it's an enjoyable, if not spectacular, record that sounds
better with repeated listening.
   Loveless works in the same musical territory as such hip country
traditionalists as Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell and Rosanne Cash.
She's at her best, however, with the pop-leaning ballads ``If You
Think'' and ``I'm on Your Side.''
   Also worth hearing is her rendition of the great ``Don't Toss Us
Away.'' Her version, with backround vocals by Crowell, is more
understated than the Lone Justice original but no less powerful as
Loveless makes a plea for keeping a romance alive even as all around
``it seems like everyone we've known, their love's grown cold.''
   Loveless' band, featuring fiddler Mark O'Connor and the always
impressive Albert Lee on guitar, is solid throughout on an album
that _ sort of like a good concert opening act _ gives the sense of
hearing an artist who may have something great in her future.

   Symphonies No. 24, 26, 27 and 30 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart;
Prague Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras (Telarc)
   
   For listeners not enchanted with performances on original
instruments but who want fresh-sounding, more authentic versions of
pre-20th century works, there is a middle course. Sir Charles
Mackerras and the Prague Chamber Orchestra take it in this Telarc
recording of four middle symphonies by the 17-year-old Mozart.
   The orchestra is scaled back, a harpsichord added and the style
of playing is that of original instrument recordings, though the
instruments are modern. The strings make more biting attacks and
lean into the beginning of notes, and the flutes and oboes leave out
vibrato. The sound is brisk and lean and full of life, and the
musicians play with a controlled exuberance.
   There is a little too much echo to the sound, a result probably
of the recording site, the Castle of Dobris in Prague. Mackerras
sometimes lets things move along a little too briskly, though there
are loving moments, especially in the masterful slow movement of No.
27, perhaps the best part of the disc. The main theme is a
descending string passage capped by plucked notes in the cello,
which become their own counter theme in the next section.
   As William Malloch's fine linear notes point out, these
symphonies are numbered out of chronological order: Nos. 26 and 27
were written before Mozart's July-September 1773 visit to Vienna,
and Nos. 24 and 30 after. Oddly, No. 24 sounds the earliest, with
its simple descending three-chord main theme in the first movement.
No. 26 sounds the most operatic, and was indeed used as an overture
to a play. No. 30 is full of humor, a light-hearted romp in the
opening Molto Allegro movement, followed by a stately Andantino,
Menuetto and Haydenesque surprise ending in the final Presto.
   The Vienna trip was Mozart's third to the European music capital.
As a 7-year-old prodigy, he jumped into the lap of Empress Maria
Theresa and gave her a kiss for her praise. The next time, he got a
gold watch. In 1773, he got another audience _ but not the court
appointment he had hoped for. The empress in a letter compared the
ever-touring genius to a travelling beggar.

   It could have been an actor's nightmare:
starring in a movie while the man you're portraying is always there,
peeping over your shoulder. But for Morgan Freeman, the results were
great.
   Freeman, who received an Academy Award nomination last year for
his supporting role as the terrifying pimp in ``Street Smart,'' is
the star of Warner Bros.' ``Lean on Me.'' He plays the role of Joe
Clark, the New Jersey principal who turned a drug-ridden wasteland
into a model high school with the symbolic weapons of a baseball bat
and a bullhorn.
   Not only is Joe Clark alive and functioning at Eastside High in
Paterson. He was also present while ``Lean on Me'' was being shot at
Eastside.
   ``Joe was there before we started,'' says Freeman. ``Since we
filmed in the school and school was in session, he was there every
day, doing his job.
   ``You want to know if that was daunting? Yes. Incredibly daunting
the first week and a half or two. I didn't know how I was going to
do it.''
   How much of the performance is Morgan Freeman and how much is Joe
Clark?
   ``All of the performance is Morgan Freeman,'' he replied. ``What
Morgan Freeman could bring in the way of Joe Clark was largely due
to Joe Clark. He was very available to me, extremely helpful, very
supportive. He made it easy, despite my own sense of inadequacy.''
   But Freeman still had to create a character, not merely imitate
Joe Clark.
   ``That's what I lost sight of,'' he admitted. `` I went into this
watching him and thinking, `I got to be Joe Clark,' rather than,
`I've got to give a performance.' I had to straighten myself out on
that. It was like trying to make a Studebaker look like a Buick.''
   Freeman was pleased to report that Clark has seen the film and
has given his seal of approval. ``That's the seal that counts,''
said Freeman. ``I really wanted him to like the movie. I like him a
lot.''
   Not everyone agrees. Clark was tagged ``Crazy Joe'' because of
some of his tactics, including the chaining of school exit doors to
keep out drug dealers. Or his initial act of expelling 300
under-achieving and trouble-making pupils. Freeman, however,
dismisses Clark's critics.
   ``He is universally beloved by his students, and that's all that
counts. People who disagree with him are meaningless. They're off in
some kind of ivory tower; I don't think they even know what he did.''
   Some might argue that Clark has been operating a fascist state.
   ``So what?'' answers Freeman. ``What do you think a school is?
It's not a democracy. You can't teach democracy if you can't catch
the attention of the students. No school I ever went to was (a
democracy).''
   His schools were in Chicago's South Side, an area not unlike
Paterson. Morgan had been born in Greenwood, Miss., but his family
moved north when he was young. He remembers school as being much
more orderly than what Joe Clark faces.
   ``The streets were what I had to negotiate; the schools were not
a problem,'' he remarked. ``Once you got through the doors of
school, you were safe. There the teachers had control.
   ``What (`Lean on Me') represents is what happened to schools,
particularly in the inner cities, in the '60s and '70s. The schools
were taken over by the students, and the teachers were shortchanged.
Their caseloads and classrooms were entirely too large. Their
ability to discipline miscreants was undermined by Supreme Court
rulings about corporal punishment in schools. And their salaries
were so low that they became second-class citizens.''
   Freeman first fell in love with acting in the third grade, when
he portrayed Little Boy Blue in a class pageant. In the seventh
grade he won the Illinois state prize as best actor in a drama
contest. But his real ambition was to become a ``hotshot pilot with
a scarf around my neck and strafe the enemy's flag.''
   In the Air Force he became a radar technician instead. After his
discharge he realized what he really wanted to do was act, and he
enrolled at Los Angeles City College to learn the basics. His first
professional job was dancing at the 1964 New York World's Fair, then
he joined a touring company of ``The Royal Hunt of the Sun.''
   Freeman managed to earn a living in plays such as ``Hello,
Dolly'' (with Pearl Bailey and Cab Calloway) and ``Purlie'' and in
TV shows such as PBS's ``The Electric Company.'' Then in 1980 the
jobs inexplicably stopped. He still doesn't know why, except maybe
he was too outspoken in rejecting material he deemed substandard.
   The drought lasted two years, and he credits Paul Newman with
helping him get work again, casting him in a film. The big
breakthrough came with ``Street Smart.''
   ``I always wanted to play a pimp,'' he admitted, ``and this guy
was real.'' Critics thought so. Pauline Kael even theorized in The
New Yorker: ``Is Morgan Freeman the greatest American Actor?''
   ``Street Smart,'' which starred Christopher Reeve, was released
early in 1987 to so-so business. Freeman's achievement might have
faded from view except that Los Angeles Times critic Sheila Benson
suggested to Cannon Films publicist Lynn Kwit that his performance
deserved an Oscar campaign.
   His reaction to the Academy nomination?
   ``I felt fine. It was like having a pat on the back and `Well
done.' You sort of kick the dirt and say, `Aw gee, thanks'
(laughing) and try to hold onto your sense of self and not go off
flying half-cocked. It's just a pat on the back.''

<BYLINE>The Artists: Which Way is Up? ^By RICHARD BENKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before Georgia O'Keeffe's painting of the
Lawrence Tree left Connecticut on a traveling show for the National
Gallery 16 months ago, the trunk had been at the bottom and the
branches at the top.
   Now it's going back to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford with
the tree standing on its head.
   Curators say ``on its head'' is what the artist intended when she
painted the towering pine at author D.H. Lawrence's ranch north of
Taos 60 years ago, but one of them adds that the National Gallery's
decision to show it that way has caused ``a firestorm of
controversy.''
   In her last 10 years, O'Keeffe chose at least three times to show
the tree upright _ on a poster, in a television documentary and in a
book of her collected works. The Wadsworth similarly displayed it
reaching upward toward a starlit sky. But her final intentions were
never made clear. O'Keeffe, who had lived near Abiquiu since 1940,
died in Santa Fe in 1986 at the age of 98.
   ``I warned the curators at the National Gallery that this would
become a subject of discussion. Of course, if Georgia O'Keeffe were
alive, one word would clarify it,'' says Juan Hamilton, a fellow
Abiquiu artist who was O'Keeffe's helper and confidant during her
last 13 years.
   The Viking Press and Hamilton say her 1976 book version was
intentional.
   ``O'Keeffe went over every one of the plates. She approved
everything,'' says Viking executive editor Amanda Vaill.
   O'Keeffe and Hamilton also displayed the painting with the tree
upright on a WNET-TV PBS documentary in 1977.
   In 1981, she gave the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival the right
to use the painting on a poster, again indicating a preference for
the upright tree, and the festival last month reprinted 5,000 copies
showing it that way.
   ``This was the agreed-upon orientation for our poster,'' festival
marketing director Daniel Kosharek says.
   Betsy Kornhauser, curator of American painting at the Wadsworth,
says the artist left the question of how to hang the work up to the
gallery when the Wadsworth acquired it in 1979.
   ``She said she looked at the tree from several directions and
several ways, and she felt that the painting could be hung from any
direction,'' Kornhauser said.
   The Wadsworth chose to hang it with the tree reaching toward the
top edge of the canvas. But Kornhauser is convinced that the
National Gallery research is correct, and from now on the Wadsworth
will show the painting with the tree pointing toward the bottom.
   In a 1929 letter to Rebecca Strand, O'Keeffe wrote of her
four-month trip to New Mexico, including a visit to the Lawrence
ranch: ``I also got a painting of the big pine tree as you see it
lying on that table under it at night. It looks as though it is
standing on its head with all the stars around _ pretty good _ for
me.''
   In a 1931 letter to art critic Henry McBride, O'Keeffe remarked
that a picture of the painting in an art magazine lost the point by
showing it ``standing on its ear. ... That tree should stand on its
head.''
   Photos of a 1931 exhibition show the tree inverted as well.
   Hamilton says the artist ``was a little more flexible than some
of the viewers of this work,'' and either way may be considered
correct today.
   ``She was a person involved in change. She wasn't a stagnant
person,'' Hamilton says. ``If she was hanging a show, she would
allow herself to do something similar'' and hang a painting
differently.
   Jack Cowart, curator of 20th century art at the National Gallery
in Washington, agrees O'Keeffe was not wedded to first decisions
about her work.
   ``We don't mean to bind her to the prior decision, but we would
think ... that the 1930s decision had a greater pertinence to the
original inspiration,'' he said.
   Cowart cited ``the inverse visual logic that the artist had in
the '30s.'' Other O'Keeffe paintings could be hung in multiple
directions, including the 1929 Black Hollyhock painted at Mabel
Dodge Luhan's Taos adobe.
   Despite the documentation, Cowart says the decision to show the
Lawrence Tree in its original orientation touched off ``a firestorm
of controversy.''
   ``We've been dealing with it since the exhibition opened. They
think they've caught us in a mistake. ... We didn't realize that the
Viking book would have such an indelible impact on the public's
memory.''
   The National Gallery tour was timed to coincide with the 100th
anniversary of O'Keeffe's birth and should honor her creative
intent, Cowart says. ``This (inversion) was not a caprice or whimsy.
It was out of reverence to the piece.
   ``And from here on, it's a tossup,'' he added with a laugh.
   Hamilton says O'Keeffe would have gotten a laugh out of it, too.
   ``Probably nothing would have amused Miss O'Keeffe more than
people worrying about whether her painting was right side up or
right side down,'' says Hamilton, one of three co-personal
representatives of the O'Keeffe estate and co-curator of the
National Gallery show.
   The traveling exhibition closed Feb. 5 at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York. The show also visited Chicago and Dallas after
opening in Washington in November 1987. It now heads for Los Angeles
for a March 31 opening.
   However, the Lawrence Tree won't be included in the Los Angeles
visit, which was tacked onto the schedule as an afterthought. The
painting returns to the Wadsworth, because the owners felt it had
been away long enough.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Focus Is On Life for Lola Falana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a year after a mysterious debilitating
illness placed her career on hold, entertainer Lola Falana says
living has replaced the stage as her No. 1 priority.
   After a lifetime in the spotlight, one brush with death and a
second illness that left her partially paralyzed, Falana, 46, has
turned her back to the entertainment grind that has dominated her
personal and professional life.
   ``I want my life back,'' she said in a recent interview in her
apartment overlooking the Las Vegas Strip where she performed for
more than two decades. ``The demands of my career had become very
draining, very depressing. I won't lock myself in again so that I
have no space to dream. I'm not rushing back to that kind of world.''
   Falana nearly died in 1983 when she suffered peritonitis
following abdominal surgery. In November 1987 she was diagnosed by
doctors in Las Vegas and at UCLA Medical Center as having multiple
sclerosis, a neurological disease that short circuits the central
nervous system.
   Her sizzling dance routines, a trademark since she wowed Broadway
in ``Golden Boy'' with Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1960s, had been
stilled in the summer of 1987 when she found her strength sapped by
the illness.
   She and her long-time manager, Joe Schenk, agree she will never
dance again. And she says she'll never go back to life on the road.
She doesn't have the heart or the health.
   ``I spent a good part of my life in airports, sleeping on planes.
How chic is that?''
   She hasn't dismissed the idea of performing in her hometown of
Las Vegas on a limited basis, but wants nothing more to do the
hassle of the road.
   ``I'm learning to hear my body,'' she says. ``Stress is the main
factor in all diseases. I need calm. The whole world is hurry up.
Well, excuse me, but I don't want to play. I've matured into
understanding what is important for my health.
   ``Since I was 14 I've been on every circuit of nightclub there
is. And if I've missed one, I don't want to see it. What is there to
dedicate your career to? One more dressing room that you find in the
basement of a building?
   ``Whatever triggered this, I'm not going to let it happen to me
again.
   ``I just got a second chance to learn how to live,'' she said,
her voice rising. ``I'm in charge. When you get a second chance at
life, you'd be amazed at how wide awake you become.
   Longtime friends such as Davis, Wayne Newton and Julio Iglesias
have encouraged her to follow her heart, mind her health, but not
close the door on her career.
   ``They say, `You can't give up your gift.' But they also tell me
it's important that I get well.''
   ``In her mind, she doesn't want to perform again,'' Schenk said.
``The dancing is gone. She'll never do that again.''
   Schenk believes the stenuous dance routines that were a Falana
trademark helped accentuate her problem 15 months ago. Falana
believes she is totally recovered from the disease.
   Her health grew progressively worse in the summer and fall of
1987.
   ``The last performance I did was the worst I ever did,'' she
recalled of an engagement in Orlando, Fla., in August 1987. ``I
couldn't feel my left foot touch the floor. I had no rhythm in my
left leg. My vocal chords were collapsing. Everything was flat.
There was no Lola on stage.
   ``I was afraid to stray away from the piano because I needed it
for support. It was a scared person up there. I couldn't switch the
mike from one hand to the other. I don't even remember the show
except thinking `How can I get off the stage.'''
   By that fall, she was bedridden. She moved to an apartment after
falling down the stairs at her home. By Nov. 2 the left side of her
body was paralyzed.
   ``I couldn't move my arm or leg,'' she recalled.
   Determined to lick the paralysis and the gloomy outlook of her
doctors, she said she began climbing small mountains _ propping
herself up on an elbow, grabbing a bed railing to try and sit up.
   ``Something inside was telling me, `You're not as helpless as you
think.'''
   By the 15th day after her diagnosis she decided to go to a
shopping mall.
   ``I had a limp, a little drag in my left leg,'' she recalled.
``If I walked slowly, it would look like I was just shopping, just
strolling. If someone noticed, I kissed it off by saying I had
stubbed my toe.''
   After five months of therapy she was able to raise her left arm
over her head. Now she wants to spend her time letting others know
that faith in God can sometimes be a miraculous medicine.
   Beneath the pizzazz of show business is a fickle streak that
leaves her cold.
   ``I've seen people get every imaginable accolade. But if they get
one day older than the world thinks they should be, they drop them
like they have no talent at all,'' she said.
   ``Show business is not the master to follow. It does not love you
back. It takes what it needs, and if you can get your share out of
it, good for you. If not, too bad, goodbye.
   ``Some of the greatest actors and actresses in the world are
sitting in a home someplace and can't even get a job to buy food
with dignity.''
   What's ahead for Lola Falana?
   ``I'm planning on being healthy, being well, meeting a marvelous
gentleman someday, settling down, being his wife.
   ``Now that I've seen all the games, all the glitter, all the
illusions, I'm ready for the real things in life _ human relations.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Writing Memoir A Humbling Experience</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Who the heck is Tobias Wolff to be writing his
memoirs?
   That's the question that Wolff, an award-winning short story
writer whose name elicits admiration in literary circles but blank
looks outside of them, pondered in a recent interview.
   It's a query he's fielded a lot lately, with the publication of
``This Boy's Life: A Memoir'' (Atlantic Monthly Press: $18.95), and
it makes him a little defensive.
   ``These are not my memoirs in the sense of Famous People I Have
Known or Wonderful Places I Have Been; it's an account of what it's
like to come of age in this country,'' said the author, citing Frank
Conroy's ``Stop-Time'' and Mary McCarthy's ``Memoirs of a Catholic
Girlhood'' as like works.
   But doesn't it take a kind of arrogance for a writer to decide
his life is as interesting as his fiction?
   ``It requires, I would say, more courage than arrogance to write
a memoir,'' he said. ``I think there's a certain amount of arrogance
inherent in writing anything. Because what you're in essence doing
is going up to complete strangers and saying, `I'm so interesting
that you're just going to have to spend $20 to spend three hours in
my company.'
   ``You have to be willing to get your neck chopped off when you
write a memoir. It's a kind of humbling activity rather than the
other way around.''
   This account of growing up in blue-collar Chinook, Wash., and
other rough-and-tumble locales in the 1950s has received high praise
for its honest and unsentimental evocation of childhood.
   Wolff, who begins the book as a 10-year-old cadging his mother
into buying him souvenirs he knows she can't afford and ends it with
his getting kicked out of prep school, has resisted all temptation
to make either himself or his childhood idyllic.
   The youth we see in these pages (the young Tobias preferred the
name Jack during this period, after Jack London) breaks school
windows, pelts cars with eggs, sneaks the family car out on joy
rides, and in an ultimate ruse, forges references and school records
to get himself admitted to prep school.
   Much of the deliquency is a rebellion against a totalitarian
stepfather, Dwight, who berates and occasionally beats the boy and
forces him to do demeaning tasks, such as spending weeks shucking
prickly horse chestnuts that are then allowed to mold.
   Wolff, 43, is the author of two short story collections, ``Back
in the World'' and ``In the Garden of the North American Martyrs,''
and a novella, ``The Barracks Thief,'' which won the 1985
Pen-Faulkner award.
   He is also the younger brother of the novelist and former
Newsweek critic Geoffrey Wolff, although the two grew up in separate
households. Geoffrey was raised by his father on the East Coast,
while Tobias traveled with his mother out West.
   Geoffrey Wolff's well-received ``The Duke of Deception''
published in 1979 was a chronicle of his father, a charismatic con
artist constantly reinventing himself, a man who once fast-talked
his way into an aeronautics position with a bogus resume. It is
uncanny how the young Jack duplicates his father's deceptive
behavior even though the elder Wolff was a virtual stranger to him.
   Wolff is a nervously energetic man whose mind races far faster
than his answers to an interviewer's questions, with the result that
he is constantly restarting sentences or leaving them unfinished. He
is dressed in jeans, a plaid shirt and Reeboks that belie his
professorial status _ he has taught creative writing at Syracuse
University in New York for the past eight years.
   The author believes that it is a very powerful myth in our
culture for adults to remember growing up as a magical and happy
time, and that he had altered his childhood memories to fit that
notion until he started working on this book.
   ``And then I discovered a darkness in those years that I had
forgotten about, glossed over. It's like women who remember years
later in analysis that their fathers abused them. You think, `How
could they go on all these years without remembering this?' But we
do,'' he said.
   ``This Boy's Life'' ends with Jack being dismissed from the prep
school, being academically unprepared for the rigorous curriculum he
had duped his way into, and joining the Army.
   In the interview, Wolff picked up where the book leaves off,
describing his duty tour in Vietnam and wandering through Europe
afterward. He fell in love with Oxford, England, and discovered that
he could attend the university even without a high school degree if
he could pass the grueling entrance exams. He crammed for eight
months, hiring tutors to instruct him in English literature and
history, Latin and French, passed the exams and went on to graduate.
   He then returned to the United States, working briefly for The
Washington Post, where he got fired when he lazily didn't
double-check an obituary that turned out to be a prank. From there
he went to California, got a Stegner Fellowship at Stanford
University, and started publishing stories.
   Wolff said he has no plans to make a book out of the material of
his adult self, and is currently finishing up a collection of short
stories and has plans for two novels.
   Looking back on ``This Boy's Life,'' Wolff said he finds himself
talking about Jack in the third person, as if he were a character he
created instead of his youthful self.
   ``The very act of writing about him, make him something on the
page, makes him different from me,'' he said. ``I find myself
feeling amused at some of the things he does; I feel affection,
irritation. ... I have the feelings toward him that I might have
toward a son.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: ``Streets of Bakersfield'' Helps Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELK, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homer Joy recently got a call from a woman who
had once scolded him for his noisy guitar playing and singing.
   Joy, 43, said the former neighbor recalled the confident young
musician's reply 35 years ago that she wouldn't yell at him after
she heard his songs on the radio.
   The apologetic call came after his song, ``Streets of
Bakersfield,'' was nominated for a Grammy as country song of the
year and Joy was nominated as songwriter of the year.
   Now, Joy hopes the song that also helped Buck Owens and Dwight
Yoakam receive a Grammy nomination for country duo of the year will
also help him find a record company to distribute a gospel album.
   It was 16 years ago that Joy wrote and recorded ``The Streets of
Bakersfield,'' about the frustration he felt while recording a
``sound-alike'' album of Hank Williams Sr. songs at Owens'
Bakersfield, Calif., studio.
   ``It just wasn't what I wanted to do,'' Joy said during a recent
interview. But because he was under contract with Buck Owens
Enterprises, he finished the project, then insisted that producer
Bob Morrison listen to him play a song he'd written.
   ``I really got kind of redneck about it,'' Joy said, but the end
result was that Owens heard the song and loved it, and had Joy
record it.
   ``The Streets of Bakersfield'' was a Top 10 hit in 1973 for Joy,
a native of Heber Springs, Ark.
   Joy had another hit single with ``John Law'' in 1974, and Owens,
Freddie Hart and other big-name country singers were recording his
songs. He performed on the same bill with Nashville stars such as
Roy Clark, Mel Tillis and Tanya Tucker.
   The version of ``The Streets of Bakersfield'' recorded last year
by Owens and Yoakam hit the top of the country charts. But in the
years between his version and the latest version of the song, Joy
hit rock bottom.
   Joy said he and Owens mutually agreed to end his contract in 1976
because of ``artistic differences.'' After that, he proved unable to
cope with the pressures, traveling and temptations of being a rising
star. After Joy and his wife of 15 years, Lois, divorced in 1978,
his life changed.
   ``I sold 4.5 million records, and then I had everything I owned
in a cardboard box in 1983,'' Joy said. ``It was a real disaster.''
   But the down-and-out wanderer, who as a boy would sneak out of
Saturday movie matinees to sing with Salvation Army bands on
streetcorners in Spokane, Wash., said he got a dose of salvation
that helped him recover and gave him a new outlook on his music.
   ``I accepted the Lord six years ago,'' Joy said. He and Lois
remarried in June 1983, and the following year a daughter, Bethany,
was born.
   The Joys have seven children. Along with his wife, sons Morgan
and Preston accompany their father on the album of gospel songs he's
recording at a studio in Spokane.
   ``My wife and I said a prayer a year ago, and it couldn't have
been more than three weeks later that Dwight and Buck did (the song)
on the Country Music Awards anniversary show,'' he said.
   Their record was released last July and hit No. 1 on Oct. 15, but
Joy said that was just a start.
   ``I believed `Streets of Bakersfield' was No. 1 with a bullet,
that it being No. 1 was just really the beginning of things,'' he
said. ``And it's turned out to be true.
   ``It's been good for everybody this song has touched, and we're
really thankful. Our prayer was that we could have a way to finance
our gospel album.''
   For that project, Joy picked the 10 best songs he's written since
he became a Christian six years ago. They are songs he's sung in
performances at missions, penitentiaries and Christian services at
rodeos.
   ``I haven't ever written a song that isn't based on truth,'' he
said, including his old songs about getting drunk or stoned,
womanizing and ``all those other kind of things. But I don't believe
(in those things) now.
   ``There was a time when I did, and I lived like that. So now we
try to live what we write now.''
   Joy still enjoys playing ``secular'' music, and he says his
gospel songs aren't an attempt to ``stuff the Bible down people's
throats.
   ``We just try to do what we believe in and hope it will touch
people, like `The Streets of Bakersfield' touched a whole lot of
people.''
   He's well aware that the success of a song revived after 16 years
doesn't guarantee a good response for a new gospel album.
   ``This thing, with `Streets of Bakersfield,' will get it listened
to,'' Joy said. ``But I'm not ignorant, and I know that the album
has to stand on its own, aside from anything else. And I believe it
will.''

<HEAD>Nose Research Provides Route to Wider Knowledge</HEAD>

   Scientists know a lot about smell. They know it
weakens as we get older, it varies depending on a person's sex and
ethnic background, and it involves more than just the nose. What
they generally don't know is why.
   ``Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back
seat to the other senses, probably because we don't live in an
olfactory world. We live in a visual world; a world of sounds,''
said Dr. John S. Kauer, a New England Medical Center researcher
trying to determine brain function using the nose.
   Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the
path of an odor impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work
produced a ``movie,'' or series of color-enhanced pictures, showing
that the brain is ``a parallel processor,'' handling many signals
simultaneously _ like a supercomputer.
   The research may have implications for the study and treatment of
brain tumors by helping differentiate between tumors and normal
tissue.
   Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory
oddities as a link between premature decline in smell and
Alzheimer's disease; a protein that ferries odor molecules through
the nose; the fact that half of all people between ages 65 and 80
suffer major loss in the sense of smell; and the trait peculiar to
some nasal nerve cells to regenerate.
   ``They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this
spontaneous renewal and spontaneous decay,'' Kauer said.
   Some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at
medical advancement but at the bottom line. In Union Beach, N.J.,
Dr. Craig Warren heads a research and development team for
International Fragrances and Flavors Inc., a company that produces
scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of
companies around the world.
   Smell, Warren said, ``is the one sense for which the mechanism
for perception is unknown.'' Scientists know how odor molecules are
gathered by smell neurons but they don't know how a few similar
types of receptor cells can distinguish between thousands of
different odors.
   Research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than
the nose, Warren said. When blindfolded, ``Most people cannot
discriminate a lemon from a lime or an orange from a grapefruit.''
   IFF regularly brings in dozens of smell samplers, usually women,
to rate and react to fragrances, with emphasis on how the fragrances
can alter mood. In the process, Warren has found that 10 percent and
15 percent of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of
smell.
   At the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of
smell.
   Mary Brooks, 35, of Philadelphia, took an uncommon route to this
fairly common problem. Beginning in 1972 she began to experience
what amounted to smell hallucinations; she thought she smelled an
unpleasant odor when there was no odor present. Years of anguish and
unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain sugery in which her
olfactory nerve was removed, ending her hallucinations but leaving
her incapable of smelling.
   ``It can be very dangerous,'' she said. ``I've already burnt
things in the oven and I didn't know it and there are smoke alarms
everywhere. But on the other hand it doesn't bother me not to smell
because I still sense that I'm breathing and smelling the same as
you are.''
   Brooks' doctor was Richard Doty, director of the University of
Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center. Patients include the aged and
professionals like wine tasters, firefighters, police officers, gas
company workers, inspectors and cooks whose lives and livelihoods
can depend on the sense of smell.
   ``There have always been problems that people had and they've had
no place to turn in the past,'' Doty said. ``It's a frontier of
science which really hasn't even been touched on.''
   That's no accident, Kauer said. ``Our world doesn't require it.
We really don't go out and forage for food by sniffing along the
ground. That evolution took place millions of years ago.''
   Doty, Daniel A. Deems and Stanley Stellar published a report in
August in the journal Neurology linking the loss of smell and
Parkinson's disease. A year earlier, a similar study linked the loss
of smell to Alzheimer's disease. A new area of research will try to
determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway for viruses or
chemicals that contribute to those maladies, Doty said.
   The general subject headings scientists have explored give an
idea of the scope of smell research: the influence of body tilt on
the sense of smell; and the effect of mouth movement, swallowing and
spitting. Studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting
distinctions: Korean Americans appeared to have particularly acute
ability to identify smells. Black Americans in one sampling had
trouble with cedar and cheddar cheese. Whites had trouble with
gingerbread. Native Japanese scored poorly on clove and fruit punch.
   Despite this mountain of research, a key question that puzzles
scientists is precisely how the sense of smell works.
   At Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Solomon Snyder last summer
identified a carrier protein that ferries odor molecules up the
nose. The discovery occurred inadvertently in a search for receptors
that play a key role in distinguishing smells, Snyder said. ``But
another possibility as to why the receptors haven't been found is
that they don't exist.''
   Other factors _ sight, sound and environment, for example _ help
provide the brain with cues in identifying smells, he said, but
``the fundamental discrimination is going to be in the nose.''

<HEAD>Advanced Uranium Enrichment Process Nears Availability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new method of wresting radioactive
uranium from nature's grasp is ready for commercial use, and could
put the United States at the forefront of the $2 billion enrichment
industry, a scientist says.
   ``I can get real excited about the economic incentives,'' said
Robert Merriman, an associate director of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and program manager for development of Atomic Vapor Laser
Isotope Separation. ``But I have to confess I believe the principal
reasons we want to be in the business in the long term are our
energy security and our national security. We cannot become
dependent on foreign suppliers for yet another one of our fuels.''
   Uranium-235, the form needed for bombs and nuclear reactors,
comprises only about 0.7 percent of the metal in nature. To be
useful, that concentration must be increased to 3 percent to 4
percent, resulting in ``enriched'' uranium.
   The United States still uses gaseous barrier diffusion, developed
during World War II and since refined, to enrich uranium. The
uranium is converted to a gas and pumped repeatedly through a series
of ceramic filters; because U-235 is lighter than the most common
isotope, U-238, it passes through.
   But gaseous barrier diffusion _ done in the United States at
plants in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky., is costly. ``I believe
the technology in our gaseous diffusion plants is the best in the
world. But Mother Nature just dictated a lot of kilowatt hours for
that approach,'' Merriman said.
   Eighty percent of the cost of gaseous barrier diffusion is the
electricity, he said. ``Our expectation is that over the next decade
energy prices will drive our cost up to the point where our prices
are not competitive.''
   The Portsmouth plant also is awaiting cleanup of tons of
radioactive waste.
   AVLIS, chosen in 1985 as the preferred U.S. method, makes use of
the fact that the different electron energies of U-235 and U-238
absorb different colors of light. Lasers are tuned so they emit a
combination of colors absorbed only by U-235 atoms, which then emit
an electron, leaving the atom positively charged and capable of
separation using electromagnetic fields.
   This process, according to the Department of Energy, is vastly
more efficient than gaseous barrier diffusion or a third technique
using centrifuges to spin off the lighter U-235. The centrifuge
process uses less electricity but lost out to AVLIS for government
sponsorship in this country.
   The United States' two main competitors for the nuclear fuel
market are URENCO, a consortium of Britain, the Netherlands and West
Germany that uses the centrifuge process, and a consortium of Spain,
Belgium, France and Italy that uses a French diffusion plant with a
nuclear power plant dedicated to it.
   Merriman said he is confident AVLIS has matured to the point of
commercial deployment. And maybe just in time.
   Duke Power is studying a venture with URENCO to build a uranium
enrichment plant in the United States using European technology.
   ``AVLIS has all the attributes of the kind of technology the
country is looking for,'' Merriman said. ``It uses about 10 percent
of the electricity of gaseous diffusion. It's very compact. And it's
a high-tech endeavor.''
   The components of AVLIS have demonstrated they would work on a
commercial scale, he said. ``It's now a question of getting the
engineering done to make it work cheaply, so we can compete and
build a plant. I don't have any doubt we'll get there.''
   The goal is to operate an AVLIS plant to enrich uranium at half
the cost of current technology. Merriman estimates a commercial
AVLIS plant with an output equivalent to that of the Paducah gaseous
diffusion plant would cost about $1.5 billion to $2 billion and take
eight or nine years to build. It could be built in modules and
phased in as market conditions dictate, he said.

   Karl Fuls was angry and frustrated after losing
his legs to circulatory problems. ``What I needed was to talk to me

have avoided.''
   Savvier now and far more self-sufficient, Fuls last August set up
The Broken Wing, a non-profit organization that matches the newly
disabled with a person of the same sex, age, background and handicap
to discuss strategies for coping.
   ``Everybody's got questions,'' Fuls, 62, said, sitting in a
motorized chair at the Rehabilitation Institute of Pittsburgh during
a recent meeting. Three of the 16 people were in wheelchairs, three
had canes and several wore leg braces.
   ``They're not going to ask a doctor. They're not going to ask a
therapist. They will ask questions to people like themselves. How do
you put makeup on? How do you take a shower? Is my sex life over?
Things like this,'' he said.
   ``It's all new. I cry. Being with somebody like you helps. You
can even laugh,'' said Mary Ann Tomko, a 50-year-old grocery
employee who sought moral support _ and practical advice _ from
Broken Wing members after her right leg was amputated abovethe knee
last fall because of a blood clot.
   Her parents, with whom she lives, accompany their only child to
meetings.
   ``It affects me, too. I thought I was going to die,'' Eleanor
Tomko, 71, said, her eyes filling with tears.
   John McCrorey, 57, whose left side has been paralyzed for eight
years because of a stroke, thrives on helping others. The former
engineer regularly chats with an advertising executive who's
recovering from a stroke. ``It's just good to talk about our mutual
problems. It's like losing half of your body and dragging it along
with you. Your body commits suicide.
   ``It's good to have hope. There's light at the end of the
tunnel.''
   Occupational therapist Annie Miller, The Broken Wing's secretary,
acknowledges there are innumerable support groups to which the
handicapped can turn. But they operate on ``a communication or
verbal level.
   ``They get together. They meet. They discuss and emotionally they
may feel better about their disabilities.''
   The Broken Wing offers ``more than just emotional support and
conversation. We are out there to provide a service, to physically
make people more independent,'' Miller said.
   Fuls had no idea how much he'd learned about coping, most of it
``the hard way,'' until 1984 when he was leafing through his diary.
He began writing about his health problems a year before being
diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. After his fourth and final
amputation in 1982, for example, his wheelchair rolled backward down
a ramp outside his house. Only later did he learn he needed a
special chair for amputees that accounts for the imbalance.
   ``I was mad,'' he said. ``It made me start thinking.''
   Soon afterward, the idea for a network to nurture independence
was born.
   After several years of research and planning, The Broken Wing
finally was chartered last August with headquarters at Fuls' home in
suburban White Oak.
   Forty strong and growing, The Broken Wing is seeking grants for
office space and a computer system that would link the longtime
disabled to the newly handicapped, eventually nationwide. Since late
January, Fuls has been talking to support groups in search of
volunteers.
   His message is simple: ``Do they remember how hard it was for
them to adjust to a handicapped lifestyle and would they be willing
to have someone else benefit from their experience?''

<HEAD>Nose Research Provides Route to Wider Knowledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists know a lot about smell. They know it
weakens as we get older, it varies depending on a person's sex and
ethnic background, and it involves more than just the nose. What
they generally don't know is why.
   ``Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back
seat to the other senses, probably because we don't live in an
olfactory world. We live in a visual world; a world of sounds,''
said Dr. John S. Kauer, a New England Medical Center researcher
trying to determine brain function using the nose.
   Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the
path of an odor impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work
produced a ``movie,'' or series of color-enhanced pictures, showing
that the brain is ``a parallel processor,'' handling many signals
simultaneously _ like a supercomputer.
   The research may have implications for the study and treatment of
brain tumors by helping differentiate between tumors and normal
tissue.
   Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory
oddities as a link between premature decline in smell and
Alzheimer's disease; a protein that ferries odor molecules through
the nose; the fact that half of all people between ages 65 and 80
suffer major loss in the sense of smell; and the trait peculiar to
some nasal nerve cells to regenerate.
   ``They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this
spontaneous renewal and spontaneous decay,'' Kauer said.
   Some research in the field is aimed not at medical advancement
but at the bottom line. In Union Beach, N.J., Dr. Craig Warren heads
a research team for International Fragrances and Flavors Inc., which
produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by
hundreds of companies.
   Smell, Warren said, ``is the one sense for which the mechanism
for perception is unknown.'' Scientists know how odor molecules are
gathered by smell neurons but they don't know how a few similar
types of receptor cells can distinguish between thousands of
different odors.

<HEAD>Advanced Uranium Enrichment Process Nears Availability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new method of wresting radioactive
uranium from nature's grasp is ready for commercial use, and could
put the United States at the forefront of the $2 billion enrichment
industry, a scientist says.
   ``I can get real excited about the economic incentives,'' said
Robert Merriman, an associate director of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and program manager for development of Atomic Vapor Laser
Isotope Separation.
   Uranium-235, the form needed for bombs and nuclear reactors,
comprises only about 0.7 percent of the metal in nature. To be
useful, that concentration must be increased to 3 percent to 4
percent, resulting in ``enriched'' uranium.
   The United States still uses gaseous barrier diffusion, developed
during World War II and since refined, to enrich uranium. But that
method, converting uranium to a gas and pumping it through a series
of ceramic filters, is costly. Eighty percent of the cost of gaseous
diffusion is electricity, Merriman said. ``Our expectation is that
over the next decade energy prices will drive our cost up to the
point where our prices are not competitive.''
   AVLIS, chosen in 1985 as the preferred U.S. method, uses lasers
tuned so they emit a combination of colors absorbed only by U-235
atoms, which then emit an electron, leaving the atom capable of
magnetic separation. The method, says the Department of Energy, is
vastly more efficient than gaseous diffusion or a third technique
using centrifuges to spin off the lighter U-235.
   The United States' two main competitors for the nuclear fuel
market are URENCO, a consortium of Britain, the Netherlands and West
Germany that uses the centrifuge process, and a consortium of Spain,
Belgium, France and Italy that uses a French diffusion plant with a
nuclear power plant dedicated to it.

<HEAD>Budworm Infestation Slowing In Pacific Northwest Forests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAKER, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adverse weather, Forest Service
``search-and-destroy'' missions and its own insatiable appetite have
slowed the advance of the Western spruce budworm that has spread
across millions of acres this decade.
   ``The outbreaks are clearly on the decline,'' said James Hadfield
of the U.S. Forest Service. The infestation has been ``the worst one
that we have ever experienced, in terms of the extent of area
defoliated and damage caused.''
   The tiny brown caterpillar was first spotted in 1980 on 5,000
acres near Cove, Ore. It has spread through Oregon and Washington,
primarily east of the Cascades, feeding on needles of fir and spruce
and destroying vast numbers of ``understory'' firs growing in the
shadow of mature trees.
   ``The effects will continue to be felt as long as 70 years out
because of the effect on the growth of trees,'' Hadfield said.
   Adverse weather at critical developmental stages and Forest
Service eradication efforts using chemical and biological pesticides
have helped reduce the infestation. In addition, trees in areas
where the budworm has been present for several years are so damaged
that they can't sustain the insect.
   Budworms defoliated 2.8 million acres last year, down from 4.2
million in 1987 and from a peak 6 million in 1986. ``We ar still
predicting a very extensive area of defoliation in 1989, even though
the intensity of the defoliation, by and large, will be pretty
light,'' Hadfield said.
   The Forest Service plans to test a new biological pesticide,
Bacillus thuringiensis, which homes in on budworms, on two plots of
1,000 and 10,000 acres in Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in
northeastern Oregon.

<HEAD>Medical Imaging Techniques Used to Identify Mummies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took modern radiological techniques to
take the wraps off two mummies at the Albany Institute of History
and Art, demonstrating that the bodies were of a man and a woman _
and that the woman had a fake toe.
   The toe, possibly made of a ceramic material, may have been the
woman's ticket to the afterlife, said curator Tammis Groft.
Egyptians believed people had to be physically intact to enter the
hereafter and attempts were often made to restore missing body parts
during mummification, Groft said.
   Albany Medical Center radiologists used standard X-rays and
computed tomography scans _ which provide a computer-enhanced
cross-section image of a body _ to study the mummies, one of which
was only partially wrapped.
   That mummy was a man, as museum experts had suspected since
acquiring the mummies in 1909. It may have been a priest known as
Ankhefenmut who was buried in the temple of Mut at Karnak in Thebes,
Groft said.
   ``We were pretty sure the partially unwrapped mummy was a male,''
he said. ``The X-rays confirmed it, showing a male pelvis and
genitalia. But the wrapped mummy remained a mystery, until we saw
the X-rays.''
   The radiology tests showed that both are from the 21st Egyptian
dynasty, circa 1085 to 945 B.C. Both probably died of natural
causes, experts theorize, since the tests didn't reveal any trauma
to their bodies. It's estimated that the man died in his 50s or 60s
and that the woman was about a decade younger.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope Long-Ignored Plant Will Be Rediscovered As Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wild legume that has been eaten in
eastern North America for nearly 5,000 years needs less fertilizer
than potatoes and yields three times the crude protein, says a
researcher who sees it as a food crop.
   The ``groundnut'' or ``rosary,'' Apios americana, is a small
climbing vine that produces clusters of edible pea-like seed pods
and tubers. It grows along sandy creek banks, through bushes and
over fallen trees.
   ``Historically, the plant is important because ... very few crops
native to North America have been domesticated,'' said
horticulturalist William Blackmon of Louisiana State University's
Agricultural Experiment Station.
   A legume, like peas, peanuts and soybeans, the groundnut produces
nitrogen and so needs less fertilizer than some food plants,
Blackmon said. The plant can survive frost and other conditions
unsuitable for many other crops.
   The tubers taste like a cross between an Irish potato and a
peanut when boiled, and can be used in casseroles, corn bread and
stir-fry cooking. Work is just beginning on recipes and other uses
for the groundnuts, which are edible but harder to produce and might
be processed into flour.
   Blackmon has been joined by researchers at the University of
Minnesota and North Carolina State University. He began sending
seeds to home gardeners in the United States and 16 other countries
in 1986, with mixed results.
   ``These were wild seeds and some of the wild seeds were just not
productive,'' he said. ``A lot of times you'll have a gardener
who'll be real clever and will come up with something that's
productive.''
   Blackmon is trying to develop a plant with a more compact vine
and with tubers closer to the stem to facilitate mechanical
harvesting.
   ``I think that in some places it might be very beneficial to the
world food supply,'' he said. ``The thing will stay stored in the
ground, (so) you don't have to store it. You can pull it when you
need it.''

<HEAD>Researchers Study Appetite Control Method Without The Risks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overweight people could control their
appetites without jangled nerves and drug dependency if a European
appetite suppressant under study here for a French pharmaceutical
company proves successful.
   University of Florida psychologist Neil Rowland recently
completed a preliminary study of the effect of dexfenfluramine on
laboratory rats fattened either by an eat-all-you-want feast of
chocolate-chip cookies and sweetened milk or by surgically neutering
the animals to control hormone levels.
   ``In either case, we end up with fat rats. They overeat and put
on the human equivalent of 50 extra pounds in a few weeks,'' Rowland
said. ``We then administer the drug to the rats through surgically
implanted capsules. What we find is that on this drug, the rats show
considerable sustained weight loss...
   ``As long as they are given the drug, they keep the weight off.''
   That is one drawback common to all diet drugs, he said. ``Whether
it's with rats or people, as long as they are given drugs they tend
to keep weight off but once they stop the drug, they gain back
weight.''
   Dexfenfluramine, which has been available in Europe for several
years, has several advantages over more traditional diet drugs,
Rowland said. It ``does not have any stimulant properties; if
anything, one side effect is mild sedation. Because of that, it has
absolutely no abuse potential.''
   And, based on European clinical tests, the drug, which Rowland is
testing for the French drug company Servier, produces little of the
nausea or drowsiness often associated with other appetite
suppressants.
   ``There are many theories about how (it) works,'' he said. ``It
may send a premature message to the brain that the stomach is full
or it may be affecting body metabolism. My feeling is that it is
working at several different levels in the body, which is fortunate
because that tends to enhance its effectiveness.''

   Independent oil-exporting nations are
likely to agree to cut their crude production to give another boost
to prices, a top OPEC official predicted.
   ``It is in their interest to reduce the supply so that we can
reach 18 (dollars a barrel),'' Subroto, secretary-general of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Monday.
   The 13 nations that comprise OPEC agreed in November to slash
production as of Jan. 1 in an effort to raise prices to their target
of $18 a barrel.
   The agreement sparked a rally that has lifted the average price
of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC to about $16 a barrel, up as
much as $5 from late November.
   OPEC officials want nations outside the cartel to join them in
trimming output to spur another price pickup.
   Representatives of a group of independent countries were meeting
Tuesday in London to discuss cuts. They met last month with OPEC
representatives.
   ``There is definitely a positive sign that, not only for our
interest but for their own interest, they will do something in
reducing the supply,'' Subroto, a former Indonesian oil minister,
said in an interview.
   ``The more they cut from their production, of course, the sooner
we can see it in dollars a barrel,'' he said.
   He declined to speculate on the level of cuts the non-OPEC
nations might put in place. But he said it was likely they would
make an offer to OPEC, possibly next month.
   One participant at the non-OPEC meeting said in London Monday he
was ``fairly optimistic about this meeting because we're all very
friendly.''
   Subroto predicted crude prices would definitely reach $18 in the
second half of 1989.
   New OPEC figures, he said, show member nations complied in
January with the new output accord. The agreedment set an overall
ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13 nations
in the first six months of this year.
   According to OPEC figures, 12 countries supplied a total of 17.42
million barrels a day in January, just under the quota of 17.51
million barrels.
   The cartel said figures from the United Arab Emirates had not yet
been received. That nation, however, has persistently overshot its
target in the past, according to private analysts. Its current quota
is 988,000 barrels a day.
   Subroto said the supply figures were ``a sign that we are abiding
(by) our quota.''
   Private analysts estimated OPEC exceeded its ceiling in January
by about a million barrels a day.
   OPEC said, however, it measures the quota by figuring crude
production and the amount of oil put into, or taken out of, stock.
Production, which it defines as the amount of crude measured at
storage facilities, was 18.13 million barrels a day in January for
the 12 reporting countries.
   It was the first time the cartel released monthly production
figures.
   Non-OPEC nations sending representatives to Tuesday's meeting
were Oman, Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia, China, Angola and Colombia. The
Soviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic, the Canadian province
of Alberta and the American state of Alaska were expected to send
observers.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
   Just as Texans are hearing reports of an economic
revival and new plans for reviving savings and loans, they're faced
with yet another industry crisis: insolvencies in dozens of the
state's insurance companies and the collapse of one of its largest.
   The $54 million failure of National County Mutual Fire Insurance
Co., which had an estimated 100,000 policyholders, triggered a state
inquiry into the State Board of Insurance and the industry itself.
   With 42 Texas-based insurance companies and 98 that do business
in the state being liquidated, fears are growing that Texas insurers
are following the same road as S&amp;Ls.
   ``The potential is there,'' said State Rep. Eddie Cavazos,
D-Corpus Christi, House Insurance Committee chairman of budget and
oversight. ``I don't think we have gotten to the bottom of the pit
(of insolvent insurance companies) and the closer we get to the
bottom, the more horror stories I hear.''
   A state auditor's report issued last week estimated the
liabilities of insurance companies in receivership exceeded their
assets by an estimated $200 million to $300 million as of Aug. 31.
   State officials say the factors that bedevil the insurance
industry are the same as those that endangered the thrifts: lax and
inept regulators, depressed real estate and oil markets and
freespending company officials.
   In 1987, Texans paid an estimated $26 billion for insurance
premiums, the audit said.
   The audit urged the insurance board to make identifying
financially troubled insurance companies its highest priority.
   Regulators came under sharp criticism for their handling of
National County, whose president, Robert H. Walker, is believed to
be in Switzerland.
   The insurance board staff knew about National County's problems
as early as 1986 but did not move to place the Dallas-based casualty
and property insurer in receivership until Oct. 24, 1988.
   A legislative report showed it took an average of more than one
year from the time examiners knew a company was in deep financial
trouble and the time it was placed into conservatorship.
   In December, when Insurance Commissioner Doyce Lee resigned under
pressure, he described the agency as under siege, trying to keep up
with the insurance industry after years of being understaffed and
underfunded while the sour economy brought on record insolvencies.
   During 1987 the agency was reorganized and its staff expanded
from about 850 employees to 1,300. Board members said the
reorganization contributed to the problems.
   But state Sen. John Montford, D-Lubbock, blamed ``inept''
management.
   ``They're running at a pace that would have worked in the
1930s,'' he said.
   Montford, who chairs the state Senate Affairs Committee that
conducted hearings on National County's failure, has sponsored 11
bills aimed at restructuring the insurance board. Also being drafted
is a measure that would set up an oversight panel.
   Regulatory and criminal investigations are under way to determine
what led to National County's insolvency, the costliest in Texas
history. The company's primary business was automobile insurance for
high-risk drivers.
   Insurance board liquidator James T. Odiorne has filed a lawsuit
against Walker and his sons, alleging that Walker ``and perhaps
others'' diverted premium money to affiliated companies.
   Also named in the suit are Texas National Insurance Co., Southern
Life Investment Co., Bent Tree National Bank, Western Fire &amp;
Casualty Insurance Co. Ltd., Walker National General Agency Inc. and
Superior Premium Finance Inc.
   As in the savings and loans crisis, consumers could end up
footing part of the bill to pay claims, which are expected to total
$40 million.
   Initially, claims will be paid through the Texas Property and
Casualty Guaranty Fund, supported by healthy insurance companies but
subsidized indirectly by the state.
   Tax credits the state gives to insurance companies that
contribute to the guaranty fund translate into lost state treasury
revenue, leaving taxpayers to make up the deficit.
   The new insurance commissioner, A.W. ``Woody'' Pogue, said he
expects more failures, but none of the magnitude of National County.
   ``We've made a lot of changes on the board,'' he said. ``I'm very
optimistic that we've turned it around.''

   Robert H. Walker may have swiped more than $20
million from the insurance company he led before it became one of
Texas' largest industry failures.
   Or he may be the most prominent insurance industry figure to fall
victim to the havoc wreaked on the Texas economy by the oil and gas
industry collapse.
   Or both.
   State and federal investigators trying to understand the failure
of Walker's company, National County Mutual Fire Insurance Co., may
have to wait for his explanations _ first they have to find him.
   The tycoon, they say, has ignored subpoenas and may have fled the
country.
   The 58-year-old Walker rose and fell in grand Texas style: buying
rounds for patrons of his giant honky-tonk, sailing a
multimillion-dollar yacht and flying several private planes before
being caught in the economic pinch.
   By the time National County was taken over by the State Board of
Insurance in October 1988, the property-casualty insurer was more
than $50 million in the red. The size of the failure prompted a
crisis of confidence in the state's insurance regulators, who have
been accused by some lawmakers of failing to act quickly to help the
company's estimated 100,000 customers.
   ``Mr. Walker is allegedly an example of what can happen when you
have this lethargic attitude by a regulatory agency,'' said state
Sen. John Montford.
   Montford serves on the Senate State Affairs Committee, which has
subpoenaed Walker to appear at a hearing.
   Insurance Board attorney Susan Martin said that based on reliable
sources, she believes Walker is in Switzerland.
   Walker is accused of concealing fraud and funneling premiums from
National County to Walker General Agency, his Dallas-based holding
company that owned the insurance operation, according to a lawsuit
filed by National County's state-appointed receiver, James Odiorne.
   The state has seized some of Walker's property, including two
sterling silver decorative saddles valued at $100,000 apiece.
   Walker owned a home in Dallas and a ranch in the Texas Hill
Country. His fortune was spread among more than 60 small companies
and real estate properties.
   Until he transferred his control last year, Walker was part owner
of the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, a Jackson, Wyo., honky-tonk with
saddles for barstools, silver dollars embedded in the bar and an
11,000-square-foot dance floor. He and two others bought the saloon
in 1979.
   Walker became well-known in the small tourist town during his
visits several times a year. Stopping at the Million Dollar, he
often would buy a round for the house and occasionally fly friends
to Las Vegas.
   ``Mostly he just partied,'' said David Hauser, who managed the
Million Dollar for eight years. ``He was a nice guy. We seemed to
get along real fine.''
   Walker could not be reached by The Associated Press. Calls to
family members were unanswered. Calls to National County were
referred to the liquidation office of the State Board of Insurance.
   But Walker has said he tried to save the company at the expense
of his luxurious lifestyle.
   ``I never kept money from the company,'' he told the Dallas
Business Journal last fall, adding that he expected to be accused of
taking about $28 million from National County. He said he offered to
contribute $3 million to the company to help recapitalize it, but
the state turned him down.
   Walker told the Journal National County was crippled by the loss
of a reinsurance contract with Dallas-based Republic Insurance Group.
   Republic began providing reinsurance in 1984 for National County
under a seven-year contract that anticipated $15 million worth of
business transferred to the reinsurer each year.
   In 1985 National County transferred about $120 million in
premiums to Republic _ eight times the anticipated amount _ and
Republic suspended the contract, a spokesman for the reinsurer said.
   Republic's decision was upheld in court-ordered arbitration,
which Walker said rendered National County unable to maintain its
insurance portfolio, primarily automobile coverage to high-risk
drivers.
   Republic, which had honored previous reinsurance contracts with
National County, refused to enter another.
   Walker began cutting back. National County took in more than $200
million in premiums at its peak, but was down to $50 million by the
time state regulators took over last fall.
   As the insurance company's troubles grew, so did those in
Walker's other enterprises, particularly real estate investments for
which he'd guaranteed payments before the energy collapse devastated
the Texas economy.
   ``I would think that he did what almost every businessman in
Dallas on a big roll did when the tap went dry,'' said Nicholas
Ricco, owner of Diversified Insurance Systems, Inc. of Dallas.
``He'd just go to other taps that are available.''
   Ricco said he and Walker talked only a handful of times in the
past five years, but they've known each other for 25 years.
   ``This lack of integrity I've heard about goes against the
grain,'' Ricco said. ``I saw him honor agreements with everyone for
years, including me, even to the detriment of himself.''
   The U.S. Postal Inspector's office in Dallas is leading a
criminal investigation of National County's failure to determine if
fraud was involved, inspector Jesse Horton said.
   Walker is also embroiled in several lawsuits stemming from unpaid
real estate loans and other soured investments.

<HEAD>Consolidated Gold Fields to Fight Sweetened Minorco Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC has rejected as
inadequate a sweetened $5.7 billion hostile takeover offer by
Minorco SA.
   ``The board intends to resist the bid strongly,'' said
Consolidated Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew, who advised
shareholders Monday to take no action in response to the offer, the
largest bid ever for a British company.
   ``This renewed bid, which is of questionable value, bears no
relation to the underlying worth of the company and is clearly not
meant to be taken seriously by shareholders,'' Agnew said.
   Under British takeover rules, Minorco, the investment arm of the
South African Oppenheimer family's mining empire, needed to renew
its bid by Thursday or risk having to wait till next fall to bid
again. By announcing its offer now, Minorco gets nearly three months
to proceed with its takeover attempt.
   The renewed bid follows approval Friday by the European Community
Commission, which conducted an informal inquiry into whether the
proposed acquisition of the gold mining group would result in a
monopoly of platinum markets.
   It also follows clearance by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission earlier this month. Minorco's original bid automatically
lapsed when the matter was referred to the commission in October.
   Minorco faces at least one more major legal hurdle. The offer is
conditional on Minorco winning its appeal against a U.S. court
injunction which blocked it from acquiring more than 30 percent of
Consolidated Gold Fields' shares.
   Minorco's offer would top Nestle SA's 2.6 billion-pound, or $4.6
billion, purchase of British confectioner Rowntree PLC last year.
   The latest bid is worth 14 pounds, or $24.78, a share in cash and
stock, for a total of 3.2 billion pounds, or $5.7 billion. Minorco's
previous offer was 13.06 pounds, or $23.12, a share in cash and
stock, for a total of 2.9 billion pounds, or $5.1 billion.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares rose 8 pence to 14.43 pounds on
London's Stock Exchange Monday, suggesting that investors believed
Minorco eventually might make an even sweeter bid.
   Minorco's shares rose 10 pence to 766 pence.
   Most analysts were surprised by the latest bid, having expected
Minorco to offer between 15 pounds and 16 pounds a share.
   By putting forward a bid on the low side, Minorco might be buying
time while it overcomes obstacles to the takeover, analysts said.
   Minorco's latest offer ``isn't the end of the game,'' said
Christopher Spreckley, a mining analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing and
Cruickshank. ``There might be another pound (per share) in it.''
   Minorco also might be hoping to force Consolidated Gold Fields to
disclose the price at which it values itself.
   This is a ``sighting shot,'' Consolidated Gold Fields' Agnew
said. ``They don't know what to pay and they want to get our
defenses open.''
   Based in Luxembourg, Minorco is 60 percent-owned by the
Oppenheimers' Anglo American Corp. gold mining giant and the diamond
mining group De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. It already owns 29.6
percent of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares.
   Part of Consolidated Gold Fields defense in the past five months
has been to raise objections to Minorco's South African connections.
   Sir Michael Edwardes, Minorco's chief executive, said, ``We have
now cleared all the U.K. and European regulatory hurdles put in
Minorco's way by the Gold Fields board.''
   ``Minorco believes that the owners of Gold Fields should now be
given the opportunity to consider the new offer on its merits and to
determine the issues which affect them as shareholders,'' he said.
   Minorco told the European Commission it would sell all
Consolidated Gold Fields' platinum interests should a takeover
succeed.
   Minorco also has said it intends to sell other minority stakes
held by Consolidated Gold Fields, including a 49-percent stake in
Newmont Mining Corp. of the United States, 48 percent in Renison
Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. of Australia, and 38 percent in Gold
Fields of South Africa Ltd.
   This would leave Minorco with Consolidated Gold Fields' ARC
construction materials businesses in Britain and the United States,
and with Gold Fields Mining Corp. in North America.

   The Association of European Airlines
said Tuesday it will study the costs and savings of a single air
traffic control system for Western Europe.
   The 21-airline group said such a consolidation might help reduce
delays and it called upon the European Economic Community for help.
   ``There is no other chance for leadership. Someone has to take
the lead,'' AEA Secretary General Karl-Heinz Neumeister told
reporters.
   He said 19 percent of all medium and long-haul flights in Europe
were delayed more than 15 minutes last year, up from 15 percent in
1987 and 12.5 percent in 1986.
   Neumeister said 70 percent of thosee delays are due to Europe's
fragmented air traffic control operations and 29 percent to airline
operations.
   He said the AEA will study the cost of creating and running a
single air traffic control network for Western Europe. He said he
hoped to have a first draft of the report in May.

   Two of the best known U.S. names in sporting
goods, Wilson and MacGregor, will be united under the ownership of a
Finnish international conglomerate.
   Wilson Sporting Goods Co. announced Monday that it agreed to be
acquired by Amer Group Ltd. of Finland for $200 million in cash.
   Amer, which is expanding its stake in U.S. sporting-goods
operations, already holds an 80 percent controlling interest in
MacGregor Golf Co., a Wilson competitor based in Albany, Ga. Golf
superstar Jack Nicklaus holds the remaining 20 percent.
   The transaction will be accomplished through a merger between a
wholly owned subsidiary of Amer and WSGC Holdings Inc., Wilson's
parent company. WSGC was bought in 1985 by Morristown, N.J.-based
Wesray Capital Corp. in a $147 million leveraged buyout.
   Wilson, based in the Chicago suburb of River Grove, manufactures
and distributes a wide variety of athletic equipment and apparel
under the Wilson brand name. Wilson estimated net sales for 1988 of
$425 million, a 24 percent gain over 1987.
   Amer, based in East Rutherford, N.J., had sales estimated at $1.3
billion in the the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.

   The stock market was mixed in early dealings
today as trading resumed after a three-day holiday weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.75 points
last week, was up another 1.43 at 2,326.25 after 30 minutes of
trading.
   But declining issues took an early lead over gainers among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 462 up, 532 down and 520
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.78 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   The U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of
the President's Day holiday.
   The stock market finished strongly last week with three
consecutive gains, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average by more
than 43 points.
   While some analysts say the market should extend those gains
these week, others say concerns that interest rates may be headed
higher could limit any price advance.
   On that score, traders eagerly awaited Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony today before the Senate Banking committee.
   In the credit markets before Greenspan's appearance, short-term
interest rates were little changed while long-term rates edged
slightly lower with the 30-year bond yields slipping toward 9
percent.
   In early trading, Texas Eastern jumped 3\ to 51}. On Monday, the
company agreed to a $53-a-share takeover bid from Panhandle Eastern.
   Also among the active issues today, Pacific Telesis slipped [ to
34[, Philadelphia Electric edged up [ to 20\ and Burlington

   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.39 to
2,324.82, stretching its gain for the week to 38.75 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the

   The number of working oil and gas rigs increased
this week by 20 to total 766 after plunging last week by 34, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported Tuesday.
   A year ago, the count totaled 978. Last week, the count was 746,
Baker Hughes reported Tuesday.
   Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said the count usually drops
off during late December through late March or early April.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among other major oil producing states, Louisiana and Texas rose
by seven each; Michigan, four; Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, three
each; New Mexico, two; and North Dakota, one.
   Colorado and Wyoming lost two each and Kansas dropped by one.
California and Ohio saw no change from last week.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Rail Workers Case from Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a federal law primarily designed to compensate injured
longshoremen also applies to railroad employees who work at dockside
coal-loading facilities.
   The court, in cases involving three injured workers in Virginia,
said it will hear arguments by railroads seeking to protect
themselves from potentially costly lawsuits.
   The Virginia Supreme Court ruled last year that the
Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act does not cover
the railroad employees.
   Instead, the state court allowed three injured rail workers to
seek potentially greater compensation under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act.
   The railroads said the compensation provided by the
longshoremen's act should be the exclusive remedy for the three rail
employees.
   The workers are Nancy J. Schwalb and William McGlone, who did
clean-up jobs for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co., and Robert J.
Goode Jr., a machinist for the Norfolk and Western Railway Co.
   All three worked at coal-loading terminals in the Hampton Roads,
Va., area.
   Ms. Schwalb suffered a serious head injury Jan. 11, 1983, when
she fell from a catwalk while going to a nearby area to pick up
spilled coal. McGlone's arm was nearly severed as he was picking up
coal from beneath a moving conveyor belt Feb. 1, 1983. Goode
suffered a hand injury while repairing loading equipment Feb. 11,
1985.
   The three sued the railroad company that employed them under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act.
   Lower courts in Virginia threw out their lawsuits on grounds that
the workers were doing jobs essential to the loading of coal at the
terminals, and thus were eligible for compensation only under the
longshoremen's act.
   But the state Supreme Court reinstated the suits, deciding the
rail employees' jobs were not covered by the longshoremen's act.
   Justice Department lawyers supported the railroads' ensuing
appeals to the nation's highest court.
   They said the three workers could get ``potentially lucrative,
albeit uncertain, relief'' under the employers' liability law.
   But government lawyers said in other cases restricting the scope
of the longshoremen's act could mean workers in similar jobs would
be forced to sue under state laws that provide less compensation for
the injured.
   ``That result would be plainly inconsistent with Congress'
intent'' in 1972, when it amended the longshoremen's law to expand
its coverage, the government lawyers said.
   The Association of American Railroads also urged the Supreme
Court to overrule the Virginia court.
   The association said its members employ some 300,000 workers who,
if injured, could sue them for compensation if the Virginia court
ruling were applied nationwide.
   The cases are Chesapeake and Ohio vs. Schwalb, 87-1979, and
Norfolk and Western vs. Goode, 88-127.

from $2.4 billion in 1987.
   Company officials attributed the increase largely to sales of

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a largely technical reversal
of Friday's strong rally in the soybean market.
   Precipitation in some key growing areas during the 3-day weekend
also weighed on prices, analysts said.
   Argentina, a major South American soybean producer, had its
heaviest showers in several weeks while snow and rain improved the
outlook for corn, soybean and winter-wheat production in the United
States.
   But the main factor in the decline appeared to be a bearish
backlash after Friday's runup, which was not supported by
significant changes in supplies or demand.
   ``When that happens, you often have some sort of reaction the
following day as equilibrium returns,'' said Walter Spilka, a
grain-market analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.22{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 2 cents lower with March at $2.68{ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.05{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents
to 10 cents lower with March at $7.40 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .70 cent higher with April at 77.62
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .78 cent higher with
March at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent to .82 cent
higher with April at 42.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.53 cent to .85 cent higher with February at 39.35 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled sharply higher on Friday while pork

<HEAD>Court Rejects Broker's Challenge Of SEC's Anti-Fraud Authority</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a prominent
stock broker's challenge to the power of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to crack down on fraud.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that Meyer
Blinder and the brokerage firm he founded, Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.,
say unfairly restrict their business activities.
   The case stems from a civil SEC enforcement action in 1980
against Blinder and his firm.
   Blinder began the business in Westbury, Long Island, N.Y., and
moved its headquarters to Denver in the late 1970s. It became one of
the nation's leading underwriters of penny stocks, or low-priced
securities.
   The commission accused Blinder and the firm of deceiving
investors in underwriting a $25 million sale of stock in American
Leisure Corp. The stock sale was intended to finance construction
and operation of a casino hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.
   U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch in Denver ruled in 1982 the
firm defrauded investors by withholding important information,
including the real risks of the casino venture.
   The judge said the firm's sales force ``practiced a program of
deliberately deceptive misinformation which (Meyer) Blinder
orchestrated.''
   Matsch issued an injunction permanently barring Blinder and his
firm from engaging in similar practices.
   Blinder went back to court in 1986 to have the injunction lifted.
He said he and the firm are rehabilitated, noting that he had
replaced his sales force since 1982 and had given millions of
dollars to charity.
   He also said the injunction was having dire, unforeseen
consequences on his business. He said about a dozen states have
taken steps to limit or ban Blinder, Robinson from selling
securities, and the SEC has imposed sanctions based on the court
order.
   Blinder challenged the constitutionality of the SEC's enforcement
powers in such cases. Blinder said it violates the separation of
powers to permit the commission to enforce the laws because the SEC
is only partly accountable to the president.
   Commission members are appointed by the president, with the
consent of the Senate, and may be removed from office by the
president for inefficiency, neglect of duty or misconduct.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August refused to
lift the injunction against the stock brokerage or its founder.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that evidence of
rehabilitation means the injunction no longer is needed to protect
the public. The appeals court also ruled that the SEC's powers do
not violate the Constitution.
   The case is Blinder, Robinson vs. SEC, 88-850.

<HEAD>Unisys Announces Minicomputers; Plans Employee Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. today announced three minicomputers
that are built around microprocessors from Intel Corp. and use the
industry-standard Unix operating system.
   The new computers are at the forefront of Unisys's efforts in the
field of network computing, which Paul Ely, president of the Network
Computing Group, described as ``by far the highest growth
opportunity in the industry.''
   The computers are known as the U 6000-30, U 6000-70 and U
6000-80. The U 6000-50 was announced last year. Members of the line
cost from $11,500 to $1 million and can serve up to 400 users at
once.
   Ely joined Unisys when it bought Convergent Inc. of San Jose,
Calif., in a $332 million transaction that was announced in August
and completed in December. He had been chairman and chief executive.
   Unisys has headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., and Detroit.
   The computer announcement came following last week's statement
that Unisys planned to reduce its workforce of 93,000 by 3 percent,
about 2,800 people this year through layoffs and retirements. The
company also plans to cut back on swollen inventories.
   Unisys's statement about job cuts was made in response to a
question at a security analysts' meeting on Thursday. Unisys
spokesman J. Peter Hynes said there was no formal announcement
because the cutbacks were in line with previous steps.
   Since Unisys was formed in 1986 through Burroughs Corp.'s $4.8
billion acquisition of Sperry Corp., it has pared 18,000 people from
its payroll by selling off operations and cut 12,000 more through
early retirements and layoffs, leaving it with 89,500 employees.
Last year's acquisition of Convergent added 3,500 to the rolls.
   Unisys Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal acknowledged last week that
1988 had been a tougher year than anticipated and he expected a
weakness in sales to continue in the first half of 1989.
   Sales in 1988 increased just 2 percent from 1987, to $9.9
billion. Although Unisys' profits rose about 18 percent in 1988,
most of the increase was attributable to lower tax rates, not bigger
profit margins. The company's operating profits slumped nearly
one-quarter on the final quarter of 1988.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole today
asked labor leaders for their help and guidance but said it was too
early to respond to the AFL-CIO's request for intervention in an
Eastern Airlines labor dispute.
   ``I want a continued dialogue with the individuals in that room
and certainly I want to have my door open and to be in touch with
them regularly,'' Mrs. Dole said after meeting with the AFL-CIO
Executive Council.
   In her statement to the council, Mrs. Dole said that ``to succeed
in this mission, let me say once again that I will need your help,
your guidance. We may not always agree on the best way to resolve
the issues before us. But I assure you today that my door will
always be open.''
   Some of those disagreements were immediately apparent, however.
   Mrs. Dole said the administration remains committed to a
sub-minimum youth training wage as part of any attempt to increase
the minimum wage. Labor leaders want the minimum wage raised but
vehemently oppose the training wage. And Mrs. Dole said President
Bush opposes mandatory child care and parental leave policies, both
items on labor's congressional agenda.
   The Executive Council on Monday opened its annual meeting by
asking Bush to appoint a presidential emergency board to mediate the
dispute between Eastern machinists and management. Such a move would
delay a strike planned for March 4 by 60 days.
   But Mrs. Dole said it was premature to say whether Bush would
appoint a board, saying he was awaiting a report from the National
Mediation Board and legal advice from the Labor and Transportation
departments.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland promised full support for the
Eastern machinists in the event of a strike.
   ``The AFL-CIO will mobilize its resources to assist the employees
at Eastern to the fullest possible support in the event the
machinists are forced to strike,'' Kirkland said.
   The call for Bush to intervene in the 16-month dispute before a
March 4 strike deadline dominated the first day of the council's
annual meeting.
   The federation's 35-member governing body also issued several
statements on its domestic policy agenda, including calls for an
increased minimum wage and legislation expanding the availability of
child care and parental leave.
   The Eastern dispute could provide the first sign of the
relationship the Bush administration will have with labor.
   Kirkland said Monday that the ``atmosphere'' of labor's relations
with the White House have improved since Bush took office, but added
that that could change if Bush rejects the machinists' request for a
presidential emergency board to mediate the dispute.
   Asked what his reaction would be if Bush refused to name an
emergency board, Kirkland, said, ``I think he would be sending a
signal that he sides with one of the most irresponsible and
avaricious employers in the country.''
   If Bush did name such a panel, it would automatically delay by 60
days the strike deadline. If no agreement was reached in that
period, the board would recommend a settlement. Congress has the
power to force both Eastern and the union to abide by it.
   Kirkland called on other unions to honor picket lines if the
machinists strike, but acknowledged that previous walkouts against
airlines have failed because union workers, particularly pilots,
have ignored pickets.
   However, Kirkland and other union leaders spoke optimistically of
the prospect of a unified union effort in the event of a strike,
saying unions that might otherwise have been reluctant to support
the machinists likely would do so because of the anti-union record
of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent company, Texas
Air Corp.
   Charles E. Bryan, president of the Miami district lodge of the
machinists' union, said his plans for a strike included picketing
and boycotting Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines, and
any other carriers that have service agreements with Eastern,
Continental or Texas Air.
   Those pickets also would include any carriers of cargo and
baggage either destined for or already carried by Eastern and
Continental, including railroads, Bryan said.
   He said there was no chance of a settlement before the March 4
deadline. Eastern has demanded that the machinists accept wage cuts
of 20 percent to nearly 50 percent as well was reductions in
company-paid pension benefits.
   Eastern officials have said the airline would hire replacements
and operate during any strike. Support from pilots would be vital to
labor's goal of preventing that.
   Ironically, many of the union leaders here for the meeting
traveled on Eastern, which offered the AFL-CIO a group discount.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
said inflationary pressures are unacceptable and that the central
bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest
rates.
   Greenspan's remarks could spell bad news for the Bush
administration, which is counting on robust economic growth to
reduce the federal budget deficit without the need to increase taxes.
   Greenspan released an economic forecast prepared by the central
bank which showed growth significantly lower than the Bush
administration's estimate.
   Greenspan's comments were made in testimony to the Senate Banking
Committee as part of the requirmeent that the central bank reveal
its economic assumptions and monetary policy targets twice a year.
   The central bank has been pushing interest rates higher in an
effort to restrain domestic demand since March of last year, an
effort which has sent a variety of short-term interest rates
climbing by about 3 percentage points.
   In his testimony, Greenspan discussed this effort and said the
central bank ``remains more inclined to act in the direction of
restraint'' on the supply of credit.
   For the past two years, consumer prices have increased 4.4
percent annually, a rate of increase which Greenspan said was
worrisome.
   ``The wage and price process may have developed some momentum,''
Greenspan said, citing reports showing that wage increases were
rising at a faster clip because of the tight labor markets.
   ``Let met stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an
increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce
inflation in coming years,'' he said. ``This restraint will involve
containing pressures on our productive resources and, thus, some
slowing in the underlying rate of growth'' of the overall economy.
   Since taking office, President Bush has on several occasions said
he believed the Fed's worries about inflation were misplaced, saying
he saw no need to push interest rates higher.
   However, the central bank has so far ignored those comments,
launching its latest credit-tightening effort just last week
following a report on prices at the wholesale level which showed an
unexpectedly sharp 1 percent increase in January.
   In his report to Congress, Greenspan said the Fed was predicting
the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
would expand by between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1989. The
administration, however, is basing its budget on a forecast which
expects growth to be a more robust 3.5 percent this year.
   To support its move to restrain inflationary pressures, Greenspan
said the central bank policy-makers reaffirmed a decision made last
summer to lower money growth targets for 1989. For M-2, the measure
of the money supply which includes currency in circulation and
interest-bearing checking accounts, the Fed said it would aim for an
increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent, down a full percentage
point from the 1988 growth target.
   Greenspan said he understood that moves toward tightening the
availability of money and driving up interest rates could have an
adverse impact on the savings and loan crisis, the Third World debt
situation and the debt problems of some American businesses.
   But he said that ``backing away from policy adjustments needed to
contain inflation'' would not solve the various problems and would
put the overall economy in more trouble.
   Most private economists believe the Fed has no choice but to keep
tightening credit in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures,
even at the risk of another downturn.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York,
said he believed the Fed has acted responsibly over the past year in
gradually pushing interest rates higher in response to indications
that excessive economic growth and tight labor markets were
threatening to set off another inflationary spiral.
   ``If you postpone the day of reckoning, it will still come and it
will be a lot harsher,'' he said. ``If inflation rises significantly
above levels where it is now, then interest rates would have to go
much higher and the negative effects would be that much greater.''
   That is what occurred in the last economic downturn in 1981-82
when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker pushed the prime
rate up to a high of 21.5 percent in a battle to control the worst
bout of inflation in this country since the Civil War.
   Volcker won the struggle but not without plunging the country
into the 1981-82 recession, the worst downturn since the Great
Depression.

<HEAD>Natwest Profit More Than Doubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's biggest
bank, reported Tuesday that its profit more than doubled in 1988.
   The company attributed the improvement to a sharply lower
loan-loss provision and narrower losses at its investment banking
unit.
   Natwest said its net income for the year came to $1.65 billion,
or $2.16 a share, compared with $755 million, or $1 a share, in 1987.
   Natwest added $86 million to its loan-loss provision in the
latest year, compared with $989 million in 1987.
   Natwest's investment banking unit, which is the holding company
for the County Natwest Investment Bank and its brokerage unit,
County Natwest Securities Ltd., posted a pre-tax loss of $99 million
in 1988, an improvement from a $204 million in 1987.
   Group Chief Executive Tom Frost said Natwest was ``poised for
further good progress and increased profitability.''
   The bank didn't break out quarterly or half-year results. It
isn't required to under British law.

   Stock prices slumped today amid worries about the
outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.75 points
last week, was off 5.36 at 2,319.46 at noontime.
   Declining issues led gainers by a margin of 2 to 1 among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 431 up, 879 down and 524
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 70.97 million shares at noon on
Wall Street, compared with 72.42 million shares at the same point
Friday.
   The U.S. financial markets reopened today for the first time in
three days after being closed on Monday in observance of the
President's Day holiday.
   The stock market finished strongly last week with three
consecutive gains, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average by more
than 43 points.
   While some analysts say the market should extend those gains this
week, others say concerns about interest rates could limit any price
advance.
   On that score, traders were closely following reports of Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony today before the Senate
Banking committee.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said Greenspan appeared to repeat earlier assertions that the
Fed would lean toward restraint to curb inflation.
   Wachtel said that after last week's gains, the stock market ``was
ready for a bit of a pullback. It is more a lack of buyers than an
abundance of sellers.''
   Texas Eastern led the list of most actively-traded issues on the
NYSE, jumping 3| to 52[. On Monday, the company agreed to a
$53-a-share takeover bid from Panhandle Eastern.
   Polaroid was off { at 43\. The company said it was beginning a
tender offer today of $50 a share for up to 22 percent of its stock

   Among other active issues today, Navistar was up [ at 6, Pacific
Telesis fell [ to 34[, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was off { at

   Panhandle Eastern Corp. began a cash tender offer
today for Texas Eastern Corp.'s outstanding stock after topping a
hostile bid for the Houston-based natural gas company by much larger
rival, Coastal Corp.
   Under the $3.2 billion deal, Panhandle plans to buy up to 80
percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding shares at $53
each, said Panhandle spokesman Jim Hart.
   Shares not purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for
Panhandle Eastern stock at the same $53 a share, Hart said.
   The agreement, subject to approval by federal regulators, was
accepted by the Texas Eastern board Monday afternoon, just hours
after the $3.2 billion offer was approved by Panhandle Eastern's
board of directors.
   The combination of the two Houston-based natural gas companies
would create a 27,000-mile pipeline system, the nation's
second-largest in total miles behind Enron Corp., also of Houston.
   Coastal Corp. spokesman Will Osterloh said his company would
study the Panhandle Eastern offer before deciding whether to
continue its $2.6 billion bid for Texas Eastern.
   ``We are going to consider our options, including possibly
raising our offer, dropping our bid or other courses of action open
to us,'' Osterloh said, adding that the company may have more to say
on the development later today.
   Texas Eastern's stock soared $4 a share to $52.50 in early New
York Stock Exchange trading today.
   ``In addition to the prospect of a significantly higher dividend,
it will enable Texas Eastern stockholders to participate in the
future of a combined operation that will be enhanced by the synergy
and efficiencies of the merger,'' said Dennis R. Hendrix, the
company's chairman and chief executive officer.
   The Panhandle Eastern bid came five weeks after Coastal offered
$2.6 billion, or $42 a share. That offer was rejected by Texas
Eastern officials who believed the company could fetch a higher
price.
   ``We expect the combination of the two companies to result in
significant operating synergies and appreciably enhanced operating
income of the combined companies starting in 1990,'' said Robert
Hunsucker, chairman, president and chief executive officer for
Panhandle Eastern.
   Panhandle Eastern has access to large mid-continent supplies of
natural gas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Gulf of Mexico, and
also operates a large liquefied natural gas facility in Lake
Charles, La.
   The company also has connections to Canadian gas through the
Northern Border Pipeline, Hart said, while Texas Eastern has access
to the rapidly growing New England natural gas market.
   ``The combined systems will provide access to almost all the
major gas processing markets in the nation,'' said Texas Eastern
spokesman Fred Wichlep.
   Texas Eastern officials said Monday they had talked to several
interested companies since Coastal's surprise takeover bid was
announced Jan. 16, but would not disclose the number or the
seriousness of other inquiries.
   However, Hendrix said, the Panhandle Eastern bid, which included
provisions for a share exchange, was by far the superior offer.
   ``The purchase price is approximately $650 million higher than
the Coastal Corp.'s tender offer, which our directors determined as
inadequate and advised our stockholders to reject,'' he said.
   Also on Monday, U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston
dissolved an injunction designed to prevent Texas Eastern from
deploying anti-takeover measures in other courts.
   Hughes said Coastal misrepresented facts when it said at the time
of a preliminary hearing on its requested injunction that it was not
involved in litigation elsewhere.
   Coastal issued a brief statement Monday which said the
dissolution of the injunction ``should not have any impact on
Coastal's court case because the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals had
stayed the injunction back on Jan. 29, 1989.''
   Wichlep, of Texas Eastern, said Hughes' action means ``we are
free to take any legal matters that may arise subsequently to the
Delaware court or any other court.''

   James. W. Near, Wendy's International Inc.
president and chief operating officer, has been appointed chief
executive officer of the fast-food restaurant chain, the company
announced Tuesday.
   Chairman Robert L. Barney, who had served as chief executive
officer, said Near has played a major role in the company's
improvement since 1986, when Wendy's lost $4.9 million. The company
reported profits of $28.5 million last year and $4.5 million in 1987.
   ``He's an outstanding operator whose attention is clearly focused
on the customer,'' Barney said. ``It is appropriate that he be given
more responsibility for the direction of this company.''
   The board of directors approved the appointment Monday.
   Near, 50, became Wendy's president an chief executive officer in
August 1986. He still serves in those positions.
   Near joined Wendy's in 1974 as a franchise owner, developing 40
restaurants in West Virginia and southern Florida. He sold them to
Wendy's in 1978.
   ``When Jim returned to Wendy's in 1986, the game plan was to help
him eventually become CEO,'' Barney said.
   Barney, 52, will remain chairman of the board and a member of the
executive committee. He was elected to Wendy's board when the
company was founded in 1969.
   Near was elected to Wendy's board of directors in 1981.
   ``As a former franchise owner, I know how corporate decisions can
affect the local operator,'' Near said. ``I want our franchisees to
provide their expertise to the corporate decsion-making process. One
of my goals is to have excellent operations consistently in every
Wendy's throughout the country.''
   There were 3,762 Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburger restaurants
worldwide at the end of last year.

<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Tuesday its net
earnings rose 8 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 1989
when compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Per-share
earnings were up 17 percent, the electronics giant said.
   Net earnings rose to $193 million, or 83 cents a share, from $179
million, or 71 cents per share, in the first quarter of last year.
Revenue rose 21 percent to $2.66 billion from $2.19 billion.
   Earnings from operations grew by 20 percent, but reductions in
interest income softened their impact in net results. The company
said its cash balance dropped from the year-ago quarter due to the
high level of stock repurchases during 1988.
   Orders climbed to $3.0 billion from $2.4 billion a year ago, with
U.S. orders rising 17 percent and international orders up 29 percent.
   ``We are pleased with the substantial increase in orders
throughout the quarter, and with the growth from the first quarter
of fiscal 1988, which was also an especially strong period for us,''
John A. Young, the company's president and chief executive, said in
a statement. ``The U.S. order growth rate also was good news.''
   Hewlett-Packard, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year,
has 87,000 employees and 1988 revenue of $9.8 billion.

   Stock prices drifted mostly lower this afternoon
amid worries about interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.75 points
last week, was up 0.18 at 2,325.00 with two hours left in the
session.
   But declining issues led gainers by a margin of 8 to 5 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 554 up, 845 down
and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 103.42 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   The U.S. financial markets were closed Monday in observance of
the President's Day holiday.
   The stock market finished strongly last week, as three
consecutive gains lifted the Dow Jones industrial average by more
than 43 points.
   While some analysts expect further gains this week, others say
concerns about interest rates could limit any price advance.
   On that score, traders closely followed reports of Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony today before the Senate
Banking committee.
   Greenspan said inflationary pressures are unacceptable and that
the central bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up
interest rates.
   But traders said the market viewed the comments largely as
restatements of positions Greenpsan had previoulsy expressed.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said that after last week's gains, the stock market ``was
ready for a bit of a pullback. It is more a lack of buyers than an
abundance of sellers.''
   Texas Eastern was among the most actively-traded issues on the
NYSE, jumping 3| to 52[. On Monday, the company agreed to a
$53-a-share takeover bid from Panhandle Eastern.

   The dollar ended mixed Tuesday in choppy European
trading, losing early gains when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan signaled no significant change in American monetary
policy. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said Greenspan did not say anything new or surprising in
his testimony to the U.S. Senate's banking committee but many
regarded his comments as less aggressively bullish than had been
expected.
   ``(U.S.) monetary policy remains unchanged,'' said a dealer in
Frankfurt, West Germany. ``It looks like further interest rate
increases are out of the question for the time being.''
   Greenspan called for financial restraints to prevent further
rises in inflation but said U.S. monetary policy ``appears to be on
track'' and that he expected the dollar to remain stable for some
months.
   The dollar had gained in Asian and early European dealings on
expectations that Greenspan would strongly emphasize the Fed's
commitment to fighting inflation, dealers said.
   ``Ultimately, the market actually wants to see higher (interest)
rates rather than just forecast that they will materialize,'' said a
senior dealer in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.40 Japanese yen to a closing 127.15
yen. Later, in London it eased to 126.75 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.8420 West German marks, down from 1.8435; 1.5685 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5683; 6.2735 French francs, down from 6.2825; 2.0910 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0820; 1,356.00 Italian lire, up from 1,350.50;
1.1897 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7565 from $1.7665 late
Monday.
   Gold prices rose in London to a late bid price of $384 a troy
ounce, up from $382.25 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to $383 from $382.20 bid late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $384.34 from
$384.01 Monday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a late bid price of $5.93 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Monday's late bid.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a late surge of buying
by commercial interests erased losses that prevailed for most of the
session.
   The buying may have reflected a desire of grain handlers and
processors to lock in their supply costs at current levels and avoid
a sudden runup in prices like the one that ended Friday's session.
   But analysts also said much of the day's activity was motivated
by technical traders' interpretations of recent chart patterns.
   The session opened on a low note after the 3-day weekend, with
much of the selling attributed to improved growing conditions for
the South American soybean crop and weekend precipitation in some
key U.S. crop regions.
   At the close, wheat was { cent lower to 2{ cents higher with

<HEAD>Comsat Earnings Rise In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications Satellite Corp. on Tuesday
reported a three-fold increase in fourth-quarter earnings, helping
the company to a 38 percent increase in earnings for all of 1988.
   Comsat provides communication services by satellite.
   ``Our results in 1988 proved that the decisive actions we took in
1987 to consolidate and redirect Comsat were the right ones,'' said
Irving Goldstein, chairman and chief executive officer. ``We expect
another strong performance in 1989 even though it may not be another
record year.''
   For the fourth quarter of 1988, net income was $12.4 million, or
66 cents per share, on revenues of $91.8 million. Earnings for the
fourth quarter of 1987 were $4.1 million, or 22 cents per share.
After adjusting for non-recurring items, net income from continuing
operations for the fourth quarter of 1987 would have been $6.5
million, or 36 cents per share.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $91.8 million from $82.2 million.
   For all of 1988, Comsat earnings were a record $61.9 million, in
comparison with a loss a year earlier of $47.3 million. Excluding a
loss from discontinued operations, the company had a $17.8 million
profit in 1987.
   Revenue for the year was nearly $359 million _ up 8 percent from
$334 million in 1987. Earnings per share for the year were $3.35.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Tougher Reviews Of Pension Denials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday told federal judges to toughen their
reviews of decisions by pension and welfare plans that deny benefits
to workers.
   Federal judges must evaluate the cases just as if the pension and
welfare plan officials had not yet made any decision, the justices
said in a unanimous ruling in a case involving Firestone Tire &amp;
Rubber Co.
   The justices said federal courts have been employing a less
stringent standard of review _ generally not disturbing decisions by
plan officials unless they are found to be ``arbitrary or
capricious.''
   The dispute stemmed from Firestone's sale of its plastics
division in 1980 to Occidental Petroleum Corp. Last year Japan's
Bridgestone Corp. paid $2.6 billion to acquire Firestone.
   In other cases involving business, the Supreme Court clarified
how federal copyright and patent laws apply to states, rejected an
appeal by mining companies in a hazardous-waste case, rejected a
challenge to the Securities and Exchange Commission's crackdown on
fraud, and limited the ability of people to seek additional damages
after winning a lawsuit.
   _The court refused to let states and state agencies be sued for
alleged violations of federal copyright law. It turned away a
Radford, Va., case that highlighted a conflict between the
Constitution's 11th Amendment shielding states from federal lawsuits
and copyright law requiring all suits be filed in federal court.
   Photographer Richard Anderson had sued Radford University, a
state-run school, and some school officials over the unauthorized
use in 1982 of copyright photographs.
   _The court unanimously ruled that states may not offer the
equivalent of patent protection for utilitarian and design ideas
left unprotected by federal law. The justices killed a lawsuit in
which a Florida boat manufacturer charged that its design for a
fiberglass recreational boat was duplicated illegally by a
competitor.
   The court said only Congress, and not individual states, can
decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design
ideas.
   _The justices rejected an appeal by mining companies seeking an
exemption from federal environmental rules for certain hazardous
wastes. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
Environmental Protection Agency must regulate the wastes.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that a 1980
federal law exempting some ``high volume, low hazard'' mining wastes
from environmental rules does not apply to certain types of waste
produced from smelting.
   _The high court rejected a prominent stockbroker's challenge to
the market-policing power of the SEC. The court, without comment,
left intact rulings contested by Meyer Blinder and the brokerage
firm he founded, Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.
   The case stems from a civil SEC enforcement action in 1980
against Blinder and his firm.
   _The justices, in a case involving alleged fraud in a 20-year-old
business merger, limited the ability of people to seek additional
damages after winning a lawsuit. The 9-0 ruling in a case from
Georgia restricts the ability of purported fraud victims to sue a
leading accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Whinney, which they accused of
preparing inflated financial statements.
   The case arose out of the 1969 merger of Cavalier Bag Co. and
E.T. Barwick Industries Inc. The owners of Cavalier Bag won a
lawsuit against officials of Barwick but lost their case against
Ernst &amp; Whinney. They were prohibited from appealing the loss to
Ernst &amp; Whinney while simultaneously seeking additional interest
payments from officials of Barwick.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Central Bank Will Pursue Fight Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday the central bank will keep up its inflation-fighting efforts
by pushing interest rates higher to combat what he termed a
troubling acceleration in price pressures.
   Greenspan, in his semiannual report to Congress on monetary
policy, said the Fed expects ``to support continued economic
expansion while putting in place conditions for a gradual easing in
the rate of inflation over time.''
   He added, however:
   ``Let me stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an
increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce
inflation in coming years.''
   Since last March, the Fed has been nudging up interest rates in
an attempt to slow economic growth and avoid a flare-up of
inflation. Those efforts intensified last week after a report on
prices at the wholesale level showed a 1 percent increase during the
month of January, equivalent to a compounded annual inflation rate
of 12.7 percent.
   Prices at the consumer level in 1988 increased by 4.4 percent,
the same pace as during the previous year and a rate that Greenspan
considers worrisome.
   ``With the economy running close to its potential, the risks seem
to be on the side of a further strengthening of prices pressures,''
the Fed chairman said. ``In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve
remains more inclined to act in the direction of restraint than
toward stimulus.''
   Greenspan said the Fed's always-challenging task of charting
monetary policy has been made more difficult by the unprecedented
combination of an aging economic recovery, financial failures in the
savings and loan industry, rising levels of corporate debt and the
large trade and budget deficits.
   ``We have never confronted a situation that is exactly comparable
to what we are in at this particular stage,'' he said.
   Greenspan said the problems are so large ``that it very
significantly skews policy toward reducing the budget deficit and
making certain that inflation does not accelerate.''
   ``It's clear to me that much of the problems that we are
confronted with could be assisted in an extremely positive way by a
very expeditious and significant cut in the deficit,'' he said. ``I
am not one of those who believes that the process of cutting the
deficit can be overdone.''
   Congressional leaders met with President Bush on Tuesday to
discuss budget and deficit-reduction plans, but legislators still
were hoping the administration would provide more details on where
it believes spending can be reduced.
   Greenspan said he remained optimistic that an agreement could be
reached.
   ``We cannot take the risk of not resolving it,'' he said. ``The
degree of risk of allowing this whole process to fester is
unacceptable.''
   Analysts said that while Greenspan's testimony before the Senate
Banking Committee demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the fight
against inflation, financial markets had hoped for something even
stronger.
   ``It's a matter of tone, but the markets would have preferred a
little more anti-inflation vigor,`` said economist David Wyss of
Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   Added economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Langston &amp; Co. in New
York, ``In view of the new and disturbing evidence on inflation, ...
the markets were expecting some even tougher talk from the Fed
chairman.''
   ``There's a general perception that maybe the Fed is falling a
bit behind the inflation curve,'' Jones said.
   Bush in recent weeks has voiced fear that the Fed would overreact
to concerns about inflation, saying he saw no need for the central
bank to push interest rates higher.
   The Fed has been pushing up short-term interest rates by a
behind-the-scenes process that siphons off available bank reserves.
This tightening of the money supply drives up the cost of that money
_ interest rates.
   But while the Fed nevertheless has continued to push up interest
rates, Greenspan in his testimony played down his differences with
the Bush administration, particularly on assumptions for future
economic growth.
   The Fed expects the economy, as measured by the gross national
product, to expand 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 1989. The
administration, meanwhile, forecasts growth of 3.5 percent this year
and is counting on short-term interest rates to gradually decline.
   The banking committee chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,
called the administration's rosy outlook ``startling'' and
questioned whether it was realistic, but Greenspan said the Bush
forecast was ``reasonable'' considering the administration's
deficit-reduction and budget plans.
   Greenspan also refused to criticize the administration's proposal
to reduce the capital gains tax as a way to stimulate investment and
generate more revenue.
   Greenspan said that the Treasury Department's revenue projections
are ``credible'' and that he would like to see the capital gains tax
rate lowered so long as the reduction is not accompanied by tax
increases elsewhere.

<BYLINE>Eastern Pilots Union's George: Flyboy With a Harvard MBA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo, the tough-as-nails chairman of
giant Texas Air Corp., has a master's degree in business
administration from Harvard University.
   So does Wright B. George, who flies planes for Eastern Airlines,
the besieged carrier owned by Texas Air.
   The two are on opposite sides of a bitter, escalating conflict
that could result in a March 4 strike by the airline's Machinists
union, which the Eastern pilots and flight attendants have pledged
to honor.
   George, a member of the master executive council of the pilots
union at Miami-based Eastern, is spreading the union gospel about
Eastern and Lorenzo to Wall Street analysts, creditors of the
strapped airline and the public.
   The campaign is aimed at forcing Lorenzo to sign what George
called acceptable contracts with the Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants at Eastern.
   George, 46, doesn't pull punches. He's going after his
cost-cutting boss with nearly the same fervor he showed flying
combat support missions as an Air Force captain in Vietnam.
   Lorenzo is ``looking at the abyss. The evil empire is
tottering,'' he said in a recent interview in New York. ``We
understand the risk (of striking). The worst thing that can happen
to us is that we lose our jobs.''
   That risk appears real. Many financial analysts and other
observers believe a strike against Eastern could jeopardize the
airline's survival.
   Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $335.4 million in
1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenue
dropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.
   The airline's latest contract offer _ rejected by the Machinists
_ calls for $150 million in wage cuts.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said no Eastern officials wished
to comment on George or his activities.
   George, Harvard Business School Class of `74, calls Lorenzo,
Class of `63, ``a financial genius but a business moron.''
   George has organized a presentation for Wall Street analysts and
Eastern creditors in New York on Wednesday _ the same day
intensified talks involving Eastern management, the Machinists and
federal mediators are set to start in Washington.
   Among other things, George said, the pilots and their financial
consultants plan to warn the airline's creditors of the risk to them
if Eastern is hit by a strike.
   George, who is a manager of the Eastern pilots' pension fund,
masterminded a session with analysts last September. He also was a
prime organizer of a demonstration against Lorenzo later that month
at the 25th reunion of Lorenzo's Harvard Business School class in
Cambridge, Mass. The Rev. Jesse Jackson Jr. was among the speakers
addressing the rally.
   How did an Eagle Scout and church altar boy from rural Illinois
arrive at center stage in the high-stakes conflict?
   ``I'm a pilot and I'm basically fighting for the profession,''
said George, who manages to look like a boxer, Ivy League banker and
farm boy. ``This profession is in a death struggle with Mr.
Lorenzo.''
   Sitting in the paneled mahogany caverns of the Harvard Club in
midtown Manhattan, he seems more culturally akin to the corporate
dealmakers he assails than the mechanics and baggage handlers he
supports.
   George grew up on a farm in Sycamore, Ill., studied mathematics
and economics at the University of Wisconsin, and later flew support
missions in Vietnam, evacuating casualties.
   After his Air Force service from 1967 to 1971, George attended
Harvard while starting to fly for Eastern, getting his MBA in 1974.
Wall Street was the next move, but he didn't stay there long.
   ``I had a brief but mediocre career,'' he said, referring to his
stint at Bankers Trust Co. ``I don't particularly like being tied to
a desk.''
   But George does like flying. He left the desks of Wall Street to
return to the cockpits of Eastern in 1974 and has been flying for
the carrier ever since. He's clocked around 10,000 hours of flight
time, he reckons, on domestic routes and in Latin America.
   His jabs at Lorenzo aren't all deadly serious. At the pilots'
meeting with financial analysts last September, George caught the
attention of the normally blase analysts and news reporters by
bouncing a striped beach ball during his opening remarks.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo agreed to cater the meal today,'' he told the
participants solemnly, as waiters proceeded to serve peanuts from
silver trays.

<HEAD>Most People Believe Takeover Process Is Corrupt, Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of people interviewed in a national
survey believe the corporate takeover process in this country is
corrupt and should be regulated by Congress.
   In the survey released Tuesday, 84 percent of the respondents
said they believed mergers and acquisitions take place in a corrupt
environment, and two-thirds said the government should place more
restrictions on leveraged buyouts. In a leveraged buyout, investors
buy a company with largely borrowed funds, and then pay off the
loans with the company's cash flow or by selling its assets.
   The survey, conducted for the National Law Journal and Lexis, a
computerized legal data base operated by the information firm Mead
Data Central, polled 808 people between Jan. 28 and 30. During that
time, two congressional committees were holding hearings into
possibly restricting LBOs.
   Public awareness of and concern about LBOs have increased in
recent months as a result of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s record
$24.53 buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   In the survey, which has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage
points, 32 percent of the respondents endorsed restructuring tax
laws to make it more difficult for LBOs to be accomplished, a step
that has received support in Congress and the Bush administration.
   Twenty-four percent of the respondents said consumers are hurt
the most by takeovers. Fifty-four percent said employees are hurt
the most, but one-third also said the gretest benefit of takeover
activity was the creation of new jobs.
   More than one-fifth of the respondents said they or a member of
their immediate family had worked for a company that was involved in
a takeover in the last three years. Of that group, almost 50 percent
reported negative consequences of the takeover, including the loss
of a job.

   Zenith Electronics Corp., the only domestic
television maker, reported the first annual profit in four years
Tuesday, attributing the performance to booming computer sales and
modest growth in its consumer electronics division.
   Some industry analysts said the $11.7 million in 1988 net income
could mark a turning point in the company's fortunes.
   But Chairman Jerry Pearlman said Zenith's management was
continuing to explore all avenues _ including selling all or part of
the consumer electronics business _ to keep the company profitable.
   ``We are mindful of our responsibilities to our shareholders to
increase the value of their investment in Zenith,'' Pearlman said in
a statement. ``We have not ruled anything out.''
   Zenith reported net income for the fourth quarter of $20.4
million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $4.7 million, or 18
cents a share for the last three months of 1987.
   Sales for the period totaled $841 million, a 23 percent increase
from fourth-quarter 1987 sales of $686 million.
   The results included a one-time gain of $6.4 million, which
represented a reduction in income taxes from operating losses that
were carried forward from the previous year.
   Zenith's full-year net income of $11.7 million, or 45 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of $19.1 million in 1987. Zenith
lost $10 million in 1986 and $7.7 million in 1985. In 1984, its last
profitable year, the company had net income of $63.6 million.
   Zenith's sales for all of 1988 totaled $2.7 billion, up 14
percent from 1987 sales of $2.4 billion.
   Sales of Zenith's highly regarded computer systems and components
climbed 23 percent in 1988 to nearly $1.6 billion while revenues
from the recovering consumer electronics division rose 2.7 percent
to $1.1 billion.
   Zenith had said in October that it expected to show a pretax
profit in 1988. But several industry analysts said they were
surprised the company did better than break even after taxes.
   ``I'm encouraged by the results,'' said Julian Menear, an analyst
with the New York investment firm Pershing &amp; Co. ``They've got some
difficulties ahead but this shows they are able to make money in
consumer electronics.''
   Charles Ryan of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York said the 1988
earnings signaled a ``major improvement'' in Zenith's TV and
video-equipment business. He predicted further gains for that
segment in 1989 as prices rise and more U.S. consumers opt for the
pricey large-screen and stereo TV sets that Zenith produces with
great efficiency.
   But James Magid of Needham &amp; Co. was less enthusiastic about
Zenith's future.
   ``There is no reason to suppose this is a major turning point,''
he said from New York.
   Zenith's TV business nosedived in the mid-1980s as a flood of
low-priced South Korean-made televisions reached U.S. markets,
joining the low-priced Japanese models already on shelves. Zenith
recently asked the Commerce Department to monitor imports for
illegal ``dumping'' of TV sets at unfairly low prices.
   Since 1985, the company has concentrated on increasing its
manufacturing efficiency through employee reductions and plant
consolidations.
   Those moves put the company in an ideal position to profit from
the increased demand for U.S.-made products that has resulted from
the dollar's plunge in value against foreign currencies.
   At the same time, Chinese demand for televisions has increased
dramatically with the opening of that country to foreign trade,
creating a worldwide shortage of picture tubes.
   Zenith has benefited from the tight-supply situation, which is
not expected to ease this year, and the company announced last week
it was hiring 600 people at its picture-tube plant in the Chicago
suburb of Melrose Park to increase production.
   The company also is working on a high-definition television
system that it hopes the government will select as the U.S. standard
for the new technology. That would bring Zenith lucrative patent
royalties.
   Despite these positive signs, analysts said Zenith still lags
behind foreign producers in sales of portable television with
screens measuring less than 19 inches diagonally, a market that
constitutes a large chunk of U.S. demand.

   Several independent oil producing countries said
Tuesday they would cut or freeze oil exports during the second
quarter to help OPEC support world oil prices.
   The non-OPEC group, after a daylong meeting in London, released a
statement saying more information was forthcoming but did not
disclose details of the agreement or say which countries would
participate.
   ``Specific announcements with respect to the above decisions will
be made by the respective authorities in the course of next week,''
the group said in a statement.
   Participating in the talks at the Mexican Embassy were Mexico,
Oman, Malaysia, Egypt, China, and Angola, the communique said. Also
attending were observers from the Soviet Union, Colombia, North
Yemen, Norway, Alaska and the Canadian province of Alberta, it said.
   Oil analysts said the agreement would help bolster oil prices in
the short-term. But they added that such cuts would have little
impact on the buoyant supply and weak demand in the oil market.
   There was little immediate reaction in the London oil market.
After the communique was released, the spot price of North Sea Brent
Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was $16.30 a
barrel, up 10 cents from late Monday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell by about
15 cents following the announcement.
   Analysts said the lack of details about the agreement pressured
the market.
   The agreement ``is fairly significant,'' said Philip Morgan, an
oil analyst with the London investment firm Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers. ``I think it means the extension of the oil producers'
cartel, even if the countries don't want to commit themselves to
OPEC at this stage.''
   It also was significant that the independent producers were
acting unilaterally, analysts said. They were doing so because the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has managed to curb
its production, they said.
   Last year, independent oil producers offered to cut their output
by 5 percent, if OPEC agreed to reciprocal cuts. OPEC refused.
   Some OPEC members have expressed resentment that independent
producers enjoy the benefits of the cartel's production limits
without making a contribution.
   OPEC's 13 members are estimated to be producing about 19.5
million barrels a day, one million barrels above their agreed
production limit but well below their fourth-quarter production.
OPEC has set a target price of $18 a barrel.
   ``The psychological impact (on the oil markets) will be quite
strong,'' Morgan said. But, ``I think the total volume of the cuts
makes little difference to the whole supply and demand question.''
   James Henderson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in
London, said, ``Basically, we see it as fairly positive for the oil
price short-term.
   ``Basically, it will help OPEC through the seasonal demand
downturn in the second quarter. We still see a dip in the oil price
but not as dramatically as it would have been.''
   Henderson predicted oil prices would fall to $14.50 to $15 a
barrel in March and April.
   The analyst said he expects the independent producers to cut
exports by between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day.
   ``A cut of 100,000 (cq) to 300,000 isn't going to have a dramatic
effect on the supply and demand balance,'' Henderson said.
   The communique also said some participants ``will go back to
their authorities for further consultations in order to determine
their contribution.''
   ``Further meetings of technical experts will be convened on a
regular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the market
situation as well as compliance with the agreement,'' the statement
said.
   The group set May 16 for the next meetig to ``address the
prospects of the second half of the year, a period viewed by the
experts with caution.''
   Individual delegates would not elaborate when they emerged from
the meeting.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover Says Trader Lost $14 Million In Unauthorized
Dealings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. said Tuesday a
vice president in its government bond trading department lost $14
million for the bank last year through unauthorized, secret dealings
in Canadian bonds.
   The bank refused to identify the individual but said the person
``has been relieved of his or her duties.''
   The bank said the loss, discovered earlier this month in a
routine review, caused it to reduce its reported profit for 1988 by
1.4 percent to $952 million, instead of $966 million as reported in
a January news release.
   ``The employee is not only very experienced but clever and
sophisticated,'' said John Stefans, a bank spokesman. He said the
person had been with Manufacturers Hanover about five years and in
the business about 20 years.
   The vice president, without authorization, bought about $600
million worth of Canadian federal and provincial bonds over at least
a year, mainly in the final weeks of 1988, Stefans said.
   To conceal the transactions, the person put them in the bank's
investment account instead of its trading account, Stefans said.
   Securities held in the investment account are carried on the
books at what they cost. When the securities were moved to the
trading account, where they belonged, they had to be booked at their
lower market value, resulting in the $14 million loss, Stefans said.
   Stefans said the bank had been in contact with the Federal
Reserve and the New York state Banking Department. He said it has
not yet been determined whether to lodge civil or criminal charges
against the executive.
   The bank has reviewed its procedures for preventing unauthorized
trading, Stefans said. But he added, ``A sophisticated enough
person, for a particular period of time, if intent on doing
something, can probably get away with it.''
   ``Everybody on the floor was surprised'' when word of the
unauthorized trading got out, said Bill Pike, who is in charge of
U.S. Treasury bond and municipal bond trading.
   In addition to the correction in full-year earnings, the bank cut
its reported earnings for the fourth quarter by $14 million, to $210
million from $224 million. The earnings did not have to be formally
restated because they had never been officially stated, only put out
in a press release, Stefans said.
   Losses from unauthorized trading in recent years have prompted
scrutiny of management controls at some Wall Street firms. The giant
investment firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. reorganized its mortgage
securities unit after unauthorized trading in a risky form of
security caused a $275 million pre-tax loss in April 1987.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Reports Of Zambian Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices posted their sharpest gains in three months
Tuesday as reports of flood-related mining disruptions in Zambia
refocused attention on the difficulties faced by many Third World
copper producers.
   On other markets, gold futures rose sharply; cotton futures
soared; livestock and meat futures rallied; grains and soybeans were
mixed; and energy futures were mostly lower.
   Copper futures settled 2.9 cents to 8.3 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in March at
$1.345 a pound, representing a one-day gain of nearly 6.6 percent in
the contract's value.
   The concerns raised by flooding at a Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines Ltd. facility spread well beyond the implications for copper
output from Zambia, the world's fourth-largest copper producer.
   The incident served to remind traders of the strain on copper
producers in Africa, Latin America and Asia as they strive to catch
up with the demand created by the strong economies of the
industrialized world.
   Copper production hurdles and labor difficulties have cropped up
during the past year in Peru and Chile while the major African
coppper countries have struggled with transportation problems.
   Those factors helped push copper futures prices to the record
high of $1.6475 reached on Dec. 8. But production concerns have
faded in recent weeks as copper stockpiles increased.
   ``A market is very much a forum for changes in sentiment,'' said
George Anagnos, a metals analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in New York. ``The flooding was important but it also focused
people's attention on broad output problems throughout the Third
World.''
   The London Metal Exchange on Monday reported a 1,750-metric-ton
decrease last week in its warehouse stocks of copper, to 85,025
metric tons. Anagnos said the market had been expecting an increase
of more than 5,000 metric tons.
   Gold futures advanced strongly on the Commodity Exchange
following Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee.
   Analysts said Greenspan was perceived as being too soft on
inflation. Gold is often seen as an investment hedge against
inflation.
   Gold settled $5.10 to $5.60 higher with April at $389.40 a troy
ounce; silver settled 0.5 cent lower to 0.1 cent higher with March
at $5.935 a troy ounce.
   Cotton futures rallied on reports that the Plains Cotton
Cooperative in Lubbock, Texas, had sold from 250,000 to 300,000
bales of cotton, an unusually large amount, to unknown destinations.
   Cotton settled .88 cent to 1.54 cents higher with March at 58.57
cents a pound.
   Feeder cattle led the livestock and meat futures markets higher
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to continued strong
demand among meat packers for fattened cattle.
   Live cattle settled .28 cent to .83 cent higher with April at
77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.35 cents
higher with March at 84.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent to
1 cent higher with April at 42.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with February at 39.32
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a late surge of buying by commercial interests
erased the losses that had held sway for most of the session.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2\ cents higher with March at $4.25 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.69}
a bushel; oats were { cent to 7\ cents higher with March at $2.13 a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at
$7.46{ a bushel.
   Energy futures prices finished mostly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in nervous trading while traders kept one eye on
a London meeting of oil ministers from non-OPEC countries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent lower to .03
cent higher with March at $18.59 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent
to .98 cent lower with March at 48.92 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to .94 cent lower with March at 48.35 cents a
gallon.

<TEXT>
   The price of Public Service Company of New
Hampshire common stock fell nearly 14 percent Tuesday, apparently
because a Barron's magazine article said the stock could become
worthless when the utility emerges from bankruptcy protection.
   The opening of New York Stock Exchange trading in Public Service
common stock was delayed 31 minutes Tuesday morning because there
were too many sell orders and not enough buyers.
   The stock then lost nearly 20 percent of its value by noon,
falling from its Friday closing price of $5.50 to $4.50 a share. The
stock made up a little ground in the afternoon, closing at $4.75.
   Melanie Hale, a utility analyst with McCarthy Crisanti Maffei
Inc. of New York, said the article in the new issue of Barron's
apparently prompted the fall. Public Service spokesman Nicholas
Ashooh said company officials had no other explanation.
   Headlined ``Common Mistake: A Bankrupt Utility Generates More
Speculative Heat Than Light,'' the article was written by William
Fry, president of Progressive United Corp. and general partner in
Meridian Strategic Investments L.P., two Indianapolis firms that
invest primarily in companies under bankruptcy protection.
   Fry noted that Public Service's common stock price has more than
doubled in the 13 months since it became the first major
investor-owned utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the Great
Depression. Debt from its 36 percent share of the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power project forced Public Service to seek bankruptcy
refuge.
   ``In large measure, the rise in the shares reflects investors'
faith that PSNH _ and its common (stock) _ will revive when the
company finally emerges from Chapter 11,'' Fry wrote.
   But at least for common stockholders, ``that faith isn't likely
to be rewarded,'' Fry wrote.
   ``Quite the contrary. Holders of the company's common
(stockholders) could find themselves with totally worthless paper
when PSNH comes out of Chapter 11'' of the federal bankruptcy code.
   That is because Public Service's liabilities exceed the market
value of its assets, Fry explained, and under bankruptcy law,
bondholders and other senior claims must be paid in full before
lesser claims may receive any compensation.
   Public Service ``has secured and unsecured obligations of nearly
$2 billion. It also has nearly $500 million of liquidating value of
preferred stock, which takes priority in a reorganization. Against
the obligations, the company has a conventional utility plant with a
book value of about $650 million, and its investment in Seabrook,''
Fry wrote.
   He noted that it remains uncertain whether Seabrook ever will be
allowed to operate commercially, and even if it does, Public Service
is unlikely to recover what it has invested in the reactor.
   Even an acquisition offer by Northeast Utilities of Connecticut,
estimated to be worth $2 billion if Seabrook operates, would leave
nothing for preferred stockholders, much less common stockholders,
Fry said.
   ``It's extremely speculative to think that common shareholders
will get anything at all in a reorganization,'' Fry concluded. ``So,
if you have an uncontrollable urge to speculate in PSNH, its bonds
appear to be a much more rational vehicle.''

   The Dow Jones industrial average posted a tiny
gain Tuesday but broader market measures slumped in what some
analysts said was a reflection of deepening worries about inflation
and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 38.75
points last week, eked out a gain of 1.61 points to close at
2,326.43.
   But declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
611 up, 872 down and 505 unchanged.
   ``The market seems to have lost its momentum, its gusto, the
urgency to buy coming off the lows of last November,'' said Edward
P. Nicoski, a market strategist for the investment firm Piper
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
   He said traders were becoming more concerned about inflation, a
concern that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledged in
an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.95 million
shares, down from 159.52 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 173.90 million shares.
   The U.S. financial markets reopened Tuesday for the first time in
three days after being closed on Monday in observance of the
President's Day holiday.
   The stock market had finished strongly last week, propelling the
Dow Jones industrial average up by more than 43 points in the last
three sessions alone.
   Traders closely monitored Greenspan's congressional testimony on
Tuesday, and some came away disappointed that he wasn't more
forceful in repeating an earlier pledge that the central bank would
continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest rates.
   Piper's Nicoski said Greenspan left open the possibility that the
Fed officials ``may not be able to tighten as much as they'd like''
because of the financial failures in the savings and loan industry.
   ``People are really starting to get concerned here about
inflation,'' Nicoski said.
   Few traders appeared ready to buy stocks in advance of
Wednesday's scheduled report on consumer prices in January. Earlier
this month, the government reported a bigger-than-expected rise in
producer prices in January.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the market may simply have been due for a correction.
   ``It is more a lack of buyers than an abundance of sellers,'' he
said.
   Sonat was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising ~ to 32 after
a pair of 2 million share blocks were traded.
   Texas Eastern was second most active on the NYSE, jumping 3~ to
52]. On Monday, the company agreed to a $53-a-share takeover bid
from Panhandle Eastern.
   Polaroid fell ] to 43]. The company said it was beginning a
tender offer of $50 a share for up to 22 percent of its stock in a
bid to fend off a hostile suitor.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 1 to 59 despite reporting its earnings per
share rose to 83 cents in its first quarter from 71 cents per share
a year earlier.
   Holly Corp. surged 9| to 35\ on the American Stock Exchange after
disclosing it had hired an investment adviser to consider the
possible sale of the company and other alternatives.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $7.148 billion, or 0.24
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.39 to 166.06.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.59 to 342.07, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index dropped 0.78 to 295.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
0.81 to 406.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 324.86, off 1.09.

   The dollar finished mixed Tuesday after Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to signal a dramatic
shift in U.S. monetary policy in testimony to Congress.
   Gold prices shot up. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $385.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up $5.25 an ounce
from Friday's late bid.
   U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Washington's
Birthday holiday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Fed chief's testimony to the
Senate banking committee on Tuesday offered no new insights into the
central bank's thinking and did not indicate additional interest
rate increases were imminent.
   In his testimony, Greenspan repeated the Fed's resolve to fight
inflation by pushing interest rates higher, a tactic the central
bank has been using in its battle to keep prices under control.
   Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston, said market
operators last week and on Monday in Europe and Asia had bought
dollars partly on the grounds that Greenspan might outline a more
aggressive anti-inflation policy. Holders who had accumulated large
dollar positions unloaded the currency after Greenspan delivered his
semiannual report to Congress on monetary policy.
   Although the dollar ended Tuesday above New York's closing levels
on Friday, it was sharply off its opening levels.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.40 Japanese yen to a closing 127.15
yen. Later in London, the dollar traded at 126.75 yen. In New York,
the dollar ended at 127.15 yen compared wotj 125.88 on Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7565 from $1.7665 late
Monday. Later in New York, sterling rose to $1.74725 from late
Friday's $1.7745.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8440 West German marks, up from 1.8375; 1.5690
Swiss francs, up from 1.5593 Swiss francs; 1.19225 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.1899 Canadian dollars; 6.2795 French francs up from 6.2575
French francs; and 1,351.00 Italian lire, down from 1,353.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8420 West German marks, down from 1.8435; 1.5685
Swiss francs, up from 1.5683; 6.2735 French francs, down from
6.2825; 2.0910 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0820; 1,356.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,350.50; and 1.1897 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold gained as investors took the opportunity to buy at prices
that had been pushed lower by recent selling by dealers in Australia
and the Soviet Union, said William O'Neill, a vice president of
Elders Futures Inc.
   ``There was a strong bout of dealer buying in New York which
seemed to result from demand for cash bullion,'' O'Neill said.
``It's the first real surge of this type this year.''
   Gold prices rose in London to a late bid of $384 a troy ounce, up
from $382.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $383 an ounce
from $382.20 bid late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $384.34 an
ounce from $384.01 on Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $385.90 a troy ounce from $380.80 an ounce Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a late bid of $5.93 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Monday's late bid. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.926 a troy ounce, down
slightly from $5.928 Friday.

<TEXT>
   Most oil futures prices ended lower in volatile
trading Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty over the outcome of a
non-OPEC producers conference.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 3
cents higher at $18.59 after trading as high as $18.93 during the
session. All other contract months fell.
   Refined product prices fell sharply. The March contract for
heating oil dropped 0.98 cent to settle at 48.92 cents a gallon,
after trading at a session high of 50.35 cents.
   Unleaded gasoline scheduled for March delivery fell 0.94 cent to
a closing price of 48.35 cents a gallon. Other contract months also
closed down.
   Crude prices opened higher with buyers caught up in last-day
trading on the March contract, analysts said. Prices fluctuated
throughout the session on various OPEC-related rumors, they said.
   Late in the day, a group of producers who don't belong to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in London,
released a statement saying some producers had agreed to either cut
or freeze exports during the second quarter of 1989 to help
stabilize world prices.
   However, the group said it would not disclose details of the
agreement until next week, which created uncertainty and pressured
prices, analysts said. ``It's disappointing because investors were
expecting concrete numbers,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president of
energy investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``As long as
they don't know it's difficult to say what the bottom line is ... so
the market sold off.''
   Analysts have predicted that any cutbacks by non-OPEC nations
will be minimal and probably will not alter the current
supply-demand balance. Since OPEC reduced its production by 3
million barrels daily at the start of the year, prices have risen
nearly $5 a barrel.

<HEAD>New Deadline Passes With No Word On Bids For Pepperell</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 6th graf with Farley extending offer to Thursday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest deadline for takeover bids on
West Point-Pepperell Inc. passed Tuesday with no word on whether the
textile company would extend the bidding or which suitors might have
submitted offers.
   ``We're still not commenting at all on the bidding process,''
said spokeswoman Toni Cauble.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting an unidentified person familiar
with the bidding, reported Tuesday that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. or a
subsidiary, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, had submitted a bid.
Pepperell officials declined comment on the report and Merrill
officials did not return telephone calls.
   Two other companies, Dominion Textile Inc. of Montreal and
Milliken &amp; Co. of Spartanburg, S.C., were rumored to be interested,
but both have declined to comment.
   Pepperell's directors put the textile and apparel company up for
sale Feb. 3 in response to a hostile takeover bid from Chicago-based
Farley Inc. They originally set a Feb. 15 deadline for bids, but
extended it until noon Tuesday.
   Farley's public offer of $52 per share, or $1.5 billion, was to
expire at midnight Tuesday, but the company said it had been
extended to Thursday.
   West Point-Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly held textile
company, makes sheets and towels under the Martex, Lady Pepperell
and Utica brands, as well as Arrow shirts. It has steadfastly fought
the bid by Farley, which controls underwear manufacturer Fruit of
the Loom Inc. and Acme Boot Co. Inc.
   Farley originally made its bid for the company last October,
offering $48 per share, or $1.4 billion, for Pepperell's outstanding
stock. The offer was increased to $52 per share on Feb. 1.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Partners last fall completed raising money
for a $1.5 billion buyout fund. In 1987, the Capital Partners unit
financed buyouts of Borg-Warner Corp. for $4.78 billion and
Supermarkets General Corp. for $2.07 billion, but last year the unit
completed just five purchases totaling $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp.'s Cadam Inc., branching out into
new territory, said Tuesday it was making its design software
available on workstations made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Apollo
Computer Inc.
   The step should help Cadam's sales while making it easier for
engineers to work together on designs even if they use different
models of computers, said Eric Keller, senior research analyst at
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
   Cadam Professional software is for designing objects ranging from
cars to printed circuit boards.
   Cadam said a feature called Power Link will make it easy for
designs that are developed on a Sun workstation to be moved to an
Apollo workstation, and vice versa.
   General Motors Corp. demanded that exchangeability in 1987 when
it authorized Cadam as one of its two suppliers of computer-aided
design software, along with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Eventually other computers, including International Business
Machines Corp.'s RT-PC, will be included in Power Link, Cadam said.
The RT-PC was the first workstation to run Cadam Professional. Cadam
also makes design software that runs on mainframes and personal
computers.

<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. announced Tuesday it no
longer will market its products through Businessland Inc. stores in
the wake of a dispute with the huge retail chain.
   ``It has become apparent to us that continuing our relationship
with Businessland is not in the best interest of Compaq or our
customers,'' said Michael S. Swavely, vice president of sales and
marketing for Houston-based Compaq.
   Businessland last year accounted for about 7 percent of the $2.1
billion in annual revenue for Compaq, a leading maker of desktop,
laptop and portable personsal computers.
   At the same time, sales of Compaq products accounted for about 15
percent of the $872 million in net sales during fiscal 1988 for
Businessland, which is based in San Jose, Calif.
   Swavely said Businessland had requested a business relationship
in which the companies would have been ``strategic partners.''
   Swavely said that would have required Compaq to give Businessland
company preferential treatment, Swavely said. Compaq hasn't given it
and Businessland has elected not to support Compaq, he said.
   ``Simply put, Businessland has repeatedly requested special
treatment that would give them an advantage over other authorized
dealers. Compaq remains committed to the philosophy that authorized
dealers should be treated fairly and equally,'' he said.
   Compaq spokesman Bob Beach said Businessland over time kept
asking ask Compaq for preferential treatment in terms of profit
margins, certain support systems and other areas. Beach said he
could not provide specifics.
   Compaq's announcement surprised Businessland officials.
Businessland issued a statement saying that it was in compliance
with Compaq's authorized dealer agreement and that Compaq's
notification was unforeseen.
   Suzanne Crocker, Businessland's vice president for marketing and
communications, said the retailer had asked Compaq to reimburse it
for some of the cost of giving technical support to buyers of Compaq
computers. She said Businessland has such arrangements with other
computer makers.
   Adding to tension between Compaq and Businessland, David A.
Norman, Businessland's chairman and chief executive, told securities
analysts two weeks ago that Businessland would put the bulk of its
technical support behind computers such as International Business
Machines Corp.'s Personal System-2 line that are built on Micro
Channel Architecture.
   That was a rebuff to Compaq, which is working with other IBM
rivals on an alternative to Micro Channel called Extended Industry
Standard Architecture.
   ``Micro Channel is the best solution for the future given what we
know today,'' Ms. Crocker said Tuesday.
   The agreement between Compaq and Businessland, which has been in
effect since 1983, will terminate effective April 21.
   ``I think on a short-term basis, Businessland will sell their
current inventory and that may have a short-term negative pricing
effect,'' on Compaq, said Richard W. Davis, ana analyst with Advest
Group Inc.
   But Businessland officials say they are confident the addition of
new vendors and continuing sales of other products will restore
revenue.
   Swavely said the company anticipates Compaq customers to move
their business to other dealers.
   Compaq informed Businessland of its decision Monday. Swavely said
several Compaq dealers have been de-authorized during the past six
years.
   ``The action is specific to this single dealer, and, as such,
does not indicate any change in Compaq's strategic commitment to its
other dealers,'' Swavely said.
   For 1988, Compaq had record sales of $2.1 billion, up from $1.2
billion in 1987. The company also had a record net income of $255
million for 1988, up from $136 million in 1987.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole on
Tuesday promised to work with labor and piqued the interest of union
leaders by calling for a flexible pension system, but she also
disagreed with them on several issues.
   The tone of the first meeting between the AFL-CIO Executive
Council and Mrs. Dole was amiable despite the differences, a stark
contrast with the first such session of the Reagan presidency, when
then-Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan and the union leaders clashed
publicly over the president's economic plans.
   There was no such acrimony after the meeting with Mrs. Dole,
although federation President Lane Kirkland said it was inevitable
that labor would disagree with the Bush administration on some
issues.
   ``I want continued dialogue with the individuals in that room and
certanly I want to leave my door open and be in touch with them,''
Mrs. Dole said after her private meeting with the 35-member council.
   While Mrs. Dole represented the Republican administration at the
meeting, new Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown also was in
Florida to address the AFL-CIO's political committee.
   Brown said he briefed the labor leaders on party efforts to gain
500 seats in state legislatures by 1990 and 100 more by 1992, an
effort to increase the number of state legislatures, 28, in which
Democrats control all chambers.
   ``Labor's got an extremely important role in the party,'' Brown
said after the meeting. ``Labor has important political tentacles
around the country, it can be very important in electing Democrats.''
   At a meeting with reporters, Mrs. Dole raised a proposal to allow
workers who change jobs to carry pension funds with them. She said
that the administration was studying the issue and that she asked
the labor leaders for their input.
   Kirkland said the federation welcomed her interest and would
cooperate.
   An early disagreement likely will be on congressional proposals
to raise the minimum wage. Mrs. Dole said Bush would support that if
the legislation also carried a sub-minimum training wage for youths;
Kirkland said the AFL-CIO opposes the lower wage.
   Other areas of apparent disagreement are child care and parental
leave, with the administration favoring voluntary policies that
might include tax credits. Labor backs Democrat-sponsored bills that
mandate some programs.
   ``We never signed on for a honeymoon,'' Kirkland said when asked
to assess labor's early relations with the Bush administration.
   ``It's early on and we have yet to see what issues or areas we
can cooperate on. I'm quite certain there will be some where we
disagree.''
   The meeting with Mrs. Dole came on the second day of the annual
weeklong meeting of the governing body of the 1.9 million-member
federation.

<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. began a $1.1 billion stock
buyback Tuesday and said the plan may include $325 million in
privately negotiated share purchases, a move some analysts said was
aimed at the company's hostile suitor.
   The instant camera maker, which announced Jan. 30 that it would
undertake the buyback, began a cash tender offer for 16 million
shares at $50 a share. In addition, Polaroid said it would
repurchase $325 million of its stock on the open market or ``in
privately negotiated purchases.''
   The offer of private negotiations was seen by some as an
invitation to Shamrock Holdings Inc. of Burbank, Calif., which holds
a 6.7 percent stake in Polaroid and is pursuing a $3.2 billion
hostile takeover of the company.
   ``They're leaving the door wide open for greenmail,'' said Alex
Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
``I can't think of any other privately held block of stock other
than Shamrock's that would be negotiated individually.''
   Greenmail is the practice of buying back shares held by a
corporate raider at a premium compared with the market price, in
order to thwart a potential or actual hostile bid. Critics say the
practice favors raiders at the expense of other stockholders.
   But some Wall Street analysts said Polaroid seemed to be making
an effort to placate its stockholders by offering a premium for some
of their shares.
   Polaroid's buyback offer of $50 a share is $5 over Shamrock's
last bid and $6.25 above Friday's closing price for Polaroid shares
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   On Tuesday, Polaroid stock fell 37{ cents to close at $43.37{ a
share.
   Charles K. Ryan, an analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets,
said the drop reflected anxiety about the possibility of greenmail.
   ``Polaroid's announcement is good for 30 percent of the stock and
bad for 70 percent,'' Ryan said. ``It does provide shareholder value
for some of the shares, but if they remove Shamrock by doing this,
the remaining shares could decline in value.''
   Shamrock called the buyback a further attempt at entrenchment by
Polaroid's management.
   ``We believe that Polaroid's partial buyback is a far leass
attractive alternative than Shamrock's $45 cash offer for all
Polaroid shares,'' Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold said in a
statement.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid and is
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the
May 9 annual meeting, in addition to its hostile tender offer.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock since the California company
made a friendly but unsolicited offer of $40 a share last July. In
September, Shamrock launched a hostile offer of $42 per share. Last
month, it boosted that offer to $45.
   Polaroid last July put 9.7 million shares into an employee stock
ownership plan. In January, the company announced a recapitalization
plan that included selling $300 million of preferred stock to
Corporate Partners L.P., a private investment group.
   Shamrock has filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court in an effort
to block Polaroid's buyback, the ESOP and the sale of stock to
Corporate Partners. Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   Polaroid said its stock repurchase offer expires March 20 and is
subject to various conditions, including definitive financing, an
absence of adverse decisions in lawsuits with Shamrock, and changes
in Shamrock's hostile bid. If more than 16 million shares are
tendered, Polaroid said it will buy shares back on a pro rata basis.

<HEAD>Troubled Toy Company Announces Plan To Sell To Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worlds of Wonder Inc. announced Tuesday it
reached a definitive agreement to sell the troubled toy company to a
group of New York investors for an undisclosed amount, subject to
bankruptcy court approval.
   If the deal signed Monday is approved, Worlds of Wonder will
emerge from its reorganization, the company said in a statement.
   The company began in a trailer in 1985 and saw sales climb to
$300 million within two years with such toys as Teddy Ruxpin, the
talking teddy bear, and Lazer Tag.
   But it reported large losses after it encountered production
problems and failed to develop new hit toys. The company filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in
December 1987 after it was sued by creditors seeking payment.
   Worlds of Wonder hopes to file the reorganization plan in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Oakland within the next few weeks and expects
confirmation hearings to be held in April or May, said the company's
general counsel, Anne Jordan.
   Once the plan is approved, a newly formed company headed by
investor Eli Jacobs would acquire Worlds of Wonder's assets for an
undisclosed amount of cash, notes and preferred stock and continue
to operate the company in Fremont under the same name, Jordan said.
   ``It allows the company to move forward with the plans for a
revitalized business, which we developed over the past year,''
Stephen J. Hopkins, WOW's chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement.
   In addition to Jacobs, the investment group includes Franklyn S.
Barry Jr., former president of Fisher-Price Toys, and David Edelman,
former president of Ingram Software.
   Proceeds from the sale would go to Worlds of Wonder's secured
creditors, Algemene Bank Nederland and First National Bank of
Chicago, lead bank for a group of five financial institutions, the
company said.
   The company repeated its earlier announcement that current
stockholders would not receive any money, and that their stock would
be canceled. The new company would then issue its own stock, Jordan
said.
   Worlds of Wonder announced late last year it was talking with
investors about a possible sale. The company has been negotiating
the agreement with Jacobs and the other investors for the past few
weeks, Jordan said.
   Just before it filed for Chapter 11 protection, Worlds of Wonder,
which designs, develops, markets and distributes toys, employed
about 500 people. About 120 people now work for the company.

<HEAD>Dole Says Too Soon For Bush Position On Eastern; Unions Plan for
Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said
Tuesday that President Bush needs more time to decide whether to
accept an AFL-CIO request that he intervene to block a threatened
strike at Eastern Airlines.
   The AFL-CIO, meanwhile, intensified its preparations for a
strike, asking its affiliated unions to assist the Machinists union
if it goes on strike against Eastern and to boycott its parent
company, Texas Air Corp.
   ``The stakes are high and the IAM deserves the most thorough
support we can provide,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a
letter to the unions.
   Outside Eastern headquarters in nearby Miami, hundreds of Eastern
workers held a noon-hour rally as a show of solidarity with
negotiators on their way to Washington, D.C., Tuesday night for an
intensive round of mediated contract talks.
   Speaking at the rally as if a strike were a certainty, Eastern
Machinists leader Charles Bryan promised, ``Anyone who gives
services or aid and comfort to providing staff or help to (Texas Air
owner) Frank Lorenzo in the strike pending here will suffer the
wrath of organized labor.''
   The 9,000 Eastern mechanics and ground workers are scheduled to
strike March 4, but that deadline would automatically be pushed back
60 days if Bush named an emergency board to mediate the 16-month
dispute.
   Mrs. Dole said Bush was awaiting advice from the departments of
Labor and Transportation and a recommendation from the National
Mediation Board on whether an emergency board was needed. The
mediation board is coordinating talks scheduled to resume Wednesday.
   ``Give the president the opportunity to look at all the data
first,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Eastern, which has asked the Machinists for $150 million a year
in wage and other concessions, has said it plans to operate in the
event of a strike. The union says the carrier has circulated memos
asking supervisors for a list of managers scheduled for work March
4, training records and parts in stock.
   The machinists are seeking raises totaling $50 million, which
means the two sides are $200 million apart.
   Labor leaders Monday promised to disrupt air travel and shipping
in the event of a strike by picketing Eastern, its sister carrier,
Continental Airlines, and any air or ground carriers that have
service agreements with Eastern.

<HEAD>Suit Claims Fairchild Unit Falsified Tests On Aircraft Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $200 million civil lawsuit against Fairchild
Industries' Voi-Shan unit accuses the defense contractor of
falsifying test results for nuts, bolts and rivets used in military
and commercial planes.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in May,
but it remains sealed while the government considers joining the
action, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
   Fairchild spokeswoman Deborah Tucker at the company's Chantilly,
Va., headquarters declined to comment on the suit.
   The news of the suit is the latest development in a controversy
over aircraft parts made by Voi-Shan. The Seattle Times reported
Sunday that the company is suspected of supplying substandard parts
to Boeing Co. that bear the approval stamp of a fictitious
quality-control inspector.
   Boeing said its own investigation turned up no problem with the
Voi-Shan parts.
   Fairchild said last week that there have been no claims from
customers that it shipped any unsafe fasteners. It said it was
conducting its own investigation into the allegations.
   The allegations prompted a criminal investigation, which included
a 48-hour search at the plant two weeks ago by federal authorities,
both newspapers reported.
   Tom Runion, a former lab technician at the Voi-Shan plant in
suburban Chatsworth, and two unidentified former employees filed the
suit under the False Claims Act, which allows plaintiffs to win a
part of any damages eventually awarded.
   The U.S. Justice Department may join such suits as a plaintiff if
it decides the allegations have merit.
   The suit alleges that Voi-Shan falsified the results of safety
tests on its fasteners, including tests to assess the parts'
durability under stress.
   The criminal investigation is being pursued jointly by the FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, Defense Department, the Navy and the Air
Force, the newspapers said.
   According to an affidavit filed by the FBI, the Federal Aviation
Administration has ordered Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. to
determine whether they used any fasteners for which tests are
questionable.
   The alleged falsifications took place because ``necessary testing
equipment was inoperative, the tests could not be accomplished in
the available time due to backlogs or because parts from a
particular lot failed a test, and it was decided by management to
approve the parts anyway,'' the affidavit alleged.
   The probe led the Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C., to announce
it is reconsidering its $230 million bid for Fairchild, the Times
said.

   SII was formed by Lennane in the 1970s. Lennane will be succeeded

<HEAD>Coleman Family SEC Filing Details Coleman Co. Acquisition Plan</HEAD>

   The Coleman family may sell off parts of
Coleman Co. if it succeeds in its more than $330 million attempt to
take over the camping equipment maker, according to a document filed
Tuesday.
   The document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
contained the clearest public statement of the family's intentions
to date.
   Some analysts have speculated the $64-per-share offer from family
members was intended to put the company on the auction block. Others
said the family appeared to be serious about retaining control and
may have made the offer as a defensive move to ward off other
takeover attempts.
   The acquisition was undertaken ``in order to better enable the
family and the company's management to focus attention on the
long-term interests of the company,'' the SEC filing said.
   The family proposed the leveraged buyout to the Coleman board on
Feb. 14.
   Selling some of the assets of the acquired company is a
relatively common method of repaying money borrowed for
debt-financed takeovers.
   Coleman Co. officials refused to comment on the SEC document.
   Coleman stock continued trading heavily on the New York Stock
Exchange, closing Tuesday at $70.62{, up 12{ cents. Average daily
trading normally is 20,700 shares; On Tuesday, 108,300 shares
changed hands.
   In its filing, the family said it reserves the right to take
other action if its proposal fails.
   ``I think what they're saying is they don't have a secondary
plan, but they reserve the right to do anything else they darn well
please,'' said Ron Wade, managing partner at the Kansas City, Mo.,
office of the Arthur Anderson and Co. accounting and consulting firm.

<HEAD>Deere Earnings Down</HEAD>

   Deere &amp; Co. reported earnings of $48.4
million Tuesday for the three months ended Jan. 31, a 28.3 percent
decline compared with the same period of 1988.
   Deere, however, said the profit of $67.5 million reported in the
1988 period was inflated by a one-time gain.
   Earnings per share for the nation's largest farm-machinery maker
declined to 65 cents for the three months ended Jan. 31, compared
with 99 cents per share in the comparable quarter last year.
   Net income for last year's first quarter benefited from a
one-time gain of $38 million from the adoption of new accounting
rules for income taxes and tax losses that were carried forward, the
company said.
   Worldwide net sales to dealers for this year's first quarter
totaled $1.14 billion, up 9 percent from the $1.04 billion reported
in the year-ago period.
   ``During January 1989, the company introduced to its agricultural
equipment dealers a major line of new combines, large tractors and
other equipment,'' said Deere Chairman Robert A. Hanson.
   ``The manufacturing startup of these new products resulted in
some production and shipping delays as well as excess manufacturing
costs which affected our North American operating results in the
first quarter,'' Hanson said.
   ``Shipments to our dealers ... were approximately $75 million
less than scheduled,'' he said. ``However, we expect to make up this
shortfall in the second quarter.''
   Retail sales for the period were relatively unchanged from
first-quarter 1988, the company said.
   Deere is optimistic abouts its prospects for this year.
   Hanson said farmers' income, which hit a record high last year,
was expected to be strong again in 1989. He said Deere also could
benefit from reductions in the U.S. grain surplus that had long
dampened commodities prices. ``Additionally, land values have
continued to increase, and the overall level of famers' indebtedness
has been reduced significantly,'' Hanson said.

<HEAD>Cox Sells Independent TV Station To St. Louis Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cox Enterprises Inc. said Tuesday it had agreed
to sell its independent television station here to a new St.
Louis-based communications company for an undisclosed price.
   The sale of KDNL, Channel 30, to Better Communications Inc.
hinges on approval by the Federal Communications Commission. KDNL is
affiliated with the Fox Network.
   Atlanta-based Cox also owns newspapers, other television stations
and radio stations.
   Stanley G. Mouse, president of Cox Broadcasting, a division of
Cox Enterprises, said KDNL had not fit the profile of its other
television stations.
   ``Other Cox television stations either are affiliated with the
networks of ABC, CBS and NBC _ or are top 10 market independents
with major news commitments,'' Mouse said.
   ``We're pleased to turn KDNL over to quality broadcasters who
will serve the St. Louis market well,'' he said. ``As for Cox, we
will continue to look for television stations that fit our
portfolio.''
   Better Communications was formed last fall by Barry Baker, former
vice president and director of Koplar Communications Inc. of St.
Louis, and Larry Marcus, former vice president of business affairs
for Koplar. Koplar owns KPLR-TV, St. Louis' Channel 11.
   ``KDNL is the perfect launch for Better Communications,'' Baker
said. ``We plan to grow a broadcasting company from our St. Louis
base, a city in which we have strong ties to both the business and
civic communities.''
