   A man angered by construction noise
on Tuesday opened fire on police, killing one officer and wounding
two others before he was caught, officials said.
   The suspect led authorities on a six-hour manhunt before he was
apprehended by a highway patrol helicopter, which plucked him from
the Wichita River, about 125 miles northwest of Dallas, said David
Wells, spokesman of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   Lt. Walter Tommy Collins, 52, died Tuesday night of cardiac
arrest shortly after undergoing surgery for bullet wounds at
Bethania Regional Hospital, said Sgt. Jim Bernethy, who heads the
homicide unit.
   Officer Steve Pruitt, 38, was in stable condition after
undergoing surgery for a shoulder wound, said Leslie Schaffner.
Officer Don Gossett, 35, who was shot in the leg, was treated and
released.
   The suspect, who has not been identified, was taken to Bethania
Regional and was to undergo surgery for a gunshot wound to the left
shoulder he apparently suffered in the exchange with police, said
Ms. Schaffner.
   The gunman fired a .30-caliber rifle when the officers arrived
at the suspect's trailer home about 11 a.m., officials said. The
confrontation began when the man complained about noise from a
construction crew working at a nearby vacant, six-unit building.
   ``When the first officer arrived on the scene, he tried to tell
the man to put the gun down and he was shot. Two other officers
responded. They also were shot,'' said Pat Yates, Wichita Falls
Police spokeswoman.
   Witness R.J. Logan said he saw the suspect and one officer stand
``toe-to-toe'' and exchange fire. Logan said the officer was hit in
the shoulder and the suspect was wounded in the side.
   Authorities could not immediately confirm Logan's report.
   Bernethy said the suspect could face a capital murder charge and
two attempted capital murder charges.

<HEAD>Commercial Sales Suspended</HEAD>

   The Energy Department said Tuesday it had
suspended shipments of tritium to commercial customers from the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee because of European customer
complaints of short weights.
   The department said headquarters staffers, Oak Ridge employees
and staff members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose
export licenses govern overseas shipments, are reviewing
measurement and loading operations at Oak Ridge.
   Tritium, a radioactive gas, is a major component of many nuclear
weapons, but it also has commercial, research and medical uses. An
atom of tritium is simply a hydrogen atom with two neutrons instead
of none.
   Tritium is used in luminous signs, such as aircraft exit signs,
and for runway markers in remote areas like Alaska. Half of any
original amount decays in 12.6 years.
   Annual commercial sales recently have averaged about 180 grams,
a little more than six ounces. The total amount of discrepancies
since mid-1987 is about five grams, about one-sixth of an ounce,
the department said.
   The department said it had no indication of risk to public
health.
   ``There were some pluses, but it was mostly minuses'' that were
complained about, said Department spokesman Phil Keif.
   The department's production of tritium is currently shut down
because of safety and management problems with the nuclear reactors
used to produce it at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.
   When the three reactors are running, they can produce about 11
kilograms of tritium per year, about 24 pounds, according to an
estimate by the ``Nuclear Weapons Databook'' published by an
environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council.

   Britain has enough evidence to prosecute three
suspected Nazi war criminals, a government inquiry said Monday, but
a decision was postponed until Parliament can debate the issue this
fall.
   The War Crimes Inquiry recommended British courts be given the
power to hear cases of murder and manlaughter committed as war
crimes in Germany or German-occupied territory during World War II.
   After examining 301 allegations against people living in
Britain, it said there was sufficient evidence to prosecute four
people, although one has since died and another is in poor health.
Another 78 cases warrant further investigation, and attempts should
be made to trace 46 others alleged to have fled to Britain after
the war, it said.
   In Scotland, a television program about alleged Nazi war
criminals living in Britain was cut off Monday night after lawyers
acting for one of the men named in the program obtained a court
injunction.
   The program was stopped after 45 minutes of the hour-long
documentary ``Crimes of War'' had been shown. Directors of Scottish
Television (STV) ordered the transmission be stopped because of the
court action.
   Glasgow-based STV is part of Britain's commercial Independent
Television network.
   ``Crimes of War'' was broadcast without interruption last year
by STV and then throughout Britain by the Channel 4 station. STV
says the program helped prompt the government inquiry that resulted
in Monday's report.
   The injunction was granted by Judge Lord Prosser to lawyers
acting for Antanas Gecas at a closed-door hearing in the Scottish
capital of Edinburgh.
   Gecas, a 72-year-old a retired engineer living in Edinburgh, has
filed suit against The Times of London over stories it has printed
about him. No date has been set for a hearing.
   Gecas denies allegations that he took part in the wartime
killings of thousands of Jews in Nazi concentration camps and has
said he only witnessed the slayingsa.
   An STV spokesman released a statement saying: ``On legal advice
we took the program off the air. As far as I know it is the first
time a TV program (in Britain) has ever been halted in transmission
as the result of legal action.''
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the House of Commons and the
unelected House of Lords will debate the War Crimes Inquiry report
this fall and ``in the light of views expressed, the government
will take a final decision.''
   He said there would be many practical problems in bringing
criminal prosecutions decades later, including the age and frailty
of witnesses, the difficulties of assembling evidence and of
testifying ``when witnesses' memories are more than 40 years old.''
   But, quoting the report, he said: ``The crimes committed are so
monstrous that they cannot be condoned .... To take no action would
taint the U.K. with the slur of being a haven for war criminals.''
   The inquiry was set up in February 1988 after the government
received a list of alleged war criminals said to be living in
Britain from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Los Angeles-based
Nazi hunters. It was conducted by two prominent retired law
officers, Sir Thomas Hetherington and William Chalmers.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, called
the inquiry's report ``an historic victory,'' but said the
government took ``the easy way out'' by not giving Parliament
specific proposals.
   ``The inquiry deals with allegations of horrific killings on a
very large scale, crimes which would constitute violations of the
internationally agreed laws and customs of war,'' Hurd said in the
House of Commons.
   ``The allegations are not about actions committed in the heat of
war. They concern individuals allegedly holding quite senior
positions in paramilitary units in territories occupied by German
forces, whose task was the systematic murder of civilians.''
   Hurd ruled out extradition of suspects for trial in the Soviet
Union where many of the atrocities took place. The inquiry visited
the Soviet Union to interview witnesses.
   Lawmaker Roy Hattersley of the opposition Labor Party welcomed
the report, but urged the government to follow the lead of other
countries, such as Canada and Australia, to allow the prosecution
of all war criminals, not just Nazis.
   Labor lawmaker Peter Archer said suspected war criminals might
now decide to ``disappear for the second time.''
   Hurd said no action would be taken to stop them from leaving
Britain, adding such curtailment of people's movements would be
``unacceptable'' and unfounded.
   Conservative lawmaker Toby Jessel said: ``Isn't the real point
the sheer number of murders? We're not talking of one murder, nor
six, nor 60, nor 600, nor 6,000, nor 60,000, nor 600,000, but 6
million murders, including the murder of about a million children?
What is wrong with the idea of a little bit of justice for that?''

   Police in three states waited to question
an auto mechanic about five killings while he appeared in court
Monday on a murder charge. New Mexico police said they arrested
another man who might be tied to the crimes.
   Ardmore District Attorney Fred Collins filed a first-degree
murder charge Sunday against Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola,
but said Monday he didn't want to discuss the charge until he had
heard from officers sent to Raton, N.M., to investigate the man
arrested there.
   Greg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, Kan., was charged Monday
in Raton with murder in the shooting death Sunday of a store clerk
in Springer, N.M.
   Authorities also were questioning him about the deaths of two
Kansas women. Those deaths are among those in which Greene is being
questioned, but there was no indication that the two men knew each
other.
   Greene was arrested Sunday in Lawton in the shooting death
Friday of a flower shop employee in Ardmore, about 95 miles south
of Oklahoma City.
   Greene's father said his son wasn't violent and had never liked
weapons, but had been drinking since his marriage broke up. A
former landlord said Greene had been ``ripping everybody off.''
   Authorities in Kansas, Texas and Indiana said after Greene's
arrest that they wanted to question him about slayings in their
states. Police in Pampa, Texas, where Greene's estranged wife
lives, charged him with capital murder in Thursday's shooting of a
photo shop operator.
   Kansas authorities wanted to talk to him about the slayings of
two convenience store clerks Wednesday in Garden City in western
Kansas. Two Indiana motel clerks were killed in March at
Merrillville and Remington.
   All the victims were shot in the head. The Indiana victims also
suffered other wounds.
   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of two
survivors of the shootings there identified Greene from photographs
as the man who wounded her and another woman and killed a third.
   Paul Renfrow, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
spokesman, said ballistics tests conducted on the bullets from the
Ardmore, Garden City and Pampa slayings showed the same .25-caliber
handgun was used in each case.
   A judge denied bond for Greene and set a preliminary hearing for
Sept. 28.
   The investigation took a new twist Monday when police in New
Mexico investigated the slaying of the Springer store clerk during
a robbery.
   Braun was arrested Sunday at a roadblock, driving a car with
Kansas license plates. He was arraigned Monday on an open charge of
murder in the woman's death and ordered held on $1 million bond.
   ``We expect to find evidence that is relevant to at least the
Kansas case, if not more,'' said Lesley Skinner, a deputy district
attorney in Colfax County, N.M.
   ``Right now we're not ruling anybody out,'' police Capt. Stan
Wojdylak of Garden City, Kan., said Monday after sending detectives
to New Mexico.
   ``I was asked last night if he (Greene) was a strong suspect. I
said yes he was. But now you're looking at a different set of
circumstances. We just have to see what happens when we talk to the
person in New Mexico. These are probably our two best leads,''
Wojdylak said.
   ``Just because we made an arrest doesn't mean we're not going to
continue ... following up on each and every lead we can,'' said
Pampa Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Hall.
   In an interview Sunday with The Daily Oklahoman, Greene's
father, Hank, said his son wasn't a criminal.
   ``He would give you the shirt off his back,'' Greene's father
told the newspaper. ``He's never even had a weapon in his house.
He's never liked them. He was always afraid the kids would get
ahold of them. He's never done no physica harm to anyone.''
   The elder Greene said his son started drinking heavily when his
wife filed for divorce recently. She has since moved to Pampa with
her parents.
   ``He loves his wife and kids very much. But when the split-up
happened, he told me he just lost it,'' Greene said.
   Greene has five children from two marriages.
   Greene had operated a car repair shop behind a service station
in Inola until June 30, when station owner Chester Flud said he
kicked Greene out. Inola is about 25 miles east of Tulsa.
   ``He wouldn't pay his bills and he was ripping everybody off and
I just got tired of it,'' Flud said Monday. Flud said Greene didn't
stand behind his work.
   Flud said Greene stayed around Inola for a few days and then
left town.

   A 20-year-old student pilot reported engine
failure and indicated she would make an emergency landing minutes
before her plane spiraled and crashed Monday, killing her.
   Cache County Sheriff's Deputy Dave Tarbet identified the victim
as Ann Marie Kowallis of Providence.
   He said Kowallis had taken off from the Logan-Cache Airport in a
Cessna 152 at about 10:45 a.m. and crashed about a half mile north
of the airport.
   The single-engine Cessa 152 was leased for flight training by
Logan Air Service, where Kowallis was taking instruction. She was
qualified for solo flight, Tarbet said.
   Shortly after Kowallis took off, she reported ``engine failure,
emergency landing,'' then radio contact was lost, said Logan Air
Service office manager Kena Nelson.
   The Federal Aviation Adminstration is investigating the accident.

<HEAD>Engineers Study Space Shuttle Valve Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The planned early August launch of
space shuttle Columbia on a secret defense mission is likely to be
delayed at least a day because of a problem with a fuel valve, NASA
officials report.
   Engineers were conducting tests today to determine if the valve
was stuck or if they were receiving a false reading because of some
other problem.
   At the same time, shuttle managers were beginning a two-day
review of the readiness of all aspects of the mission. They planned
to set a firm launch date on Wednesday.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off July 31 with a
classified Defense Department payload, but minor technical problems
have forced delays. NASA said last week that Aug. 7 would be the
earliest possible launch date.
   The valve problem was detected early Monday following the brief
launch pad test firing of all three of Columbia's auxiliary power
units. Radio data indicated one of two hydrazine fuel valves
leading to APU No. 2 was stuck open when it should have been closed.
   The APUs provide power for moveable control surfaces such as
wing flaps, the speed brake and the rudder.
   NASA at first said the faulty unit would be replaced, a
procedure that would delay the launch two or three days. But
officials said later they were not certain the valve was stuck open
and they wanted to run some checks to determine what was wrong.
   They said the tests will add a day to Columbia's launch
processing schedule.
   When an APU valve stuck open before last December's launch of
the shuttle Atlantis, the replacement and checkout of the new unit
cost the launch team three days.
   Officials said they might be able to do the job in two days this
time because of the experience gained then.
   When Columbia is launched, its five-man all-military crew is to
deploy a Pentagon payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.

   An Army officer and five Canadians
face charges in connection with North America's largest
confiscation of illicit steroids intended for human consumption,
the U.S. Customs Service said Monday.
   Clint Medford, 29, of El Paso, Texas, a captain stationed at the
Army's Fort Bliss base, was arrested Friday along with Tibor
Reiter, 47, of Weston, Canada, Customs agents announced. The
arrests occurred when agents seized a tractor-trailer truck in
Erlanger, Ky., that contained 25,790 units of steroids whose total
worth authorities estimated at $2.1 million.
   Reiter had been driving the truck and Medford was following
behind in a car when the two were arrested early Friday as the
shipment of vials and boxes was being delivered to undercover
agents, federal authorities said.
   The Customs Service retained custody of the drugs and truck.
Canadian authorities, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
worked with the Customs Service to develop the case in a four-month
undercover investigation that led customs agents to London,
Ontario, Canada.
   The two remained in federal custody Monday in northern Kentucky.
U.S. Magistrate J. Gregory Wehrman set a $45,000 bond for Reiter,
but allowed no bond for Medford because he faces an outstanding
warrant in Texas, federal authorities said.
   Customs agents said Medford and Reiter face U.S. charges of
smuggling. The charges carry maximum punishment of five years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Charged in Canada were Medford; Reiter; James Connolly, 39, of
Brampton, Ontario; and Ronald Sutherland, 43, Graeme McRae, 43, and
Albert Beraldo, 36, all of London, Ontario, U.S. Customs officials
said.
   Authorities said the Canadian charges involve either smuggling
or selling controlled drugs without a prescription.

   Thomas Root left the hospital ahead of
schedule Monday with questions still unanswered about his 800-mile
flight while apparently unconscious, a gunshot wound to his abdomen
and his personal dealings.
   ``He asked us not to give details about his plans,'' said Linda
Hamlin, spokeswoman for Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, where Root
was taken after the July 13 crash.
   Last Thursday, relatives said Root would stay at the hospital
another week to undergo more medical and psychological tests.
   ``We're not really giving specific information about the
tests,'' Ms. Hamlin said. ``He was well enough to leave, so he
left.''
   Root, a 36-year-old Washington, D.C., communications attorney,
said he blacked out about two hours after taking off from National
Airport for Rocky Mount, N.C., but he doesn't know why.
   He said a handgun kept in the plane's glove compartment
apparently discharged and shot him when he crashed in the Bahamas,
a story disputed by firearms and medical experts.
   Root also said he cannot explain photographic evidence collected
by the National Transportation Safety Board showing that he turned
his head and the plane's sun visor moved while he was supposedly
unconscious.
   An NTSB investigator said he was awaiting more information from
Root to continue the probe of the flight.
   The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office are also conducting
separate investigations of Root, but have declined to comment on
them.
   ``Root's leaving the hospital has nothing to do with our
investigation,'' said FBI spokesman Paul Miller in Miami. ``As far
as I know, he has not been charged with anything and he is free to
go wherever he wants.''
   Members of a Drug Enforcement Administration-led task force
collected information on Root after an April 24 seizure at his
airport hangar of a can of ether and about three dozen guns, all
but one legally registered.
   But no investigation was launched based on the facts gathered, a
task force spokesman said last week.

   Recent Japanese political turmoil that led to

resign:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1988:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   June 20 _ Japan agrees to U.S. demands that it eliminate quotas
over the next four years on imports of U.S. beef and oranges.
Agricultural groups, a traditional source of support for the
Liberal Democratic Party, warn the liberalization will hurt
Japanese farmers.
   June to November _ News reports disclose the names of about 160
prominent politicians, businessmen and government officials who
received discounted stock shares from Recruit Co., an information
and publishing conglomerate.
   Aug. 1 _ Questioning on the Recruit issue begins in Parliament,
delaying debate over a tax-reform package backed by the LDP that
includes an unpopular 3 percent sales tax.
   Nov. 17 _ The Liberal Democrats push tax reform package through
Parliament's lower house.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1989:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 24 _ Economic Planning Agency chief Ken Harada, who had
headed a parliamentary committee investigating the Recruit scandal,
becomes the third Cabinet member to resign because of Recruit ties.
   Feb. 11 _ A setback for the LDP in a parliamentary by-election
is attributed to public unhappiness over the scandal and the tax
package.
   Feb. 23 _ The government party candidate withdraws from a
gubernatorial race because of donations from Recruit.
   April 1 _ The 3 percent sales tax, levied on almost all
purchases, goes into effect.
   April 11 _ Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita tells Parliament he
received about $930,000 in political donations from Recruit.
   April 16 _ A poll by Kyodo News Service shows Takeshita's
support rating at 3.9 percent, an all-time low.
   April 25 _ Takeshita announces his resignation.
   April 26 _ A Takeshita aide commits suicide, apparently because
of his boss' resignation.
   April 28 _ The governing party rams the 1989 budget through the
lower house without opposition participation for the first time in
postwar history.
   May _ Takeshita's departure from office is delayed because the
LDP is unable to find a willing replacement untainted by the
Recruit scandal.
   May 27 _ Takeshita intervenes and selects Foreign Minister
Sousuke Uno.
   May 29 _ Prosecutors announce the end of their investigation
into the Recruit scandal, saying they will press charges against 17
businessmen, bureaucrats, aides to senior politicians and
legislators.
   June 2 _ Parliament confirms Uno as prime minister; he vows to
follow a policy of political reform to win back popularity for his
party.
   June 5 _ The magazine Sunday Mainichi publishes an article
alleging Uno kept a paid geisha mistress. The publication breaks a
taboo on such revelations about politicians' private lives, but the
harm to Uno comes only after foreign news media pick up the story
and Japanese media then give it greater attention.
   June 9 _ Uno is embarrassed in Parliament when an opposition
Socialist member questions him about the geisha allegation. He
declines to respond, fueling criticism from women's organizations.
   June 28 _ After more published allegations of extra-marital
affairs, news reports say Uno tells a party leadership meeting he
can't continue in office.
   July 2 _ The Liberal Democrats suffer a sharp setback in
elections for Tokyo's Metropolitan Assembly, while the Socialists
gain.
   July 7 _ Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hisao
Horinouchi angers Japanese women when he says they should avoid
politics and stay at home, and that Socialist Party Chairwoman
Takako Doi is unsuited to be prime minister because she is
unmarried.
   Sunday _ Voters give LDP a stinging electoral defeat, as the
party loses control in the upper house of Parliament for the first
time in 34 years.
   Monday _ Uno says he will resign. Again, there is no obvious
candidate among the Liberal Democrats to replace him, and he says
he will remain in office until a successor is found.

Party leader Takako Doi dropped Sakurai from the party's list of
candidates for parliament's upper house.
   Only a candidate for the governing Liberal Democrats would be so
unethical as to inconvenience others in the interests of
self-promotion, according to the Socialist campaign credo.
   Ten thousand people, including Ms. Doi, had been waiting for
Sakurai at a rally in Mishima and the super-express train he got on
was not scheduled to stop there.
   A man without a party, Sakurai decided to run as an independent,
though repenting by halting all campaigning for three days.
   The incident inspired editorials and columns in major newspapers
and the ``train-stopping candidate,'' as the media called Sakurai,
won more votes in Sunday's election than all eight other candidates
from Shizuoka prefecture, including the two incumbents.

<HEAD>Thirty East Germans Seek Refuge In West German Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty East Germans have sought
political asylum in the West German Embassy since early July and
scores have been caught in attempts to flee to the West, Hungarian
state radio reported.
   Since barriers were dismantled at the Hungarian-Austrian border
in early May, ten times as many would-be escapees have been caught
than in the whole of last year, a spokesman for the Hungarian
border guards told the radio.
   The Hungarian radio's English-language program on Monday did
not, however, give any figures.
   Hungarian authorities began dismantling border fortifications
after Communist Party officials described them as technically and
politically outdated.
   Hungarians have been allowed to travel freely to the West since
early 1988.
   The Hungarian broadcast quoted Walter Piesnitz, Bonn's state
secretary for domestic affairs, as calling on East Germans not to
try to flee to the West via Hungary and not to seek asylum at West
German embassies.
   Over the past weekend, 37 East Germans escaped across the
border, Austrian police said Monday. Since border fences were
removed, a total of 152 East Germans have reported to Austrian
authorities.

<HEAD>Thatcher Hints At Successor With New Foreign Secretary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has catapulted
the most junior member of her Cabinet, John Major, into the
prestigious office of foreign secretary, making him a prime
contender to succeed her.
   The appointment Monday of Major, the 46-year-old son of a
trapeze artist, was the boldest move in Mrs. Thatcher's biggest
government shake-up since she took office in 1979.
   Worried about her Conservative Party government's sliding
popularity, Mrs. Thatcher named new appointees to more than half
the 22 Cabinet posts, including defense.
   ``The object of this shuffle was to improve the cutting edge of
government,'' said Kenneth Baker, who was moved from education
secretary to become chairman of the Conservative Party.
   The previous chairman, Peter Brooke, who presided over the
party's drubbing by socialists in elections for the European
Parliament last month, was appointed to the Cabinet as Northern
Ireland secretary.
   The job in the strife-torn province is largely removed from
party politics on mainland Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher fired two key ministers: Transport Secretary Paul
Channon, accused of bumbling bomb warnings in the aftermath of the
Pan Am air disaster over Scotland last Dec. 21 and of a mediocre
performance during current transportation strikes, and Social
Security Secretary John Moore.
   Channon, an heir to the vast Guinness family brewing fortune and
reputedly the richest man in the Cabinet, is also accused by
critics of a lackluster performance during current strikes on
British Rail and the London subway.
   Two other Cabinet members, Defense Secretary George Younger and
Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young, said they were resigning
to resume business careers.
   Young was succeeded by Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King.
   Major, who was raised in south London's rundown Brixton district
and left school at 16, is one of the few British foreign
secretaries who has never been to college. A self-made man, Major
did construction work for two years before making a career in
banking.
   His appointment underlined the transformation of the
Conservative Party hierarchy _ once the preserve of the British
upper classes _ since Mrs. Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, took over.
   ``We now know, without the need for guesswork, who her chosen
successor will be,'' London's liberal Guardian newspaper said
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, is widely expected to retire some time after
bidding for an unprecedented fourth successive term in the next
election, which must be held by mid-1992.
   The previous foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, 62, was moved
to the vacant post of deputy prime minister in what was widely seen
as a demotion.
   Major and another relatively young appointee drafted into the
Cabinet for the first time, Christopher Patten, 45, the new
environment secretary, both entered Parliament in May 1979 _ the
election that brought Mrs. Thatcher to power.
   Major is a firm supporter of Mrs. Thatcher's tight-fisted
economic policies while Patten, a noted speech writer, comes from
the Conservatives' liberal wing. Their rapid promotion highlighted
a shuffle aimed mainly at improving the party's image.
   Major had been in the Cabinet as the relatively obscure chief
secretary to the treasury, the No. 2 financial post, for just over
two years before being appointed foreign secretary.
   He said he planned to concentrate on the European Economic
Community _ where Mrs. Thatcher's relations with other leaders are
often prickly.
   ``We are in Europe. I would like to see us take a lead in
Europe,'' Major said in a television interview.
   The opposition Labor Party, which since spring has held a strong
lead of between 7 and 14 points over the Conservatives in poll
ratings, dismissed the Thatcher shake-up as cosmetic.
   ``It is the policies that count and it is Mrs. Thatcher's policy
and she is not going to change,'' said Roy Hattersley, deputy
leader of the Labor Party.
   Mrs. Thatcher is beset by 8.3 percent inflation, among the
highest in an industrialized nation, renewed labor union militancy,
the unpopularity of plans to sell off the water and electricity
industries and the introduction of a controversial new property tax.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential rains and floods have claimed more
than 200 lives since the weekend, stranded tens of thousands of
people and washed away roads, dikes and crops, official newspapers
said today.
   Since the rains began two months ago, nearly 1,700 people have
died.
   In eastern Zhejiang province, which was hit by Typhoon Hope late
last week, more than 100 people have died, the China Daily said.
   Tens of thousands of people were stranded in the province's
central Yongkang County, where water rose to waist high and washed
away roads, dikes, dams and acres of crops, the paper said.
   In northeastern Jilin province, which has been hit by torrential
rains since Saturday, 63 people were killed and 15 missing in
floods and mudslides, the People's Daily said.
   The paper said railway service has been disrupted and more than
11,000 buildings destroyed in the province.
   China Daily said the death toll in Miyun county, outside
Beijing, has risen to 15. Heavy rains hit the Beijing area over the
weekend. The county registered 14.5 inches of rainfall within 12
hours on Saturday.
   In western China's normally arid provinces of Gansu and Qinghai,
rainstorms since Sunday have killed at least 20 people, the paper
said.
   Two typhoons, Gordon and Hope, have hit China's coasts recently.
Gordon killed 17 people and injured more than 100 when it hit
southern China's Guangdong and Guangxi provinces a week ago.
   Tuesday's reports said the remnants of Typhoon Hope were still
circling over Zhejiang province. It has killed 36 people in
neighboring Fujian province.
   In early June, torential rains killed 800 people in central
Sichuan province alone.

<HEAD>Painting Reported Stolen From Heathrow Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say they are investigating the reported
theft from London's Heathrow airport of a Paul Gaugin watercolor
owned by the Beadlestone Gallery of New York.
   The London newspaper the Daily Mail, said the painting, valued
at more than $1.9 million, was stolen from a cargo hangar.
   It said the watercolor, measuring nine inches by four inches, is
titled ``Tahitienne en Pareo Rouge'' _ Tahitian woman in a red
pareu.
   Gaugin, a Frenchman who was born in 1848, lived and painted in
Tahiti in the South Pacific from 1895 until his death in 1903.
   ``The matter is the subject of an inquiry by the Criminal
Investigation Department at Heathrow,'' Scotland Yard said in a
brief statement that gave few other details.
   The Daily Mail said the painting was one of four that arrived on
a British Airways flight from New York on June 21.
   It said the consignment remained in the British Airways cargo
hangar until the owners arrived to collect them five days later.
   It said each of the pictures was in a separate box but that only
one, containing the Gaugin painting, was missing. The other three
paintings were not identified.
   The paper said the theft was not reported to police until
Sunday. Neither the paper nor Scotland Yard gave any reason for the
gap between the discovery of the theft and the reporting of it to
police.

   Rap performer Chuck D. of Public Enemy says
rappers are king to some youths because they tell it like it is.
   ``You gotta understand, Public Enemy and rap music are
dispatchers of information,'' he said Sunday at the Indiana Black
Expo festival.
   ``We're almost like headline news,'' he said. ``Rap music is the
invisible TV station that black America never had.''
   Chuck D. told an Expo audience that the country's social
structure keeps blacks and whites apart, and rap music is shocking
the white community because rappers have become heroes to some
white children.
   Organizers of the Expo, though, said one reason for the session
was that rap music is causing controversy within the black
community.
   Prinses Hemphill of the Chicago-based Coast to Coast Concerts
said some investors are afraid of rap concerts because violence
marred several performances.
   Concerns also were voiced about violent rap lyrics and explicit
sexual imagery in rap videos. But several people said adults should
listen to the music to make their own judgments. And some said it's
hard not to listen.
   ``It's like you got no choice, because it's coming right into
your living room,'' said Parrish Smith of rap group EPMD.

   ``It's scary going into a show that's been going for 12 years.
It's kind of like I've been invited to a really big party where you

   In an unusual step, her name will appear in the main titles.
   ``You always need someone to stir up the pot,'' said executive

   Other newcomers to the long-running series: Sasha Mitchell as a

   Former tennis star Bjorn Borg is
finding his touch may not be as deft from the boardroom as from the
baseline.
   Borg said Monday he refused an offer of $4.6 million in capital
to rescue his struggling fashion business, which was built on an
estimated $75 million in earnings from his 10-year tennis career.
   Borg, 33, said he turned down the money to help Bjorn Borg
Design Group because it meant surrending financial control of his
companies. Borg said he was negotiating other financing to keep his
business afloat.
   His business produces a line of designer fashions, fragrances,
shoes and accessories, and has real estate interests in Sweden.
   Lars Skarke, who has a 25 percent stake in Borg's companies,
said the group is in dire need of cash to meet orders.
   Borg, the five-time Wimbledon champion who retired from
professional tennis in 1983, has boasted of his hands-on management
style.

   Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti
has gambling on his mind, and it's not all Pete Rose.
   South Carolina legislators have started a drive to get the
commissioner to clear the name of ``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson, who was
tainted by the ``Black Sox'' scandal 70 years ago.
   Jackson, a Greenville native, was among eight members of the
Chicago White Sox accused of throwing the 1919 World Series to
Cincinnati. They were banned from baseball for life.
   The state Senate approved a resolution asking Giamatti to
reinstate Jackson as a ``member in good standing in organized
baseball.''
   Sen. Ernest Passailaigue, who sponsored the resolution, recently
sent Giamatti a copy of it and promised to start a national
petition drive. Passailaigue said Jackson did not help throw the
1919 World Series.
   The commissioner's spokesman, Jim Small, said Monday that
Giamatti had received the resolution but was not prepared to
comment on it.
   Jackson, who died in 1951 at age 63, finished his 13-year career
with a .356 average, third highest in history. His plight has
surfaced in two recent movies _ ``Eight Men Out'' and ``Field of
Dreams.''
   Giamatti is currently investigating Rose, the Cincinnati Reds
manager, over allegations that Rose bet on baseball games.

   The author of a personal ad reading
``WANTED: LIVE FLIES suitable for human consumption. Call
Renfield,'' says the message has turned up plenty of people with
pests to spare.
   ``They want to know what makes them suitable for human
consumption, what container we want them in and how much we pay,''
said Ira Domser, drama instructor and director-producer of
``Dracula'' at Western Maryland College.
   In ``Dracula,'' an insane character named Renfield eats flies
and spiders, Domser said.
   Domser admits last week's advertisement in the Carroll County
Times was a publicity ploy. He says he isn't making the actor eat
insects to get into character.
   Still, he may come to regret his ad. The calls are tying up the
box office telephone, giving workers more than their fill of spider
and fly tidbits.

   Look out for the newest member of the Heu and

   The infant entered the world Monday on a busy bridge, blocking
traffic in the heart of downtown.
   The couple was driving to the hospital and ``she said the baby
was coming,'' firefighter Odell Minor said. ``She told him to pull
over and stop the car.''
   A passerby had heard the husband's shouts for help and called
authorities.
   When Minor and fellow emergency medical technician Doran Kemp
arrived, the car was parked at an angle on a bridge over the
Milwaukee River, and the baby was on the car seat.
   ``He was lying quietly and moving, face up. New life,'' Minor
said.
   ``We wrapped him in a little blanket and gave him to his mom so
she could see him.'' He said the boy, who was not immediately
named, and mother were doing fine.
   An ambulance took the two to St. Mary's Hospital, and the
traffic jam cleared.

   Thirteen-term U.S. Rep. John Conyers filed
petitions Monday to make him eligible to run for mayor against
incumbent Coleman Young, who is seeking an unprecedented fifth term.
   Conyers accused Young of arrogance several weeks ago but avoided
announcing his candidacy then.
   ``I'm asking myself if I'm doing the right thing,'' Conyers said
Monday. ``One is never sure about these great decisions.''
   Conyers, 60, a Democrat, filed his petitions with City Clerk
James Bradley. ``He has more than enough petitions to make him
eligible, and they're still bringing more in,'' said Amelie Allen,

   Candidates have until 4 p.m. Tuesday to become eligible to run
in the non-partisan Sept. 12 primary. Accountant Tom Barrow and
businessman Charles Costa also filed petitions Monday. Young, who
announced his candidacy last week, was expected to file his

<HEAD>Team Looks at How DC-10 Passengers Survived Crash</HEAD>

   Special investigators are trying to determine
how so many people walked away from last week's DC-10 crash in
Iowa, hoping to find ways for more people to survive airline
crashes.
   ``We want to know how injuries occurred, how people got out.
We'll try to get people to remember everything they can,'' Ted
Lopatkiewicz of the National Transportation Safety Board said
Monday.
   Members of the group, led by NTSB investigators, are
interviewing hospitalized passengers in Sioux City and will send
questionnaires to other survivors, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Officials say 185 passengers and crew members survived when
United Airlines Flight 232, en route from Denver to Philadelphia
via Chicago, crashed Wednesday while making an emergency landing in
Sioux City. The NTSB has not determined the cause of the crash, but
reports say an engine explosion apparently knocked out flight
steering mechanisms.
   Among issues to be studied by investigators is the fact that
several infants were traveling at no charge in their parents' arms,
a common practice on domestic flights, and whether child-restraint
seats should be required. United said at least one infant was among
the 111 dead.
   The team, Lopatkiewicz said, will try to determine what
precautions were most effective in preventing injury and death when
the disabled jetliner burst into flames during the emergency
landing, flipped over, landed on its back and split apart in a
cornfield near the airport.
   The survival investigation also will cover crash and fire
preparations on the ground, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Investigators have not determined how many passengers were
children or infants or how many children were among the dead,
Lopatkiewicz said. A list compiled by The Associated Press shows
that 24 children under age 10, including seven under 5, were among
the survivors.
   The NTSB recommended in 1983 that standards be adopted for
infant seats on airliners. In 1984, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration drew up standards for seats that can be used on
airliners and cars, but they are not required.
   The Association of Flight Attendants and some airline safety
groups have pushed for child-restraint seats on airliners. The
procedure for emergencies is to have children without seats wrapped
and padded and braced on the floor.
   If child-safety seats were required, infants who sit on laps and
fly at no charge would need their own seats, which could make
family travel more expensive.
   An unusually large number of children are flying on some
domestic routes this summer, in part because several airlines,
including United, offered free tickets to children flying with
adults on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Denies Friendship With Top Aide Gave Her Access</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House panel investigating
the federal housing scandal says he doesn't believe a former
housing employee who contends her friendship with a top agency
official brought her no favors.
   Washington attorney Lynda Murphy testified Monday that she was
not given special treatment by Deborah Gore Dean, a friend who was
the top aide to Samuel Pierce, secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration.
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., asked whether he believed her
testimony on that question, said, ``Of course not.''
   Ms. Murphy was one of two witnesses appearing as Lantos'
subcommittee on employment and housing investigated allegations of
mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at HUD during Pierce's
eight years as secretary.
   The other witness on Monday, Republican National Committeeman
William Taylor of Florida, defended his use of national party
stationery for letters in which he lobbied HUD officials for
clients.
   Ms. Murphy is a Washington attorney who since leaving HUD in
1982 has had extensive dealings with the agency. She was criticized
for hiring Ms. Dean as a consultant after Ms. Dean left the agency.
   ``I'm beginning to feel there is a quid pro quo,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   But asked whether it would be fair to say her close friendship
with Ms. Dean helped her receive access to internal HUD
information, Ms. Murphy angrily replied: ``I don't think that's a
fair characterization.''
   Ms. Murphy said she found nothing improper about her hiring Ms.
Dean. She also defended her action in reading a draft copy of a HUD
document that affected a client Ms. Murphy was representing before
the agency.
   Ms. Murphy said Ms. Dean asked a subordinate to show her the
document _ a letter being prepared for Pierce's signature.
   At the time, Ms. Murphy represented a client awaiting financing
from DRG Funding Corp., a major lender in HUD programs. In the
letter, Pierce criticized DRG but lifted a requirement that it get
advance HUD approval of loans. Ms. Murphy later went to work for
DRG.
   She said she was not surprised to be allowed access to the
internal document and said such ``give and take'' was common
between HUD and representatives of major companies doing business
with the agency.
   During Taylor's testimony, Lantos asked whether the GOP leader
agreed that he should not have used RNC stationery to correspond
with HUD officials.
   ``Obviously, I don't,'' Taylor said. ``I found nothing wrong
with letting people know who I am.''
   When Shays said the panel's goal was to rid Washington of such
influence-peddling, Taylor retorted, ``Good luck,'' and added: ``I
didn't invent it.''
   ``I wish you were a Democrat,'' said Shays, a Republican. ``I am
embarrassed ... You cashed in on your party.''
   Taylor said he earned several hundred thousand dollars lobbying
HUD for a variety of clients and also got a 10 percent stake in one
project, paying less than $100 for an investment he estimated is
worth more than $400,000.
   Taylor, former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said he
pleaded no contest and paid $5,000 in court costs to end a
conflict-of-interest case after he represented both the city of
Jacksonville and the private developer concerning the same HUD
project.
   Also Monday, the New York newspaper Newsday reported that
Washington HUD officials gave away two low-income housing projects
in Chicago for $1 each and allowed the projects to wind up in the
hands of real estate developers who then received federal rent
subsidies and tax credits worth millions of dollars.
   The paper said in its Long Island editions the decision was made
by former HUD officials Thomas Demery and R. Hunter Cushing over
the objections of HUD officials in Chicago. Cushing has declined to
testify before the House subcommittee, citing his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination.
   Also, it was disclosed that the Justice Department has decided
not to prosecute Demery in connection with his activities for a
charity whose donors included many developers who did business with
HUD.

   The government should pay for care for 1.6
million frail older Americans who live at home but need help with
such routine tasks as bathing and getting out of bed, a private
commission said today.
   The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone said older
Americans with severe physical or mental limitations _ most of them
women _ depend mainly on family or friends for help.
   That can ``exact a heavy financial, emotional and physical toll
on the care-givers, many of whom are themselves elderly, of modest
means and in poor health,'' the report said.
   Providing limited amounts of government-paid help may ``help
deter or delay nursing home placement by easing the burden on
care-givers and sustaining their ability to continue providing
assistance,'' it said.
   The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fund
philanthropic foundation, recommended that Medicare be expanded to
provide home care and adult day-care services for the most severely
impaired elderly.
   The expansion, which would cost an estimated $6.8 billion if it
were in place for 1989, would provide up to 25 hours of in-home
care per week, or two hours of adult day care could be substituted
for each hour of home assistance.
   ``These individuals, with the help of family and friends, are
struggling to stay at home,'' said Dr. Robert Butler, chairman of
the commission and the Department of Geriatrics and Adult
Development at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center. ``Without
help, the alternative is often a nursing home.''
   The report, ``Help at Home,'' comes as Congress looks for ways
to rein in rapidly rising costs for government health assistance to
the elderly and poor, and as advocacy groups push for a national
health care program to address needs such as financing for
long-term care.
   The commission said its proposal would represent only a modest
benefit expansion, yet could ``help to facilitate continued
independent living, and most significantly, improve the quality of
life for severely impaired elderly people who live alone.''
   Under the proposal, Medicare would pay 80 percent of the costs
for limited amounts of home care, with Medicaid picking up the
balance for poor older Americans.
   The commission, made up of experts on health policy and aging,
said more than 5 million of the 29 million elderly Americans who
live at home suffer from physical or mental limitations that
restrict their independence.
   The proposed home-care benefits would cover only the 1.6 million
older people with the greatest physical and mental disabilities,
300,000 of whom live alone and are in particular need of home care.
   Currently, 70 percent of those who would be covered by the
program rely solely on family and friends for help, with wives and
daughters giving more than half of the assistance.
   These informal care-givers often face challenges of their own _
35 percent are 65 or older, one-third are in fair or poor health
and one-third have income of less than 125 percent of the poverty
level, the study said.
   ``This is a story of poor women taking care of poor women,' said
Karen Davis, director of the commission and chairman of the
Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Hygiene and Public Health.
   ``The emotional and financial toll on these care-givers can be
enormous.''
   The home care these informal care-givers provide represents a
time-consuming and costly commitment, the study found. Eighty
percent of informal care-givers had been providing assistance seven
days a week for at least a year; 9 percent had to quit jobs because
of the competing time demands, 21 percent had reduced the number of
hours they work and 19 had taken time off without pay.

<HEAD>Budget Deficit Reduction on Track</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government remains on track to
post a reduction in the budget deficit in 1989 even though the
usual June surplus was smaller than a year ago.
   The Treasury Department said Monday that revenues last month
were up 9.2 percent from June 1988, to $108.32 billion, while
spending rose 11.6 percent, to $100.53 billion.
   That combined to produce a $7.79 billion surplus, down 14.7
percent from June 1988.
   June usually provides a break in the monthly flow of red ink
because corporations and individuals make quarterly tax payments in
the month. In May, the government reported a deficit of $25.47
billion after a record $40.57 billion surplus in April.
   Analysts attributed the smaller June surplus to a blip in
spending caused by calendar fluke. Military pay, veterans benefits
and health-care supplements usually are paid at the start of the
month. But because July 1 fell on a weekend, those payments were
shifted into June, cutting what would have been a larger surplus.
   Even though last month's surplus was smaller than last year, the
deficit for the first nine months of the fiscal year, which began
Oct. 1, was $105.5 billion, 11.6 percent lower than the first nine
months of fiscal 1988.
   If that pace continues through September, the deficit for all of
fiscal 1989 will be $137.2 billion, coming under the revised
estimates of both the Bush administration and the Congressional
Budget Office.
   The administration's Office of Management and Budget last week
cut its 1989 deficit estimate from $164.1 billion to $148.3 billion
because 1986 revisions to the tax laws are producing
higher-than-expected revenues.
   The CBO, meanwhile, predicts a deficit of $150 billion, down
from an earlier estimate of $159 billion.
   Both projections are in line with or a bit higher than those of
private economists. The deficit limit established for fiscal 1989
under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law is $136 billion.
   ``This year's deficit will probably come in the $145 billion to
$150 billion range,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston &amp; Co. Inc., a government securities dealer in New York.
   ``But, it wasn't due to an overly impressive deficit cutting
effort by either Congress or the administration but rather to the
windfalls of the Revenue Act of 1986.''
   However, economist Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. warned that the 1990 deficit could surge if the
economy topples into a recession as some analysts expect.
   A recession would cut tax revenues.
   ``I would bet Congress would turn around and start spending
again as they have in past recessions,'' Kahan said.
   The government's largest spending category last month was
interest payments on the national debt, the fastest growing
spending category. Interest in June totaled $37.62 billion and
reached $191.28 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal
year. That was up 13.1 percent from a year earlier.
   Other large spending categories were:
   _The military: $28.38 billion last month and $221.34 billion so
far this fiscal year, up 3.8 percent from a year ago.
   _Social Security: $22.64 billion in June and $170.16 billion so
far in fiscal 1989, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
   _Other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services:
$16.18 billion in June and $128.52 billion so far in fiscal 1989,
up 8.2 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Spending on Corn Price Supports Adding Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal spending on price support operations
to help corn farmers is adding up faster than Agriculture
Department analysts estimated six months ago.
   The increase stems from having more feed grains in U.S.
inventories than believed when the earlier spending projections
were drawn up.
   One of the effects was to reduce corn price projections from
their earlier level. That, in turn, raised the federal spending
forecast for price support and income benefits.
   Despite the upward creep in costs for feed grains, spending on
some other commodities is much less than had been forecast earlier.
The net result is that total outlays in the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1 are projected at less than $13.5 billion, about $360 million
below the level used last January.
   The revised figures were in a mid-session review report made
available Monday at the request of The Associated Press.
   Programs include payments to farmers for participating in annual
crop programs. In the case of major crops such as wheat, corn and
cotton, the programs provide price supports and other benefits in
return for taking land out of production.
   But some other commodities also are covered, including price
support operations for soybeans, peanuts, tobacco, honey, sugar,
dairy and wool.
   Outlays for corn and other feed grains in 1989 were indicated in
January at about $3.04 billion. The review bumped the estimate up
to $4.17 billion. At the same time, spending for wheat, rice and
upland cotton programs were reduced by more than $1.3 billion from
the January forecast.
   Allowing for adjustments in other programs administered by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp., total spending for the various
agricultural commodities were reduced a net of $86 million to less
than $7.03 billion for this fiscal year.
   Other CCC spending, including $3.75 billion for aid to farmers
who lost severely from the 1988 drought, put the fiscal 1989 total
to just under $13.5 billion, compared with the January estimate of
more than $13.8 billion.
   Looking at 1990, the report said total CCC spending could drop
to just over $11.3 billion, down $231 million from what was
projected in January.
   Scott Steele, USDA budget analyst, said the boost in feed grains
outlays from the level initially projected was a result of new
quarterly grain inventory figures in January, which showed more
feed grain on hand than had been indicated previously.
   It was this larger inventory that ``we did not take into account
when we did the budget'' published by the out-going Reagan
administration Jan. 9 and later adopted by President Bush's people,
he said.
   Steele said the Jan. 9 projections were based on USDA supply and
demand readings in November. The mid-session review took into
consideration the grain figures issued Jan. 13.
   The supply-and-demand report issued Jan. 13 showed U.S. crop
estimates for 1988-89 were larger than anticipated, with last
year's corn harvest put at 4.92 billion bushels, an increase of 250
million bushels from the November estimate.
   One immediate result of the larger supply was a
10-cent-per-bushel reduction in USDA's 1988-89 corn price forecast.
   Looking at the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the report
showed total CCC outlays at less than $11.4 billion, down about
$231 million from what had been projected in January.
   Spending on feed grains in 1989-90 was indicated at nearly $7.07
billion in 1989-90, up from the $5.56 billion projected in January.
Declines from the January projections were shown for wheat, rice
and cotton.
   Comparatively, total CCC spending both this year and next is
expected to be at the lowest level since 1984, when programs cost
less than $7.32 billion. Those ballooned to $17.7 billion in 1985
and to a record $25.8 billion in 1986 before beginning their
downtrend.
   One reason for the decline in annual costs has been the 1985
farm law, which enabled USDA to reduce price support levels and
``target price'' formulas for some of the major commodities.

<HEAD>Exercise May Help Improve Older Drivers' Skills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exercise, stress management and driver
education may help older people improve their road skills,
researchers say.
   Older drivers who participated in an experimental training
program had increased upper-body flexibility, felt less anxiety in
stressful driving situations and improved their roadway observation
habits, West Virginia University researchers said Monday.
   Kenard McPherson, director of the West Virginia Traffic Safety
Center and principal investigator for the study, said further
research could lead to a training program to ``keep older people on
the road as long as they can safely operate.''
   McPherson said additional work is needed to isolate the effects
of exercise on driver performance, but that the two-year study
carries ``encouraging implications'' about the beneficial effects
of combined training in exercise, stress-reduction and driver
education.
   ``The automobile has become a symbol, for both young and old, of
freedom, independence and opportunity,'' the study said.
   Drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in
traffic accidents and, when the number of miles driven is taken
into account, the two groups are almost equal, the study said.
   Older drivers' most common difficulties are in situations that
require visual skills or rapid judgments. Many of those problems,
according to the study, ``may stem from a general decline in the
physical fitness status of adults as they age.''
   The researchers said their findings were ``encouraging in that
the investigators were able to demonstrate that a closely
supervised and monitored exercise program at home can improve older
driver range-of-motion, reduce stress and improve these individual
observing driving skills.''
   The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, which financed the study,
said the findings offer ``new hope to older drivers that they can
minimize some physical effects of biological aging through exercise
programs.''
   Kenard said the drivers' improved observation habits resulted in
better scores for straight-line backing, parallel parking,
intersection scanning and checking to the sides when they wanted to
change positions on the roadway.
   However, their actual vehicle handling skills _ for example,
keeping a vehicle in its lane or stopping at the proper point _
didn't improve, he said.
   ``The flexibility and stress management programs were not
effective, for the most part, in improving the handling skills of
older drivers,'' the study said. ``However, these older drivers
improved on the skill of observing after participating in a visual
perception driver training program.''
   The study said the improved observation skills were ``rather
significant, given the importance of observing to driving tasks
such as parking, backing, changing lanes, driving straight and
driving through blind intersections.
   ``Furthermore, analyses ... indicate the skill of observing is
an important factor differentiating good vs. poor older drivers.''

   Congressional leaders and governors of seven
coastal states say they share a commitment to developing federal
and state laws that will protect coastal waters.
   ``We may not all agree on the specific measures to respond to
these problems, but we all share a common commitment to work
together to develop the best possible response to coastal pollution
problems,'' Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
said after Monday's conference.
   Calling the closed-door meeting ``an opportunity to develop a
working partnership,'' Mitchell defended the lack of specifics in
the agreement.
   ``We think it's very significant that we got started,'' Mitchell
said at a news conference.
   Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill agreed.
   ``What we're seeing here is a first,'' he said. ``This is a
cohesive movement forward.''
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer called the conference a
``historic meeting of governors and legislative leaders.''
   The governors and legislators signed a broad statement of
principles that ranged from regional research and monitoring
efforts to wetlands protections.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on the environment, conceded that
the agreement was not in itself that important, but said it was
significant that key governors and legislators were meeting to
discuss coastal problems.
   On financing, the Coastal Protection Agenda called only for
``creative ways to meet the funding needs of increased coastal
protection.'' But several Democrats said the Bush administration
had to come through with more money.
   ``We need more than a salute to a clean environment. We need
money,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate
environment water protection subcommittee.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the unsuccessful 1988
Democratic presidential nominee, said ``these are going to be very,
very expensive projects, all of them.''
   Other governors at the meeting were Edward DiPrete of Rhode
Island, Michael Castle of Delaware, Gerald Baliles of Virginia and
James Martin of North Carolina.

   Dealing a setback to the Bush administration's
clean air bill, the Senate majority leader says it needs major
surgery if the nation is to reduce auto pollution, toxic chemicals
and an acid rain component.
   Majority Leader George J. Mitchell made clear Monday he plans to
revamp the measure, telling reporters he has no intention of making
sponsorship of failed clean air legislation his ``life's work.''
   While Mitchell _ chief sponsor of clean air measures for a
decade _ was largely critical of the legislation, the powerful
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee gave Bush's
legislation a lukewarm endorsement.
   At the first congressional hearing on the legislation, Energy
and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., called the proposal
the ``best vehicle'' for breaking a decade-long clean air
stalemate. He lashed out at ``Detroit-bashing'' critics who believe
the bill is too soft on automakers.
   Dingell, while praising the overall pollution reduction he said
the bill would achieve, warned he has reservations about several
parts of the proposal and cautioned that the measure could ``have
devastating effects'' on the auto industry and its workers.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly,
at the same hearing, asked members of the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee to support the legislation.
   Reilly said the bill will ``make the 1990s the clean air
decade'' and insisted it will force industry to rid the skies of
pollution while taking into account the cost to business of
reducing acid rain, ozone smog and airborne toxic chemicals.
   He said the legislation also will give industry incentives to
cut pollution by giving business the flexibility to work out
alternatives and trade ``credits'' for achieving more cleanup than
required.
   However, Mitchell said Bush ``avoided virtually every tough
choice'' in his legislation and gave too much discretion to the EPA
administrator to enforce the law.
   Mitchell said language to let automakers meet new anti-pollution
requirements by averaging auto emissions represents a major retreat
from current law. Averaging would allow some cars to exceed new
anti-pollution standards while other vehicles would meet them with
room to spare.
   The averaging would cause confusion in emissions testing,
Mitchell said, because it would be nearly impossible to tell
whether a particular car should pass.
   Mitchell called the Bush bill ``especially weak'' on nitrogen
oxides, the second main ingredient of acid rain that harms lakes
and streams.
   ``Incredibly, the president proposes to permit increases in
(nitrogen oxide) emissions,'' Mitchell said, because Bush would
reduce nitrogen oxides by 2 million tons by the year 2000, while
emissions of the substance are expected to grow by 3 million tons
in the same period.
   The senator, however, praised Bush's plan to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by 2000, compared with 1980
levels. Sulfur dioxide is the major acid rain component.
   Mitchell said it was ``most disturbing'' that the cleanup of
toxic chemicals under Bush's plan would take into account the cost
to industry when protecting Americans' health.
   He attacked the so-called ``unreasonable risk'' health standard,
in which economists would perform a ``cost-benefit analysis
estimating how much a human life is worth and how many must be at
risk before additional control of toxic air pollutants is
warranted.''
   Dingell said he had several other reservations about the bill,
including:
   _Provisions that fail to give states credit for past reductions
of sulfur dioxide.
   _The failure to protect between 20,000 and 50,000 jobs in the
soft coal and related industries, which could result from new
requirements on utilities.
   _A cap on sulfur dioxide emissions after the year 2000, which he
said could ``tilt in favor of some fuel to the detriment of coal.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Hails Mexico Debt Accord; Others Skeptical</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration calls the new Mexican
debt relief package a breakthrough accord that will make it easier
to reach debt reduction plans for other Third World countries.
   But some members of Congress and private bankers remain
skeptical about how fast and how much debt relief will flow to
Mexico because of the arrangement.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who provided a final push
over the weekend to get a Mexican deal completed, hailed the
package Monday as a ``fantastic change in circumstances'' for the
poverty-stricken country.
   He said the proposal, if fully implemented, will cut Mexico's
annual interest payments by $1.5 billion, down about one-third from
the $5 billion to $5.4 billion the country is paying on its
commercial bank debt of $54 billion.
   In addition, Brady estimated that over four years, the amount of
Mexico's outstanding debt will be reduced by $10 billion to $12
billion from where it would have been without the agreement.
   In a briefing for reporters, Brady expressed hope that
agreements will be reached in coming months with other countries.
He specifically mentioned Venezuela, the Philippines and Costa Rica
as likely candidates.
   Those deals should move more swiftly because a lot of the ``pick
and shovel'' work was accomplished with the initial Mexican
transaction, he said.
   But Brady conceded that even with the Mexican plan, it could be
the end of the year before benefits begin flowing to the country.
That is because the relief will depend on individual decisions
being made by more than 500 commercial banks that hold Mexico's
loans.
   To keep the country economically afloat until then, Brady said
the United States and other major industrial countries are willing
to put up around $1.5 billion in short-term financing.
   Mexico was seen as a key test case for the administration's debt
reduction effort unveiled by Brady on March 10. The administration
has made debt reduction a key component of its foreign policy,
believing that the only way to ensure the survival of emerging
democracies, especially in Latin America, is to ease the crushing
$1.3 trillion Third World debt burden.
   In the case of Mexico, the debt reduction package provides banks
with three options:
   _Banks can cut 35 percent off the value of the current loans by
exchanging the old debt for bonds carrying guarantees that banks
will receive payment on the reduced debt. The guarantees would come
from the 151-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister
organization, the World Bank.
   _Banks can agree to cut interest rates to 6.25 percent, down
from about 10 percent, with the interest payments also guaranteed
by the IMF and World Bank.
   _Banks can agree to provide new loans. Until now, this has been
the only approach to the debt problem with banks simply agreeing to
funnel more money to a debtor country, funds that basically went to
pay interest payments on the old debt.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he is concerned that too many
banks will opt for simply supplying new loans and this will result
in a meager write-down of Mexico's old debt.
   ``A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks,
are going to stick with the familiar (approach of supplying) new
money to pay old debt,'' Schumer said.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the Mexican agreement does not
represent any ``long-lasting breakthrough in Mexico's debt
situation'' but he said it will help the country through its
immediate cash-flow problems.
   For their part, the commercial banks said it is too soon to say
how much debt relief they will give Mexico because they have not
yet had time to explore the full plan.
   ``At the moment, we're exploring our options,'' said Fraser
Seitel, a spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp. ``We're looking at
the entire (Third World) debt package.''

<HEAD>Drug Recalled Because of Misrepresented Samples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A generic medication used to control high
blood pressure is being recalled because samples were
misrepresented in a government inspection.
   Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., also is
suspending the sale of two other drugs pending an investigation.
   The action marks the second time this summer a drug company has
acknowledged marketing a formulation of a product that was
different from that approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   Par Pharmaceutical pulled its generic version of the
anti-hypertensive drug Maxzide off the market Monday after telling
the FDA that an employee switched a sample of the drug requested by
the FDA with a sample from another batch of the drug.
   The company also said it was investigating a possible
misrepresentation involving its generic Orphengasic Forte, a muscle
relaxant, and is considering an FDA request that it be recalled.
   Par has suspended sales of the generic muscle relaxant as well
as those of its generic Valproic Acid, an anti-convulsant, which is
being investigated.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, and Rep. Thomas Bliley,
R-Va., ranking Republican on the panel, said the disclosure shows
that FDA's generic drug regulation is ``dangerously lax.''
   ``The problem is we can no longer be reasonably confident that
the FDA is able to detect the entry of unsafe or inefficacious
generic drugs into the nation's pharmacies,'' said Dingell, whose
panel has been investigating the agency's generic drug division.
   Par said it had ``no reason to believe that there are any
adverse health or safety implications involved'' in any of the
three drugs it's reviewing, and has promised to cooperate with the
FDA.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the agency had no concerns about
safety of any of the three Par drugs, but ``we are looking into
whether the effectiveness of any of these medications was reduced.''
   Par and one of the company's founders, Ashok Patel, pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in Baltimore last week to paying
illegal gratuities to FDA employees.
   The charges are unrelated to the misrepresentation of the
company's triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, which is its generic
version of Maxzide, said Barbara Manners, Par vice president and
general counsel.
   Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., said last
month that its employees had substituted samples of FDA-approved
Dyazide for its own generic version of the drug to win government
approval for its product.
   Par said in a statement that ``certain product samples furnished
to an FDA inspector were intentionally drawn from a production
batch other than that represented to the inspector.''
   Par said it would convene a panel of outside consultants to
review the company's research and development activities and
record-keeping systems. The consultants will report to a special
committee of the company's board of directors, Par said.
   Additionally, Par said that ``because of the urgency of the
investigations of these matters'' it has postponed its annual
shareholders meeting, which had been scheduled for Friday.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the Iran-Contra scandal say the
CIA shouldn't invoke concerns over national security to block the
trial of one of the agency's former station chiefs.
   A federal appeals court judge granted the Justice Department's
request Monday to delay the trial of Joseph Fernandez, charged with
lying to investigators about his assistance to Oliver North's
Contra network.
   Fernandez says that to defend himself he must identify the
locations of three CIA stations and facilities in Latin America and
detail three of the agency's highly sensitive programs in Costa
Rica.
   The Justice Department, at the CIA's request, wants to prevent
the disclosures.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton, presiding over the case in
Alexandria, Va., rejected government proposals to substitute
numbers for the names of CIA stations and to abandon part of one
charge against Fernandez in exchange for dropping references to the
programs. Fernandez's trial was to have begun Monday.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will decide whether to
allow the Justice Department to formally intervene and whether to
reverse Hilton's rulings.
   The CIA is trying to ``protect a fictional secret'' by objecting
to the release of the classified information, independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh said in a letter to the Justice Department.
   The Fernandez case, he said, will not be able to be tried if the
department blocks disclosure of the names of CIA stations and the
three CIA Costa Rican programs.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act gives Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh the authority to file an affidavit in court
prohibiting the disclosure of classified information. If a judge
deems the material vital, the criminal charges can be dismissed.
   In going to the appeals court, the Justice Department was
avoiding filing the potentially case-killing affidavit.
   Fernandez faces two counts of obstruction and two counts of
making false statements in his responses to the CIA inspector
general's office and the Tower Commission in 1987.

<HEAD>Savannah River: September 1990 is Westinghouse Date</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins is unhappy that
the first of the government's three tritium-producing nuclear
reactors won't be restarted until September 1990, long after
expected.
   Department spokesman Phil Keif said Monday that Watkins has
written the civilian contractor, Westinghouse Corp., saying ``he
wasn't very happy'' about such a long period before production
resumes.
   The three reactors at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina
have been shut for more than a year because of safety and
management concerns. During the shutdown, the previous contractor,
Du Pont Corp., withdrew and the government hired Westinghouse.
   The reactors are the sole source of tritium, a short-lived
radioactive gas essential for many nuclear weapons. Because tritium
decays to inert helium, the tritium charge must be renewed from
time to time.
   Defense officials have said some weapons might have to be
cannibalized to keep other weapons in service if tritium production
isn't restarted soon.
   Asked if the September 1990 date was a surprise, Keif said, ``I
think so.''
   ``Westinghouse sent this back in its restart plan. The secretary
wrote back and said he wasn't very happy with that, and we'd have
to get together again'' to see what could be done, Keif said.
   Keif said he didn't know if any new problems were discovered at
the reactors that would require such a delay.
   When the reactors were shut down in spring 1988, officials
expected to restart at least one that summer. The date has been
pushed back several times since then.

<HEAD>Inspector General: Energy Department Surveys May Not be Reliable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $60 million examination of environmental
problems at the government's nuclear weapons plants may not be
reliable, the Energy Department's inspector general reports.
   Inspector General John C. Layton, whose staff examined about
half of the preliminary reports prepared by environmental survey
teams, concluded the reports lacked organized, detailed supporting
documents.
   The Energy Department disagreed, saying the documents criticized
by the inspector general weren't intended to be reference materials.
   The report published Monday said the surveys were backed up with
log books of personal notes too skimpy to jog the memories of the
note-takers.
   ``The notes were neither indexed nor organized in a way that
would allow anyone to trace facts or conclusions in the reports
back to the source,'' the inspector general's office wrote. ``Team
members acknowledged that it would be difficult and time-consuming
to locate information in the backup documents.''
   The notes ``generally were not recorded in complete sentences
and were not detailed enough to function as a memory aid even to
team members, who may be involved in hundreds of findings at dozens
of locations,'' the report said.
   The $60 million inventory began under the Reagan administration.
   In a memo to Energy Secretary James Watkins, the inspector
general said officials ``cannot be assured that the $60 million
effort provides a sound basis for prioritizing environmental
problems.''
   Layton said some contamination may not be adequately identified
and critical projects may end up in the wrong place on the cleanup
priority list and lose limited funding.
   The Energy Department, in its formal response to the report,
said the preliminary reports produced by the field staff were sent
to the various plants, where they ``were not found to be
deficient.''
   The department said the inspector general ``extrapolated beyond
what is reasonable.''
   Layton told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last week
the surveys were designed to identify environmental problems and
rank them according to priority, but the shortcomings ``undermine
the credibility of the process and call into question the
usefulness of the surveys.''
   The details of the report were withheld until Monday.

<DATELINE>WEST HOMESTEAD, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard hats are out and bathing suits
in at an old steel plant where a giant water park sits like an
oasis in an industrial wasteland.
   Built on the railroad yards of USX Corp.'s former Homestead
Works, the 20-acre park presents a bright new image for residents
accustomed to staring at fiery smokestacks, coal trains and mile
after mile of steel mills.
   The park, with 15 water slides, kiddie pool, sandy beach and
wooden boardwalk, is the most striking effort to revitalize the
hard-hit steel belt along the Monongahela River.
   ``Those of us who live around here can't believe it's such a
pretty place. You feel like you're far away when you're so close to
home,'' said Beverly Hess, 46, relaxing recently with friends under
a beach umbrella.
   ``You couldn't imagine it being picturesque down here because it
was such an eyesore. And to think our parents worked here,'' said
Mrs. Hess, who lives a few blocks from the park.
   Two years ago during an international conference on redesigning
urban areas, a group of planners led by Britain's Prince Charles
swarmed over the Monongahela Valley and came up with a variety of
ideas for revitalizing the area.
   Some ideas, like open-air markets, parks and marinas, seemed a
bit far-fetched to residents and more befitting sophisticated
cities than tough mill towns.
   But even the most imaginative proposals didn't envision a water
park on the banks of the once-polluted Monongahela, six miles
southeast of downtown Pittsburgh.
   ``It's an emotional shot of adrenalin. It's the first positive
thing that's happened in West Homestead since the mill closed''
three years ago, said Ann Hughes, media director for the park.
   The valley, which extends for about 30 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh, has largely missed out on the renaissance taking place
in the city and its suburbs. During the past century, its
one-industry towns grew up around the mammoth steel mills lining
the river, and when steel plummeted earlier in the decade, so did
the communities dependent on them.
   The water park shows little evidence of manufacturing. Tall
poplars and willows shadow a spidery network of slides, tugboats
churn the wide Monongahela and a dense, tree-covered hillside
dominates the opposite riverbank.
   But the fantasy ends with the view from the top of the
85-foot-high slide. Sprawling for miles outside the park walls are
the wreckage of aged industry _ dark, cavernous buildings of the
former Mesta Machine Co., slag-covered lots and long coal trains
headed to power plants.
   Over the past few years, local government and entrepreneurs have
begun developing some of the sites into industrial parks, high-tech
centers and now even water parks like Sandcastle.
   ``It's an image changer,'' said Joseph M. Hohman, director of
development for Allegheny County and co-chairman of the Mon Valley
Commission, which coordinates revitalization projects in the
valley. ``Sandcastle certainly has changed people's outlook of what
the future of the valley can be.''
   Kennywood Park, owner of Sandcastle and two amusement parks in
western Pennsylvania, spent $7 million to build the park, which
opened last week.
   The park employs 135 people, a pittance compared with the 15,000
who once toiled at the century-old Homestead Works and the 4,000
who labored at Mesta.
   Tom Croft, executive director of the Steel Valley Authority,
which is trying to rebuild industry in the valley, said ventures
like Sandcastle help diversify the economy. But jobs in recreation,
he said, are no match for those in manufacturing.
   ``If you're coming from the perspective that the area should
become a bedroom community of Pittsburgh, then you might draw the
conclusion that we could make these 25 miles of riverfront into
parks,'' he said.
   ``If you have families to raise or if you are a borough official
of one of these towns in bankruptcy, though, then you ... need to
replace some of the thousands of jobs that have been lost with as
many family-wage jobs as possible.''

<HEAD>Japan Seeks to Minimize Foreign Impact of Election Shift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today sought to minimize the impact
of its political troubles on foreign relations with assurances that
planned diplomatic contacts will go ahead, including the defense
chief's visit to Washington.
   But some analysts warned of trouble in foreign economic affairs
and said the growing influence of opposition parties could make
Japan's trade policy more protectionist.
   The governing Liberal Democrats' hard loss in parliamentary
elections, followed by Prime Minister Sousuke Uno decision to
resign after less than two months in office, could seriously erode
the party's ability to set policy.
   Uno's decision Monday means his Cabinet also will resign, but
not until the Liberal Democrats find a new leader, which is
expected to take several weeks as no obvious candidate was in sight.
   At a Cabinet meeting this morning, Uno said Japan holds an
important position in global affairs and ``continuity should be
maintained to the maximum extent,'' a Foreign Ministry official
said.
   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will travel to Paris this
weekend for international talks on the Cambodia issue, and Defense
Agency chief Taku Yamasaki will go ahead with a scheduled trip to
Washington in early August, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Sunday's election cost the Liberal Democrats their majority in
parliament's upper house _ the first time in the party's 34 years
that it lost control of a legislative chamber _ and gave a strong
boost to the opposition Socialist Party.
   The Socialists are more protectionist on trade issues than the
Liberal Democrats and oppose the security treaty under which some
64,000 U.S. troops are based in Japan.
   Yamasaki said the Liberal Democrats' ``security policy will be
unshakable'' and he warned that the opposition would change defense
policy if it came to power. ``In that respect, we will maintain
political power with a sense of great responsibility,'' Yamasaki
told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.
   The Defense Agency chief leaves for Washington Aug. 7 for a
weeklong visit that includes talks with Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney on such matters as the two countries' joint development of a
new jet fighter for Japan called the FSX.
   U.S. critics of the FSX deal have called it a giveaway of U.S.
technology, but Yamasaki says it is a defense matter rather than an
economic issue.
   Both the Liberal Democrats and the opposition were holding
separate meetings today to chart their political moves.
   The governing party is undecided on how to pick a new leader,
and the opposition parties will have to overcome their policy
differences to mount a joint assault on the Liberal Democrats in
parliament.
   While the opposition's key issue against the government is
likely to be an unpopular new sales tax, some analysts warned that
Japan could become more protectionist because the Socialists and
other opposition parties won votes from farmers disgruntled by the
Liberal Democrats' moves to open Japan to more agricultural imports.
   ``It's ironic that the Diet (parliament) will become more
protectionist,'' political science professor Takashi Inoguchi of
Tokyo University said at a foreign correspondents' lunch.
   A leftward shift in national politics tends to make Japan more
nationalistic in trade matters, Inoguchi said.
   Princeton University political science professor Kent Calder
said, ``In the short run, the Japanese government will become more
hesitant and reactive in its foreign policies, including foreign
economic policies.''
   Calder said Washington will find it more difficult to make
progress in coming negotiations on Japan's distribution system
because small businessmen are an important constituency of the
Liberal Democrats.
   The United States complains that Japan's complex system of
multiple middlemen amounts to a trade barrier because it is hard
for foreign goods to gain entry to the retail market.
   The election result showed the impact of foreign pressures on
domestic politics, Calder said.
   As examples, he cited U.S. and other foreign demands for more
access to Japanese farm markets, which the Liberal Democratic
government gradually granted only to see its candidates defeated in
formerly safe farming districts.
   ``The demands of the international system can have adverse
consequences domestically,'' Calder said.
   Calder noted that the election marked the first big defeat for
the pro-business Liberal Democrats since Japan emerged as a
financial superpower.
   The Liberal Democrats retain control of the more powerful lower
house of Parliament, and the election defeat did not have any
significant effect on currency or stock markets.
   Calder indicated this was an area that bore further watching in
the future because of the importance of Japan in globalized markets
and as a massive lender.

   The National Endowment for the Arts would be
forbidden to award tax-paid grants to sponsors of two controversial
photographic exhibitions for five years under legislation approved
by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.
   The panel Monday also endorsed a House-approved proposal to trim
the endowment's $171.4 million budget next year by $45,000 _ the
exact amount the agency gave for the controversial shows by
photographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   The endowment is an independent federal agency that awards $169
million annually to a wide variety of artists and institutions
orchestras to painters and poets.
   ``Banning funding for specific institutions establishes a
dangerous precedent which goes against the long and widely
respected system of federal support for the arts through a
competitive peer review process,'' said Hugh Southern, acting
chairman of the endowment.
   The NEA gave $30,000 for a national tour of the Mapplethorpe
show, which included homoerotic and sadomasochistic pictures and
several photos of nude children. Serrano received a $15,000 NEA
grant for his work, which includes a widely criticized photograph
of a Christ figure submerged in a container of the artist's urine.

   A Vermont senator sidetracked subcommittee
action on draft legislation to impose a ceasefire in the battle
over logging in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest.
   Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Brock Adams, D-Wash., planned
to ask the full Senate Appropriations Committee to approve the
legislation today despite concerns from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   Leahy says he's ``deeply disturbed'' that provisions in the bill
might pre-empt the right of environmentalists to appeal timber
sales to the courts.
   Leahy's skepticism dampened the excitement of the bill's
sponsors, who hope to ensure an adequate supply of logs to keep the
region's mills operating over the next 14 months, as well as
protect some of the old-growth forests that are prime habitat for
the northern spotted owl.
   Leahy, who has close ties to environmental groups, said he was
well aware that forest products were ``essential to the economic
health'' of the region, but added the right of appeal was also
vital.
   Hatfield agreed to postpone consideration of the bill until the

   President Bush stands behind William Lucas,
his embattled nominee to be the Justice Department's top civil
rights enforcer.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Bush
chose the Detroit lawyer as ``someone who would be a fighter for
civil rights; a black person who understood the black experience.''
   ``We stand behind the candidate,'' Fitzwater said.
   Lucas, the former sheriff of Wayne County, Mich., is opposed by
many civil rights groups who say he lacks experience to be
assistant attorney general for civil rights. They also have
criticized his defense of recent Supreme Court decisions on civil
rights.
   Supporters say that Lucas' stand on civil rights is the same as
that of Bush and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which could
vote on the nomination as early as Thursday, expressed doubts about
Lucas after his testimony at confirmation hearings last week.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a prominent black congressman,
withdrew his support for the nominee after the hearing.
   And Monday, Jesse Jackson urged Judiciary Committee Chairman
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., to reject Lucas as ``unsuitable'' for

<HEAD>Foley Criticizes Capital Gains Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley says President
Bush's plan to cut the capital gains tax rate is a ``misguided and
unfortunate'' proposal that would benefit the rich and hurt efforts
to cut the deficit.
   In a speech to the National Press Club on Monday, Foley said
more than a third of the total tax break would go to people earning
more than $1 million a year.
   ``The proposal of the president to cut the rate on capital gains
is, I think, misguided and unfortunate'' and would open the door to
tax shelters that ``seriously eroded public confidence in the tax
system,'' the Washington Democrat said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``It is
definitely not a foregone conclusion that we are going to win this.
   ``We are working on it very hard. We think capital gains are
important. But there's still a lot of discussions to take place
over the next few days.''
   As a result of the 1986 tax overhaul, capital gains are taxed at
the same rates as other income: 15 percent, 28 percent and 33
percent. Bush campaigned on a promise of a 15 percent rate for all
capital gains, regardless of a taxpayer's total income.

   A B-52 bomber caught fire on the ground at
Kelly Air Force Base during a fueling exercise late Monday, killing
one person and injuring at least four others, base officials said.
   The accident occurred about 10:35 p.m., said 1st Lt. Dave Ebner.
   It originally was reported that fuel was being taken out of the
plane for maintenance work at the time of the accident, but base
officials later said the cause was still being investigated.
   The injured were taken to the Air Force's Wilford Hall Medical
Center for treatment, and a seven-member burn team was called to
assist.
   The identities of the victims were withheld pending notification
of family members. All were civilian employees, Ebner said.
   ``I heard four to five large explosions about 11 p.m. and saw
flames leaping 15 to 20 feet in the air,'' said Jim Fisher, a
school teacher who lives near the base.

<HEAD>Former Ambassador Praises U.S. Diplomat Under Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The American diplomat suspected of spying
for the Soviets tried to cut a higher profile than his post
warranted but was well-connected and worked hard, according to a
former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
   Felix S. Bloch, who is in the United States and under FBI
investigation, was known as a ``workaholic'' when he worked at the
U.S. Embassy in Vienna, said the former ambassador, Helene Von Damm.
   Mrs. Von Damm promoted Bloch, then an economic expert at the
embassy, its deputy chief of mission when she took over as
ambassador in 1983. She resigned in June 1985.
   In an interview shown Monday on Austrian public television, Mrs.
Von Damm was asked about Bloch, a fellow Austrian native.
   Bloch was one of six applicants for the position of deputy
chief, and ``for me he was the best qualified,'' she said.
   He ``was already very well-connected, he was established, people
respected him and in Washington he was known as a man who was very
ambitious and hard-working, a kind of workaholic, and I thought he
actually suits me quite well,'' she said.
   But Mrs. Von Damm also said she had some trouble with Bloch.
   ``I was very satisfied with him to begin with,'' she said. ``I
even helped him get a special distinction, but as time went by he
tried time and again to enhance his profile in public, and I had to
rein him in again and again.
   ``I wasn't terribly harried by this at the time, it was a
problem I could cope with. No one is perfect, and other than that
he did very well.''
   She said that only at the time when she sent her letter of
resignation to Washington, ``there were signs that he (Bloch) was
not 100 percent loyal to me.'' She also said she advised Ronald
Lauder, who succeeded her as the U.S. ambassador in Vienna, to look
for someone to replace Bloch.
   Ex-Ambassador Lauder, now campaigning for mayor in New York
City, said Bloch was transferred to Washington from Vienna because
of insubordination.
   Mrs. Von Damm said that as deputy chief of mission Bloch had the
same access to secret documents and information as the ambassador
because ``he had the same top clearance.''
   In reply to a question, she said that Bloch knew the resident
CIA representatives in Vienna.
   If Bloch was a spy ``it would be a great damage'' for the United
States, she added. She spoke in German with an occasional English
phrase.
   Mrs. Von Damm resigned as ambassador following criticism of her
marriage to Vienna hotel owner Peter Guertler. It was her fourth
marriage, and it also ended in divorce.

   Maj. Gen. Robert Lyons lived a life few
people could imagine.
   The youngest major general in U.S. history, he served with the
Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. He
received two Medals of Honor, the nation's highest military honor,
and was recommended for a third.
   He also was a friend of Elvis Presley's.
   Sound too good to be true? It was.
   Robert Stanley Lyons, 35, pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District
Court to a charge of falsely impersonating a federal officer.
   Lyons, who did serve in the Army but was discharged as a
private, was charged after a complaint from a woman gave him
$1,000. Lyons had told her he needed the money to pay off some bad
checks and get out of the CIA.
   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Patton, Lyons liked to
distribute a phony issue of Pentagon Gazette with a picture of
himself on the cover in a general's uniform.
   The issue was billed as ``a special tribute to one whom many
believe is Washington's well-known best-kept secret.'' It claimed
he pulled off one of the greatest feats in U.S. military history by
leading a four-man commando team to Southeast Asia in 1983,
rescuing 285 American prisoners of war and bringing back the
remains of 300 more.
   The bogus magazine carries an article under the byline of Paul
Summers that says, ``I strongly believe that Maj. Gen. Lyons has
left a trail never again to be matched or surpassed.''
   Patton said Lyons ``knew what he was doing and intended to do
it.''
   Lyons said he was trying to get psychological help.
   Sentencing was set for Sept. 2. Lyons faces up to three years.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged to
a record high Tuesday, and the dollar firmed one day after Japan's
prime minister resigned to take responsibility for a major defeat
at the polls.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
193.90 points Monday, added 445.57 points, or 1.31 percent, to
finish at 34,538.90. Roughly 1 billion shares changed hands.
   The dollar, which started at 142.20, closed at 142.35 yen, up
0.40 yen from Monday's close. It fluctuated between 141.98 yen and
142.60 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's firmness followed its similar trend in
New York on Monday, after news that Japan's long-governing Liberal
Democratic Party lost its majority in parliament's upper house.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced the same day he will resign
to take responsibility for the defeat.
   ``The election was a big loss as dealers expected, and even
though Uno will resign, most people feel the political situation
won't change all that much,'' said Osamu Seto, a dealer with Mitsui
Bank.
   Meanwhile, dealers probably won't buy yen, Seto said. The focus
will move more towards interest rates in the United States and the
strength of its recovery, he added.
   An analyst at Okasan Securities Co., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said housing issues carried the morning's bull market.
   Volume was increasing, he said, but high-tech stocks are weak.
He said there was no particular market-affecting news.

<HEAD>High-Profile Solidarity Lawmaker Visits Prague Spring Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity activist Adam Michnik
has used the official passport afforded him after he won a seat in
Poland's parliament to see Alexander Dubcek, leader of the crushed
Prague Spring uprising.
   Michnik and two other members of the the Polish free trade union
movement met with Dubceck for three hours Monday at the former
Communist Party leader's home in Bratislava, said Czechoslovak
activist Petr Uhl said.
   Dubcek and the Solidarity activists agreed that the Soviet-led
1968 invasion that crushed Dubcek's liberal reforms was ``an
unacceptable and illegal act,'' Uhl said. He was reached by
telephone from Vienna.
   Dubcek was ousted in April 1969 and expelled from the party in
June 1970.
   Czechoslovak police watched the Poles, accompanied by Czech
human rights activist Jan Urban, arrive at Dubcek's home but did
not interfere, said Uhl.
   He said police also filmed the Poles and Czechoslovaks arrive at
Urban's Prague home on Saturday for a meeting of activists.
   The meeting centered on the forthcoming 21st anniversary of the
1968 invasion, which is expected to be the focus of more
anti-government protests in Czechoslovakia.
   Uhl said the Solidarity activists spent Sunday night at the
country home of dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's
most prominent human rights campaigner.
   Havel was jailed for eight months earlier this year but released
on parole after unprecedented protests at home and abroad.
   On Saturday, Michnik and the other Solidarity visitors met
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, 90-year-old head of Czechoslovakia's
beleaguered Roman Catholic church.
   Michnik, himself a former political prisoner, has also made use
of his new official passport to travel to the Soviet Union.
   Uhl said Michnik had informed Dubcek about his talks in Moscow
and his impressions of recent Soviet reforms, which the former
Czechoslovak leader has praised in public statements since 1987.
   Round-the-clock surveillance of Dubcek was lifted that year when
Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Czechoslovakia, and Dubcek was
permitted last fall to go to Italy to receive an honorary degree.
   There, he made a series of statements criticizing Prague's
current Communist leaders. He has not been allowed to travel abroad
since.
   Uhl said Michnik planned to return to Poland today.

   Jubilant shrimpers pointed their boats
toward the open Gulf after a weekend of protests and blockades
prompted the government to suspend regulations requiring
turtle-saving devices in their nets.
   ``Thank God, we're going fishing and making a living,'' said Tee
John Mialjevich, a Louisiana shrimper and president of Concerned
Shrimpers of America, which organized many of the protests.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher decided Monday to
suspend indefinitely a rule that shrimpers use devices to protect
the endangered Kemp's Ridley turtle.
   Environmentalists denounced the suspension and one group
promised to organize a national boycott of shrimp.
   Hundreds of shrimpers in Galveston, meanwhile, broke into cheers
when they heard about Mosbacher's decision.
   ``This is a lot more than we thought we would get,'' said
Richard Santini of Galveston, who estimated he lost $6,000 to
$7,000 during the weekend's blockade of the Houston Ship Channel.
``We can make a living now.''
   The shrimpers gathered outside a Galveston meeting between
Mialjevich and Gray Castle, a Commerce Department deputy
undersecretary, while Mosbacher met in Washington with congressmen
from Gulf states.
   Mialjevich boarded a motorized cart with Castle and shouted to
the throng, ``Let's stay together!'' Many shrimpers had threatened
another blockade if their demands were not met.
   Castle said Mosbacher was concerned about another blockade, but
added officials also worried about shrimpers' pocketbooks.
   ``It's true that anytime you get 250 shrimp boats blockading a
harbor, you've potential for problem,'' Castle said. ``But you're
talking about people's livelihoods.
   ``I think if any of us was in the same position, we'd react in
the same way.''
   Mosbacher said enforcement of the turtle excluder regulations
would be suspended indefinitely.
   Beginning in 45 days, shrimpers will have to pull their nets
from the water every 90 minutes to free turtles but will not have
to use the turtle excluders. That is the amount of time turtles can
survive underwater.
   Authorities will issue warnings to shrimpers caught not pulling
their nets after 90 minutes. Next year, the regulations will be
re-evaluated.
   Proponents of the endangered turtles were bitter. They had
claimed the turtle excluder devices would help save the turtles
from extinction.
   ``The radical action of the secretary of commerce has convinced
us that we need to take some radical action,'' said Mike Weber,
vice president of programs for the Center for Marine Conservation.
   Weber's group planned to organize a nationwide shrimp boycott
and to seek a temporary restraining order against Mosbacher's
decision.
   ``I think you may find that there are far more people out here
that care about upholding the endangered species law than there are
shrimpers,'' said Jane Scheidler, spokeswoman for Help Endangered
Animals-Ridley Turtles and president-elect of the Houston Audubon
Society.
   Previous studies show 11,000 sea turtles die in shrimp nets
every year, including 3,000 in the Gulf of Mexico. Shrimpers
disclaim responsibility for the deaths.
   The excluders are like trap doors allowing turtles to escape the
nets. Shrimpers complain the contraptions let shrimp out, too,
reducing harvests as much as 35 percent. They also say the devices
are bulky and dangerous to operate.
   The law requiring excluders went into effect May 1. Mosbacher's
call for enforcement of the law last week led to the protests.
   About 200 shrimp boats had crowded the deep-water Houston
channel Saturday and about 300 shrimpers jammed Port Aransas,
gateway to the Port of Corpus Christi.
   Similar blockades were staged at other Gulf of Mexico ports
along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, but the shrimpers disbanded
Sunday after federal officials promised to hear their complaints.
   Gunfire was reported in Texas and Louisiana during the blockades
and four shrimpers were arrested in Texas. There were no injuries,
authorities said.
   Ship traffic, blocked in several ports Saturday, was normal
Monday, Coast Guard officials said.

<UNK>Japanese Tourists Blaze Trail In Iran, But Red Tape A Problem</UNK>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Japanese tourists are
visiting Iran, the first foreigners to take package tour vacations
in the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran's official
news agency reported today.
   But the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the transport
industry magazine Sanat Hamlo Naql as saying ``formalities'' at
Tehran's Mehrabad airport are ``enough to ruin the whole trip.''
   The monthly magazine noted: ``Most of the Japanese questioned
said that just because of the difficulties of entering and exiting
Mehrabad they are not willing to come to Iran ever again.''
   Rigorous security, immigration and customs controls at Mehrebad,
in and out, involve lengthy waits, sometimes lasting several hours
at an airport not renowned for its services.
   IRNA quoted Mehdi Hashemi, head of the state-run Foundation for
the Disabled's hotel and travel agencies division, as saying: We
have problems at the airport and we're trying to solve them.
   ``These problems show that the officials in charge do not have
the right picture of a tourist,'' he said.
   ``Tourism is considered very important even to countries which
do not have much need for foreign exchange. But for Iran the
attraction of tourists is obviously more important,'' Hashemi noted.
   The magazine said as many as 500 Japanese, in groups of a few
dozen, have visited Iran since May.
   Since the August cease-fire in the 8-year war with Iraq, Iran
has been seeking to redevelop a once-thriving tourist industry that
collapsed during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, made no mention of
tourists other than Japanese visiting Iran.
   But Tehran has been boosting relations with Third World
countries and the Soviet bloc, while its relations with the West
remain icy.
   IRNA said the Japanese spend $3,500 in hard currency for a
10-day visit. The price includes a $2,000 round-trip ticket from
Tokyo with Iran Air, Iran's national carrier.
   The package tours, organized by the Disabled Foundation's
tourism division, takes the visitors to historical sites in Tehran
as well as the provincial cities of Shiraz, Isfahan, Hamadan and
Bakhtaran.
   ``Iran today is not well-experienced in tourism, but with the
expansion of this operation, there's hope for improvement,'' said
Nasser Moradi, a manager of the tourist organization.

   Police say they are investigating the reported
theft from London's Heathrow airport of a Paul Gauguin watercolor
owned by the Beadlestone Gallery of New York.
   The London newspaper the Daily Mail, said the painting, valued
at more than $1.9 million, was stolen from a cargo hangar.
   It said the watercolor, measuring nine inches by four inches, is
titled ``Tahitienne en Pareo Rouge'' _ Tahitian woman in a red
pareu.
   Gauguin, a Frenchman who was born in 1848, lived and painted in
Tahiti in the South Pacific from 1895 until his death in 1903.
   ``The matter is the subject of an inquiry by the Criminal
Investigation Department at Heathrow,'' Scotland Yard said in a
brief statement that gave few other details.
   The Daily Mail said the painting was one of four that arrived on
a British Airways flight from New York on June 21.
   It said the consignment remained in the British Airways cargo
hangar until the owners arrived to collect them five days later.
   It said each of the pictures was in a separate box but that only
one, containing the Gauguin painting, was missing. The other three
paintings were not identified.
   The paper said the theft was not reported to police until
Sunday. Neither the paper nor Scotland Yard gave any reason for the
gap between the discovery of the theft and the reporting of it to
police.

<HEAD>State Upset With Exxon's Plan to Pull Cleanup Workers Sept. 15</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials angrily reacted to Exxon's
plan to pull all its oil spill cleanup forces out of Alaska by
mid-September, saying crews should stay until the area is clean.
   Meanwhile, the oil giant indicated the cost of cleaning up the
nation's largest oil spill would total about $1.25 billion and was
a major factor behind a plunge in its second quarter earnings.
   In an internal memo released Monday, a top company official said
the Sept. 15 pullout date was not negotiable.
   ``It's not enough to declare victory and go home,'' Gov. Steve
Cowper said Monday. ``Virtually from the beginning, Exxon promised
Alaskans that the company would stay until the job was done. I
expect them to fulfill that promise.''
   But Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said there was nothing new in
the memo.
   ``We've been saying all along we would operate until about Sept.
15 when we have to shut down because of the weather,'' he said.
``None of that has changed.
   Otto Harrison, Exxon's general manager in Valdez, said in a memo
to company officials dated July 19 that no winter cleanup
operations will be conducted because of safety and operational
reasons and the company's only commitment for next spring is to
survey the shorelines.
   ``These are not negotiable points,'' he wrote in the memo, a
copy of which was provided to The Associated Press.
   ``Our discussions with federal or state agencies is for the
purpose of keeping them informed, and is not requesting approval,''
Harrison wrote.
   The memo was dated the day before Exxon President Bill Stevens
testified before a Senate subcommittee and reluctantly committed
the company to resuming operations next year if more work needs to
be done.
   A spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Exxon's
obligation to clean up the mess does not end in September.
   ``The secretary has stated all along that Exxon is fully liable
and responsible for that accident and they have an obligation to
ensure full mitigation of damages and to restore Prince William
Sound back to its original splendor,'' spokesman Steve Goldstein
said.
   Steve Provant, on-scene oil spill coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, said his agency wants
Exxon to leave a contingency force behind to deal with oil that may
wash off beaches and cause problems during the winter.
   He also said it might be possible for Exxon crews to work until
Oct. 1. Provant said this winter the state plans to monitor
beaches, map the damage, test waters and fly over the area.
   An army of 11,000 people, 1,000 vessels and more than 70
aircraft has been trying to clean beaches stained after the Exxon
Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, and spilled about 11 million
gallons of crude.
   In releasing its earnings, Exxon said a provision for spill
costs reduced its net income by $850 million in the second quarter.
   The company said the provision includes $600 million already
spent on the cleanup plus estimated future outlays, but does not
include the cost of any lawsuits. In addition, the company said
insurance coverage of more than $400 million would go toward the
cleanup.
   Exxon reported an 87 percent drop in net income to $160 million
from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
   Cowper said he understood Exxon's need to have a plan for
scaling back as winter approaches. But he said ``demobilization
does not mean disappearance.''
   Surveys by the state and the Coast Guard indicate only about
one-third of the cleanup work either has been completed or is in
progress, the governor said.
   He said some of the beaches already treated have been fouled
again by significant amounts of oil.
   But Beathard said, ``We believe six months of winter storms and
tidal action will remove most, if not all, of what's remaining,''
he said.
   Beathard said a shoreline assessment would be undertaken in the
spring.

   Albert Johnston Jr. had tears in his eyes as
he watched his family's story once again on the big screen, 40
years after his chance remark to a famous filmmaker resulted in a
movie about race.
   Johnston sat with his mother, Thyra, and a crowd of nearly 700
people Monday night to watch ``Lost Boundaries'' and remember the
man who inspired it _ his father, Dr. Albert Johnston.
   ``We're all here because a brave man and a patriotic man ...
tried to join a segregated Navy,'' said Keene State College film
professor Lawrence Benaquist, who organized the reunion on the 40th
anniversary of the film's opening in Keene.
   The fair-skinned Johnstons passed for white in Gorham and Keene
in the 1930s and '40s so Johnston could find work as a doctor.
   They kept the secret even from their children until 1941, when
Johnston was refused a Navy commission when naval investigators
found he belonged to a black fraternity in college and had black
ancestry.
   Several years later, Albert Jr. and other University of New
Hampshire students visited Louis de Rochemont, producer of the
``March of Time'' documentary films, at his Newington home to
encourage fairer treatment of minorities in films.
   On his way out, Albert Jr. mentioned the revelation that was to
enthrall de Rochemont. The two subsequently convinced the Johnstons
to let the filmmaker dramatize their story.
   ``We never had any bad repercussions,'' said the 88-year-old
Mrs. Johnston, now of Kaneohe, Hawaii. ``The story has not hurt us
at all.''
   The film won the 1949 Cannes Film Festival award for best script
and was revolutionary for its time, treating its subject in a bold,
documentary-like fashion.
   ``All of us had a certain real conviction about the theme of the
picture and the content of the picture, and I didn't hesitate,''
said Mel Ferrer, who made his screen debut in the film portraying
Dr. Johnston's character.
   At Keene State College's Arts Center, Ferrer and other members
of the cast and crew recalled the difficulties caused by the film's
touchy topic.
   De Rochemont was under contract to MGM at the time he decided to
make ``Lost Boundaries,'' but the major studio balked at the idea
after initial enthusiasm about the project, associate producer
Borden Mace said.
   De Rochemont scraped together the money _ even mortgaging his
house _ to make the film independently, Mace explained. But he said
a desire for authenticity, not financial concerns, prompted the
producer to use unknowns and shoot on location in New Hampshire and
Maine.
   The film was slightly fictionalized, with the names of people
and places altered.
   At first reluctant to see their lives on the screen, the family
was _ and still is _ pleased with the film. Mrs. Johnston said she
wished the film were more widely known.
   ``I think it would help the younger people to know what it was
like then,'' she said.

   Producer Joseph Papp reaffirmed his decision to

hoped to present it along with other productions dealing with the
Middle East within a year.
   Papp, producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, decided
last month to withdraw an offer to the El-Hakawati Palestinian
Theater Company of Jerusalem because of concern about the reactions
of Jewish theatergoers.
   ``I live with my decision and my sensibilities _ particularly
those that relate to national and religious groups living in New
York where my plays are presented,'' Papp said at a news conference
Monday. ``If there had been an overwhelmingly large Arabic
theater-going population living here, I would be just as sensitive
to their beliefs and concerns as I am to Jews.''
   The six-person company was to have performed ``The Story of
Kufur Shamma'' at the Public Theater last week. The play tells of a
40-year search by a Palestinian man for residents of his village
that was decimated by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
   Papp met Monday with members of the American-Arab Relations
Committee. Members of the committee said the meeting was cordial,
but issued a statement saying Papp's decision assumed that ``New
York Jews are intolerant and have the power to suppress the First
Amendment rights of others.''
   ``I think there should be a stronger commitment to an open
society,'' M.T. Mehdi, president of the committee, said at the news
conference.
   Papp said there had been no pressure from Jewish groups to
suppress the play, and called his decision a ``personal'' one.
   ``I never objected to the play itself,'' Papp said. ``After I
agreed to present the play, I discovered we were not putting on
anything else (about the Israeli-Palestinian problem) at the same
time.''
   Papp said he would like to present different plays covering a
wide spectrum of views about the Palestinian problem and indicated
he would attempt to do so within 12 months.
   ``In this particular instance, I'll have things that represent
the whole issue of the Palestinian situation and seek those (types
of) plays _ whether they be Palestinian or Israeli plays,'' Papp
said.
   ``The Story of Kufur Shamma'' will still be seen in New York. It
will be presented for seven performances, beginning Wednesday, at
the Dance Theater Workshop, an off-off-Broadway company.

<HEAD>Pilot Ditches in English Channel Trying to Recreate First Crossing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot trying to re-enact the first
flight across the English Channel on its 80th anniversary was
forced to ditch her plane just two miles short of the British coast
today.
   Gloria Pullan was commemorating French Aviator Louis Bleriot's
July 25, 1909, flight from Calais, France, to Dover, England, in an
authentic Bleriot XI monoplane, the same type used for his crossing.
   ``I took off from Calais and it was a beautiful flight until I
started losing power,'' she said, clutching her wet British
passport. ``Gradually the aircraft went down and I had to ditch in
the sea about two miles off Dover.
   Ms. Pullan, 36, was rescued by a Royal Air Force helicopter
after being in the water for three minutes.
   She was taken to a field atop the famous White Cliffs of Dover
where a large welcoming party was waiting on the spot where Bleriot
landed.
   ``It was so sad,'' she said. ``I think the aircraft has been
lost. I was enjoying it so much and I would do it again any time. I
am sorry I could not bring the airplane into land for the official
reception.''
   Louis Bleriot, grandson and namesake of the pioneer aviator,
flew in a helicopter alongside Ms. Pullan's plane and saw it crash.
   ``It was very sad seeing the aircraft go into the sea,'' he said
at Dover. ``I believe it sank. I could not see it afterwards.''
   Bleriot's flight was staged in response to a challenge by
English newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe who offered a prize of
$1,600 to the first person to cross the channel by air.
   Bleriot covered the 22-mile journey across the narrowest part of
the channel in 36 minutes and crash-landed his fragile flying
machine in a field near Dover Castle.

<HEAD>Chinese Walk Out of Conference; Ambassador Urges Non-Interference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of international scientists
hoped to get back to work on disarmament after criticism of the
Beijing crackdown by Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov triggered a
walkout by Chinese delegates.
   The walkout at Monday's opening session of the 39th Pugwash
Conference came after Sakharov condemned the Chinese government's
brutal repression of student protesters.
   ``We cannot forgive or disregard the conduct of the Chinese
government and we must find ways to demonstrate this attitude,''
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner said. One of the two Chinese
delegates who walked out during the speech later confronted
Sakharov.
   The sensitivity by Chinese leaders over the crackdown,
meanwhile, also was evident Monday in comments made by Han Xu,
China's ambassador to the United States.
   ``At present, the important thing is not to interfere in China's
internal affairs, particularly when it is in difficulty. Do not
make things more difficult,'' Han, 65, said at a luncheon in West
Palm Beach, Fla.
   They were his first public comments ``since those terrible
developments occurred in China,'' he said, adding that it would be
his last as ambassador. The 65-year-old said he soon will retire
and return to Beijing.
   Han said additional economic sanctions against China ``hurt the
United States as much as they hurt China. The only effect on China
that I can think of is that would push back China into the
isolation of the old days.''
   At the conference, M. Innas Ali, a nuclear physicist from
Bangladesh, said Sakharov's confrontation with the Chinese did not
dampen the optimism of most delegates.
   ``Now everybody is moving in the right direction, toward
disarmament,'' he said. ``But we still have to do some constructive
work so this can be realized in practice.''
   About 200 scientists and statesmen from more than 30 countries
are attending the five-day conference, which is being held in the
United States for the first time in 19 years.
   The Pugwash conferences grew out of a 1955 statement by Bertrand
Russell and Albert Einstein urging scientists of all political
persuasions to devise ways to avoid nuclear war. The first
conference was held in 1957 at Pugwash, Nova Scotia.
   Most of the sessions are devoted to technical arms control
issues and are closed to the public.
   The Chinese delegates waited outside the conference room during
Sakharov's 45-minute speech, which was largely devoted to Soviet
economic and environmental problems. Then one of them, Professor
Shi Zhongben of Beijing University, confronted the 68-year-old
human rights activist.
   Trembling with emotion, Shi said Sakharov did not understand
Chinese affairs and had chosen an inappropriate forum for his
criticism.
   ``We can build peace through international cooperation _ not by
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,'' Shi said.
   Sakharov remained impassive. ``Maybe I don't understand all the
complexities of the situation in China, but I think I was right,''
he said later.
   Despite the incident, Shi and colleague Niu Qiang of the Chinese
People's Association for Peace and Disarmament said they planned to
attend the rest of the conference.
   Two other Chinese delegates kept their seats in another part of
the room, but it was unclear whether they did so deliberately or
failed to notice the departure of Shi and Niu.
   After the Chinese Army violently crushed the pro-democracy
protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 3-4 _ with estimates
of deaths running from several hundred to as high as 3,000 _ the
new Soviet Congress issued a guarded statement calling it ``an
internal matter.''
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the
1950s, later spoke out against Soviet human rights abuses and the
war in Afghanistan and was banished to internal exile in the city
of Gorky from 1979 to 1986.

   ABC News apologized for an evening news show
that did not clearly label a simulation of evidence in the Bloch
spy case, but said it would continue to use such staged events.
   The blunder in Friday evening's ``World News Tonight'' segment
on American diplomat Felix S. Bloch might have led some viewers to
believe they were watching videotaped frames of Bloch giving a
briefcase to an agent of the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency.
   The network's two still pictures of the transaction were created
by ABC News staffers and were not taken from FBI footage of the
alleged encounter, ABC News officials said Monday.
   ``It was a terrible mistake'' not to identify clearly the
pictures as simulation, Richard Wald, senior vice president of ABC
News, said in a telephone interview. ``I regret it.''
   Bloch is suspected of having spied for the Soviets. He has not
been charged.
   Media critic Ben Bagdikian called into question the practice of
using reenactments on news broadcasts, calling them ``pure poison.''
   ``Since the Fox network got its ratings with `America's Most
Wanted,' it's clearly an imitation of that. It's docudrama as
news,'' said Bagdikian, former dean of the graduate journalism
school at the University of California, Berkeley.
   Wald defended reenactments, saying they should be seen as
extensions of courtroom sketches.
   The ABC simulation lasted about 10 seconds and included two
grainy, still shots of one man handing a briefcase to another.
   ABC correspondent John McWethy's narration at the time said,
``It was not until earlier this year that Bloch was videotaped
handing over a briefcase to a known Soviet agent on the streets of
a European capital.''
   The sequence failed to include a ``simulation'' advisory, as is
customary.
   ABC newsroom guidelines say it should be made explicitly clear
when the audience is watching a news simulation, according to
spokeswoman Elise Adde.
   Reenactments are becoming increasingly popular in other network
programs as well. NBC's ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' will use
them when the show makes its debut later this month.
   And news simulations are among the alternatives being considered
for CBS' ``West 57th,'' which will be redesigned for the fall.
   The Fox Broadcasting Corp. has attracted large audiences for its
crime reenactments on ``America's Most Wanted,'' a show designed to
help capture fugitives.

Rockies.
   A 2-inch downpour fell in an hour at White Pine, Pa., Monday
night, and basements and roads flooded near Frostburg, Clarysville
and Eckhart.
   About three quarters of an inch fell in Fayetteville, Ark., and
Harrison reported more than half an inch.
   Warm moist air produced thunderstorms over New Mexico and
northwest Texas. A cold front moving across the northern Rockies
generated showers and thunderstorms from western Montana into
northern Idaho.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from the central
Appalachians to the coast of the Carolinas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from much
of Arizona and New Mexico across the southern Rockies to much of
Texas; from Florida across the Tennessee Valley; and in southern
Missouri, the lower Ohio Valley and southern portions of the Great
Lakes.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s along the Pacific Coast;
the 80s from the southern and central Rockies across portions of
the Plains and the Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes;
from 100 to 115 degrees from central California through the Desert
Southwest; and in the 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 95 degrees at Glendale, Ariz., and Phoenix.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
brisk European trading early today. Gold prices were higher.
   The dollar lost ground in jittery trading overnight and appeared
to be stabilizing in late morning European trading, but many
dealers expected dollar-selling to resume with the opening of the
New York market.
   Dealers said sentiment is gradually turning more bearish against
the dollar.
   ``There are a lot of people who expect a much lower dollar by
the beginning of August,'' said a trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.40 Japanese yen to a closing 142.35
yen. Later, in London, it was unchanged at 142.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
   _1.8910 West German marks, down from 1.9055

   The Stock Exchange's key index surged to a record
high and the dollar rose against the Japanese yen today, a day
after Japan's prime minister said he would resign to take
responsibility for a major electoral defeat.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
193.90 points Monday, added 445.57 points, or 1.31 percent, today,
closing at 34,538.90. Roughly 1 billion shares changed hands.
   The dollar opened at 142.20 and closed at 142.35 yen, up 0.40
yen from Monday's close of 141.95 yen. t fluctuated between 141.98
yen and 142.60 yen.
   In an election Sunday, Japan's long-governing, pro-business
Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in parliament's upper
house for the first time in its 34-year history.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced that he would resign to
take responsibility.
   A trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the election was not having a major impact on Tokyo
markets.
   ``Abroad, investors grasp that market fundamentals have not
changed in Japan,'' and this has acted as a spur to active trading
domestically, he said.
   Domestic demand-related issues received particular attention
today. There were large buying orders for housing issues, the
trader said.
   In addition, consumer products issues were bought on news that a
Tokyo court had ruled in favor of Shuwa Corp., a large real estate
firm that is trying to reconstruct the retail market through
several unfriendly mergers.
   Liberal Democratic Party statements that the party would
reconsider the new 3 percent sales tax also spurred buying of such
issues. Voter anger over the 4-month-old tax was seen as a major
factor in the party's election loss.
   On the foreign exchange market, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was heavy buying of
West German marks with yen today.
   ``Traders feel that selling yen against the dollar is dangerous,
so they are buying European currencies,'' he said.
   Traders have said the market anticipates lower interest rates in
the United States, which would make dollars less attractive.
   Their reluctance to buy yen stems from the continuing political
instability in Japan, the dealer said.
   ``People feel that the political situation in Japan will become
chaotic again. But the longer the chaos lasts, the less important
it will be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Animal Activist Acknowledges Ordering Castration Of Donkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brigitte Bardot has acknowledged ordering the
castration of a donkey she was keeping for a neighbor, but she says
she should be above suspicion because of her concern for animal
welfare.
   Bardot, a former film star who has devoted herself to animal
causes, said in a statement issued Sunday that the donkey Charly
was castrated by a veterinarian under anesthesia.
   She said she agreed to keep Charly for a Lyon businessman, Jean
Pierre Manivet, but the donkey's amorous interest in an elderly
female donkey already on the grounds was so excessive as to
endanger the female.
   Manivet subsequently complained that his donkey was castrated
without his consent.
   Bardot said she tried unsuccessfully to contact Manivet before
ordering the operation.
   ``I think I am above suspicion as to the way I treat and care
for animals, whether they are confided to me or belong to me,'' she
said in a statement.

   Authorities have recovered the body of
a teen-ager who lost his grip on a lifeline in a rain-swollen flood
channel after being struck by debris.
   The body of Peter Alvarado, Jr., 16, was found Monday in Alameda
Arroyo, a flood plain that received the rushing waters of the
Embudo Channel on Sunday.
   Peter and his 14-year-old brother, David, had been skateboarding
in the concrete-lined Northeast Heights flood channel Sunday when a
3-foot-high wall of water from a sudden thunderstorm hit them.
   David was rescued.
   Peter was within a few feet of high ground when a chair carried
by the torrent struck him and knocked him off a lifeline across the
channel. His younger brother and rescuers helplessly watched him
float away.
   The body was found 10 to 12 miles downstream after it was
spotted by people looking over a bridge, according to Anthony
Garcia, a member of the aquatic rescue team for the Bernalillo
County Fire Department.
   ``As a parent you think that your children might be mature
enough to be secure,'' said the boys' father, Peter Alvarado Sr.,
as he watched rescuers recover his son's body. ``There's really no
constraint you can have on a child once they leave your house.''
   He added: ``We're lucky to have one boy who is safe and sound.''
   David was treated for cuts and bruises at St. Joseph Hospital,
city Fire Department spokesman Ernie Watson said.
   The National Weather Service said an inch of rain fell in the
area in less than an hour.
   At least 10 people, including four police officers and four
firefighters, were injured trying to rescue the brothers.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov arrived today
for a four-day visit to Britain, marking what British officials say
is the first trip by a Soviet defense minister to a NATO country
since World War II.
   Gen. Yazov, accompanied by six top army, naval and air force
commanders, flew in from Moscow on an Aeroflot jet and was met by
Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin.
   He made no comments and was driven directly from Heathrow
Airport to the Defense Ministry in London for a formal welcome.
   British Defense Secretary George Younger, who announced his
resignation in a major Cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on Monday, was staying on until the end of the week to
host Yazov.
   ``This is the beginning of an official, high level
Soviet-British defense relationship,'' said a senior British
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Younger and Yazov were to hold a joint news conference this
afternoon after several hours of talks and a meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   On Wednesday, Yazov is to visit a Royal Air Force base in
Scotland to inspect Phantom and Tornado fighters which sweep NATO's
northern air flank for Soviet intrusions, and an aircraft carrier,
HMS Invincible.
   He will also visit Britain's main military academy, Sandhurst,
near London, and a paratroop training base in southern England.
   The trip is part of increased East-West military contacts under
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of reduced
confrontation with the West.
   It comes only two months after Britain expelled 11 Soviet
diplomats and journalists, charging they were spies. The Soviet
Union retaliated by expelling 11 Britons.
   The British official said talks with Yazov will focus on the
Soviet Union's new defensive military strategy and Soviet views of
President Bush's latest arms control proposals, announced at a NATO
summit in May.
   In Moscow, the official Tass news agency quoted Yazov as saying
before departure that while big differences remained between London
and Moscow, ``there are real opportunities for expanding the sphere
of our mutual understanding.''
   Last year, Yazov met twice with then U.S. Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci _ in Switzerland and in Moscow. He has also met in
Moscow the French, Spanish and West German defense ministers.

<TEXT>
   A grand jury refused to indict a man accused of
shooting three people at a subway stop, and he was freed after
spending 11 days in jail for a crime he denied committing.
   Clemente Jackson, 21, was arrested June 22 by transit police
handing out a composite sketch of the gunman. He denied the crime
but spent 11 days in jail until he was freed on bond.
   The shooting was done June 10 by a man who recognized a group of
young men who apparently had robbed him a day earlier at another
subway stop. He asked them, ``Remember me?'' and then shot three of
them, police have said.
   The three who were wounded, aged 14, 24 and 26, were charged
with robbery; one is still hospitalized.
   Jackson expressed dismay with the ordeal after Monday's grand
jury decision. He said he may sue the city for false arrest.
   ``I can't believe I went through all this. It was like a
nightmare,'' he said.
   Eight relatives and friends testified that Jackson was far from
the scene of the crime.
   Jackson's supporters said prosecutors did a poor job of handling
the case, and some defense witnesses charged their testimony was
limited.
   ``Only because of the public outcry on behalf of this young man
was the grand jury able to hear the evidence,'' said Bonita E.
Zelman, his lawyer.
   Jackson said he was convinced prosecutors knew he was innocent,
but prosecutors said they had acted in good faith.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that senior
diplomat Felix S. Bloch has already confessed to spying for years
for the Soviets in exchange for a guarantee of immunity from
prosecution.
   But the newspaper, Der Standard, quoted ``reliable'' CIA sources
as saying publicity of the case has cast doubt on the deal.
   Bloch, who served as the second-in-command at the U.S. Embassy
in the Austrian capital during much of his stint there from
1980-87, is in the United States under FBI investigation. He has
not been formally charged.
   News reports of the spy probe began Friday.
   The daily, which began publication last fall, said without
further detail that a preliminary investigation of Bloch began in
February 1988 and was completed in March of this year.
   After taking office in January, President Bush appointed Bloch
director of the Office of European Regional Political-Economic
Affairs in the State Department's Bureau of European and Canadian
Affairs.
   The newspaper did not refer to that appointment or explain how
it could have been made if Bloch was already under suspicion.
   Bloch was the highest-ranking U.S. official ever implicated in
an espionage investigation involving the Soviet Union. He was
reportedly filmed by U.S. officials earlier this year passing a
briefcase to a Soviet KGB agent in a European capital.
   By all accounts, the Austrian-born Bloch had access to sensitive
   intelligence material during his career, and officials expressed
concern he could cause serious damage to U.S. interests if he
shared his secrets with foreign powers.

   Felix S. Bloch, suspected of passing secrets
to the Soviets, is described by friends as a dull and dry U.S.
diplomat who badly wanted an ambassador's post.
   Bloch and his family remained under tight surveillance after
media reports placing him at the center of what could be the
biggest State Department espionage case since the 1950s.
   ``Everybody is stunned and depressed,'' said one State
Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Friends and colleagues spoke of Bloch as a precise, analytical
man respected for his grasp of European affairs but frustrated at
the pace of his State Department career.
   ``Dry, bureaucratic, competent, ambitious,'' was the description
offered by his friend, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who
has known Bloch and his wife, Lucille, for more than 30 years.
   Mock told Austrian reporters that Bloch chafed at serving under
politically appointed ambassadors without becoming ambassador
himself.
   At his condominium near Washington's Embassy Row, neighbors said
Bloch and his wife were reserved and private, though friendly.
   Preston Pitts, a neighbor, said Bloch told him earlier this year
that an ambassador's job might come soon: ``He told me he was
slated to be an ambassador to Central or South America _ I didn't
ask the country. He hoped to be; he was up for it.''
   Pitts said the first sign anything was amiss came nearly a month
ago when FBI agents began a heavy and visible surveillance of Bloch.
   Agents were seen throughout the building and sitting in cars
around it, he said, prompting concern and talk by many residents.
   ``The agents were around here like ants _ they were too
obvious,'' said Pitts. ``I saw him in the hall and said, `Felix,
are you in any danger?' He said, `No.' ... I thought they were here
to protect him.''
   Bloch was filmed by U.S. officials earlier this year passing a
briefcase to a known Soviet KGB agent in Paris, according to
sources. The State Department issued a statement saying it and the
FBI were ``pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order to identify the
compromised security which has occurred and the appropriate steps.''
   No charges have been filed.
   President Bush described reports of spying by Bloch as ``very
serious.''
   Bloch served in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980-87, most of
that time holding the No. 2 post in the embassy.
   Bloch returned to Washington in 1987 and became director of the
State Department's office of European regional political-economic
affairs. He was considered a top specialist on the European
Community.
   In Austria, he served under Reagan ambassadorial appointees
Ronald Lauder, and before that, Helene Von Damm, a longtime aide to
Reagan.
   ``I did not like him,'' said Lauder, a candidate for the
Republican nomination for mayor of New York City.
   ``There was something about him that bothered me,'' Lauder said
on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program. ``The more I got to know
him the more I realized there was something dramatically wrong.''
   However, Lauder said he did not suspect espionage.
   Bloch appeared to be more highly regarded among others. A former
Austrian official, Ernst Eugen Veselsky, called Bloch
``substantially more knowledgeable than others.''
   Bloch was born in Austria and left that country at age 3 with
his Jewish parents. Bloch is a graduate of the University of
Pennsylvania and holds a master's degree from the University of
California at Berkeley.
   He held a variety of State Department jobs, including economic
counselor at the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin in 1974. He later was
an inspector who traveled to various embassies.
   Mock told reporters in Austria that he learned of suspicions
about Bloch three weeks ago and that ``there was an allusion this
might go back to the 1970s.''

<HEAD>Sales of Military Items Power Rise in Durable Goods Orders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods,
powered by a surge in sales of military goods, rose a modest 0.3
percent in June, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$124.1 billion. The rise followed a large 4.4 percent decline in
May, the steepest in 10 months.
   The modest rebound was unlikely to persuade economists that
durable-goods sales, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive
sectors of the economy because buyers must usually borrow to
purchase them, are breaking out of their recent sluggish pattern.
   Early in June, the Federal Reserve Board nudged interest rates
down slightly, ending a year-long program of fighting inflation
with higher interest rates. The Fed's shift to easier credit likely
will take several months to influence sales, however.
   Excluding the volatile defense category, which swings widely
from month to month, new orders fell 0.7 percent last month
following a decline of 3.9 percent in May.
   Military orders shot up 15.8 percent in June to $8.8 billion
after dropping 11.4 percent in May and plunging 18.3 percent in
April.
   The closely watched category of non-defense capital goods, a
barometer of business investment plans, rose 0.5 percent in June to
$37.5 billion following a 7.7 percent plunge a month earlier.
   The Commerce Department offered these other details of activity
in June:
   _Non-electrical machinery orders rose 3.7 percent to $23.1
billion, reflecting an increase in purchases of steam engines and
turbines.
   _Electrical machinery gained 2.8 percent to $19.2 billion
following a 6.1 percent drop in May.
   _Transportation equipment declined 3.5 percent to $32.3 billion
following a 9.7 percent drop a month earlier. Most of the decline
came in motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding.
   _Primary metals, including steel, were off 5.0 percent to $12.0
billion following a 1.8 percent decline in May.
   For the first six months of the year, new orders totaled $755.1
billion, 8.2 percent higher than the first half of 1988. The figure
does not take inflation into account.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.1 percent to $121.6 billion in
June, following a 0.3 percent decline in May.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. John Conyers entered the race for
mayor, giving incumbent Coleman Young his stiffest challenge since
he first won the job almost 16 years ago.
   Conyers, 60, filed petitions for candidacy Monday with City
Clerk James Bradley. Amelie Allen, a worker in the clerk's office,
said Conyers had more than enough petitions to make him eligible.
   ``I'm asking myself if I'm doing the right thing,'' Conyers
said. ``One is never sure about these great decisions.''
   But after filing the petitions, he said, ``There's no turning
back.''
   Speculation that the powerful, 13-term Democratic congressman
would run increased after Conyers lambasted Young two weeks ago,
saying the mayor ``has an unbroken record of personal and political
mistakes in the last few years.''
   ``It's time for him to go,'' Conyers said of Young, who is
seeking his fifth 4-year term.
   Nominating petitions bearing 55,000 signatures also were filed
Monday on behalf of Young, spokesman Robert Berg said. Young had no
comment on Conyers' candidacy, Berg said.
   Young's critics have accused him of focusing on downtown
development in the nation's sixth-largest city at the expense of
neighborhoods. His years in office have seen a continuation of the
white and middle-class flight from the city to the suburbs.
   Observers say Conyers will force Young, who had planned on
ignoring other candidates and campaigning against the news media,
to go on the offensive.
   ``Coleman Young is an excellent campaigner, an excellent vote
getter, but he's never had an established black candidate running
against him _ and now he's got two,'' said political consultant
Jack Casey. He referred to City Council President Erma Henderson,
who is also running.
   ``What's going to be fascinating now is whether the black vote
will split,'' Casey said. ``If it does, white voters are going to
have a lot to say'' about who is elected.
   About 70 percent of Detroit's population of slightly more than 1
million is black.
   Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. He is
active in several rights organizations and is known battling South
Africa's apartheid policy.
   Two other candidates, accountant Thomas Barrow, whom Young
defeated in 1985; and businessman Charles Costa also filed
petitions Monday. Candidates have until today to be eligible to run
in the non-partisan Sept. 12 primary.

<HEAD>Pope Appoints Bishop in Byelorussia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today appointed the first
bishop in the Soviet republic of Byelorussia in more than 60 years,
underlining what the Vatican called a ``new spirit'' in
Soviet-Vatican relations.
   The pope named the Rev. Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz as apostolic
administrator of Minsk, capital of Byelorussia, to look after the
estimated 2 million Roman Catholics in the republic.
   The Vatican's deputy spokesman, Giovanni D'Ercole, said the
Vatican had informed Soviet and Byelorussian authorities of the
decision to appoint the bishop.
   ``These (authorities), in the new spirit established by the
Soviet government, politely let the holy father know they had no
difficulty in this regard,'' D'Ercole said in a written statement.
   As a sign of the changing times, D'Ercole said that on March 10
the pope had been able to appoint the first residential bishops in
Lithuania since the end of World War II.
   In another sign of the improving climate, last week the Vatican
and predominantly Roman Catholic Poland re-established full
diplomatic relations after a break of more than 40 years. Poland is
the first Soviet bloc country with diplomatic ties with the Holy
See.
   John Paul has said he is willing to meet with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he visits Italy in November, marking what
would be the first meeting between a pope and a Soviet leader.
   One of the main obstacles to improved Vatican-Soviet relations
is the status of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which was forcibly
merged with the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. However, Vatican
officials say there is a strong underground Ukrainian church and
exiles report hunger strikes and protests by Ukrainian faithful
demanding full recognition of their church.
   The pope has often expressed his desire to travel to the Soviet
Union, but only if he is allowed to visit his flock throughout the
country, including Lithuania, the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   D'Ercole said there are about 60 priests and 100 Catholic
churches in Byelorussia, which has a population of nearly 10
million.
   ``It's a community of Catholics with a deep faith that has
lasted and consolidated itself in the various trials of the
difficult years,'' he said.
   Kondrusiewicz, 43, was born in Odelsk in the Byelorussian
province of Grodno. He did his seminary studies in Lithuania and
was ordained a priest in May 1981. He served as a priest in
Vilnius, Lithuania, until he was transferred to Grodno in 1988.
   D'Ercole said the last bishop appointed by the Vatican in
Byelorussia was Monsignor Boleslaus Sloskans in 1926. He was jailed
the next year and eventually left for Belgium, where he lived in
exile until his death in 1981.

<HEAD>Executions, Economic Problems Dampen Spirits In Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The execution of four military officers on
drug-running charges and Cuba's nagging economic problems are
putting a damper on this year's festivities to mark Fidel Castro's
guerrilla origins.
   In Western countries, high-level corruption is often dismissed
as the product of human frailty. However, it has been taken more
seriously in Cuba, where the government takes pride in the
revolutionary rectitude of its leaders.
   ``There is no tradition for this sort of thing here,'' said one
Cuban official on condition of anonymity.
   Cuba has viewed signs of moral turpitude in the United States
and other Western countries as an outgrowth of capitalist
decadence, which communist societies are supposed to be able to
avoid.
   That theory took a beating at the trial of army Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez on charges of smuggling tons of drugs into
the United States in an alliance with Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel.
   Ochoa, once a trusted adviser to President Castro and a
designated hero of the 30-year-old Cuban revolution, had commanded
Cuban forces in Ethiopia and Angola. He also headed a Cuban
military mission in Nicaragua.
   He was executed with three other military officers on July 13.
Other officers convicted of corruption received lesser sentences.
   Castro has not spoken to the Cuban people about the episode, but
he is expected to do so Wednesday in Camaguey, 300 miles east of
Havana.
   The speech marks the 36th anniversary of Castro's debut as a
guerrilla fighter. The occasion is national holiday and kicks off
festivities throughout the island.
   As a reflection of the current mood in Havana, Western reporters
arriving to cover the speech were told to avoid human rights
activists and the relatives of Ochoa or others put to death.
   Reversing a policy of greater tolerance, authorities told
reporters that violations of these restrictions could lead to
expulsion from Cuba or denial of future visa requests.
   An Associated Press reporter, who was absent when the warning
was issued, interviewed Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban
Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
   Sanchez called the executions ``murder under legalistic cover,''
saying Ochoa and other defendants were denied adequate legal help.
   This charge was denied by the Jurists' Union of Cuba, which said
the defense attorneys carried out their duties with ``great
professionalism.''
   Supporters of the revolution expressed satisfaction with how the
Ochoa case was handled, including the decision to execute the
defendants.
   Sanchez said the trials occurred at a time of growing economic
and political problems.
   This view was shared privately by a government official, who
said the current period is among the most challenging the
revolution has faced.
   ``These are difficult times, indeed,'' he said.
   Sanchez said the economy ``is suffering a slow but sustained
deterioration.''
   His remarks appeared to be borne out by widespread scarcity of
food and other consumer goods.
   The only sign of bread at one bakery in western Havana were
pictures of biscuits and other baked goods on a wall behind the
counter. On the bare shelves, a sign promised bread in two hours.
   Insufficient wheat deliveries from the Soviet Union are blamed
for the bread shortages.

   Thundershowers rumbled across Manitoba
and Saskatchewan today, sending light rain on hundreds of forest
fires that have blackened more than 2.2 million acres.
   Canadian officials held out hope that more rain later today
would relieve the fires, which have forced the evacuation of more
than 19,000 people from northern Manitoba.
   Pilots trying to pick up people fleeing the fires have been
frustrated by smoke so thick it turns the sun into a reddish smudge.
   ``There's no sunlight to speak of at all,'' Northern Affairs
Minister Jim Downey said after returning from the sparsely
populated wooded region on Monday. ``It's like dusk in the middle
of the afternoon.''
   Downey had flown with Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon to Thompson,
The Pas and Flin Flon, where evacuatees were being taken.
   Hot, dry winds blew flames perilously close to native
settlements and mining towns and officials said thick smoke
hindered evacuation efforts.
   ``It's sometimes an hour-to-hour situation, waiting for the
smoke to lift to a point where a plane can land,'' said provincial
government spokeswoman Diana Soroka.
   Thompson, a mining city of about 15,000, has taken in more than
3,000 evacuees. It was many miles from the nearest fire Monday, but
the city's airport was temporarily shut down because of the smoke.
   The fire zone begins about 250 miles north of Winnipeg and
stretches about 220 miles from northeastern Saskatchewan to
northwestern Ontario.
   Officials estimated 224 fires were burning in Manitoba on
Monday, but said that might not be accurate because they could not
see the fire for the smoke.
   Soroka said some evacuees were being taken to Brandon and
Winnipeg in the south: ``We're taking them wherever the room is.''
She said people were being evacuated by plane, train and car.
   The province has not yet had to use its powers under the state
of emergency declared Sunday, which include being able to
commandeer private property.
   Military transport planes, helicopters, hoses, pumps, tents, and
other materials have been pouring in from other parts of Canada and
the United States.
   About 1,600 firefighters, 53 helicopters, 11 waterbombers, nine
fixed-wing aircraft and several pieces of heavy equipment, such as
bulldozers, have been thrown into the effort.
   It's estimated $25 million will be spent by the end of the week,
compared with $15 million for the whole season last year.
   But the only thing firefighters can do is hold the lines around
communities _ so far they have been relatively successful. Only a
few houses and lodges have burned, and there have been no reports
of injuries or deaths.

   A man who came home to find his house
being burglarized for the fifth time won't be arrested for shooting
two alleged burglars to death and seriously wounding a third,
police said. The suspects were shot while trying to drive away.
   The case of Terry Duncan, 27, probably will be referred to a
grand jury, but for now, he is a free man, Police Sgt. Gary
Westphal said Monday.
   ``These three people were breaking into his home and he's been
burglarized before,'' said police Sgt. Gary Westphal. ``These
people were armed. I believe under the Texas Penal Code, he can
protect his home in this manner. He can use up to deadly force.''
   Duncan had been coming home from work periodically to check his
house, police said, because it has been burglarized four times in
the past two years and there had been a recent series of burglaries
in the neighborhood. His wife and two children were away when the
shooting occurred at 11 a.m Monday.
   Duncan told police he shot the men when they ignored his
warnings and tried to drive off, Westphal said.
   The men were unarmed at the time they were shot, but two pistols
were found in the car, police said.
   Two men died from gunshot wounds to the head, Westphal said. The
third man was in stable condition with an arm wound at Dallas
Parkland Hospital.
   Names of the dead and injured were not released immediately.
   A home alarm sounded several minutes before Duncan arrived at
the home, but he hadn't been notified by the alarm company, police
said.
   Duncan told police he arrived to find one man sitting in a car
in front of his house. The man in the car yelled, and two men
emerged from a broken window, he reported.
   Duncan got a .44 Magnum lever-action rifle from his pickup
truck, positioned himself behind a tree, and ordered the three to
stop, he told police. When they didn't, he opened fire, the
homeowner reported.
   Duncan's father, Dallas police Sgt. Sherman Duncan, was killed
in December 1984 while working off-duty at a bar, officials said.

<DATELINE>SALUDA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three black teen-agers from a church group
were barred from a whites-only swimming pool owned by the Jaycees,
who promised to investigate the incident.
   The company that operates the pool for the Jaycees refused to
admit the teens on July 13 because the land on which it sits was
willed to the club with a provision that blacks be excluded, Saluda
Jaycees President Rickie Turner said Monday.
   The teens were part of a group of 50 youths and adults who
repair homes for the poor in a United Methodist Church volunteer
program.
   Workers for the Saluda Swim and Tennis Club, which runs the pool
for the Jaycees, offered to allow whites in the group to swim, but
the entire group left, said Willie Teague, editor of the church
newspaper.
   ``It's a rather sad commentary on the progress that we hoped we
had made but apparently had not,'' said Teague, who wasn't present.
``It says that racism is still alive and well in South Carolina.''
   The Saluda Swim and Tennis Club isn't listed in the local
telephone directory.
   The United States Jaycees will look into the incident, said Dave
Nershi, the group's executive director of marketing.
   ``Obviously it is not something that an organization such as
ours can tolerate,'' Nershi said. ``The fact that it happened to a
group of volunteers only makes it that much more unconscionable.''
   The Jaycees, which number 240,000 nationally, prohibit
discrimination based on race, sex or creed.
   Local Jaycees president Turner, who owns a service station,
said, ``As far as I'm concerned, they should have let the people
swim and let them go on.''

<HEAD>Existing Homes Sales Rebounded 5.9 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rebounded 5.9 percent
in June following five months without a gain, a real estate trade
group said today, attributing the rise to a decline in mortgage
rates and falling prices.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.40 million units in June, up from May's rate of 3.21 million
units. It was the first increase in sales since December 1988 and
the largest increase since December 1986, when sales jumped 6.6
percent.
   The group also noted what it described as a small increase in
the median sales price, which was $93,200 in June, up $600 from May
and 3.2 percent from a year earlier.
   ``For the most part, buyers coming into the market in June are
the most vulnerable to rate swings. They're getting in while they
can, buying the most they can. The homes they're buying tend to be
in the moderate price range,'' said Realtors President Ira Gribin.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., fixed-rate
mortgages peaked at 11.22 percent in late March and have been
falling since, hitting 9.87 percent last week. During June, they
fell from 10.48 percent to 10.07 percent.
   Economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America said he expected sales to recover modestly through the rest
of the year. But, he said sluggish economic and job growth overall
will prevent a strong resurgence.
   Regionally, sales were led by an 18.5 percent jump in the
Midwest to an annual rate of 960,000 units, the highest level since
December. Sales rose 5.2 percent in the West to 610,000 units and
4.1 percent in the South to 1.28 million units.
   In the Northeast, however, sales fell 9.8 percent to a rate of
550,000 units, the lowest since February 1985.
   Economist John A. Tuccillo of the Realtors said Midwestern sales
are being bolstered by relatively low prices, while the rapid rise
in prices in the Northeast over the past several years is
preventing a sales rebound there.

   Demanding Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
resign, opposition members today shouted insults and walked out of
Parliament's upper house a day after opposition lawmakers in the
lower house resigned en masse.
   The opposition is protesting alleged corruption in the Gandhi
government and is insisting that the prime minister step down and
call new elections.
   The demand for Gandhi's resignation stemmed from an auditor's
report that criticized the government for irregularities in the
1986 purchase of artillery from the Swedish firm AB Bofors.
   The opposition alleges that members of the government received
kickbacks.
   The governing Congress Party called today's move by 12
opposition parties ``a stunt and gimmick'' before the general
elections, which Gandhi must call by January.
   The 12 parties control 106 seats in the 544-member lower house,
or Lok Sabha. Gandhi's party has a solid majority in the house and
the opposition departure is not likely to affect parliament's
functioning.
   Opposition leaders said they were giving up their seats hoping
the purchase would become a major issue in the elections.
   The 90 opposition members in the upper house, or Rajya Sabha,
were asked to keep their seats to try to obstruct legislation
passed by the lower house. Formal approval from the Rajya Sabha is
needed before a law can be enacted.
   Before storming out of the 245-member house, opposition members
chanted: ``We want resignation'' as Gandhi watched impassively.
   As the din continued, house Chairman Shankar Dayal Sharma said
``the house cannot be held ransom.'' One opposition member replied:
``The prime minister is holding the country to ransom.''
   Both houses of Parliament have stalled since the Comptroller and
Auditor General's report on the gun deal was put before Parliament
on July 18.
   The $1.4 billion deal to purchase howitzers has been a major
scandal for Gandhi's government because of allegations that Bofors
bribed government officials and senior Congress Party members to
secure the contract.
   Newspapers and opposition politicians say bribes up to at least
$50 million were paid. The allegations have never been proved and a
parliamentary committee investigation the deal last year concluded
there was no evidence of kickbacks.
   The auditor general's report said the arms purchase was flawed
on technical considerations and cost assessment.
   Opposition leaders have previously demanded Gandhi's resignation
on the issue, but the 44-year-old prime minister has repeatedly
said he was not involved in any wrongdoing.

   Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to
American workers rose 4.5 percent in the 12 months ending in June,
the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures, was pushed
ahead both by rising wage costs and higher benefit costs.
   Wage pressures have intensified every quarter since June of
1988, when the Employment Cost Index rose above the 4 percent level
for the first time.
   In another sign of higher wage pressures, the Labor Department
said today that major collective bargaining settlements reached in
the first six months of 1989 provided average wage increases of 3.7
percent in the first year of the contract, up from a 2.1 percent
average first-year increase the last time these contracts were
negotiated.
   Over the life of the contracts, the settlements negotiated in
the first six months of this year called for average increases of
3.3 percent annually, compared to 2.5 percent average annual
increases the last time the contracts were negotiated.
   The various signs of increasing wage pressures have raised
concerns among economists that tight labor markets are pushing
labor costs higher and making the country's inflation problems
worse.
   The Federal Reserve last year began pushing interest rates
higher in an effort to slow the economy and lower the inflation
rate.
   That inflation-fighting effort has caused the unemployment rate
to edge up slightly in the recent months as economic growth slows.
Because of this, many economists believe that wage increases will
moderate in coming months.
   The 4.5 percent rise in the cost index for private industry
workers covered total compensation, which includes wages, salaries
and the employer costs of providing such benefits as health
insurance.
   The wage and salary component of the index climbed by 4.1
percent in the 12 months ending in June while benefit costs rose a
faster 5.6 percent.
   The increase in wages and salaries reflected in part the
influence of relatively large pay gains for sales workers, a
segment which is heavily influenced by volatile commission
earnings, the Labor Department said.
   Workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than
the manufacturing sector in pay gains. Service industries saw wages
and salaries go up by 4.7 percent in the past 12 months compared to
a 3.2 percent rise for the manufacturing sector.
   This gain reflects the fact that service industries have been
more affected by shortages of workers in the past year.
   However, there was a wide split in the services category. At the
low end of the increases, wages in the transportation sector and
communications industry rose just 1.9 percent while wages at
hospitals shot up 6.4 percent. Wages climbed an even faster 7.6
percent in finance, insurance and real estate but this increase was
influenced by commission earnings.
   The 4.5 percent increase in total compensation for private
industry over the 12 months ending in June was close to a 4.6
percent rise in the 12 months ending in March.
   The 4.1 percent rise in wages and salaries was close to a 4.2
percent increase for the 12 months ending in March, a gain which
had been the highest increase in more than three years.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Mount First New Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Beijing students rallied to vent
their anger over the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement,
students said today. It was the first protest reported since the
movement was suppressed in early June.
   At least 300 Beijing University students gathered outside their
dormitories Sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patroitic
songs and to mourn those who died in the crackdown, said students
who participated.
   They also were protesting that some work units, especially in
government offices, have rejected some students assigned to work
for them after expressing doubts about the students' ideological
purity, the students said.
   After about an hour, the students marched to the campus area
where students had put up thousands of political posters during the
spring democracy movement, said the participants.
   They sang and beat pots and pans to mourn classmates who were
killed June 3-4 when troops opened fire on student protesters and
their supporters, the students said.
   China has said nearly 200 people died, but Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as
high as 3,000.
   One student said some young teachers, housed in a dormitory next
to the poster area, joined Sunday's protest and lit firecrackers
before the head of the school's Communist Party office ordered them
all to go home.
   The student said school officials are investigating those who
participated in the two-hour event, but no one had been punished
yet.
   He said seniors, the only ones left on campus now, feel
oppressed by the monthlong ideological study classes they have been
forced to attend in order to graduate.
   ``No one dares to say what he really thinks. We all have to tell
lies,'' he said.
   The student said his classmates on Sunday night sarcastically
sang patriotic songs like ``Without the Communist Party, There
Would Be No New China'' and repeatedly shouted ``Long Live the
Communist Party.''
   In their political education classes, the students must study
top leaders' essays and speeches on the student movement, which the
government now calls a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   After reading and discussion, the students are required to write
essays about what they learned, how their mistaken thinking was
corrected, and what they did during the protests.
   The seniors are allowed to graduate only after they have
submitted an acceptable essay. Students returning in the fall also
will undergo political education.
   Students said the ideological training was not enough to satisfy
some work units that the students assigned to them are politically
acceptable, students said.
   No one seemed to know exactly how many students have been
rejected by their work units, but a student said all but one of
those assigned to the State Security Bureau have been rejected.
   Job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown.
Most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government.
   One government employee, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he was told to investigate a Beijing University student
assigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in the
student movement.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects State's Move to Block New Trial for Gary Dotson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Dotson, who was freed from prison after a
woman recanted testimony that he raped her, isn't barred by the
statute of limitations from getting a new trial, a judge ruled.
   The ruling Monday by Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald clears
the way for a hearing on Dotson's request for a new trial to clear
his name in the widely publicized case.
   The judge rejected a state prosecutor's assertion that the
two-year statute of limitations barring tardy prosecution applies
to Dotson's decade-old case. He also rejected the state's argument
that newly developed genetic tests Dotson wants to use in his
defense are irrelevant.
   ``We're going to prove once and for all that he didn't do it,''
Dotson's sister, Laura, said after the hearing. Dotson, 32, who is
in an alcoholism treatment center as a condition of parole, didn't
attend.
   Dotson was sentenced in 1979 to 25 to 50 years in prison for the
1977 rape of Cathleen Crowell, who later married and became
Cathleen Webb. In 1985, Ms. Webb recanted her testimony, saying she
made up the attack because she feared she had become pregnant by
her boyfriend.
   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency, saying his
punishment had been sufficient. But the governor said he did not
believe Ms. Webb's about-face, and has refused to pardon Dotson.
   The judge set a hearing for Aug. 14, at which he is expected to
schedule a hearing to determine if there should be a new trial.
   The defense hopes to use new genetic tests to show that semen
found on Ms. Webb's underwear wasn't Dotson's.
   At Monday's hearing, State's Attorney Gayle Shines argued that
the defense failed to prove the test results have ``a substantial
probability'' of changing the outcome of the original trial, a
requirement for granting a new trial.
   The absense of Dotson's semen does not prove he didn't rape the
woman, she argued.

<TEXT>
   An American diplomat suspected of spying for
the Soviets gave the Austrian government information about a
classified U.S. probe against President Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past,
sources say.
   Felix S. Bloch served as the deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna at the time of Waldheim's June 1986 election and the U.S.
Justice Department probe of his record as an intelligence officer
in the German army during World War II.
   Bloch ``had inappropriate contacts with the Austrian government
on some important matters,'' said his former boss Ronald Lauder,
now a Republican New York City mayoral candidate, who served as
ambassador to Austria in 1986 and 1987.
   Lauder said he did not like his deputy, a veteran State
Department officer who served in Vienna since 1980, and asked for
him to be recalled in 1987. Bloch was called home two months after
Waldheim was placed on a list of people banned from the United
States for Nazi activities.
   A classified Justice Department probe found evidence that
Waldheim knew of and facilitated Nazi atrocities in the Balkans.
But it took a year, during which Austria and some U.S. officials
lobbied against restricting Waldheim, until he was placed on the
so-called ``watchlist'' in April 1987.
   The decision led to a virtual boycott by Western governments of
the Austrian leader, whose job is largely ceremonial.
   Bloch was very close to a major Waldheim backer, Foreign
Minister Alois Mock, and he ``constantly provided him with
information on the status of the Waldheim investigation and the
watchlist decisions,'' said one source familiar with the affair.
   ``They were very tight'' from the days in the 1950s when Mock
and the Austrian-born Bloch studied together in Italy, said a
government source, who also requested anonymity.
   ``Bloch was clearly uncomfortable with the decision on
Waldheim,'' said the source. ``It stuck in my mind,'' he added.
   The sources spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Bloch, 54, was born to Jewish parents in Vienna and emigrated
with them to the United States at the age of 3 before the outbreak
of World War II.
   Bloch, who has not been charged with any crime, was videotaped
by U.S. officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to a known
Soviet KGB agent in Paris, according to U.S. sources.
   At a Vienna news conference Monday, Mock said he had discussed
``all aspects'' of U.S.-Austrian relations with Bloch, but added
there was ``nothing in particular'' that he regretted telling his
American college friend.
   Bloch and his wife, Lucille, first met Mock in Bologna, Italy,
where they studied under the auspices of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins
University in 1957-58.
   ``We then lost track of each other, but I met him again in 1970,
when he was in Berlin,'' said Mock. He said he last saw Bloch last
fall and intended to see him again on a U.S. trip scheduled to
start Tuesday. He has since canceled the trip.
   Mrs. Bloch was asked last year to take over running the
Austrian-American Foundation, a tax-deductible organization that
promotes cultural links between the two countries.
   ``It was flagging. She was asked to inject some life into it''
to promote Austria's image, which was eroded by the Waldheim
affair, said one Austrian familiar with the matter.
   The organization, which was previously headquartered in New
York, moved to Washington to accommodate Mrs. Bloch's wishes and
took up offices one block from the White House.
   Meanwhile, the World Jewish Congress, which led the campaign
against Waldheim in 1986, issued a statement saying it was shocked
to hear from Lauder that Mock ``was dealing behind the back of the
U.S. ambassador with a U.S. official at the time when the Waldheim
investigation was under way in the United States.''

<HEAD>Third White House Guard Placed on Administrative Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third White House guard has been placed on
administrative leave as the Secret Service investigates late-night
tours of the executive mansion given a lobbyist and his friends, a
spokesman said today.
   Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams said the uniformed guard,
whom he refused to identify, worked some of the same shifts as
Officer Reginald deGueldre and another uniformed guard placed on
administrative leave earlier.
   DeGueldre has acknowledged he admitted lobbyist Craig Spence and
his party to the White House for a private after-hours tour of the
West Wing in July 1988. The guard also said he accepted an $8,000
gold Rolex watch from Spence and took several pieces of china from
the White House, according to published reports and court documents.
   DeGueldre has denied doing anything illegal.
   The Washington Times has reported that Spence was a customer of
a homosexual prostitution ring under investigation by U.S. Attorney
Jay Stephens for possible credit card fraud. The Secret Service,
which has jurisdiction over credit card crimes, also is working on
that case.
   The service is also conducting its own internal investigation
into whether uniformed guards violated procedures in admitting
people to the White House, or committed any crimes, such as theft,
Adams said.

   A B-52 bomber caught fire on the ground while
being refueled at Kelly Air Force Base, killing one person and
injuring 11 others, officials said.
   The cause of the accident late Monday was under investigation,
said Lt. Col. Ed Cooke, a base spokesman. The plane, which had just
undergone a mechanical overhaul and wasn't carrying bombs, was
``very heavily damaged'' in the accident, he said.
   ``I heard four to five large explosions about 11 p.m. and saw
flames leaping 15 to 20 feet in the air,'' Jim Fisher, a San
Antonio school teacher who lives near the base.
   Flames could be seen from up to one mile away, witnesses said.
   Cooke said the B-52, built in 1958, was undergoing ``depot-level
maintenance,'' a 3{- to 4-month process in which the plane is
virtually stripped and reassembled. He added planes are scheduled
for the maintenance ``every couple of years.''
   The fact that it was being refueled indicated the plane probably
was being prepared for a test flight, one of the final stages in
the repair process, Cooke said. The plane had been scheduled to
return Friday to its home base at Barksdale Air Force Base in
Shreveport, La.
   The dead man was identified as Jesus Pedraza, 38, a civilian
employee of the Air Force, said First Lt. Dave Ebner, a base
spokesman.
   The injured, all civilian workers, included Herman Morris, in
serious condition at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, and
Juan Garcia, Adam Najera and Wayne Holland, in fair condition at
Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center. Seven others were treated
and discharged.
   The fire was put out in less than one hour, Cooke said. There
were no immediate reports of damage to any of the base's facilities.

   The Soviets are showing extraordinary interest
in the spy investigation against State Department official Felix S.
Bloch _ even tailing him and the FBI to New York _ despite a U.S.
warning not to interfere.
   The unusual Soviet surveillance shows ``they have a lot invested
in this,'' said a government source familiar with the case.
   The United States cautioned the Soviet Union against trying to
smuggle Bloch out of the country, it was learned Monday evening.
The warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the
30-year career diplomat was suspected of spying.
   Still, Bloch and a caravan of FBI agents were followed by Soviet
Embassy personnel on Saturday from Washington to a New York City
suburb, the government source said.
   Another source said that while premature disclosure of the
investigation had hampered the government's ability to complete the
probe, ``They have still got a good case'' against Bloch.
   Formerly the No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, the
54-year-old diplomat was placed on leave with pay on June 22. He
has surrendered his diplomatic passport and his State Department
credentials, but has not been charged with any crime nor has his
travel been restricted.
   Nevertheless, President Bush on Monday called the allegations
``a very serious matter.''
   Two U.S. sources said Monday that Bloch had been videotaped
handing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris earlier this year.
Another source said the KGB had tipped Bloch that he was under U.S.
surveillance before he was suspended from his job on June 22.
   ABC News said the warning came in a telephone call intercepted
by U.S. agents in which the Soviet agent told Bloch, ``A bad virus
is going around and we believe you are infected.''
   Bloch is refusing through an attorney to be questioned by the
FBI but submitted to a brief interview by State Department security
officers early in the investigation, according to a government
source who, like others providing details on the case, spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
   Counterintelligence experts said even if Bloch were a spy, it
was too soon to know what secrets he compromised.
   But they said the damage could be far different than that
inflicted in other recent spy cases, such as those of the John
Walker ring in the Navy or National Security Agency technician
Ronald Pelton. They were low-ranking American officials who
compromised coding equipment and spying techniques that are very
costly to replace.
   Unlike the military or U.S. intelligence agencies, which have
been forced to deal with a number of recent spy cases, the State
Department's foreign service has prided itself on being
comparatively free of such problems.
   The last was in 1961 when Irvin Scarbeck, second secretary of
the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, was convicted of passing secrets to the
East. The most famous State Department spy case involved Alger
Hiss, convicted in 1950 of lying to Congress about passing secrets
to Whittaker Chambers.
   Some experts said this case might seriously damage the morale of
the foreign service. ``The one thing they could say was: `We're
different. Our people don't go marching in to the other side
because of resentments or whatever,''' one source said.
   Bloch most recently has been director of the Office of Regional
Political-Economic Affairs on the State Department's European desk.
Before that, while in Vienna, he at one point lobbied to keep
Austrian Prime Minister Kurt Waldheim off the ``watchlist'' of
people banned from the United States for Nazi activities during
World War II, a government source said.
   Waldheim eventually was placed on the list in April 1987, a move
that infuriated many Austrians.
   After Bloch fell under suspicion, the Soviets were informed
through diplomatic channels, in a message described as
``discreet,'' that U.S. relations with Moscow would be damaged if
they tried to make off with the diplomat, a U.S. official disclosed.
   ``So far, they have observed the admonition,'' said the official.
   But FBI agents tailing Bloch on Saturday on a trip to New York
were followed in turn by Soviet Embassy personnel, according to
another government source.
   The Soviets followed a caravan of FBI agents driving behind
Bloch from Washington to Chappaqua, N.Y., where one of his
daughters lives. Town police said the caravan arrived Saturday
afternoon.
   While many Soviet diplomats may not travel more than 50 miles
from their post, others have permission to make trips like the
Washington-New York drive. The Soviets are required to drive cars
with diplomatic license plates, which have letter codes designating
the country using the vehicle.
   In ABC's initial report on the spy case last Friday, the network
said Soviet officials had been seen watching Bloch's Washington
apartment.

<HEAD>General Strike In Abkhazian Capital; Death Toll Rises to 21</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general strike today idled much of the Black Sea
capital in the Abkhazian enclave of Soviet Georgia, and the death
toll from ethnic unrest in the republic rose.
   The strike in Sukhumi came a day after an estimated 18,000
people in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, demonstrated against the
killing of Georgians by Abkhazians. A Georgian activist said other
strikes have shut down 50 factories in the republic.
   The official Tass news agency reported that all public transit
was halted and half the commercial enterprises were shut down in
Sukhumi, a resort city 880 miles south of Moscow.
   Twenty-one people have died in the violence in Abkhazia and
Georgia since the groups began fighting July 15, Tass quoted
Interior Ministry officials as saying. The death toll stood at 19
on Monday, and the circumstances of the additional fatalities were
not clear.
   Soviet media reports have not specified the nationalities of
each victim.
   Two people were arrested Monday in the Ochamchir section of
Abkhazia on suspicion of having killed a police officer and a cadet
Saturday, the report said.
   Roving bands of armed Georgians and Abkhazians have staged more
than 50 attacks on police and other government installations, in
many cases seizing weapons, according to official reports.
   Authorities have arrested 34 people for allegedly taking part in
the unrest and 221 for violating a region-wide curfew, and they
have seized about 5,000 weapons, Tass reported.
   Speakers at the rally in Tbilisi on Monday demanded independence
for Georgia, one of 15 Soviet republics.
   In Tbilisi today, 30 students were staging a sit-in and three
had started a hunger strike in favor of Georgian secession.
   Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a leader of the Georgian National
Independence Party, said about 50 factories in Georgia were taking
part in a strike and that mass meetings would be held every evening
until protesters' demands were resolved.
   Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest.
Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greater
economic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want the
fertile enclave, with its myriad seaside resorts, retained as part
of their Caucasus republic.
   The violence this month broke out after the state university in
Sukhumi set up a new branch that was to teach courses exclusively
in Georgian.
   At least 134 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past
month in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.
   In Novy Uzen in Kazakhstan, where ethnic Kazakhs clashed with
settlers from the Caucasus in mid-June, a curfew was lifted Monday
after more than a month, Tass reported.

<HEAD>Tamils Vow to Set Up Separate State, Indian Embassy Families Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Tamil groups today declared they
will try to establish a separate state in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   The announcement was a rebuff of President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
who on Monday sent three Cabinet ministers to urge the
Tamil-controlled provincial council in Trincomalee to support his
efforts to get Indian troops to leave Sri Lanka.
   At a news conference in the city 150 miles northeast of Colombo,
the groups said they founded a Tamil National Council and will seek
a ``Tamil homeland that shall be fully responsible for the
Tamil-speaking people.''
   India has said its troops, who began arriving July 30, 1987,
cannot leave until they complete their mission of disarming other
Tamil groups and the provincial council in Trincomalee is allowed
to exercise more local autonomy.
   Also today, about 40 wives and children of Indian diplomats left
Sri Lanka to avoid any trouble that might arise this weekend, the
deadline set by Premadasa for the departure of Indian troops.
   About 40 other relatives of Indian diplomats and security
staffers at the high commission, returned to India on Sunday,
according to a spokesman for the high commission, or embassy.
   A shadowy group called the Workers Action Front, believed to
have links with Sinhalese extremists, called for a three-day
protest against the Indian presence starting Wednesday.
   Sinhalese radicals accuse the government of making too many
concessios to Tamil separatists and not doing enough to get the
Indian troops to leave.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Tamils, who make up 18 percent, say the Sinhalese discriminate
against them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.
   Military sources today reported 10 more killings of Sinhalese in
the past two days in Colombo and the Sinhalese heartland of
southern and central Sri Lanka. Ultranationalist Sinhalese from the
People's Liberation Front were blamed for seven of the deaths, and
the three others were front guerrillas killed by security forces.

   Ku Klux Klansmen who clashed with black
marchers in 1979 must attend a course on race relations taught by
civil rights leaders as part of a settlement of a civil lawsuit.
   The settlement was to be filed today in U.S. District Court in
Huntsville, but had not reached the court by mid-morning, a clerk
said. In addition to mandating the civil rights course, it requires
Roger Handley, former grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, and nine other Alabama Klansmen to pay $11,500 in damages to
the marchers.
   ``Our goal has always been to try and change the hearts and
minds of those whose racial beliefs lead to violence against us,''
said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Atlanta-based
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Neither Handley nor his attorney, Dan Willingham, could be
reached for comment today. A person at Handley's home said he
couldn't come to the telephone and Willingham was reported out of
his office until later in the day.
   Klanwatch, a group operated by the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery, filed the civil lawsuit in 1980 on behalf of the
SCLC, which had organized the 1979 march in Decatur.
   ``It is an historic moment when the president of the group
founded by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an ardent practitioner of
nonviolence, stands before the grand dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux
Klan and expresses Dr. King's message of love,'' Lowery said in a
statement released Monday by Klanwatch.
   The settlement also requires several Klansmen to perform
community service and refrain from harassing blacks or joining any
Klan or white supremacist group for periods of up to five years.
   ``Probably the most unique aspect of this case is that seven of
the defendants have to attend a race relations course,'' said Pat
Clark, director of Klanwatch. ``We must find a way to change
attitudes and give people an opportunity to assess their
wrongdoings.''
   She said details of the two-hour course, which probably will be
taught in Birmingham next spring, have yet to be worked out.
   The suit was filed in 1980 after Klanwatch investigators
uncovered new evidence that eventually prompted the Justice
Department to reopen its investigation of the May 26, 1979,
incident.
   A group of robed Klansmen clashed with black marchers in Decatur
who were protesting the conviction the year before of a 19-year-old
mentally retarded black man for raping three white women. Gunfire
erupted during the incident, and two Klansmen and two blacks were
wounded.
   Ten Klan members, including Handley, the top Klansman in Alabama
at the time of the incident, were indicted in 1984 on civil rights
charges. All were either convicted or pleaded guilty. Earlier this
year, Handley and six of his cohorts drew federal sentences ranging
from two months to two years.
   Ms. Clark said the settlement of the civil lawsuit, which came
after several months of negotiations, brought the 10-year-old case
to a close.

   LA CELLE-SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Cambodia's Hanoi-backed
government and three guerrilla factions broke off talks today
without even an agreement on who would take part in an
international peace conference set to begin Sunday.
   ``I'm totally pessimistic,'' said Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
representing one of three rebel groups meeting with Prime Minister
Hun Sen in the talks in a chateau in this suburb southwest of Paris.
   Sihanouk insisted that Cambodia be represented at the conference
opening Sunday by all four factions: his own, another non-communist
group, the communist Khmer Rouge and Prime Minister Hun Sen's
government.
   However, Hun Sen said there should be just two Cambodian
representatives _ Sihanouk and himself.
   A sticking point throughout complicated negotiations has been
the role of the Khmer Rouge in the talks and later in the formation
of a proposed transitional government following the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.
   Today's meeting was intended to be a search for common ground
among the Cambodian groups to prepare for the international
conference.
   But Hun Sen said the discussions were at an impasse, and blamed
the presence of the Khmer Rouge, who were represented today by
Khieu Samphan.
   ``It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot
continue its journey,'' Hun Sen said.
   While there were no more talks planned among the leaders, Hun
Sen said he hoped that lower-level contacts would continue, and
that the international peace conference could open Sunday as
planned.
   At his news conference, Hun Sen announced that the Vietnamese
pullout would be complete by Sept. 27.
   ``The final total withdrawal will take place from Sept. 21 to 26
by way of land, river and sea routes,'' he said.
   Previously, Vietnam has promised to have its troops out by Sept.
30.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, to end a three-year
reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge in which hundreds of thousands
of Cambodians were killed.
   There are fears the Khmer Rouge could trigger renewed civil war
if they are given a share of power in an interim government, as
Sihanouk demands.
   Sihanouk has the backing of many Western nations, including the
United States, but there has been increasing international support
for reaching a settlement that does not include the Khmer Rouge.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Monday
that preventing a return to power of the Khmer Rouge must be a key
element in any settlement.
   In Thailand, Western analysts and Thai military officers said
fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border, where many refugee camps
are located, intensified in recent days.
   The sources said 26 wounded soldiers had been brought to the
International Red Cross hospital at Kap Choeng, compared to an
average number of wounded of a dozen per month.
   Last week, shelling believed to have been conducted by
pro-Vietnamese troops forced the evacuation of nearly 40,000
refugees from a Khmer Rouge border refugee camp known as Site 8.
Most have since returned the sprawling encampment.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Ruling On Handicapped Access To Transportation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE RULE</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transit agencies still intend to buy buses
with wheelchair lifts even though a federal court overturned a
ruling that requires the lifts, according to attorneys for
handicapped groups.
   The court upheld a federal provision that gives local agencies
the right to decide how to serve the handicapped _ through
accessible buses, alternate transit services or a combination.
   The ruling by the full 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Monday overturned an earlier ruling by the U.S. District Court and
a three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit.
   The appeals court found that the lower courts had overstepped
the boundaries of a lawsuit filed in 1988 by the American Disabled
for Accessible Public Transit, or ADAPT, and several other groups.
   A federal regulation already requires agencies to make new buses
accessible to the handicapped, and the groups filing the lawsuit
never argued anyone was violating the provision, Circuit Judge
Edward R. Becker wrote.
   The issue has become a rallying point for handicapped activists,
with groups calling on the Bush administration in February to let
the original 3rd Circuit ruling stand.
   Timothy Cook, who argued the case for ADAPT, said Monday night
that ``we don't think anyone will read this to mean that buses
won't have lifts.''
   Attorney Michael Churchill, who also represents ADAPT, said that
although the judges didn't specifically say so, ``this court seems
to believe that the purchase of all buses should be of those that
are accessible.''
   ADAPT had argued the provision on local discretion conflicted
with the regulation on accessible buses, but the court disagreed.
   The federal regulation strikes ``a balance between preserving
local discretion, avoiding the imposition of unduly burdensome
costs and ensuring adequate transportation services for the
handicapped,'' Becker wrote.
   The government has estimated that mass transit authorities
across the country would pay a total of $90 million a year on the
lifts.
   Churchill said he would wait to see how the Transportation
Department interprets the ruling before deciding on an appeal.

<HEAD>Government Says Rebels Downed Military Transport Plane, Killing 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government news agency ANGOP claimed
today that rebels shot down a military transport plane with 48
aboard, killing 42.
   Spokesman for the rebels in Washington and the U.S. State
Department said they had heard no word of the reported Sunday
attack, and the claim could not be independently verified.
   The plane, a Soviet-built, twin-engine Antonov 26, was carrying
a delegation of regional officials from Luena to Cazombo in eastern
Moxico province Sunday when it was hit in the left engine by a
missile, a military official said.
   The plane crashed about 25 miles west of Cazombo, the official
said.
   An unidentified military source, quoted by the Portuguese news
agency Lusa, said the downing of the plane ``is more than a
cease-fire violation. ... Angola cannot tolerate (the rebels)
continuing to act with impunity.''
   In Washington, spokesmen for State Department and the
U.S.-supported rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola said they had heard no word of the reported
attack.
   Reports of the attack and a spate of other cease-fire violations
come six days before peace talks are to begin in Zaire between the
Marxist government and the rebels.
   The rebels on Sunday attacked and occupied the towns of
Quimbele, and Cuimba in northern Uige province close to the Zairean
border, the Luanda official said.
   Rebel forces on Monday ambushed vehicles in Lunda South
province, killing 16 people, and fired mortars over Kuito, the
provincial capital of Bie, killing two or three people, he added.
   The government delegation in the plane was apparently on its way
to Cazombo as part of a recent national program to explain to
provincial populations the terms of an agreement reached with UNITA
on June 22, the official said.
   Both government forces and UNITA rebels have accused each other
of violating the cease-fire that began June 24 but lasted only one
week.
   The rebels have been fighting Cuban-backed government troops
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975.

<TEXT>
   Strikes that swept across Soviet coal fields for
two weeks dwindled today to scattered stoppages, but new walkouts
broke out in Estonia while the country's legislature debated how to
deter future strikes.
   In the Donetsk coal basin, the country's largest, local
officials said most of the Ukranian region's 300,000 strikers
returned to work after they heard the results of their strike
committee's meeting with Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Ryzhkov sat down Monday with the miners and worked out a
``concrete program of actions for the entire country's coal
industry,'' said Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper.
   In Estonia, workers at ship-building factories and several other
plants struck today to protest recent measures that favor the
native Estonian population of the restive Baltic republic, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   A republic-wide strike committee of non-Estonian workers called
the strike Monday, Tass said. It demanded cancellation of a recent
law promoting the Estonian language and withdrawal of a proposal to
allow only longtime residents to run for local office.
   Lawmakers of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, today
debated a statement promising workers the legislature would ``act
decisively and effectively to do everything necessary for the
strengthening of social stability,'' the government newspaper
Izvestia reported.
   Government concessions to strikers have included promises of pay
raises, increased benefits and more economic independence for
mines, as well as shipments of scarce food and clothing.
   Viktor G. Kucherenko head of the legislature's Planning and
Budget Commission, said during a break in the legislative session
on Monday that strike settlements would cost up to $8.6 billion.
   In Voroshilovgrad, which is in the Donetsk basin 550 miles south
of Moscow, about 26,800 workers at 47 out of the region's 93 mines
remained on strike, Tass said.
   The Donetsk strikers were among the last holdouts during the
nationwide coal strike that started July 11 in western Siberia and
spread from the Arctic to Central Asia.
   Last week, the more than 100,000 striking Siberian miners
returned to work after the government promised to meet virtually
all their demands.
   President Mikhail Gorbachev has issued repeated appeals to the
miners, sympathizing with their plight and blaming official trade
union and mining officials for precipitating the strikes by
neglecting miners' needs.
   But he has warned that the strikes could jeopardize his economic
reforms.
   In Vorkuta in the Arctic, the city strike committee ended the
walkout Monday after ``listening with great attention,'' to
Gorbachev's appeals, Tass reported. But strikers warned they would
walk out again if the government did not keep its promises, the
news agency said.
   However, Valery Serdyuk, the city's Communist Party chief, said
none of Vorkuta's mines was working regularly yet. Most miners were
waiting for formal approval by the Soviet Council of Ministers of
their demands, he said in a telephone interview.
   Tass said the strikes in the Donetsk region alone cut coal
production by 1.2 million tons and in the western Siberian Kuznetsk
Coal Basin by at least 1 million tons, according to official
reports.
   Poor transportation is also hurting Donetsk coal supplies, Tass
said, with piles of unshipped coal lying around and often catching
on fire.
   Tass said the strike had not led to any accidents in Donetsk
mines, but 40 percent of the mines' walls badly needed maintenance.
   Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet on Monday the strikes were the
biggest test so far of his 4-year-old economic reforms and called
for a shakeup of local governing councils, which are frequently
blamed for blocking progress.
   Last week, he appealed for a ``renewal'' of Communist Party
ranks from top to bottom, and his suggestion that local governing
bodies also be transformed could mean sweeping leadership changes.
   Local elections scheduled in the spring throughout the Soviet
Union involve multiple candidates and for the first time offer
serious challenges to entrenched officials.
   Some members of the Supreme Soviet said Monday the elections
should be held earlier. Gorbachev said each of the Soviet Union's
15 republics should decide when and how to hold the elections.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people remained out of their
homes today while officials prepared to extinguish a burning
railroad chemical tank car that was among 14 cars that derailed
Saturday.
   The fire dwindled enough Monday to allow officials to cut the
original evacuation zone around the derailed freight train by more
than two-thirds, from 15 square miles to 4 square miles.
   Chemicals in the car form hydrochloric acid when burned, but the
acid wasn't endangering people, officials said. The evacuation was
a precautionary move.
   ``A very lazy fire'' continued today in one car, said R. Lindsay
Leckie, spokesman for CSX Transportation Inc., owner of the cars.
Firefighters planned to use an air line to accelerate the blaze and
burn off remaining gases and moisture, then smother it with sodium
bicarbonate powder, he said.
   He said the remaining cars would be removed once the fire is out.
   Meanwhile, it was revealed that the brakeman of the wrecked
train checked himself into a local hospital's substance abuse
program after the derailment.
   The brakeman, whose identity was withheld, entered the hospital
a few hours after giving federally required blood and urine
samples, William Loftus, executive director of the Federal Railroad
Administration, revealed Monday.
   But Loftus emphasized that human error had been ruled out as a
cause of the derailment and the brakeman's actions did nothing to
change that. The precise cause hasn't been determined.
   Loftus refused to divulge the man's name, the hospital he
entered, or the substance he's believed to have used.
   ``The guy's not going to turn himself in if he's clean,'' Loftus
said.
   The evacuated families won't be allowed to go home until the
fire is out and workers have cleaned up the derailed cars, two of
which contain chemicals, said Leckie.
   No accurate count was available of the number of people
evacuated. Unofficial figures ranged from 400 to 2,000, but Leckie
and Tittabawassee Township officials refused to make any estimate.

   Syd Straw, former lead singer for the Golden
Palominos, han music on her mind _ like dinosaurs
and ants.
   She keeps maps and pictures of dinosaurs around her apartment.
And she won't step on ants because she can't stand the idea of
harming living creatures in any way.
   Music is her lihas a lot more tfe, but when she picks up a newspaper,
the
science section is opened first. Straw often wonders about
extinction and erosion, what will happen to the world.
   She feels the same way about people, priding herself on the
diverse group of musicians she assembled for her debut solo album,
``Surprise.''
   ``I bend over backwards to make sure the people playing for and
with me are enjoying it and feeling good,'' Straw said.
   ``That's probably my maternal instinct. ...`happy-go-luck accordion''
of Matt Irving. Straw recorded ``Almost
Magic,'' co-written by former bandmate Matthew Auerbach, with a
103-degree fever, completely blacking out at one point.
   She closes Side 1 with Stephen Foster's traditional ballad
``Hard Times,'' and Side 2 with another slow song, her own ``Golden
Dreams.''
   ``I like to rock, and I like to give the impression of being a
sensitive soul also,'' she said. ``I thought a lot about the song
order. It's not quite accidental that both sides end in a similar
way. I want to leave people thinking.''
   On ``Crazy American,'' she sings: ``Any place I hang my hat is
someone else's home.'' The lyrics recall her years in New York when
she depended on the kindness of friends and strangers for shelter.
   ``I didn't live anywhere for years. `OK, I'll live in your
apartment for two weeks.' `Oh, you're coming back nine days early?
You'll be here in 10 minutes? Fine.' That is a pretty common
situation in New York City. A lot of people sort of live around
like that,'' she said.
   Straw, whose parents were both actors, grew up in Montrose,
Calif., where she enjoyed playing hide-and-seek in her neighbors'
yards, and sitting on a wall singing Neil Young's ``Heart of Gold.''
   She headed for New York after high school, taking acting classes
and managing several walk-on appearances on ``Saturday Night
Live.'' Hearing a local singer perform one night inspired Straw to
take up music herself.
   ``Music saved my life, it gives me a raison d'etre,'' she said.
``I wouldn't want to be a non-musical person. I am so musical every
minute of my life. I have trouble with people who don't give a damn
about music. Usually, they don't give a damn about animals,
either.''
   Her career began to pick up at in late 1985 when she met drummer
Anton Fier, mastermind of the Golden Palominos, at the Bitter End
nightclub.
   ``I'd say sparks were flying, some kind of friction was in the
air. We kind of took each other and started jousting. That night he
walked me home and said, `You want to sing on my record?' I said,
`Maybe,' and I did.''
   She learned quickly to be ready for anything with the Palominos,
singing rock, country and avant-garde with an everchanging band
behind her. After two albums, ``Visions of Excess'' and ``Blast of
Silence,'' Straw left the group to start a solo career in 1987.
   ``Anyone as motivated as I am would feel very frustrated; it
wasn't enough to live on,'' she said. ``I like being in control of
my own music. Previously, I had to answer to Anton because it was
his group. He was the one mixing. Now, I'm the one behind the
board.''

<HEAD>Chinese Documentary Uses Apparently Pirated U.S. TV Footage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dramatic scene of a lone man stopping a
column of tanks was shown on national TV Tuesday for the first time
as China broadcast the second part of a government documentary on
the crushed pro-democracy movement.
   The Cable News Network's Beijing bureau said it believes China
pirated the sequence from CNN or ABC.
   Terry Frieden, CNN's acting news manager in Beijing, said his
cameraman believed the tank man sequence was taken from CNN or ABC
News footage because of the angle from which it was shot.
   The man who briefly stopped the tanks during the army's attack
on demonstrating students last month eventually was pulled from the
street by friends. The Hong Kong press later identified him as a
19-year-old student, Wang Weilin, and said he was arrested.
   The Chinese documentary, ``A Test of Blood and Fire,'' did not
mention his fate but said he was not shot or crushed by the tanks
at the scene because the soldiers ``showed restraint.''
   John Liu, cameraman for CBS News, said he recognized footage
from CBS and ABC in other parts of the four-part documentary, which
China Central Television began showing Monday. ABC's bureau could
not be reached immediately for comment.
   It was not the first time Chinese TV used foreign footage
apparently intercepted from satellite transmissions. Shortly after
the June 3-4 army crackdown, Chinese TV showed ABC footage of a
Chinese man claiming that 20,000 people were killed, and urged the
public to turn the man in. Two women reported on him the next day,
and he was tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Tuesday night's half-hour segment of the documentary showed the
period after martial law went into effect May 20 through the bloody
weekend of street fighting.
   Both it and Monday's first part have shown some events out of
sequence, apparently to strengthen the government line that
anti-Communist intellectuals were behind the student protests.
   At important junctures in the second segment, the sound was
turned down or off. The documentary showed students talking to or
shouting at soldiers, but it was impossible to hear what they were
saying.
   And in the brief segment on the military crackdown of June 3-4,
the silent video showed students throwing rocks and bricks at army
vehicles, but the sound of gunfire was missing.
   The documentary also included footage shot by police TV crews
and from cameras mounted along main streets.
   Some previously unseen footage was shot from inside the glassed,
locked entrances to subway stations, where police camera crews,
apparently fearing for their lives on the streets, sought shelter.
The pattern of the station glass could be seen across the picture.

<HEAD>State of Emergency Extended By Six Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament extended Zimbabwe's state of
emergency for six months Tuesday after the government said it
needed wide-ranging powers to deal with threats from South Africa
and border raids by rebels from Mozambique.
   Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi cited sabotage and
infiltration by agents of white-run South Africa as a continuing
threat to national security.
   He said the government expected ``hostile activities'' by South
Africa against its black-governed neighbors to increase after
independence elections in Namibia in November scheduled to end
South African control over the southwest African territory.
   In the past, South Africa has mounted several attacks in
Zimbabwe against facilities of the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla organization fighting the government in Pretoria.
   ``That regime (in South Africa) always blames us whenever there
is an uprising in their country,'' Mahachi told legislators.
   Since the last renewal of the emergency in January, there was a
``marked increase'' in cross-border attacks by rebels in
neighboring Mozambique, he said, as well as what he described as
``counterrevolutionary and anti-social activities'' in Zimbabwe
itself.
   About 80 Zimbabweans were slain by Mozambique National
Resistance rebels who were also blamed for 78 abductions, 14
clashes against troops and 72 armed robberies, Mahachi said.
   Zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965, when it
was introduced by the government of former Rhodesian prime minister
Ian Smith to crack down on black nationalists.
   The emergency, which has been renewed by parliament every six
months since independence in 1980, allows for detention without
trial.
   On Tuesday, one outspoken legislator was prevented on procedural
grounds from listing 50 alleged abuses of the state of emergency
since 1982.

   When Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrives in
Africa on Wednesday, there will be three high-level Chinese envoys
on a continent that has gotten relatively little attention from
China in the past decade.
   Criticized by the West for its crackdown on student
pro-democracy protesters, China has rediscovered its Third World
identity, temporarily cast aside in the 1980s while the leadership
pursued modernization and riches.
   Qian's trip, his longest journey abroad in 15 months as foreign
minister, will take in six countries and last 18 days. At the same
time, Assistant Minister Yang Fuchang is visiting five west African
countries, also for 18 days, and the deputy head of the Communist
Party's international liaison department is visiting the Congo.
   The nations of Sao Tome and Principe and Ethiopia were among the
first to send government or ruling party delegations to China after
its June 3-4 army attack on student protesters. A trade delegation
from Ghana is in Beijing this week.
   ``China and African countries always show each other sympathy,
understanding and support whether in their common struggle or in
difficult times,'' Premier Li Peng said in a message to the
Organization of African Unity summit meeting in Ethiopia.
   ``The profound friendship and close cooperation existing between
China and Africa can stand the test of storms,'' he said.
   The entire Third World is proving to be a haven of calm for
Chinese foreign relations.
   India's foreign secretary was the first senior foreign envoy to
visit China after the army crackdown. Pakistan, Bolivia and
Malaysia have sent delegations.
   Several Soviet and East European groups also have come, and Vice
Premier Tian Jiyun went to Moscow last week for regular economic
and trade talks in the first trip abroad by any high-level Chinese
leader since the crackdown began.
   But even Soviet parliamentarians registered their opinion about
the crackdown, urging China to show reason and wisdom. Most Third
World countries _ some with their own histories of repressing
dissent _ have been non-judgmental.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted the foreign minister
of Sao Tome and Principe, Carlos Dias da Graca, as expressing
``understanding and support for the measures taken by the Chinese
government'' when he visited in June. China said it was giving the
African nation an interest-free loan, although it did not specify
the amount.
   Africa has been the main recipient of what relatively little
foreign aid China has given. In the first three decades of
communist rule, China sent 150,000 technicians to Africa to help
build more than 500 projects.
   The biggest, a 1,160-mile railroad from the capital of
landlocked Zambia through Tanzania to the coast, cost the lives of
145 Chinese workers before it was completed in 1975.
   China financed a $100 million fertilizer plant in Tanzania, a
gymnasium in Kenya and a parliament hall in Cape Verde. Highways in
Madagascar and a sugar refinery in Togo were built with Chinese
funds.
   In return, China gained a sense of solidarity with other
developing nations at a time when it was isolated from most East
and West bloc countries and feared attack from both.
   China once again feels isolated and beleagued, as illustrated by
a recent commentary in Economic Reference News. U.S. criticism, it
said, ``is not an isolated incident but a component part of an
international political adverse current initiated by some U.S.
Influences in recent years.''
   The commentary said China is the victim of Western plotting to
lure it into ``conducting `reforms' to weaken and even get rid of
the communist leadership.''
   China's new Third World emphasis can be seen not only in its
diplomatic exchanges, but in a noticeable increase of Third World
news on Xinhua and state TV. The evening news carried a four-part
series last week on the Tanzania-Zambia railway, and has begun
running stories on industrial production in African countries.
   The Third World, however, cannot offer the soft loans and
technology China has been counting on to fulfill its goal of
doubling gross national product by the year 2000.
   An upbeat Xinhua news analysis about U.S.-Polish relations may
indicate what Chinese hope will happen to their strained ties with
the West.
   Without mentioning the parallel to China's situation, it noted
the United States and other Western countries imposed economic
sanctions against Poland after it declared martial law in 1981 and
outlawed the independent Solidarity trade union.
   ``The situation began to change,'' it noted, ``after the Polish
authorities' announcement to end martial law in 1983.''

   Survivors of the fiery DC-10 crash
credited flight attendants for maintaining calm and helping
passengers escape from the wreckage.
   Helen Hayes of Denver sat in row nine at the front of the middle
cabin section and said a flight attendant whose name she didn't
know helped prevent panic.
   ``Her voice was very soothing,'' Ms. Hayes said from her
hospital room. ``She prevented the passengers from going into
complete hysteria.''
   Seven of the eight flight attendants on the plane survived the
tumbling crash of the United Airlines jet at the Sioux Gateway
Airport on Wednesday. The three crew members in the cockpit also
survived.
   In all, of the 296 people on the plane, 111 were killed.
   United spokesman Robb Doughty said flight attendants have
landing positions in jump seats which are bolted to bulkheads in
reinforced sections of the cabin. That's deliberate, he said, so
they can aid passengers in getting out of the airplane.
   ``They sit there so they can manage the evacuation through the
doors,'' he said.
   Ms. Hayes said she was sitting near one of the flight attendants
while the plane flew toward Sioux City for an emergency landing and
could see the fear on her face, although she said passengers
further away probably couldn't. She said the flight attendants
issued instructions on what passengers should do right up to the
time the crippled jumbo jet hit the ground.
   ``It must have been very difficult for them to do that,'' she
said.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Many Vietnamese Injured in Camp Clashes with Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many Vietnamese refugees were hurt in weekend
clashes with police at a crowded Hong Kong detention center, the
U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.
   Only four Vietnamese requested treatment for injuries after the
confrontations, including three who said they were hurt
accidentally, police said.
   One refugee died in unclear circumstances, but not of natural
causes, according to police and Robert van Leeuwen, the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees in Hong Kong.
   The incidents occurred at Sek Kong detention center, a former
military airfield where more than 7,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers
live in tents. They are among 50,000 Vietnamese who escaped their
communist homeland by boat to seek temporary sanctuary in the
British colony of Hong Kong.
   Police say about 200 Vietnamese hurled stones at their guards
Sunday night when the guards started investigating holes in the
barbed wire fence around the camp. Order was restored but violence
flared again several hours later when police carried out a search
for makeshift weapons.
   The clashes came during reported growing tension in the colony's
detention centers amid indications that Britain and Vietnam are
near agreement on the forced repatriation of those who cannot prove
they fled political persecution.
   ``Preliminary indications are that a considerable number of
people have been injured in the incident,'' van Leeuwen said on the
state radio.
   In the case of the dead refugee, initial findings of an autopsy
showed he did not die of natural causes, according to a police
statement. It said police are investigating the case.
   Police Assistant Commissioner Richard Smallshaw said only four
Vietnamese men requested treatment after the disturbance, including
one requiring hospitalization.
   The other three ``claim they were accidental injuries and were
not the result of police action,'' he told the radio. ``They're
very minor indeed.''
   Van Leeuwen was quoted in the English-language South China
Morning Post as saying women and children apparently were among the
injured. Smallshaw denied that.
   The Vietnamese at Sek Kong are among boat people who must prove
they are political refugees and not economic migrants. Hong Kong
and other Southeast Asian authorities say they cannot cope with an
influx of tens of thousands of Vietnamese who brave storms and
pirates in flimsy boats to escape their homeland in hopes of
winning asylum in countries such as the United States.

<TEXT>
   Bombings in Mecca during the annual
pilgrimage to the holiest city of Islam focused attention once
again on an ideological struggle for leadership of the world's 1
billion Moslems.
   The bombings were a major setback for efforts to end the rift
between Saudi Arabia and Iran, currently the main protagonists in
the centuries-old schism between the Sunnis and Shiites, Islam's
leading sects.
   Two bombs exploded in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on July 10 during the
hajj, or pilgrimage, to the shrines of Islam, killing a Pakistani
pilgrim and wounding 16 people. A third explosion July 17 caused no
casualties.
   Official Saudi statements did not fix blame, but the bombings
were widely believed to be the work of Iranians.
   Tehran's fundamentalist Shiite regime accused the Saudis of
planting the bombs in an attempt to discredit Iran, and renewed
their demand that custodianship of the holy sites be taken away
from the Saudi royal family.
   Ayatollah Abdolkarim Musavi Ardebili, chief justice of Iran,
declared: ``We want God to give us the strength ... to throw out
the corpse of this tahgut (idolatrous despot) from the House of
God.''
   His statement goes to the heart of the rift between the Sunnis,
who account for 80 percent of Moslems, and the minority Shiites.
The Saudi royal family and most of their 12 million subjects are
Sunnis, and Iran's population of 50 million is overwhelmingly
Shiite.
   Custody of Mecca and Medina is a pillar of the Saudi royal claim
to legitimacy, so Iran's demand has political as well as religious
significance. Two years ago, King Fahd underscored his religious
role by declaring his primary title to be Custodian of the Holy
Places.
   Shiites believe religion and politics cannot be separated and
the hajj must be a forum for political action, such as rallies
against the United States and Israel. That view is anathema to the
Saudis.
   Fahd's hajj and endowments minister, Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Wasei,
accused Iran of seeking ``to fan the flames of sedition in Islamic
ranks'' and said Saudi Arabia was ``determined to resist all
attempts at maneuvers, pressures and provocations.''
   The latest developments appeared to dash hopes in the Persian
Gulf region that the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on June 3
signaled the end of Iran's virulent fundamentalism and the
emergence of more moderate policies.
   Conservative Arab states in the area, governed by royal
families, have felt threatened for the past decade by Iran's
efforts to export the revolution that overthrew the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979.
   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April 1988, citing
terrorism and subversion.
   Fahd acted after 402 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were
killed in clashes with riot police in Mecca on July 31, 1987,
during the hajj. The first two bombings this year occurred on the
second anniversary of the riots, reckoned by the Moslem lunar
calendar.
   Saudi Arabia says the Iranians instigated the riots by defying a
ban on political activity during the pilgrimage. Iran claims the
Saudis massacred its pilgrims.
   The Saudis won Moslem support for limiting pilgrims to 1,000 for
every 1 million of a country's population. The ostensible purpose
was to reduce crowding in the holy cities during major construction
of more facilities, but the clear intent was to curb the Iranians.
   Under the quota system, Iran's usual contingent of about 150,000
pilgrims would be reduced by two-thirds. As a result, Iran
boycotted the hajj in 1988 and this year.
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, successor to Khomeini as Iran's
religious leader, accused Saudi Arabia on July 6 of ``blocking the
faithful from performing the hajj, to gratify America and Israel,''
and said Iran ``will not forget these hostilities.''
   Before the hajj bombings, which occurred four days after
Khameini's speech, King Fahd's government had been quietly trying
to promote reconciliation with Iran.
   Arab diplomats said Oman was ``communicating ideas and
conditions'' between Iran and Saudi Arabia and that other Arab
states, notably Kuwait, had made their own efforts.
   According to the diplomats, the Saudis set out three
``irrevocable conditions for coexistence'' with Iran:
noninterference in Saudi internal affairs, a pledge to abandon
political activities during the pilgrimage and acceptance the hajj
quota system.
   Khamenei has said, however: ``We have pledged to God to continue
Imam Khomeini's path ... which is the path of Islam. ... Our main
aim ... is to revive Islam once again and return to Koranic values.
We will not retreat an inch on this.''

   Two former aides to PTL founder Jim
Bakker were convicted today of evading taxes on $1.2 million they
allegedly took from the TV ministry to spend on luxury
condominiums, jewelry and designer clothes.
   James and David Taggart were found guilty of one count each of
conspiracy and four counts of evading taxes. The jury deliberated
for nearly five hours Monday evening and early today before
reaching the verdict at 11:15 a.m.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter set Aug. 25 as a
tentative sentencing date. Each brother could be sentenced to 25
years in prison and face fines of more than $1 million.
   Potter released the Taggarts on $50,000 unsecured bond, the same
figure that has been in effect since the two were indicted.
Prosecutors had asked that it be raised, but the judge said he
would ``take a risk.''
   Both Taggarts sat quietly as the verdict was read. David Taggart
looked at the jurors as they were polled individually. James
Taggart continued to stare straight ahead.
   Prosecutor David Brown said the verdict was ``not about PTL; it
was about David Taggart and James Taggart's obligations to pay
their taxes no matter how much they own and what kind of lifestyle
they live.''
   ``Greed doesn't pay, no matter how rich you are you've got to
pay your taxes,'' Brown added.
   In closing arguments Monday, the brothers' lawyer had argued
that they had received more than $1 million in ministry funds with
Bakker's approval. But prosecutors told jurors to ignore Bakker's
role in the case.
   ``This case is about a crime,'' Brown said. ``Did they willfully
defraud the United States?''
   The Taggarts were charged with evading more than $525,000 in
income taxes after spending nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on
personal luxuries such as condominiums, jewelry and designer
clothes.
   Defense lawyer Ben Cotten had said Bakker, the PTL founder who
resigned amid a sex and money scandal, agreed to give David Taggart
access to the same resources that he enjoyed. If the federal
government was owed taxes, PTL would be required to pay them.
   ``The intent was not to beat the IRS out of money. It was to
have PTL shoulder the burden,'' Cotten said in his closing
arguments.
   But Brown said the Taggarts tried to conceal the money they took
from PTL, and he told jurors not to consider the actions of Bakker
or his former top aide, Richard Dortch.
   ``This case is not about them,'' Brown said.
   Bakker and Dortch are scheduled to go on trial for wire and mail
fraud Aug. 28 in Charlotte.
   Closing arguments in the Taggart case came on the 12th day of
the trial.
   Before beginning his remarks, Cotten placed items from such
exclusive New York stores as Cartier and Gucci on a bench in front
of the jury. The prosecution said the brothers bought items from
those stores with funds stolen from the ministry.
   ``If what is on trial here is a lifestyle you don't like, then
we didn't need a trial at all,'' he said as he picked up the items.
   Brown, however, told the jury that of the $1.2 million the
Taggarts allegedly took, $750,000 was in cash.
   ``People don't routinely use hundreds of thousands of dollars in
cash unless they're trying to conceal something,'' said Brown.

<HEAD>Wives Gaining on Husbands, but Still Earn Much Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Wives' incomes have increased nearly twice as
fast as their husbands' in recent years, but the man is still the
major breadwinner for most families, the Census Bureau reported
Tuesday.
   Between 1981 and 1987 the average earnings of wives jumped 23.3
percent, while husbands' income climbed 11.8 percent in the same
period, according to the study ``Earnings of Married-Couple
Families: 1987.''
   That brought the average income of wives to $13,245 in 1987,
compared with $29,154 for husbands.
   ``More of them (wives) are working year-round, full time,
instead of part time,'' explained Census statistician Robert W.
Cleveland. In past years, he said, women were more likely to accept
part-time jobs, resulting in lower average income.
   ``Also, more women are in professional and technical jobs which
tend to have better pay,'' Cleveland added.
   One factor in this change, he said, is the tendency of women to
have pursued more education in recent years.
   In addition, said Cleveland: ``I think there is more equal
treatment, things are not as discriminatory for women. The
opportunities are more available for them now than in the past.''
   Still, wives continue to lag behind their husbands in income.
   Wives working full-time at least 50 weeks per year averaged
$18,929 in 1987, only 57 percent of the $33,305 earned by husbands
who worked full time 50 weeks or more.
   Recent government statistics for all men and women, married and
unmarried, showed women averaging 65 percent of men's income,
somewhat more than the 57 percent for full-time working wives.
   Wives are more likely to have to take time off to tend children,
or to have delayed careers during child rearing, than women in
general.
   Indeed, the effect of children may be noted in the incomes of
wives by age, as reported in the study.
   The most rapid income rise between 1981 and 1987 was among wives
aged 35 to 44, who saw their average jump 31.5 percent, more than
triple the 9.8 percent increase for husbands in the same age group.
   ``In that age bracket, the kids are grown, the women can enter
the labor force and ... start working full time,'' Cleveland said.
   For all wives, those with no children averaged $14,256 in 1987,
compared with $13,067 for women with children aged 6 to 17; $12,163
for those with children under age 6; and just $10,732 for those
with children in both age groups.
   Husbands averaged $31,636 for those with children aged 6 to 17;
while those with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged $29,564.
For those with children under 6, average income was $28,181, and it
was $27,755 for husbands without children.
   While husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majority
of families, that isn't a universal situation.
   About 5.3 million wives earned more than their husbands in 1987,
about 18 percent of the 29.1 million married couples in which both
husband and wife had earnings, the report said.
   In many cases, husbands were 55 or older and often partly
retired, Cleveland observed, while their wives tended to be
slightly younger and still working full time. Wives who earned more
than their husbands were more likely than other wives to have
attended college and to have no children at home, the report found.

<HEAD>Insurance Group Urges Legal Limits on Rock Concert Noise Levels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland's main accident
insurance group called Tuesday for legal limits on noise levels at
rock concerts to protect fans from ear damage.
   In the absence of statutory noise limits, concert organizers
should give away free ear plugs with tickets, the Swiss Accident
Insurance Agency said.
   The proposal that noise levels should not be higher than 100
decibels drew an angry reaction from concert organizers, who said
such measures would prompt rock stars to bypass Switzerland.
   ``It would be the death of rock concerts in Switzerland,'' said
Saemi Hafen of Good News, the country's largest promoter.
   ``It's a typical suggestion from people with nothing better to
do,'' said Hanns Hanneken, editor of the magazine Music Scene.
   The agency said many people suffered ear damage after attending
concerts with noise levels of between 100 and 120 decibels.
   The pain barrier is reached at 125 decibels. Under Swiss law,
workers have to wear earplugs if the noise limit is more than 87
decibels.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new fashion and lifestyle magazine Mirabella
has made its debut, but will this guide for the well-educated woman
be a lasting hit, or will it join the heap of new magazines that
fold in a few years?
   ``It's going very well. I think wonderfully well,'' said Grace
Mirabella, the editor. The first issue in June of 600,000 copies
sold out, but this veteran of the competitive, crowded world of
magazines knows success can be fleeting. ``I'm anxiety-ridden,''
she says.
   The figures for July are that just 70 percent to 75 percent of
the 600,000 copies are expected to sell. But publisher Julie
Lewit-Nirenberg noted that summer is traditionally slow for
magazines and that the first issue sold for $1, compared to the
$2.95 buyers now must fork out.
   She said the number of advertising pages dropped from 123 in
June to 85 in July and 50 in August. But the September issue just
closed for printing with 149 advertising pages.
   Ms. Mirabella says she knows there are pitfalls. ``We have to
keep our eye on the reader we think we have _ where her head is and
how she sees us. ... The reader we have is an intelligent reader,
selective in her view and selective in her eye.''
   Fashion designer Pearl Nipon knows who that reader is. ``I think
it's our customer.'' Mirabella, she says, ``is fabulous. It's so
understandable, it is so today.'' And she intends to continue to
buy advertising in the magazine.
   Patti Cohen, fashion director for Donna Karan, agrees. ``It's
really very exciting. ... I don't think it takes readers from other
magazines. I want to read Mirabella, but I also want to read the
Vogues and the Elles.''
   By targeting a narrowly defined audience of well-educated, older
and affluent women, Mirabella has a chance of surviving in the
crowded fashion magazine market, said Joseph Ostrow, worldwide
media director of Foote, Cone and Belding, an ad agency in New York.
   But a good six months will have to pass before any meaningful
judgment can be passed on the publication, said Nancy Smith, senior
vice president of media services at Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., another
New York ad agency.
   The money and backing of communications magnate Rupert Murdoch
bode well for Mirabella, as does the fact that Ms. Mirabella is the
creative force behind it, Ms. Smith said. ``She is an extremely
talented woman who has demonstrated her strength before.''
   Ms. Mirabella was Vogue's editor-in-chief for 17 years before
she was abruptly dismissed last June by S.I. Newhouse Jr. of Conde
Nast. In November, Murdoch approached her about presiding over a
monthly bearing her name.
   The glossy, oversized publication has some features that can
hardly be considered intelligent reading material. One article in
the June issue describes the favorite lipstick colors of actress
Joan Collins, designer Caroline Herrera and jewelry designer Paloma
Picasso.
   But its tone is more subtle than many other fashion magazines _
both in its fashion coverage and its features. And Ms. Mirabella
and her staff pride themselves on the fact that the monthly is
almost half text.
   ``It's a smart and intelligent magazine for women interested in
style and fashion but like a little more protein in reading
matter,'' Ms. Lewit-Nirenberg said, ``Not just a sugar high.''

   What do you say to a naked stranger

   A woman did just that after returning home Monday afternoon to
find a nude man sleeping in her living room. Awakened and arrested
was Todd Colombo, 22, of Levittown, said Nassau County police Sgt.
Edward Mitchell.
   Colombo apparently forced his way in through a front screen door
and helped himself to some food from the refrigerator before taking
off his clothes and falling asleep, Mitchell said.
   Laura Hopkins, 32, called police and the man was arrested for
trespass and criminal mischief. Mitchell said police don't know
what motivated Colombo to go in the house, empty the fridge or take
off his clothes.

<TEXT>
   The Iowa Civil Liberties Union says it
is drafting a proposed amendment to Iowa's constitution that would
ensure the right to abortion.
   ``Iowa is a state with a longstanding tradition of respect for
individual rights of privacy,'' ICLU Executive Director Cryss
Farley said in a statement distributed Monday. ``Our constitution
should provide express protection for that concept.''
   Ms. Farley said the ICLU is drafting a proposed amendment ``that
will simply protect the status quo'' in the wake of a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling broadening state powers to restrict abortions.
   ``It is clear that we can no longer rely upon the U.S. Supreme
Court to protect the right of reproductive choice,'' Ms. Farley
said.
   Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson said he doesn't expect the
Legislature to approve abortion restrictions next year.
   The National Organization for Women called Sunday for an
amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing women the
right to abortion and birth control. NOW issued its call for a
``Bill of Rights for the 21st Century'' at a convention in
Cincinnati.
   The proposed constitutional amendment in Iowa, which has yet to
be drafted, would require the approval of two successive General
Assemblies before being submitted to a statewide vote.
   ``This will be a moderate proposal aimed at preserving
established privacy rights,'' said ICLU lobbyist Mark Lambert.

   The coalition government said Tuesday it
would grant television licenses for two private networks, breaking
the state's monopoly.
   It was the latest in a series of moves toward pluralism in in a
country where television and radio have been under state control
since their inception.
   Government spokesman Athanassios Kanellopoulos said the licenses
will be given to two publishing consortiums, Tiletypos Corp. and
Antenna-TV, made up of representatives from Greece's diverse and
often partisan press.
   Both stations will transmit locally, not nationally, and the
state will share in about 5 percent of the profits, he added.
   The three state-run TV networks in Greece belong to the Hellenic
Radio and Televison Corp.
   The state monopoly on radio was broken two years ago when the
municipality of Athens set up a station.
   Popular demand and pirate TV stations also led the former
Socialist government to begin allowing in six international
satellite channels, including Cable News Network.
   The center-right New Democracy party, the majority member in the
Conservative-Communist coalition government, had made private TV a
part of its campaign platform for last month's elections.

<HEAD>Economists See Good News In Slowdown of Wage, Salary Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wages, salaries and other benefits rose 4.5
percent in the 12 months ending in June, the Labor Department said
Tuesday in a report viewed by some economists as a hopeful sign
that inflationary wage pressures may be peaking.
   The department's Employment Cost Index measures movements in
labor costs over the preceding 12 months. For the 12 months ending
in March, the last time the index was issued, the increase was 4.6
percent. That figure was down from a 4.9 percent increase in the 12
months ending in December.
   To some analysts, the two quarters of slightly slower
compensation increases showed that labor costs are beginning to
moderate in the face of a slowing economy.
   The unemployment rate, which dropped to a 15-year low of 5
percent in March, has been climbing and now stands at 5.3 percent.
Many economists are expecting the jobless figure to hit 6 percent
by early next year, reflecting lackluster econmic growth in the
second half of 1989.
   This rising jobless rate will ease tight labor markets and help
alleviate inflationary pressures in the economy, these analysts
believe.
   ``The Employment Cost Index shows that the upward momentum in
wages has ceased and is beginning to fade,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist for the Boston Co.
   In a separate government report Tuesday, the Labor Department
said that major collective bargaining settlements concluded in the
first six months of this year featured average wage increases of
3.7 percent in the first year of the contract, up from 2.1 percent
first-year increases the last time these contracts were negotiated.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago, said collective bargaining settlements are higher than
they were two to three years ago, but that they have not jumped
sharply in recent months.
   ``Wage increases stopped strengthening toward the fall of last
year,'' he said. ``We have a capping of wage increases with the
business slowdown that began earlier this year.''
   Since employment costs account for close to 70 percent of total
costs on the industrial side of the economy, any hint of rising
wage pressures fuels concerns about the onset of a new inflationary
spiral.
   For that reason, the signs of some wage moderation were seen as
encouraging indications that the Federal Reserve will succeed in
its efforts to tame inflation without pitching the economy into a
recession.
   The 4.5 percent increase in compensation costs for the 12 months
ending in June includes wages and salaries and the costs for such
employee benefits as health insurance.
   The wage and salary component of total compensation climbed by
4.1 percent over the past year while benefit costs rose a faster
5.6 percent.
   Workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than
the manufacturing sector in pay gains. Service industries saw wages
and salaries increase 4.7 percent in the past 12 months compared to
a 3.2 percent rise for the manufacturing sector.
   However, there was a wide split in the services category. At the
low end of the increases, wages in the transportation sector and
communications industry rose just 1.9 percent while wages at
hospitals shot up 6.4 percent. Wages climbed an even faster 7.6
percent in finance, insurance and real estate, but this increase
was influenced by earnings on commissions, which can be volatile
from quarter to quarter.

   Efforts by Congress to force communities into
cleanups they can't afford just won't work and are a cheap
substitute for a real environmental policy, a spokesman for the
nation's mayors told senators Tuesday.
   ``You cannot build ... treatment plants with a thousand points
of light,'' John Bullard told a joint session of the Environment
and Public Works subcommittees on environmental protection and on
superfund, ocean and water protection.
   Bullard, mayor of New Bedford, Mass., was representing the
National League of Cities before the subcommittees, which are
considering a variety of clean water legislation.
   Bullard said the federal government must be able to ``walk this
fine line'' between ``punishment and partnership'' if it is to be
serious about environmental issues.
   He said an ``irresistible force'' of public demand for a clean
environment is running up against an ``immovable object'' of scarce
financial resources that threatens ``an impending explosion that
could consume some cities.''
   For example, he said his own city is working under a consent
decree in which it is supposed to spend $560 million on various
clean water projects to meet federal standards.
   The only problem, he said, is that the figure works out to
$5,600 per man, woman and child in the city of 100,000. He said the
city, with a total annual budget of $116 million, is doing good to
handle its $22 million total indebtness and has never built a
project that cost more than $15 million _ that one a dam with help
from the Army Corps of Engineers.
   He pointed out that Congress has authorized $1.2 billion in
federal spending since 1984 on a single section of the Clean Water
Act, yet has actually appropriated only $92.51 million.
   ``It appears to us that the federal government has poorly
managed its own fiscal affairs and cannot seem to put them back in
order,'' he said. ``What is happening now appears to us to be an
attempt to continue business as usual, merely shifting the
financing responsibility to other levels of governmnent. The end
result will be that all our fiscal houses will be in total
disarray.''
   Bullard was among a number of government officials and private
researchers to testify before the two subcommittees. Tuesday's
hearing was not on any one of them, but rather was organized to
enable a variety of public and private groups to present their
general views.

   The Democratic-controlled House today cut
President Bush's request for Star Wars spending in next year's
defense budget by nearly $2 billion.
   By a vote of 248-175, the House approved an amendment that cut
$700 million from the program in addition to the $1.1 billion the
House Armed Services Committee had cut last month.
   Bush had proposed spending $4.9 billion for the program in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and made a personal plea on behalf of
the program at a White House meeting on Monday. The House
recommended spending of $3.1 billion.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked if Bush
would veto a bill that cuts money for Star Wars.
   ``We're a long way from considering vetos ... We're talking now
about winning, not about vetos,'' he said.
   The action came in a series of roll call votes as the House
worked its way through the annual defense blueprint. The Senate was
debating its own version.
   The House rejected one proposal for a deeper cut and a second
amendment that would have restored all but $300 million to the
administration's request.
   ``If we value America's security, ban Star Wars,'' Rep. Les
AuCoin, D-Ore., said earlier in the debate.
   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., lost 299-117 in his effort to set
spending for the program at $4.1 billion _ $300 million below
Bush's request. ``It is much better to build shields than to build
swords,'' Kyl argued.
   An amendment that would have limited spending on Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, to $1.3 billion
failed by a vote of 286-137.
   Republican Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut attributed the
administration's defeat on Star Wars to the emphasis it has put on
lobbying for the B-2 bomber.
   ``They focused hard on this issue,'' Rowland said, referring to
the bomber. ``They got creamed on SDI.''
   Following the series of votes, the House considered a number of
amendments to use the money diverted from SDI for conventional
forces, environmental cleanup and military drug interdiction.
   The annual defense debate opened in both congressional chambers
Monday with the Senate adding money to speed production of such
conventional combat weapons as the Stinger and TOW missiles.
   Voting 91-0, senators added $933.6 million for missile
production over the next two fiscal years after Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee contended
that stretching out acquisition would be ``militarily unwise and
economically sound.''
   On the stealth bomber, Nunn and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the
panel's ranking GOP member, offered an amendment to prohibit buying
large numbers of the aircraft until prototypes meet strict flight
and radar-evasion tests. It would reduce Bush's spending request
for $4.7 billion for the B-2 by $300 million.
   Warner said that imposing a ``fly-before-buy'' standard is a
prudent step before the United States makes the costly decision to
produce the bat-winged aircraft.
   The House Armed Services Committee made deep cuts in the B-2
program, slashing $800 million from the Bush request, and is to
consider amendments Wednesday to end the program altogether or
place strict limits on further funding.
   Bush is appealing to lawmakers in both chambers to hold the
spending line on both the B-2 and Star Wars.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., called on Bush to veto
the defense bill if the House makes deep cuts in the Star Wars
program.
   Bush is encountering resistance on the B-2 because of its high
cost _ estimated at $70 billion for 132 bombers, or $530 million
each.
   The president is attempting to deflect the argument away from
the price tag by framing it in terms of the flexibility needed to
bring success in arms control talks with the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez, saying the unborn
``deserve our help and protection,'' today called a special
legislative session to address the abortion issue.
   Martinez, who favors more restrictions on abortion, called for
the special session three weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court threw
the issue back to the states in a 5-4 decision on a Missouri case.
   ``The court has given states the opportunity to better balance
the rights of the unborn with those of women, and I believe Florida
should do more to protect unborn children who cannot speak for
themselves,'' Martinez said in a statement.
   ``This is an issue of fundamental rights, and I believe the
unborn deserve our help and our protection.''
   The governor, however, isn't expected to offer specific
legislation for the session, to be held Oct. 10-13.
   The Florida Legislature appears evenly divided on the issue, but
many lawmakers would rather leave the controversial subject alone.
   Senate President Bob Crawford said the abortion issue could
create such bitter feelings among lawmakers that other critical
needs of the state could suffer.
   ``There are many issues that are very important, and we need to
continue working on other issues and not be paralyzed just dealing
with the emotions of this issue,'' Crawford said after the
governor's announcement.
   Earlier this month, Speaker Tom Gustafson named a pro-choice
lawmaker, Elaine Gordon of North Miami, to put together the House's
abortion proposal for a special session
   Ms. Gordon, a Democrat, chairs the House Health Care Committee.
   Current Florida law allows abortons during the first six months
of pregnancy. A woman must have permission from two doctors, based
on health reasons, to acquire an abortion in the last trimester of
pregnancy.

<HEAD>ASNE Head Finds Both Indifference and Commitment at Papers</HEAD>

   The leader of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors returned to his desk Tuesday both encouraged and
discouraged by his trip to urge executives of two dozen newspapers
to hire more minority people.
   Loren Ghiglione, ASNE president and editor of the Southbridge
(Mass.) News, said he found some papers attached no especial
importance to the question of whether they cover their communities
with a staff composed entirely of white reporters and editors.
   Others, he said, showed a commitment to finding minority
youngsters and bringing them along for years until they are
prepared to join news staffs as fulltime reporters.
   Ghiglione set out July 3 on a Maine-to-California trip during
which he met more than 100 editors and other newspaper executives.
   Before he left, he said feared that the newspaper industry's
commitment to integrating its newsrooms had taken a back seat to
business matters and that the goal was threatened by apathy.
   ASNE surveys have found that 54 percent of newspapers have no
minority news people on their news staffs or at the top. Most of
them are small papers.
   All told, minorities account for 7.5 percent of all newsroom
professionals, the most recent survey found.
   Ghiglione said he found a longterm commitment at some papers. He
cited the Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, in an area with a significant
Hispanic and Indian population, where editors are determined to
have 40 percent to 45 percent minority staffing by the turn of the
century.
   The Journal not only takes on young minority people as interns,
it keeps in touch with them, takes them back summer after summer,
follows them through college and retains them as interns until they
are prepared to take their place on the paper's staff, Ghiglione
said.
   On the other hand, he said, he sometimes encountered
indifference at other papers.
   ``I guess people were too polite to be angry or hostile,'' he
said, ``but what I sensed at several places was a feeling that,
`While this is a noble cause it is very low priority while we're
trying to get the paper out every day. If a qualified minority
candidate came through the door, we would consider hiring him if we
had an opening but recruitment requires more effort, more time and
more money than we are willing to give.'''
   Ghiglione said he now assigns increased importance to focusing
on junior and senior high school students and encouraging writing
and work on school newspapers.
   He said he intends to follow up his trip with letters and calls
to the owners of groups of newspapers that don't stress minority
hiring.
   ``I'm going to go to the heads of many of the dailies I visited
and ask for their help,'' he said. ``An awful lot of companies have
not put it on their priority list.''

   A 20-year-old Palestinian died today from
wounds suffered in a clash with Israeli soldiers in the occupied
Gaza Strip, and his death reportedly set off tire-burning protests
there.
   Also today, Palestinian lawyer who supports the PLO said he met
recently with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, disputing claims by
the government that Shamir's talks on his peace plan are only with
non-PLO Palestinians.
   The statement by Jamil Tarifi comes amid a growing controversy
over whether Israel is carrying on indirect negotiations with the
PLO, either through its own officials or through the U.S.-PLO
dialogue in Tunis.
   In Gaza, Fawsi Mohammed Elidawil died of injuries suffered in a
clash with soldiers a day earlier in the Egyptian border town of
Rafah.
   The army confirmed his death, which raised to 520 the number of
Palestinians who have died in clashes with Israelis during the
19-month Palestinian uprising. Thirty-eight Israelis have also been
killed.
   As word of the latest death spread today, youths in Rafah set up
roadblocks and burned tires in protest, Arab reporters said. They
said one man was wounded when soldiers opened fire to disperse the
protesters.
   In the West Bank, two Palestinians were shot and wounded in a
clash with soldiers in Ramallah and a third was hit in the face and
chest with 11 rubber-coated metal pellets used by troops to put
down riots, hospital officials said.
   A 36-year-old Palestinian was stabbed by masked youths in the
Balata refugee camp near Nablus as a suspected collaborator with
Israel, Arab reports said. He was reported in serious condition.
   At least 84 Palestinians have been killed as suspected
collaborators by fellow Arabs during the uprising.
   Tarifi told a news conference in Ramallah that he met with
Shamir several days ago, but he did not say exactly when.
   Shamir's spokesmen have issued denials for two days that the
right-wing premier was holding meetings with supporters of the PLO,
following a statement by PLO Chief Yasser Arafat that he approved
talks between his supporters and Israeli officials.
   Israel views the Palestine Liberation Organization as a
terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish state.

<HEAD>Government Reports Orders for Major Goods Up a Modest 0.3 Percent
in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for big-ticket factory goods rose a
modest 0.3 percent in June, the government said Tuesday in a report
seen as evidence that manufacturing, although sluggish, isn't
crumbling.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
ranging from bicycles to battleships _ advanced to a seasonally
adjusted $124.1 billion last month. That followed a 4.4 percent
decline in May, the sharpest in 10 months.
   ``This is basically in line with the forecast of modest growth
but no recession,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a
consulting firm in Washington.
   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
said the report likely means the Federal Reserve won't be in a rush
to cut interest rates soon.
   ``The report could have triggered action if it was really weak,
but it wasn't. ... It suggests we're continuing to tread water in
manufacturing, but the sector isn't crumbling,'' he said.
   The Fed recently shifted gears after a year-long campaign of
fighting inflation with higher interest rates, allowing two small
declines in short-term rates since early June. Most analysts expect
the central bank to continue nudging rates lower, but slowly and
cautiously.
   Other statistics released Tuesday generally confirmed
economists' views that inflation isn't getting worse and growth is
holding up, although at a lackluster rate.
   Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to American workers rose
4.5 percent in the 12 months ending in June, down just slightly
from the 4.6 percent gain in the 12 months ending in March,
according to the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index.
   In its quarterly report on collective bargaining agreements, the
Labor Department said major contracts signed by labor unions in the
April-June period provided first-year raises of 3.9 percent, up
from 3.2 percent in the first quarter.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes rebounded 5.9 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.4 million units. It was the first
increase in six months and a sign that falling mortgage rates have
begun to stimulate the depressed housing sector.
   The rebound in durable goods orders was powered by a 15.8
percent jump in military orders to a seasonally adjusted $8.8
billion. The highly volatile category registered drops of 11.4
percent in May and 18.3 percent in April.
   Excluding defense, new orders fell 0.7 percent last month
following a decline of 3.9 percent in May. The June activity was
depressed by softness in auto manufacturing which offset an upturn
at factories producing machinery.
   The closely watched category of non-defense capital goods, a
barometer of business investment plans, rose 0.5 percent in June to
$37.5 billion following a 7.7 percent plunge a month earlier.
   Non-electrical machinery orders rose 3.7 percent to $23.1
billion, reflecting an increase in purchases of steam engines and
turbines.
   Electrical machinery gained 2.8 percent to $19.2 billion
following a 6.1 percent drop in May.
   Transportation equipment declined 3.5 percent to $32.3 billion
following a 9.7 percent drop a month earlier. Most of the decline
came in shipbuilding and in motor vehicles and parts.
   Primary metals, including steel, were off 5 percent to $12
billion following a 1.8 percent decline in May. Evans said much of
the decline represents lower steel prices, rather than less volume.
   For the first six months of the year, new orders for durable
goods totaled $755.1 billion, 8.2 percent higher than the first
half of 1988. The figure does not take inflation into account.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.1 percent to $121.6 billion in
June, following a 0.3 percent decline in May.

<HEAD>Media Calls For Big Voter Turnout In Presidential Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian newspapers called Tuesday for a
big voter turnout in presidential elections Friday to confound the
Islamic republic's critics and ``open a new chapter'' after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death.
   All predicted a landslide victory for the only real candidate,
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has emerged as Iran's
strongman since the June 3 death of Khomeini, the revolutionary
patriarch who founded the fundamentalist state.
   Rafsanjani's only challenger is Abass Sheibani, 58, a
French-trained physician and parliament deputy with no national
political base.
   ``It can be said beyond any doubt that Mr. Rafsanjani is the
best choice for the post,'' said the Tehran Times, an
Engligh-language daily that supports Rafsanjani.
   ``He has the qualifications ... and his realistic approach to
domestic, regional and international issues is known to all.''
   The radical Abrar daily said massive participation by Iran's
estimated 25 million voters is vital because ``world oppressors
have been trying to portray the Islamic republic as unstable and
unable to last'' since Khomeini died.
   Jomhuri Islami, another radical daily, stressed that ``each vote
is a bullet fired at the heart of Iran's enemies.''
   The election will be held alongside a national referendum on
proposed constitutional reforms to give the presidency greater
powers and eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed
government for years. Reforms propose scrapping the post of prime
minister and making the president head of government.
   The Tehran Times said June 28 ``will go down in the history of
the Islamic republic as one of the most important events ...
because the nation will have a president with the power needed to
tackle the issues.''
   Newspapers were so confident Rafsanjani will win that they have
been speculating on the formation of his Cabinet when he succeeds
two-term incumbent Ayatollah Ali Khamanei.
   Khamenei was elected to succeed Khomeini as Iran's supreme
religious leader last month and was to step down when his second
term expired Oct. 5. But elections were advanced three weeks to
speed up the transition of power after Khomeini died.
   Diplomatic sources and Western analysts say Rafsanjani, 55, is
expected to name a team dominated by technocrats and give priority
to reviving Iran's economy after a decade of mismanagement, poor
planning and an eight-year war with Iraq.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's pragmatist faction, also is
expected to neutralize his radical rivals by giving them positions,
although probably with reduced powers.
   The Tehran Times said Rafsanjani personally will take charge of
the Planning and Budget Ministry in his drive to revitalize a
materials-starved industry operating at only 30 percent to 40
percent of capacity and map out a much-delayed long-term economic
strategy to reduce runaway inflation and unemployment in the
postwar era.

<TEXT>
   Authorities from four states trying to solve
five fatal shootings in the past week are awaiting results of
ballistics tests on a gun found after the arrest of a man at a
roadblock.
   Greg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, Kan., was arraigned
Monday in Raton on a charge of murder in the shooting Sunday of a
mini-mart clerk in Springer, about 30 miles south of Raton in
northern New Mexico. He was being held at the Colfax County Jail in
lieu of $1 million bond.
   Braun was the second person arrested in connection with the
string of slayings. The gun was found in Braun's car, and officials
planned to conduct ballistics tests today. Results of the tests are
expected Wednesday.
   Paul Renfrow, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
spokesman in Oklahoma City, said earlier ballistics tests indicated
that four people slain last week in Garden City, Ardmore, Okla.,
and Pampa, Texas, were shot with one gun.
   Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., was charged Sunday in
Ardmore with first-degree murder. Police did not find a gun on
Greene.
   Carter County District Attorney Fred Collins, who filed the
charge against Greene, said Monday he didn't want to discuss the
case until he had heard from officers sent to Raton to investigate
Braun.
   ``This is the most ridiculous headache. It is not simple,''
Collins said.
   In Raton, Deputy District Attorney Leslie Skinner said there was
no information linking Braun to the killings in Oklahoma, Texas and
Kansas, and no indication Braun and Greene knew each other.
   But Capt. Stan Wojdylak of the Garden City Police Department
said, ``Right now we're not ruling anybody out.'' His department
also sent detectives to New Mexico.
   ``We just have to see what happens when we talk to the person in
New Mexico. These are probably our two best leads,'' Wojdylak said,
referring to Greene and Braun.
   Pampa authorities have charged Greene with capital murder in the
shooting of a Pampa photo processing business owner, but Pampa
Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Hall said: ``Just because we made an
arrest doesn't mean we're not going to continue ... following up on
each and every lead we can.''
   Braun was arrested near Cimarron on Sunday evening, about 40
minutes after a holdup at a mini-mart in the nearby town of
Springer left clerk Geraldine Valdez, 48, dead with two gunshot
wounds to the head.
   ``Someone called and gave us a description of a vehicle,''
Colfax County Sheriff Jim Maldonado said Monday. He said Braun
surrendered peacefully.
   Braun stood quietly at his arraignment. A magistrate said a
preliminary hearing would be held within 10 days.
   Meanwhile in Ardmore, a judge denied bond for Greene and set a
preliminary hearing for Sept. 28.
   In an interview Sunday with The Daily Oklahoman, Greene's
father, Hank, said of his son: ``He would give you the shirt off
his back. He's never even had a weapon in his house. He's never
liked them. He was always afraid the kids would get ahold of them.
He's never done no physical harm to anyone.''
   The killings began early Wednesday in Garden City, when Barbara
Kochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, were abducted from
convenience stores on opposite sides of the southwestern Kansas
city. Their bodies were found hours later.
   On Thursday, Edley Perry Spurrier was found dead in the photo
processing shop he ran in Pampa, in the Texas Panhandle.
   In Ardmore, Gwen Miller was killed in a flower shop Friday, and
two other women were wounded.
   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of the
survivors, Joann Bean, had identified Greene from photographs as
the man who shot her, Mrs. Miller and Mary Manning.
   Meanwhile, in Merrillville, Ind., police said the March slayings
of two motel clerks may be related to the killings in Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.

   President Bush's top lieutenant in the war on
drugs agrees that ``crack is worse than taxes,'' but he isn't ready
to call for a tax increase to pay for the fight. Bush's spokesman
said today the president doesn't support such a boost, either.
   ``Maybe down the road we will,'' William J. Bennett said after a
closed meeting with leaders of the U.S. Conference of Mayors on
Monday. ``But I think there are other choices.''
   Bush pledged during his election campaign that he would not
support new taxes, and press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today
that the president remains ``opposed to raising taxes for any
purpose.''
   Fitzwater said there were ``practical problems'' with proposals,
suggested by some in Congress, to sell federal bonds to pay for the
drug war.
   He said the president believed that if more money is needed, it
should be obtained through ``the more traditional route'' of a
congressional appropriation or a shift of money from other programs.
   But some mayors who met Monday with Bennett said citizens will
support new taxes if the money is used to fight drugs.
   ``Most of us have had to raise taxes in our local communities
already to deal with the drug problem, so we're not afraid to
recommend that,'' said Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, president of
the conference.
   ``The people are ready to accept an increase in taxes if they
knew that the taxes were going solely to interdict drugs and not
for some social program which they may or may not agree with,''
said New York City Mayor Ed Koch.
   Koch said the slogan ``crack is worse than taxes means that
people will pay to have this monster lifted from their shoulders so
their kids can be protected.''
   The mayors met with Bennett, director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, to push a 16-point plan they want included in
the strategy he is to produce by Sept. 5. One point calls for
increased funding for state and local programs.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn called for $3 billion in federal
funds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug war,
and he complained that Bennett remained vague on the money issue.
   ``This is a lot of baloney, what's going on here,'' Flynn said
in an interview. ``Unless they're willing to put real dollars on
the line ... they're not sincere in the war on drugs.''
   Flynn said he asked Bennett whether he would support the $3
billion appropriation and was told, ```It depends on what Congress
does.'''
   Bennett agreed that some funds should come from the federal
government, but he would not give a figure.
   ``Mayors always ask for more,'' he said.
   Two California Republicans, Sen. Pete Wilson and Rep. Jerry
Lewis, introduced legislation last week to sell $4 billion worth of
savings bonds to raise money to fight the drug war. Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., said Monday he was offering a similar bill.
   Despite the differences, Whitmire described the meeting as ``a
very good dialogue.'' Even Washington Mayor Marion Barry, whose
relationship with Bennett has been cool, called it ``a great
meeting.''
   The other mayors at the meeting were: Robert Isaac, Colorado
Springs, Colo.; Joseph Riley, Charleston, S.C.; Richard Berkley,
Kansas City, Mo.; Arthur Holland, Trenton, N.J.; Wilson Goode,
Philadelphia; William Hudnut, Indianapolis; Jerry Abramson,
Louisville; Joseph Paolino, Providence; Jessie Rattley, Newport
News, Va.; Theodore Mann, Newton, Mass.; William Althaus, York,
Pa.; and John Rousakis, Savannah, Ga.

   A 17-year-old girl gave birth to a healthy
child today, hours after her father set her on fire during an
argument. The new mother was in critical condition with
third-degree burns over 70 percent of her body.
   Kimberly Richmond, who was 8{ months pregnant, gave birth at
3:45 a.m. at Children's Medical Hospital in Akron, according to
Akron Police Captain Jerry Foys.
   Foys said police arrested her father, Joseph Richmond, 41,
without incident at the hospital and charged him with felonious
assault. He was being held in the Summit County jail.
   Hospital officials said the girl delivered a healthy, 4-pound
girl.
   She was on a respirator in the hospital's burn unit after having
her baby by Caesarian section, said hospital spokeswoman Carol
Wallace.
   ``Apparently, the father and daughter had an argument over
something; we're not sure about what,'' Foys said. ``It happened at
their home. He went and got some flammable liquid _ we think it was
brake fluid _ and poured it onto the girl and set her afire.''
   Police said the argument occurred at about 8:20 p.m. Monday. Foy
said police learned about the assault from hospital officials after
the girl was admitted.

   Military troops from the United States and
Australia will hold a month-long exercise, the largest for the two
nations since World War II, in northern Australia next month,
Pentagon officials announced Tuesday.
   During the exercise, dubbed ``Kangaroo 89,'' the U.S. and
Australian armed forces will conduct mock battles in the air, land
and sea over an area the size of western Erope. About 2,300 U.S.
military personnel will join thousands of active and reserve troops
from Australia.
   ```Kangaroo 89' will test both countries _ Australia on how well
it can defend its territory and the United States on its ability to
deploy forces to a distant location and operate once there,''
according to a Pentagon statement.
   U.S. Navy ships and aircraft will conduct anti-submarine,
anti-air and anti-surface warfare training with their Australian
counterparts, the statement said.
   The manuevers, which begin Aug. 1, are part of a series of
exercises between the United States and Australia.

<HEAD>Cavazos Says Board Should Remain Free from Federal Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should not give money to an
independent board that is working to develop a national, voluntary
teacher certification system, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos
said Tuesday.
   However, Cavazos said the Bush administration supports the goals
of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, which
plans to start offering the certificates in 1993 to qualified
applicants who make it through a rigorous evaluation process.
   Board members believe their plan ultimately will upgrade teacher
training and the profession in general, open doors to new roles and
possibly higher pay for certified teachers, and improve the
learning environment for children.
   ``The board currently operates with total independence from the
federal government. And that, in my judgment, is the way it ought
to remain,'' Cavazos told the House Education and Labor
subcommittee on postsecondary education.
   The 63-member board, made up of teachers, other educators,
government officials and prominent business leaders, is asking for
$25 million from Congress to help fund its research into standards
and assessment methods. Business executives have said they will
match that amount but cannot hope to raise more.
   ``These private leaders say they consider it imperative that our
national government provide a one-time appropriation of $25 million
that the private sector will match,'' said board chairman James
Hunt, a former governor of North Carolina.
   In a statement submitted to the panel, Hunt said anything less
than $50 million would result in piecemeal reform rather than the
broad effort needed to help the board ``do the job right.''
   Cavazos cited three major concerns: the board lacks
accountability to the education secretary, the money requested is
excessive and would likely duplicate department research, and the
department opposes sole-source contracts awarded without
competition.
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said he could think of better ways to
use $25 million if the objective is to attract more and better
teachers. ``We should put our priorities in order,'' he said,
adding he would prefer to see the money used to forgive loans for
students who agree to teach in poor areas.
   But others on the subcommittee said they wanted to find a middle
ground.
   ``These people want to do something for this country and I don't
want to turn them off,'' said Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.
   He suggested that the board itself award research grants
competitively and submit to oversight by Congress and the
department. He also said the $25 million, if deemed excessive,
could be reduced.
   Subcommittee chairman Pat Williams, D-Mont., said Coleman's
suggestions appeared to offer ``some room here for some type of a
coming together. ... Is there room to work with the
administration?''
   Cavazos said he would enter into discussions with an open mind.
But he said he could not support the request as currently
structured and invited the board to apply for money on the same
competitive basis that other federal grants are awarded.
   Witnesses for the American Association of School Administrators
and the Council of Chief State School Officers said they favored
the federal appropriation as long as the board required competitive
bidding and peer reviews for research contracts and the $25 million
did not come from other federal education programs.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has approved the
board's $25 million request as part of an omnibus education bill
that also includes President Bush's proposals for several new
education programs. The bill is expected to come to the floor in
September.

   A Navy radar plane
crashed on takeoff at this San Diego base, killing two of three
crewmen, while two other fliers were plucked from the Pacific after
their fighter ditched offshore.
   The first crash occurred about 5:30 p.m. Monday at North Island
as a jet used to jam enemy radar was attempting to take off for a
training run, military officials said.
   The twin-engine EA-6B Prowler failed to lift off as it was
embarking on the homeward leg of a training flight that began
Monday morning at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington
state, officials said.
   ``It crashed just as it reached the end of the runway,'' said
Lt. Jack Papp, a Navy spokesman.
   ``There was nothing left. The plane's a complete loss,'' he said.
   Killed were the pilot, Lt. John A. Zibel, 31, of Coal Center,
Pa., and an electronic countermeasures officer, Lt. j.g. Kevin
Leslie, 27, of Beverly, Mass., said Mary Ann Heiserman, a
spokeswoman at Whidbey Island.
   Lt. Cmdr. Chauncey L. Mitchell, 35, of Beaumont, Texas, another
electronic countermeasures officer, survived with minor injuries,
Ms. Heiserman said.
   He was listed in stable condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in
San Diego, said Lt. Jack Papp, a Navy spokesman.
   The Prowler is designed to be launched from a carrier and to jam
land-based enemy radar during long-range bombing missions, Papp
said. The crash was being investigated.
   Hours later, a Navy F-14 fighter jet went down around 9 p.m. six
miles off San Clemente Island, which lies about 60 miles northwest
of San Diego.
   The pilot, Lt. Stephen Molter, 28, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and the
radar intercept officer, Lt. Daniel Crisp, 27, of Marion, Ohio,
parachuted into the water and were picked up 43 minutes later by a
small Navy boat.
   They were examined at a clinic on San Clemente, then returned to
the mainland. Both were in ``good shape,'' Ms. Carleton said.
   The F-14, part of squadron VF 51 at Miramar and normally
stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Vinson, was on a mission
to practice landings on a simulated carrier deck on the island, 60
miles northwest of San Diego.
   Ms. Carleton did not know at which point of the mission the jet
crashed. There were indications of an engine stall and resulting
control problems, and the crew elected to eject, she said.
   Both crashes were under investigation.

<HEAD>Somali Cabinet Ministers Arrested, Accused of Plotting Against State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunfire broke out in Somalia's capital
near the home of the ousted defense minister who was detained this
week on charges of plotting against the government, sources said
Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, a human rights group said house-to-house searches
and detentions continued in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, nearly
two weeks after deadly clashes between Moslem worshipers and Somali
soldiers.
   The brief outburst of shooting started Monday, apparently when
soldiers went to search the home of former Defense Minister Aden
Abdullahi Nur, according to a resident who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He did not know if there were casualties.
   Nur was stripped of his defense portfolio in a Cabinet shakeup
this year and remained minister-without-portfolio in the office of
autocratic President Mohamed Siad Barre.
   He and a fellow minister-without-portfolio, Mohammed Abdulleh
Ba'adleh, were arrested Monday and accused of plotting against the
state, according to Mogadishu sources. Ba'adleh had been minister
of interior until the Cabinet shuffle.
   State-run Mogadishu Radio announced Monday the two are accused
of acts which ``threatened the sovereignty, unity and security and
togetherness of the large community of the Somali people.''
   The broadcast, monitored in neighboring Kenya, said prosecutors
are investigating the ministers. The broadcast did not say they
were arrested.
   Nur is a member of Somalia's Ogadeni clan, which reportedly has
been feuding with the govenment in central and southern Somalia.
The Horn of Africa nation's 6 million people all belong to the
Somali tribe, which is divided into half a dozen major clans. Siad
Barre belongs to the Marehan clan.
   It is not clear whether the charges against Nur and Ba'adleh are
related to July 14 riots when security forces opened fire on Moslem
worshipers in Mogadishu. The human rights group Africa Watch said
troops killed as many as 400 civilians. The government put the toll
at 23.
   Africa Watch, in a statement sent by telex to Nairobi, claimed
Tuesday that arrests and house-to-house searches that followed and
in which at least 2,000 people have been arrested continue in
Mogadishu, although on a reduced scale.
   Troops still are enforcing a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew relaxed
from a dawn-to-dusk curfew imposed July 14, residents said.
   The violence erupted after the July 13 arrests of four Moslem
leaders and an unspecified number of civilians, according to Africa
Watch, which has offices in London and Washington. Islam is the
state religion of the impoverished, pastoral nation.
   The claims are difficult to assess as the government has refused
to allow Western journalists into the country since heavy fighting
broke out between government forces and the northern rebel Somali
National Movement in May 1988.
   Siad Barre has ruled Somalia as a one-party state since 1969 and
has battled the northern rebels since 1981.

<HEAD>Navy Man Cleared After 4{ Years in Prison Returns to Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy man who was cleared of a murder
conviction after 4{ years in prison rejoined the service, praising
his superiors for standing by him while he fought the charges.
   Surrounded by at least 40 friends, James Robert Steele was
restored Monday to his former rank of petty officer in a
re-enlistment ceremony at the Construction Battalion Center in
Gulfport.
   ``We're always glad to have good sailors re-enlist,'' said Capt.
Herb Lewis, the center's commanding officer.
   Steele, 38, was convicted in 1985 of killing 23-month-old
Christina Sinclair, the daughter of his then-girlfriend, Kathy
Sinclair of Long Beach, Miss.
   He spent 4{ years behind bars before the Mississippi Supreme
Court reversed his conviction in April, ruling the evidence was
insufficient.
   The Navy never discharged Steel, but his commission expired in
1986 while he was in prison. In a 10-minute ceremony, Steel was
honorably discharged from his first commission, then re-enlisted
for two more years in the Seabees.
   He was given a good-conduct medal for behavior during the
earlier tour of duty, and officials have promised to restore back
pay that was withheld while he was in prison.
   ``I'm happy that I'm still in the military,'' Steele said. ``I
think them sticking behind me like they did speaks well of the
military.''
   The Navy awaited the outcome of Steele's appeal before ruling on
his status.
   ``The Navy has gone along with the legal system, and justice has
prevailed,'' Lewis said. ``We accept the final outcome.''
   At his trial, prosecutors said Steele killed the girl by
slamming her head against a flat object on Oct. 10, 1984. The child
died 13 days later. Steele maintained the child fell out of bed.

   Testimony about a doctored bank document
intensified the furor over Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings
and prompted a longtime supporter to raise the possibility of the
mayor's resignation.
   Bradley, who was elected this year to a fifth term, faces
criticism for his personal financial affairs, including taking
consulting fees from a bank that had dealings with the city and
serving on the board of a savings and loan.
   Bradley should consider resigning if he is found to have
influenced city decisions to deposit money in Far East National
Bank, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, long a supporter of the
mayor, said after a council committee meeting Monday.
   ``If he can't explain away any of this, he is going to have to
assess his effectiveness in running the city,'' Ms. Flores told the
Los Angeles Times. She added, however, that she was not
recommending that Bradley quit.
   Bradley today insisted that he wouldn't resign, and said he
didn't know why the phrase ``per the mayor'' was blotted out on a
worksheet detailing a $2 million investment of city funds.
   Questioned by reporters after a City Hall news conference on
another matter, Bradley said: ``To anyone who has any such
thoughts, I'll be around here four years from now, as mayor of this
city.''
   Officials testifying before the council's budget committee
revealed Monday that the notation ``per the mayor'' was removed
from a bid document from Far East and replaced with that of the
city treasurer, Leonard Rittenberg.
   The change was made to a document dated March 23, one day after
the bank was given $2 million in city deposits without going
through the usual competitive bidding process, the council panel
was told Monday.
   ``Per the mayor'' had been written under a section on the
document reporting the deposits, but was changed to read ``per
Leonard Rittenberg,'' said Edward Corser, head of the chief
administrative office's audit and management division.
   Bradley's name was blacked out with a marking pen, then covered
with typewriter correction fluid and replaced with the treasurer's,
Corser said.
   An audit released by Corser's office last week concluded that
Rittenberg ordered the deposits only a day after Bradley asked the
treasurer about the city's relationship with the bank.
   The audit also found that Rittenberg had tried to cover up the
transaction by creating documents that purported to show other
banks competing for the deposits.
   Bradley refused to comment on the latest developments. Deputy
Mayor Mike Gage denied that Bradley exerted influence on Far East's
behalf.
   Gage said the mayor immediately returned his $18,000 adviser's
fee from Far East after learning from his March 22 conversation
with Rittenberg of the bank's dealings with the city.
   Rittenberg told the committee the original reference to Bradley
on the document was simply a mistake made by one of his
subordinates.
   ``This is a worksheet,'' Rittenberg said of the document.
``Quite often, things are written on them (and) whited out, crossed
out.
   ``Nowhere did I instruct or tell my staff to make those
placements `per the mayor,''' Rittenberg testified.
   Corser testified that the document was altered after Rittenberg
informed aides that Bradley's ties to the bank were being examined
by reporters.
   Bradley's financial dealings with Far East and with Valley
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, which paid him $24,000 a year as a board
member until he resigned earlier this year, are the subject of
investigations by the city attorney, the city controller and
federal banking authorities.

<HEAD>Africans Praise U.S. Congress for Rejecting South African Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity hailed the U.S. Congress on Tuesday
for objecting to a Washington visit by South Africa's
President-designate F.W. de Klerk.
   In a speech to African leaders at the pan-African organization's
annual summit, Ide Oumarou of Niger noted that 100 congressmen had
written President Bush objecting to de Klerk's scheduled visit
later this year.
   The congressmen said Bush should not entertain de Klerk, who is
expected to succeed President P.W. Botha in September, until
Pretoria improves its human rights record.
   Oumarou said the action ``speaks eloquently of the determination
of the Congress to take a firm stand'' against white-run South
Africa.
   However, he praised the Bush administration for making ``a
decisive contribution for law, peace and security to prevail'' in
South Africa.
   He said the U.S.-brokered agreement providing for Namibia's
independence from South Africa shows the influence Washington can
bring to bear on African issues.
   Oumarou is seeking re-election to a second four-year term as the
organization's secretary-general and faces a stiff challenge from
Salim A. Salim, Tanzania's deputy prime minister and defense
minister.
   Conference sourcese say the rivals appear to be running
neck-to-neck and each has been asked to withdraw in favor of the
one with the most votes if neither achieves the necessary
two-thirds majority after two secret ballots Wednesday.
   The proposed deal reportedly was brokered by Presiden's Mengistu
Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, Moussa Traore of Mali, the organization's
outgoing chairman, and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Mubarak on Monday
takes over leadership of the 50-nation organization that was
founded in 1963 and is the world's largest continental body.
   Meanwhile, sources close to the Egyptian delegation said Mubarak
met privately Monday with Sudanese rebel leader Col. John Garang,
whose Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting the Khartoum
government for six years in southern Sudan.
   Mubarak stopped in Khartoum en route to Addis Ababa on Sunday
and met with Sudan's new military leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
Ahmed el-Bashir, who has called for peace talks with the southern
rebels since he ousted an elected civilian government June 30.
   ``It is a very complicated matter and cannot be solved
immediately,'' a source said after Mubarak met Garang. ``The
meeting was part of Egypt's effort to find a solution to the Sudan
problem.''
   Garang has not been seen at the conference, but one of his key
advisers, former Sudanese Foreign Minister Mansour Khalid, has been
circulating extensively among delegates.
   El-Bashir, in a speech to African leaders Tuesday, extended a
unilateral cease-fire for one month and again pledged his best
efforts to settle with the rebels. Garang has not responded
directly, but appears to be tacitly accepting the cease-fire.

   The body of a 36-year-old doctor was found
Tuesday in a bathroom of the hospital where he worked with three
syringes scattered next to him, police said.
   Dr. William Westerfield, a second-year resident at Methodist
Hospital in Brooklyn, had no visible wounds and an autopsy was
planned to determine the cause of death, according to police
spokesman Vincent Jones.
   The body was found curled in a fetal position on the floor of a
staff bathroom after an employee summoned a maintenence worker to
open the locked door, said hospital spokesman Daniel Rowland. It
was not yet determined what the syringes contained, officials said.
   Westerfield had a wife and two children and lived in Brooklyn,
officials said.
   ``We're still dealing with the shock of it,'' Rowland said.
``The staff knew him to be a caring, competent and qualified
physician.''

   Actor Rex Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth

   After the ceremony, he formally will be called Sir Reginald but
said he preferred Sir Rex, for the nickname he has used throughout
his career.
   The 81-year-old actor best known for his Oscar-winning role as
Henry Higgins in the movie ``My Fair Lady,'' was awarded the
knighthood in recognition of his services to the arts.
   ``I think they rather like to leave awarding honors until you
get to a certain age,'' he said. ``It was a marvelous moment
kneeling there and getting tapped on each shoulder.''
   Knights must kneel before the queen who taps them on both
shoulders with a sword as part of the ceremony.
   Harrison, who is due to star in the W. Somerset Maugham comedy
``The Circle,'' on Broadway this fall, said he has no plans to
retire because ``I wouldn't know what to do.''

   Nothing in the United Airlines DC-10 crash at
Sioux City, Iowa, indicates that other DC-10s are unsafe or that
anything more now needs to be done to make them safer,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Tuesday.
   Skinner defended a declaration by new Federal Aviation
Administration head James Busey that the DC-10 is a safe aircraft
even though the cause of the crash Wednesday that killed 111 people
has not been determined.
   Investigators are focusing on evidence that the triple-jet's
tail engine blew up, disabling its hydraulic steering system, but
they have offered no explanation for the explosive engine failure.
   Transportation Department experts have been made available for
the crash investigation, Skinner told a news conference, ``but
nothing has been indicated to us that we should do anything we're
not doing.''
   He said the decision to affirm that the DC-10 is safe is based
on the aircraft's record. Its manufacturer, Douglas Aircraft, says
DC-10s have flown 745 million passengers 7 billion miles over two
decades. The airliner also has been in some of history's worst air
disasters, blamed on maintenance problems, pilot error or a cargo
door defect that has been corrected.
   Skinner said if the department said nothing about the DC-10, it
might imply that something was wrong.
   Nothing in the plane's record indicates that it is either
inherently unsafe or that ``anything needs to be done that hasn't
been done,'' he said.
   If, however, evidence is uncovered during the National
Transportation Safety Board's investigation of the Iowa crash that
indicates a problem, action will be taken, Skinner said.
   The FAA has the power to ground an airplane, as it did with the
DC-10 after a 1979 Chicago crash that killed 275 people and was
later blamed on a faulty maintenance procedure by American Airlines.
   It also issues ``airworthiness directives'' that require work on
airliners within a set period of time when a problem is found.
   Skinner, in a statement he said was not related to the crash of
the 15-year-old United DC-10, also said the department is
continuing to study how to keep aging airliners free of problems,
including corrosion.
   An industry study is expected within a few weeks that will
recommend mandatory maintenance of DC-10s and other McDonnell
Douglas-manufactured models. A similar study earlier this year
recommended work on Boeing airliners and most recommendatons in the
study were later adopted by the FAA as mandatory.

<HEAD>Delaware Governor Urges New Programs to Fight Drug Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delaware Gov. Michael M. Castle called Tuesday
for stepped up education and treatment for substance abusers in
prison as a means of relieving crowded conditions and making
streets safer.
   ``Dealing with the inmates while they are in the institutions
just might be the key to solving the prison crisis, because sooner
or later the overwhelming majority will be released,'' Castle told
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   He pointed to therapy programs to give inmates a more positive
self-image plus education and prevention programs and efforts to
keep the prisons themselves drug-free.
   Castle's comments came as Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., opened
hearings in advance of drug policy coordinator William Bennett's
scheduled Sept. 5 announcement of a strategy for waging war on drug
abuse.
   Biden said his hearings would explore topics ranging from how to
fund the war on drugs to how to fight it. He said the problem of
imprisoned substance abusers is serious and displayed a number of
means by which drugs have been smuggled behind bars.
   While cameras clicked, Biden took apart a woman's shoe in which
had been hidden what he described as ``a little ol' green pill.''
He also held up a jar of carrot baby food containing an orange bag
with narcotics inside.
   Castle told the panel that the ``drug problem has dealt a blow
to our overall criminal justice system.''
   ``Our courts are clogged with extensive backlogs, prosecution
caseloads have doubled in many jurisdictions, our police find
themselves in many instances outmanned and outgunned in dealing
with drug traffickers,'' he said.
   Castle said he had signed into law a measure that would provide
a minimum penalty of three years in prison for trafficking in no
more than 5 grams of a narcotic substance. He also said he recently
agreed to build a new 600-bed prison.
   But the Delaware governor said the number of arrests is so great
that even before that prison is finished, the state may be planning
to construct a new one.
   ``I am concerned... that we have done too little to consider
alternatives to hard time in maximum security institutions,'' he
said. He said efforts should be made to head off the problems
before they land in court.
   In addition to therapy and drug abuse prevention programs,
Castle called for vocational help and basic education for inmates.
He cited estimates that 75 percent are functionally illiterate when
they enter and the vast majority still are when they leave. ``It is
essential that programs to teach reading and writing to the inmates
be established,'' he said.
   Castle also said sentencing alternative should be expanded.
   ``Certainly big-time dealers must be dealt with in the harshest
way possible,'' he said. ``But we also need effective ways to deal
with the little fish we catch in our nets, and I would argue that
different approaches are necessary.''
   As an example, he said courts ``should not punish the users of
small amounts of drugs as we would those who are major
traffickers.''

   Notices of appeal were filed by the court-appointed lawyer for

   Jackson also is appealing another conviction on five counts of
second-degree assault and first-degree criminal mistreatment for
beating Ecclesia children in her care from July 1 to Oct. 14, 1988.
   It is unlikely the state Court of Appeals will hear the cases

   A dozen Palestinians and
Israelis sat in a circle on a veranda overlooking biblical
Shepherds Field, engaging in blunt conversation they hope will
change enmity to trust.
   Israeli army trucks rumbled past every few minutes, lending
urgency to the unofficial meeting at the apartment of Ghassan
Andoni, a physics professor at Bir Zeit University.
   ``There is a silent majority in the Israeli public that is not
motivated by ideology but by its fears,'' said Andoni, who had just
been confined to a tent prison in the desert for 18 days for
political activism. ``This could change if we can win their trust,''
   An Israeli musician named Dany interrupted to say: ``For 20
years this land has been occupied by Israel, yet most Israelis do
not know Palestinians and vice versa. When they do meet, it is in
unequal situations like at a checkpoint.''
   Dany, who is in his 50s, did not give his surname for fear his
comments would threaten his job.
   More than 30 such encounters have occurred in the past year
between Palestinians and Israelis, most of them intellectuals or
professionals.
   Beit Sahur, a wealthy Christian town of 10,000, has been a focal
point of nonviolent civil disobedience. It is where the New
Testament says the birth of Jesus was revealed to shepherds.
   The informal meetings are unofficial accompaniment to talks
between prominent Palestinians and Israeli officials, including
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, about holding elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for Palestinians to negotiate
with Israel.
   Exchanges between Israeli leftists and Palestine Liberation
Organization officials have occurred abroad, often in academic
forums. The future of such contacts depends on Israel's Supreme
Court, to which four leftists have appealed a law making contacts
with the PLO punishable by three years in jail.
   On Tuesday, a Palestinian lawyer known as a PLO supporter said
he had met with Shamir, a contradiction of government claims that
the prime minister had spoken about his peace plan only with
Palestinians not connected with the PLO.
   In Beit Sahur, Hebrew University lecturer Sidra Ezrachi recalled
that the conversation group organized a weekend visit by more than
50 Israelis to the Arab town and the Israelis brought children,
prayer books and kosher food. Palestinians later went to the
Israelis' homes and attended synagogue services.
   ``My kids were playing outside, and I suddenly realized that I
wasn't worried about them being here,'' Ms. Ezrachi said.
   Publicity, however, also brought two anonymous telephone from
Jewish extremists who threatened to kill her family.
   Members of the group try to break down each other's stereotypes.
That has been difficult, even painful, especially when the
conversation turns from personal to the political or from present
to past.
   ``At some point we stopped talking about history, about who was
right,'' Ms. Ezrachi said. ``It was too painful.''
   Andoni said Palestinians, as a result of the 19-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation, now can approach Israelis as
equals and accept the idea of two states, one for Jews and one for
Arabs.
   ``All the time we were trying to de-legitimize the other side by
saying Zionism is racism, that the existence of the Jewish state
was illegal,'' he said. ``In the same way, Israelis accused us of
being terrorists, disqualifying us from being a people or needing a
state.
   ``We realized that Israelis are not going to disappear, and they
realized Palestinians are not going to go away.''
   Many Israelis are reluctant to participate in such
conversations, feeling them inappropriate while the two peoples are
in a state of war.
   Palestinians fear other Palestinians will see their
participation as acceptance of the status quo, and also that
Israeli officials will try to cast them as substitutes for the PLO
in the territories.
   Israelis and Palestinians in the Beit Sahur group have come to
consider themselves friends, but tensions linger.
   Andoni, who noted with a chuckle that he read part of the Jewish
Torah in jail, said he was increasingly discouraged by public
opinion polls indicating more hawkish Israeli attitudes. He also
suffers doubt.
   ``I always ask myself, `Am I doing wrong speaking with my
victimizers? Should I speak with the other side while they are
killing our people?''' he said.
   After reflection, Andoni added: ``Until now, though, we still
have the strength to forgive.''
   Dany said hawkish Israeli views stem from anti-Israeli violence.
   ``It is easy to pull to the extremes when you see what happened
with the bus,'' he said.
   On July 6, a Palestinian seized the steering wheel of an Israeli
commuter bus and forced it off the highway into a ravine, killing
16 Jews. Twenty-five people were injured.
   More than 520 Palestinians have died in confrontations with
Israelis since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and 38 Israelis
have been killed.

<HEAD>Little League Baseball Announces Program for Disabled Youngsters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Little League Baseball announced Tuesday a
program to allow disabled children nationwide to play baseball and
softball in a new division starting next year.
   Called the Challenger Division, the program is aimed at
youngsters aged 6 through 18 with physical and mental disabilities.
   ``Every child should have the cherished opportunity to wear a
Little League uniform and that is the goal of the Challenger
Division,'' said Creighton J. Hale, president of Little League
Baseball. ``We are simply extending the benefits of Little League
participation to disabled children and filling a void that has
existed in their lives.''
   The program was unveiled at a news conference in the Capitol
office of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who served as
chairman of a task force formed by Little League Baseball in 1988
to develop the program.
   ``One of childhood's most treasured experiences is Little League
baseball participation,'' said Dole, who was an athlete in college
before suffering disabling injuries in World War II. ``Now ...
every child can enjoy our great summer game and learn lessons that
will last a lifetime.''
   The Challenger Division was inspired by baseball programs for
the disabled that parents started in four cities, the first of
which began in Brockton, Mass., in 1985. A similar program was
formed in Bristol, Conn. in 1986, with others now in Spring, Texas
and Louisville, Ky.
   ``I can't tell you the joy and pleasure and sheer rhapsody of
these kids being able to participate in America's No. 1 sport,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who served on the Little League task
force and has thrown out the opening baseball to start the summer
league in Brockton the past three years.
   One of the organizers of the Connecticut program, Ed Beardsley,
and his 11-year-old son, David, attended the ceremony. David,
dressed in his uniform, presented a book with team pictures to
Kerry.
   Ten-year-old Joe DeLaRosa, of Spring, Texas, who has spina
bifida, gave a baseball jersey and cap to the senator. Tuesday was
Joe's birthday.
   ``It's been great,'' said Brenda DeLaRosa, his mother.
``Baseball has always been his favorite sport.''
   Participants in the Challenger Division will play with the same
equipment and on the same field as used in other Little League
games. However, Hale said the rules are more flexible to allow
local programs to tailor games to meet the needs and skills of
participating youngsters.
   The new division allows for a ``buddy system'' in which
volunteers, often players from other Little League divisions, can
assist disabled players at bat and in the field. For example, a
volunteer can push a wheelchair-bound player around the base paths
or help in retrieving balls.
   Hale did not know how many cities would establish programs for
the disabled in the 1990 season, but said a future goal is to have
a World Series championship for the Challenger Division.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Narrowly Approves Bush Diplomatic Choices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of President Bush's ambassadorial
nominees, accused by Democrats of having no qualifications except
political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   With Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., joining committee Republicans,
the panel first voted 10-9 to send to the Senate floor the
nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be
ambassador to Spain.
   Then, by voice votes, it approved the equally controversial
nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be
ambassador to Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real
estate broker, to be ambassador to New Zealand.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who led the fight against the
nominees, vowed to continue the battle on the Senate floor.
   ``One looks through this resume wondering why this person has
been appointed to this position,'' Sarbanes said of Zappala.
   ``The answer is to be found in the appendix which lists the
campaign contributions.
   ``If we are going to reduce it to that we should put the office
up for public auction and put the money in the Treasury to reduce
the deficit,'' Sarbanes said.
   In other action the committee routinely gave its approval to the
nomination of former child actress Shirley Temple Black to be
ambassador to Czechoslovakia. She won praise for her performance in
a previous appointment as U.S. ambassador to Ghana.
   It also approved Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the Holy See;
William Howard Taft IV, to be the permanent U.S. representative on
the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Keith L.
Brown to be ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a
Washington lawyer and real estate developer, to be ambassador to
Switzerland.
   Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family have given nearly
$225,000 to the Republican National Committee and state GOP
campaigns since 1984.
   The American Academy of Diplomacy gave Gildenhorn, Zappala,
Sembler and Newman ``unqualified'' ratings. Sarbanes said Zappala
and Sembler each gave more than $100,000 to Republican causes and
Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush For
President Committee.
   Sarbanes also said 30 of the 44 ambassadors named thus far by
Bush have been political appointees, not career ambassadors.
   ``This 68 percent of political nominations far exceeds such
appointments at a comparable point in previously elected
administrations,'' he said.
   Sending unqualified envoys insults the country involved,
demoralizes the professional foreign service and says to the world,
``America is not serious about diplomacy,'' Sarbanes said. ``Would
one for a moment consider nominating generals and admirals in the
same fashion?''
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., noted that although Zappala is being
sent to ``the pre-eminent Spanish-speaking country in the world, he
does not speak Spanish.''
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said Zappala, Sembler and Newman
will bring unique qualifications to their ambassadorships. ``I
believe they are indeed competent people who have achieved a great
deal and are besides close friends of the president,'' he said.
   But Sarbanes said the Senate was given the power to reject
presidential nominees in order to weed out ``cronies'' and ``unfit
characters.''
   ``It matters who ambassadors are,'' he said. ``It is not enough
to send a political appointee and hope he or she won't make
mistakes.''

   The pilot of United Flight 232 said
today that there was no procedure to handle the complete hydraulic
failure that caused the plane to crash, so the crew ``made it up as
we went along.''
   Capt. Al C. Haynes said the plane's seasoned crew made the best
of a bad situation and that he never worried about the plane
crashing. The crippled plane crashed while attempting to land at
Sioux Gateway Airport, killing 111 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``We have a lot of experience here and it showed up in the
cockpit,'' Haynes, 57, told reporters at a news conference shortly
before his release from a hospital. ``There is no substitute, as
far as I am concerned, for experience.''
   Haynes, who has been a United pilot for 33 years, was wheeled
into the news conference in a wheelchair, and gashes and bruises
were visible on his face and neck. However, he said all of his
stitches had been removed and he was in good health.
   He declined to discuss last week's crash in detail, saying he
wanted to wait until the National Transportation Safety Board had
completed its investigation. However, he briefly described the
situation in the cabin as he, First Officer William R. Records and
Second Officer Dudley Dvorak struggled to control the DC-10.
   After an explosion in the rear engine, he said, it became
``apparent that we had lost all of our hydraulics. ... When I asked
Dudley what the procedure was, he said we didn't have one. So we
made it up as we went along.''
   At the start of the news conference, Haynes thanked rescuers and
the crew of the plane for their help in the disaster. He also had a
message for those who lost loved ones in the flight.
   ``To the families and their friends, I would like to say that
this crew ... is dedicated to finding the cause of the this
accident, so that it may never happen again,'' he said.
   Investigators have ordered another aerial search for key parts
of Flight 232's rear engine and planned to visit the General
Electric Co. plant where the engine was made.
   Members of an NTSB team said they expected to wrap-up their work
this week at the Sioux Gateway Airport, where the DC-10
crashed-landed last Wednesday after its rear engine blew apart.
   The death toll from the crash rose to 111 on Monday. Of the 296
people on board, 185 survived, including 10 of the 11 crew members.
More than 30 people remain hospitalized.
   The investigation into the accident has been hampered because
the rear engine, one of three on the DC-10, flew apart over farms
in northwest Iowa.
   On Monday, teams searched a 16-square-mile section of corn and
soybean fields about 60 miles away from the crash site in hopes of
finding missing pieces of the engine.
   Officials also used aircraft from the Nebraska Air National
Guard to take infrared photographs of the area and asked farmers
working their fields to look for pieces of the engine.
   While some debris was recovered, key sections have yet to be
found including a 400-pound disk from the fan portion of the
engine, NTSB investigator Robert MacIntosh said Monday night.
Officials ordered another round of aerial photography.
   Other investigators will travel to a General Electric Co. plant
in Cincinnati where the rear engine was made.
   ``They will be reviewing the manufacturing history and the
manufacturing process,'' said MacIntosh.
   Thus far, investigators have found no evidence that foreign
matter went into the rear engine, he said.
   Workers cleared away large sections of rubble on Monday,
allowing a portion of the airport that had been closed since the
crash to reopen. Investigators are trying to reassemble the
aircraft's tail section in an airport hangar.
   The crew of the flight from Denver to Chicago reported they lost
all three of the airplane's hydraulic systems immediately after the
rear engine exploded. MacIntosh said probers had found breaks in
two of the systems and were still looking for a breach in the third.
   Meanwhile, residents of this city on the eastern bank of the
Missouri River were beginning to assess the impact of the crash on
their lives.
   American Red Cross officials held a ``coping session'' Monday
night where psychiatrists met with those involved in the crash
rescue operations.
   ``It's like a large group counseling session,'' said Red Cross
spokeswoman Marsha Pope. ``This is kind of one last thing to bring
some finality to it. It's been hard on everyone.''
   She said sleeplessness, loss of appetite and other symptoms are
typical reactions to stressful situations, and those were involved
need to be warned to expect those things.
   ``Those are normal reactions,'' she said. ``They don't need to
think they're going crazy.''
   Already, teams of counselors and psychiatrists were working with
the hundreds of rescue workers, many of whom found themselves
working for days on end at the grisly crash scene.
   ``You were asking a 20-year-old who had never seen a body to
walk through a cornfield littered with bodies,'' said Air Force
Col. Robert Ursano, who was heading one of the teams.

   Harry Belafonte is coming to Canton this
week to prepare for a movie about Sister Thea Bowman, a pioneer in
the movement encouraging black Catholics to express their cultural
roots within the church.
   Whoopie Goldberg has agreed to star in the film and a
screenwriter was in Canton for three weeks in December conducting
interviews, officials said.
   Belafonte, a singer, actor and producer, is scheduled to meet
with the Roman Catholic nun Thursday and Friday, a representative
in his New York office said Monday.
   Bowman, a lecturer, poet, evangelist and singer, is the only
black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. Her
appearance on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' captured the attention of

   Former Beatle Ringo Starr wants to re-record his
drum work before the release of an album he recorded in 1987, and
he obtained a court order to help give him time to redub the
performance.
   Starr's attorneys said Monday in Superior Court in Fulton County
that he was being ``blackmailed and coerced'' by a Georgia record
company and a Memphis producer who want to release the album this
week.
   Judge Ralph Hicks issued a temporary restraining order
preventing CRS Records of College Park and Chips Moman of Memphis
from releasing any recordings by Starr pending a hearing Tuesday,
but that hearing was postponed.
   Starr's lawsuit complained that the quality of the original
recordings was not up to his standards because Moman brought
alcoholic beverages to the recording sessions. Starr completed an
alcohol rehabilitation program last year.
   According to the lawsuit, Moman demanded thatStarr pay him
$146,239 for the Memphis recording sessions to prevent release of
the recording. It said Starr offered Moman $100,000 in an effort to
resolve the matter, but the offer was rejected.

   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
was lightly grilled by students in a special Stanford University
summer program on government and speech, one that he attended about
40 years ago.
   The 157 students questioned Meese on Monday about the
Iran-Contra arms deals and former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North's
sentence.
   Meese, 58, said he barely supported the arms sales to Iran, but
``in retrospect, the idea was a good one. I think the way it was
put together was imperfect.''
   Later he backtracked: ``I would not recommend it be done, but it
was one of those high-risk things that you have to do sometimes.''
   He declined comment about North's sentence.
   Meese made an impression on the students.
   ``He seemed easygoing and passive. He was almost the complete
opposite of what I expected,'' said Amanda Walzer, 16, of Sherman
Oaks.
   ``He had a warm personality,'' said Richard Hsu, 16, of Torrance.

   Actress-turned-animal-rights-advocate Brigitte
Bardot acknowledges she ordered the castration of a donkey she was
keeping for a neighbor, but she says it was out of concern for
another animal.
   She said she agreed to keep a donkey named Charly for a Lyon
businessman, Jean Pierre Manivet, but the donkey's amorous interest
in an elderly female donkey already on the grounds was so excessive
as to endanger the female.
   Bardot said in a statement issued Sunday that Charly was
castrated by a veterinarian under anesthesia.
   Manivet complained that his donkey was castrated without his
consent, but Bardot said she tried unsuccessfully to contact
Manivet.
   ``I think I am above suspicion as to the way I treat and care
for animals, whether they are confided to me or belong to me,'' she
said in a statement.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Mount First Known Protest Since Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students upset by the government
crackdown gathered this week to bang pots and sing mocking songs,
participants said, in what appeared to be the first demonstration
since the June 3-4 killings.
   At least 300 Beijing University students massed outside their
dormitories Sunday night to sing sarcastic renditions of patriotic
songs and mourn those who died in the crackdown, said participating
students who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The students also said they were protesting that work units,
especially in government offices, have rejected some graduating
seniors assigned to work for them after expressing doubts about the
students' ideological purity.
   After about an hour, the students marched to the campus area
where students had put up thousands of political posters during the
spring democracy movement, said the participants.
   They said they sang and beat pots and pans in memory of
classmates killed when government troops opened fire on protesters
and their supporters.
   Officials have said nearly 200-300 people died, but Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may
have been as high as 3,000.
   Students at Beijing University, which has a long history of
student activism, were at the hub of the six-week movement.
   One student said some young teachers joined Sunday's protest and
lighted firecrackers before the head of the school's Communist
Party office ordered them all to go home.
   The student said school officials are investigating those who
participated in the two-hour event, but no one had been punished
yet.
   He said seniors, the only ones left on campus, feel oppressed by
the monthlong ideological study classes they have been forced to
attend in order to graduate.
   ``No one dares to say what he really thinks. We all have to tell
lies,'' he said.
   The student said his classmates on Sunday night sarcastically
sang patriotic songs like ``Without the Communist Party, There
Would Be No New China'' and repeatedly shouted ``Long Live the
Communist Party!''
   No one seemed to know exactly how many students have been
rejected by work units, but a student said all but one of those
assigned to the State Security Bureau have been rejected.
   Job assignments were made in the spring before the crackdown.
Most college graduates are assigned jobs by the government.
   One government employee, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he was told to investigate a Beijing University student
assigned to his work unit to see if he had been active in the
student movement.
   In the central province of Anhui, party officials fired a
leading professor from government and party posts.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Wen Yuankai, a professor at
the Science and Technology University in Hefei, made speeches
during the spring protests to urge students on.
   Xinhua said he was fired as deputy director of the provincial
education commission and a member of the provincial party education
group.
   Wen is among dozens of academics punished for supporting the
student protests or making liberal statements.
   A leading figure on the government's wanted list is the former
vice president of Wen's university, dissident Fang Lizhi. He was
fired from that post in 1987 amid accusations he incited an earlier
round of student protests.
   He is being sheltered at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he
took refuge during the crackdown.
   In the central city of Wuhan, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin,
who was installed last month, said factories and other enterprises
must make sure workers are well-trained in ideology, official
reports said Tuesday.
   His comments were in keeping with the reinstatement of mandatory
ideological education at workplaces.
   Jiang also inspected flood prevention projects along the Yangtze
River in the central province of Hubei on his trip Friday through
Monday, Xinhua said. Flooding has killed nearly 1,700 people in
southern and central China this summer.

   Falling mortgage rates helped spur a 5.9
percent rebound in existing homes sales last month after five
months without a gain, a real estate trade group said Tuesday.
   Analysts said they expected continued improvement but cautioned
that sluggish economic growth likely would prevent anything
stronger than a modest resurgence.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.4 million units in June, up from May's rate of 3.21 million units.
   It was the first increase in sales since December 1988 and the
largest increase since December 1986, when sales jumped 6.6 percent.
   ``Finally the existing home market responded to the decline in
interest rates,'' said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America, who predicts modest improvement
through the summer.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., fixed-rate
mortgages during June fell from 10.48 percent to 10.07 percent and
have since edged down to 9.87 percent last week. Analysts expect a
small additional drop.
   However, Peach warned that fewer new jobs and lackluster
economic growth overall will keep existing home sales near 3.4
million units this year, well below last year's nine-year high of
3.59 million units.
   ``We don't think the underlying demand is strong enough to
create much of a surge,'' he said.
   Realtors President Ira Gribin said lower mortgage rates, by
making monthly payments more affordable, spurred cost-conscious
buyers in June to purchase moderately-priced homes.
   Sales in the Midwest, where prices are lowest, showed the
sharpest increase, while sales in the Northeast, where prices are
the highest, declined.
   Midwestern sales rose 18.5 percent to an annual rate of 960,000
units, the highest level since December. Sales increased 5.2
percent in the West to 610,000 units and 4.1 percent in the South
to 1.28 million units.
   In the Northeast, however, sales fell 9.8 percent to a rate of
550,000 units, the lowest level since February 1985.
   Nationally, the median sales price, meaning half the homes sold
for more and half for less, was $93,200 in June, up $600 from May
and 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
   By region, the median price was $149,800 in the Northeast, up
1.7 percent from a year ago; $134,100 in the West, up 5.6 percent;
$84,900 in the South, up 1.2 percent, and $72,100 in the Midwest,
up 3 percent.
   ``The housing market tends to march very closely on a regional
basis with trends in employment growth,'' said economist John
Hagens of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.
``In the Northeast, employment is stagnating because of high prices
for houses. There aren't very many people unemployed to bring back
to work and it's very difficult to attract employees in from other
parts of the country.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Discusses Reforms with Hungarian Leaders</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Strike, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with
two Hungarian leaders to discuss reforms aimed at ``creating a
society of free people'' in both countries, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   Gorbachev met at the Kremlin with Karoly Grosz, general
secretary of the Hungarian communist party, and Rezsoe Nyers, who
has described himself as first among equals in the reformist
four-man presidium established in a power shuffle last month.
   The two sides also discussed the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Hungary, Tass said. In May, the Red Army began the staged
withdrawal of 10,000 of its 62,000 troops stationed in Hungary.
   Grosz and Nyers left Moscow after the Kremlin meeting, Tass
reported.
   The Soviet Union has faced a wave of strikes and ethnic unrest
that accompanied the economic and political reforms launched since
Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985. Next year, Hungary will hold
its first multiparty elections since 1948.
   ``Nyers and Grosz spoke about problems encountered in Hungary
during the search for ways of updating the socio-ecomomic political
model of society,'' Tass said.
   ``Gorbachev noted the active quest in the socialist world for
ways to achieve socialist revival, to launch socialism onto a
drastically higher orbit in the name of creating a society of free
people, masters of their lives and their countries,'' Tass said.
   On Saturday, the first opposition candidate in more than 41
years, 35-year-old pastor, was elected in a local by-election to
Hungary's Communist dominated government.
   Also Tuesday, Hungary's Communist Party was reported to have
asked a British company to help coach communist politicians in the
art of public relations, but the agency later denied any knowledge
of such a plan.
   The party daily Nepszabadsag quoted an official as saying
Hungarian commmunists have asked the Charles Barker Public
Relations Ltd. of London to assist the party in its face-lifting
campaign.
   The agency on Tuesday said it had no knowledge of such a request.
   The party's rating in opinion polls has slipped in the past year
despite its embrace of reforming policies, and it is scrambling to
revamp its image ahead of the expected competitive elections next
year.

   Japan's governing party took its first steps
Tuesday toward choosing a new leader after a big election setback,
while the Socialists met with other opposition leaders on how to
take advantage of their new strength.
   Setting up what was expected to be the first legislative
showdown with the governing Liberal Democratic Party, leaders of
the Socialists and three other main opposition parties agreed to
submit a bill to abolish the 3 percent sales tax.
   The tax, rammed through Parliament by the Liberal Democrats late
last year over an opposition boycott, took effect April 1 and was
seen as a key factor in the Socialists' major gains in Sunday's
election for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.
   The Socialists' 67 seats leave them well short of a majority in
the 252-member house. But conservative Liberal Democratic Party,
now with 109, lost their majority for the first time in its 34-year
history.
   They still have a commanding majority in the more powerful lower
house, but a legislative wrangle over the tax could increase
pressure for new elections for the lower house before they are due
in July 1990.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced Monday he will resign to
take responsibility for the loss of 33 upper house seats.
   Liberal Democratic leaders decided Tuesday to set up a committee
to discuss how their next party leader should be chosen, a party
official said.
   The committee, headed by Seisuke Okuno, a nine-term member of
the lower house, will hold its first meeting Thursday, said the
official, who requested anonymity.
   But with no clear successor in sight, the selection is expected
to take up to a month. Liberal Democratic leaders have said they
hope to fill the vacancy by mid-August in time for a new session of
Parliament, which by law must convene within 30 days of an election.
   The Liberal Democratic Party still has a majority in the lower
house, which elects the prime minister.
   The party is considering three methods of choosing its next
president _ voting open to all party members, an election open only
to Liberal Democratic members of members of Parliament, and closed
negotiations among party leaders.
   The party is expected to opt for a vote among its legislators.
Voting by all 4 million party members would take time to organize
and closed negotiations likely would be criticized as undemocratic.
   On Tuesday, party Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimoto
acknowleged ``there was some dissatisfaction among party members''
when party leaders selected Uno to replace Noboru Takeshita.
   Takeshita, head of the party's largest faction, resigned to
accept responsibility for a bribery scandal that tainted much of
the Liberal Democratic elite. In the scandal, the Recruit Co., a
publishing conglomerate, was accused of doling out millions of
dollars of political donations and underpriced stocks to obtain
favors.
   Before stepping down, however, Takeshita virtually hand-picked
Uno, a colorless politician with no power base of his own, but with
no links to Recruit.
   Soon after Uno took office June 2, published reports alleged he
had kept several paid mistresses, including a geisha who later told
her story on TV.
   The new scandal outraged women's groups across the country,
after the Recruit affair already had contributed to erosion of the
Liberal Democrats' popularity. Japanese farmers, traditional
supporters of the party, were angered by moves to open Japan's farm
product market wider to imports.
   Trading on Japan's stock market Tuesday was bullish, even though
the election marked the first big defeat for the pro-business
Liberal Democrats since the nation emerged as a financial
superpower.
   The government on Tuesday sought to minimize the impact of its
political troubles on foreign relations with assurances that
planned diplomatic contacts will go ahead, including the defense
chief's visit to Washington.
   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will travel to Paris this
weekend for international talks on the Cambodia issue, and Defense
Agency chief Taku Yamasaki will go ahead with a scheduled trip to
Washington in August, said a ministry official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday
approved the nomination of Gwendolyn S. King to head the Social
Security Administration, and she promised efforts to improve the
retirement and disability system.
   Mrs. King, whose nomination was approved by voice vote and sent
to the full Senate, promised to ``reach out to the most vulnerable
among those we serve and ensure for them the `security' that is our
mission.''
   A fomer aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh when he was
governor of Pennsylvania and to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., Mrs. King
said she would work to create ``a fairer, more efficient and humane
Social Security system.''
   The Social Security Administration, with an annual budget of
$230 billion, currently provides 38.6 million people with monthly
retirement, disability or survivor's benefits.
   As part of a program to streamline and modernize its operations,
the agency pared its workforce by about 20 percent during the
Reagan administration years to about 65,000 employees. Critics have
complained of a drop in the quality of service to the public and of
low employee morale.
   John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents 55,000 Social Security
employees, said the union did not oppose Mrs. King's nomination and
hoped to work with her to solve ``serious problems.''
   ``By all accounts, both managers and rank and file employees are
rapidly sinking under the burden of an ever-growing workload and
the fact that they cannot service the public as it deserves to be
served,'' he said.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., expressed confidence Mrs.
King's nomination would be approved and said the new administrator
will take over an agency that has suffered from ``instability in
leadership,'' going through 10 administrators in the last 16 years.
   Moynihan said the new administrator will have to defend Social
Security's trust funds against use for deficit reduction or other
government purposes and also will face low public confidence about
the future of the benefits program.
   ``Social Security is one of the greatest governmental success
stories of the century, but people don't believe it,'' he said.
   Mrs. King currently is an executive vice president of the
Washington government relations firm of Gogol &amp; Associates. She
would replace Dorcas Hardy, who last month announced she would
resign July 31.
   The Finance Committee also approved by voice vote Tuesday the
nominations of Linda M. Combs to be assistant treasury secretary
for management, Thomas J. Duesterberg to be an assistant secretary
of commerce, and Wade F. Horn to be chief of the Children's Bureau
in the Department of Health and Human Services.

   Some people complain that all politicians
are alike, and in the Salem City Council race, they may have a
point.
   Even their own children sometimes have trouble distinguishing
at-large City Council candidate Jean-Guy Martineau from his
identical twin, Ward 5 candidate Jean-Claude Martineau.
   ``People are a bit confused,'' Jean-Guy said Tuesday.
   Jean-Guy, a City Council member for 12 years, holds the Ward 5
seat. He and his brother didn't set out to make voters do a double
take, he said.
   Jean-Guy is one of seven men running for four at-large seats.
Jean-Claude is among three candidates for the Ward 5 seat vacated
by his twin.
   Jean-Claude will be on the primary election ballot Sept. 26. If
he survives that test, he and his brother both will run in the
general election in November.
   City Clerk Josephine Fusco says she sometimes has trouble
identifying the 40-year-old political pair.
   ``They're having a lot of fun with this,'' she said. ``They're
very close. In fact when Jean-Claude came in the other day I had to
hesitate because I wasn't sure what I was going to call him.''
   The brothers wore the same hairdos, crisp white shirts and dark
blue ties Tuesday, sometimes answering questions in unison. But
they also exhibited a little sibling rivalry.
   ``He's a little heavier than me,'' Jean-Guy said.
   ``I think it's the other way around,'' Jean-Claude retorted.
   Jean-Claude, the younger by 10 minutes, was living in Florida
and returned to Salem six months ago. He said he decided to get
into politics partly because his brother's constituents kept
approaching him on the street.
   ``He got all the complaints and I got off free half of the
time,'' Jean-Guy joked.
   Both brothers are Republicans, but they don't claim twin
philosophies.
   ``I think that we're both very conservative,'' Jean-Guy said.
``Jean-Claude is a little bit more compassionate than I am. I'm
more conservative looking at the issues and I try to be more
realistic.''
   Born Jan. 3, 1949, the twins are the youngest of 12 children.
They grew up in Salem and attended St. Joseph High School, where
they got their first taste of politics when Jean-Claude beat out
Jean-Guy for president of the freshman class.
   ``I was always the clown in high school, whereas Jean-Claude was
the more serious one,'' Jean-Guy said.
   After graduation, Jean-Guy enlisted in the Navy. Jean-Claude
entered a Catholic seminary, but after five months, he too, joined
the Navy. When both twins' ships stopped in the Philippines, the
brothers sometimes got into trouble, Jean-Guy recalled.
   ``No one would believe when I told them I wasn't from their
ship. He was a fire control technician and I was in communications
so our rating patches were different and people would think we were
out of uniform,'' he said.
   Now, Jean-Claude works for Standard-Thomson Corp. in Waltham, a
manufacturer of thermostats for cars and airplanes, and Jean-Guy is
an engineer for the Raytheon Missile Division in West Andover.
   Mistakes in identity still happen.
   When Jean-Claude first returned from Florida, he ran a stop sign
while driving in Salem. The policeman let him off, believing he was
council member Jean-Guy.
   ``They should have given him a ticket in my opinion,'' Jean-Guy
said.
   Ms. Fusco, the city clerk, has a plan to cut down on the
confusion if both are elected to the council: ``They'll be assigned
to the same seat every council meeting.''

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
approved on Tuesday treaties with Mexico, the Bahamas, Canada,
Belgium, Thailand and the Cayman Islands providing for mutual
cooperation in criminal investigations, especially those dealing
with narcotics trafficking.
   The vote sending the treaties to the Senate for ratification was
16-2.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the treaties are of ``vital
importance'' in forging cooperation to assist the United States in
gathering evidence to prosecute narcotics cases.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said they should not be approved
by the committee or ratified by the Senate because they might place
Americans in the situation of being prosecuted in foreign courts
without full constitutional protections.
   He also said the United States should not ratify such treaties
with Mexico or the Bahamas because they have top legal officials
suspected of corruption and involvement in protecting drug
trafficking.
   Helms accused the Bush administration of ``a massive coverup''
of information linking these officials to alleged narcotics
corruption.
   But Kerry and other senators said the treaties are supported
fully by the Bush administration as a useful tool in the war on
drugs.
   They said the president and Justice Department retain the
ability to deny frivolous requests by foreign governments and to
protect the constitutional rights of Americans.

<HEAD>Americans Soon May Get Cocoa from Puerto Rico</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
Americans soon may be able to enjoy home-grown cocoa from Puerto
Rico instead of relying entirely on foreign production.
   Cocoa, the raw ingredient of chocolate, was tried in the 1940s
as a crop in Puerto Rico but failed because of disease and insect
problems, said agronomist Edmundo Rivera of the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   However, he said in a report by the agency, Puerto Rico has been
free of black pod fungus, the disease that threatens production in
other areas. But problems still persist, including the ability of
cocoa crops to tolerate acid soil and resist insect damage.
   Last year the United States imported more than $800 million
worth of cocoa beans, powder and cocoa butter _ the nation's entire
supply _ from Brazil, the main exporter, and other producers,
including West Africa, Central America and the Dominican Republic.
   Heber Irizzary, an agency horticulturist, said cocoa can be an
alternative crop that Puerto Rican farmers can grow on steep,
marginal soils or on land once used for sugar cane. Cane, once a
staple of the island's economy, has become less profitable because
of low yields, higher costs of production and lower market prices.
   Irizzary and Riveral, who work at the USDA agency's tropical
crops and germplasm research laboratory in Mayaguez, for the past
eight years have been studying cocoa hybrids from many countries in
order to adapt them to Puerto Rico.
   Experimental trials of cocoa strains from Costa Rica in the
early 1980s last year produced a yield potential of 3,500 to 4,000
pounds per acre from six-year-old trees, they said. Yields of 2,000
pounds per acre are considered marketable.
   Also, the agency said, cocoa from the test trees has been
evaluated favorably by four of the largest U.S. chocolate
manufacturers.
   Rivera said cocoa would meet the need for crops in Puerto Rico
that are suited to small family operations, since it can be grown
with a minimum amount of tillage and does not require expensive
machinery.

<HEAD>German Historians Praise Soviet Acknowledgment of 1939 Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German historians, long rankled
by the Kremlin's refusal to acknowledge the 1939 non-aggression
pact that carved up Eastern Europe, say Moscow's recognition of
that prelude to World War II could fuel Baltic autonomy movements.
   ``A historical falsehood is finally being erased and truth is
being placed on the table,'' Wolfgang Leonhard, a West German
author and Soviet expert, told the Bonn newspaper Bonner Rundschau.
   Step by step, the Kremlin has moved toward officially conceding
that once-secret protocols to the 1939 agreement that divided
Poland and the Baltic states between Nazi Germany and Josef
Stalin's Soviet Union.
   A week after the non-aggression pact was signed on Aug. 23,
1939, Germany invaded Poland and set off World War II. The Soviets
seized Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia a year later.
   The 1939 agreement, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, has
become a major rallying point among activists in the Baltic
republics who are demanding greater autonomy from Moscow.
   On Sunday night, a high-ranking Kremlin official stated he has
no reason to doubt the existence of the secret clauses of the 1939
pact, signed by Vyacheslav Molotov of the Soviet Union and Joachim
von Ribbentrop of Germany.
   ``There was a secret protocol,'' Valentin Falin, head of the
international department of the Communist Party's Central
Committee, said in a discussion on West German television.
   ``As far as the text is known, it is a copy of a copy and the
text corresponds to what was signed in reality,'' Falin said,
referring to a microfilm in West German archives.
   Kremlin officials had once maintained the microfilm may be a
fake, but Soviet historians investigating Baltic claims that their
states were seized illegally traveled to Bonn this year to examine
the West German records.
   Soviet officials who accompanied President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on his June visit to West Germany also said the microfilm appeared
to be an accurate record.
   West German observers say Falin's statement is significant
because it comes from a high-ranking Communist Party functionary
who has previously adopted a hard line on the issue.
   ``This is a step-by-step retreat by Soviet officials,'' said
Gerhard Simon, an expert on Soviet affairs at the Federal Institute
for Eastern and International Studies in Cologne.
   ``This is nothing revolutionary because we are talking about
historical fact,'' said Reinhard Meyers, a Muenster University
professor.
   ``But this is an official (Soviet) seal of approval on what's
been said for decades'' by historians, said Meyers, who is among
West Germany's leading experts on the World War II era.
   While the deal between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union has
been in the Western public domain for decades, the official Kremlin
line until recently was that no proof of secret protocols existed.
   ``We have been dealing with this extensively. There have been a
good number of new essays and books'' on the subject, said Simon.
   The Soviet news media have in recent months publicized some of
the West German research efforts.
   Last month, West German officials disclosed that Soviet
historians had inspected a microfilm copy of the secret protocols
and other related documents that have been preserved in the Bonn
Foreign Ministry archives.
   ``The Soviets had to retreat,'' Simon said. ``It became harder
and harder for them to claim there was no secret protocol.''
   The Tuesday editions of the Bonner Rundschau quoted Leonhard,
also a historian, as saying: ``The pressure from reform forces was
apparently so strong that now Falin _ in his important position _
has also decided to make a statement.''
   Simon says the evolution of Moscow's acknowledgement of Stalin's
secret deal with Hitler will likely bolster automony movements in
the Baltic republics.
   ``I think this will help their momentum,'' said Simon.

<HEAD>James Garner Just The Real Man To Be California's Next Governor?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Jim Garner, once described as the last
real man in America, could be an odds-on favorite to be the next
governor of California, says a state senator who wants him to run.
   ``Everybody knows him,'' said state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who
added that he approached Garner but was rebuked.
   ``He said, `I'm making $6 million a year, what do I need that
for?' or words to the effect,'' Rosenthal said Monday.
   Garner's publicist, Pat Kingsley, confirmed the informal
proposal.
   ``It is true, in fact, he was approached, but he declined,'' Ms.
Kingsley said. ``He doesn't feel politics is the right field for
him.''
   Garner, who was dubbed the ``last real man'' in America by
People magazine, has been active in environmental causes.
   Rosenthal said he sought out Garner in part because the
61-year-old actor is immediately recognizable to much of the public
thanks to his TV series ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford Files'' and
movies that include ``Murphy's Romance,'' for which he received an
Academy Award nomination.
   Garner also looks good on a horse, said Rosenthal, noting that
didn't hurt Ronald Reagan. The former president's first election
victory was in the 1967 California gubernatorial race.
   Rosenthal said he began his search for a ``non-politician''
gubernatorial candidate after he decided that state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein, among the Democrats polls show voters favor, could not
beat Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in next year's election.
Wilson has declared himself a candidate for governor.

<HEAD>Former Winston Man, Saying He Feels Guilty, Backs Limits on Tobacco
Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A model who rappelled down mountains to
project a manly image for Winston cigarettes told Congress Tuesday
he feels guilty about enticing youngsters to smoke and supports a
bill to restrict tobacco advertising.
   David Goerlitz, who portrayed a member of a search-and-rescue
team in a long-running ad campaign, said he considers himself ``an
accessory to the systematic poisoning of our society.''
   ``I have had children tell me that they smoked Winstons so that
they could be just like me,'' Goerlitz told the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials.
``For that I shall always feel guilty.''
   Goerlitz described himself as a 25-year, three-pack-a-day smoker
who kicked the habit in November and now speaks out against smoking
for the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association and
American Heart Association.
   The legislation he endorsed would strip billboards and printed
ads of everything but words and ban tobacco ads from all sports
facilities. The bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, is so
broad that it would outlaw the names of cigarette brands painted on
race cars.
   The advertising industry said Tuesday that the restrictions, if
enacted, could cost thousands of jobs.
   The Freedom to Advertise Coalition released a study it
commissioned saying that 62,992 jobs _ mostly in printing,
publishing, advertising and retail trade _ would be lost if the
proposed restrictions become law.
   Publishers, ad industry and tobacco industry groups also argued
that imposing more restrictions would violate First Amendment
guarantees of free speech and wouldn't necessarily reduce the
number of youngsters who take up smoking.
   Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said the
legislation ``rests on the false premise that cigarette advertising
is responsible for smoking by young people and that young people
would not begin smoking if cigarette advertising were banned.''
   ``We are convinced that the measure would do nothing to reduce
smoking among young people,'' Whitley testified. ``In the name of
protecting children, (the bill) would eliminate from tobacco
product advertising everything that makes it noticeable to adults.''
   Bruce Flye, chairman of the National Tobacco Council, said
growers believe their product should be accorded the same
reasonable advertising and promotional rights accorded any other
legal commodity.
   ``While protecting America's freedoms too many tobacco farm
family members have fought, bled and died in too many wars ... to
stand idly by while the United States Constitution is turned on its
head,'' he said.
   A tobacco-state lawmaker, Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said his
constituents don't understand why Washington denies them prayer in
public school, allows the burning of the U.S. flag and persists in
attacking the tobacco industry with ``punitive legislation.''
   He said people in his district complain ``it's not what you're
doing for them, it's what you're doing to them.''
   Tallon also warned that the restrictions would set a bad
precedent.
   ``Censorship is contagious,'' he said.
   Congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the U.S. Surgeon
General's warning about the hazards of smoking to be put on
cigarette packages and ads. The warnings began appearing in 1972
after the tobacco industry and the Federal Trade Commission reached
an agreement on the wording.
   Luken said his bill is needed ``to eliminate hucksterism in the
selling of a product that the Surgeon General says kills 390,000
Americans each year and is addictive in a way similar to drugs such
as heroin and cocaine.''
   Goerlitz said he was told young people were the intended market
for the ads in which he was featured along with then-unknown actor
Corbin Bernsen and other men.
   ``When I modeled for Winston, I was told very clearly that young
people were the market we were after,'' he testified. ``The other
models and I were depicted as young and daring buddies, and that's
what young people relate to at 14 or 15 years old.''
   ``Kids did not want to be construction workers any more. They
wanted to be heroes,'' he said.

   Heavy rains battered southern areas of
the country, killing 17 people and leaving another 17 missing
Tuesday, the National Disaster Center reported.
   The center said nearly 5,400 people were left homeless as 13.4
inches of rain fell in some areas since Monday night.
   Officials estimated property losses at about $1 million based on
initial reports.
   They said among the hardest hit were Kwangju and nearby
Changsong, where 14 people died and one was missing in swollen
rivers and landslides triggered by heavy rains.
   The town of Changsong and 15 surrounding farming villages were
flooded and about 24,000 residents were forced to evacuate to
nearby hills with hundreds of others clinging to rooftops, waiting
for help, the newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported.
   The daily paper said the Korean military was using helicopters
to pick up stranded people, but their rescue operations were
hampered by bad weather.
   Railroad and other public transportation services in the area
were reported cut off, according to officials.
   In Hadong and another location on the southern coast, about 175
miles south of Seoul, two high school students drowned and nine of
their classmates were missing in swollen waters. Officials said
they had been camping in two valleys.

<HEAD>Evidence Clerk Files Stress Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police clerk has filed a
workers' compensation claim with the city for stress from handling
evidence from seven bodies unearthed at a boardinghouse.
   Joy Underwood, 34, said she throws up whenever she sees news
accounts of landlady Dorothea Montalvo Puente, who is charged with
killing nine tenants including the seven discovered buried in her
yard last November.
   Underwood said her stress stems from handling sacks of evidence
in the case, including body bags and clothes belonging to Puente's
alleged victims.
   She said she's lost her apartment, faces repossession of her car
and has violent nightmares about Puente.
   ``I still have the taste of death in my mouth,'' Underwood said.
``I can't eat vegetables grown in the ground because they have dirt
around them, like the people dug up in Puente's yard _ and I'm a
vegetarian. I'm so stressed out, I cried when I ran out of
Cheerios.''
   Puente, 60, faces a Sept. 12 preliminary hearing. Authorities
allege she poisoned her tenants for their Social Security checks.
She has pleaded innocent. Drugs were found in all seven bodies
unearthed at the boardinghouse, but coroner's officials said they
were unable to determine causes in the deaths.
   Underwood, who has been on unpaid medical leave, said she has
been diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress syndrome, a
condition associated with Vietnam veterans, rape victims and people
who have been tortured.
   Police officials said transporting evidence, however gruesome,
is part of the job. They said Underwood can apply for a transfer
and can even have her old job back if she gets a doctor's approval.

   John Major, a high school dropout who took over
Tuesday as Britain's foreign secretary, personifies the
transformation of the political establishment wrought by grocer's
daughter Margaret Thatcher.
   The hierarchy of the governing Conservative Party, once the
preserve of bluebloods, is increasingly dominated by ``go-getters''
of Prime Minister Thatcher's decade in power, instinctive
conservatives often from modest backgrounds.
   Mrs. Thatcher, her administration slumping in popularity,
reinforced the grip of the self-made successes of her
free-enterprise revolution in a sweeping shakeup of her 22-member
Cabinet on Monday.
   Major was the most startling beneficiary.
   The 46-year-old son of a trapeze artist was raised in a two-room
apartment in south London's rundown Brixton district. He
leapfrogged from the most junior Cabinet post to one at the top of
a Cabinet that is far different from the one Mrs. Thatcher
appointed when she won power in 1979.
   Like her predecessor, Ted Heath, a carpenter's son, Mrs.
Thatcher at first surrounded herself with upper-class and benign
Conservative Party luminaries. Many held views to the left of her
own, and many also believed she was a temporary phenomenon.
   Just three members of that first 23-member Cabinet, including
Mrs. Thatcher, had been educated at state high schools. The rest
were all graduates of the prestigious all-boys boarding schools,
including six Old Etonians.
   Only two members of the new Cabinet are from the playing fields
of Eton. One, Nicholas Ridley, younger son of a viscount who she
switched to trade and industry secretary from the politically
sensitive environment ministry, is deeply unpopular with
rank-and-file legislators. The other, Lord Belstead, has an
hereditary title and is party leader in the unelected House of
Lords.
   Just over half the Cabinet members are people who, like Mrs.
Thatcher, made their way from state schools, often to one of the
ancient universities, Oxford or Cambridge. Major and Peter Walker,
the secretary of state for Wales, didn't go to college at all.
   They are characters in the mold of Leslie Titmuss, the ambitious
but flawed Tory hero of John Mortimer's book and TV series,
``Paradise Postponed.''
   The shift in the Conservative Party has brought sneers from both
the lower and upper strata in this class-conscious society that
Britain is now governed by garage owners and real estate agents.
   ``Putting new labels on bad wine doesn't improve the taste,''
London's 3 million-circulation Daily Mirror newspaper, an
opposition Labor Party supporter, complained in an editorial
Tuesday. ``This is still a government with an estate-agent
philosophy and an advertising agent mentality.''
   Mass-circulation right-wing newspapers hailed the changes,
particularly the sacking of Transport Secretary Paul Channon, an
impeccably mannered scion of the Guinness brewing family who
inherited a fortune in his 20s.
   His department was accused of bungling bomb warnings in the
aftermath of the Pan Am Flight 103 air disaster over Scotland Dec.
21 and for an inept performance during current waves of public
transportation strikes.
   Also shifted was the well-born party chairman, Peter Brooke, son
of a titled father. He became Northern Ireland Secretary and was
replaced in the key vote-garnering party post by Kenneth Baker, an
essentialy middle-class former education secretary.
   The Daily Express dismissed Ridley, Channon and Brooke as
``patrician figures ... all personalities a million miles away from
the populist, dynamic party Mrs. Thatcher has tried to create.''
   In 1979, Mrs. Thatcher's foreign secretary was in the classic
mold for the job: Lord Carrington, sixth in line to a herditary
baroncy, heir to vast family estates.
   Her next foreign secretary, Francis Pym, also came from the
wealthy landed gentry, and Sir Geoffrey Howe, whom she eased out of
the job this week, comes from a family of Welsh lawyers.
   Major, who says he became a Tory at 13, quit school at 16 to
become a laborer on a construction site because his mother, a
onetime music hall singer, needed the money. After a stint of
volunteer work in Nigeria, he made a career in banking.
   His political vision is essentially pragmatic. A lanky,
bespectacled figure with a classless accent, he once cited being
patient and being average as keys to political succees.
   ``The first requirement of politics is not intellect or stamina,
but patience,'' he said. ``Why should we leave politics to people
who are abnormal or not average?''

   Coal miners returned to work Tuesday, with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev guaranteeing their demands, but
Estonian shipyard workers began a strike rooted in the restive
Baltic republic's ethnic conflicts.
   Strike leader Yuri A. Bolderev in Donetsk, the Soviet Union's
richest coal basin, said Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
signed a letter Monday pledging more pay, longer vacations and
other benefits.
   A document completed by negotiators Saturday outlined the
concessions. Most of the Donetsk strikers remained off the job to
demand guarantees, and went back to the pits Tuesday.
   Members of the Supreme Soviet legislature issued a statement
Tuesday pledging to pass laws giving workers more control over
management and profits and ensuring democratic elections of local
officials, who have been accused of insensitivity to miners'
problems.
   They also said they would make sure the government provided more
food, health services, housing and good-paying jobs.
   The statement appealed for unity in the face of ethnic conflicts
and the coal strikes, which Gorbachev called the ``biggest test''
of his 4-year-old reforms. The Soviet Union ``needs utmost
unification of all forces standing for the further development of
radical economic reform,'' the statement said.
   Non-Estonian workers at shipyards and several other plants in
Estonia walked out to protest recent measures favoring the native
population, the official news agency Tass reported. It did not give
the number of strikers.
   Tass said a republic-wide strike committee of non-Estonian
workers called the strike Monday, demanding cancellation of a
language law and withdrawal of a proposed measure that would allow
only long-time residents to run for office.
   A strike growing out of ethnic strife also shut down public
transport and businesses in Sukhumi, capital of the Abkhazia region
of Soviet Georgia.
   Only 79 mines remained idle Tuesday, Tass reported, quoting the
Coal Ministry. Officials said most of the 300,000 strikers had
returned to work at Donetsk, in the Ukraine, 550 miles south of
Moscow.
   Strikers stayed out at Voroshilovgrad in the Donetsk Basin, Tass
reported. It said 26,800 workers at 47 of the 93 mines at
Voroshilovgrad had not returned to work.
   Premier Ryzhkov sat down with miners Monday and worked out a
``concrete program of actions for the entire country's coal
industry,'' Pravda said. The Communist Party newspaper did not give
details of the plan.
   Bolderev said in a telephone interview the miners still on
strike were staying out for ``purely psychological'' reasons
arising from ``an explosion of despair.''
   ``People don't want to tolerate local officials any longer,'' he
said.
   In a reference to that, the Supreme Soviet statement said local
elections scheduled for spring should be moved up to foster a
``cleansing of the government apparatus of unqualified and
incapable workers,'' reduction of the bureaucracy and ``liquidation
of undeserved privileges.''
   Gorbachev has said the Communist Party and government bodies
need reorganization to remove people blocking reform.
   State TV said Ryzhkov met Tuesday with miners from the Pechora
Basin in the Arctic and the Dnepropetrovsk region of the Ukraine,
and expressed sympathy for their demands for better housing,
working conditions, food and transport.
   It said he would issue a special decree next week aimed at
meeting their demands.
   Viktor G. Kucherenko, head of the Supreme Soviet's Planning and
Budget Commission, has estimated strike settlements will cost up to
$8.6 billion. The government already has a budget deficit of $156
billion.
   The Voroshilovgrad strikers were among the last holdouts of the
nationwide coal strike, which began July 11 in western Siberia and
spread to coal fields across the country. Siberian miners returned
to work last week after the government agreed to nearly all their
demands.
   In Vorkuta in the Arctic, the strike committee called for an end
to the walkout Monday after ``listening with great attention'' to
Gorbachev's appeals, Tass reported.
   Valery Serdyuk, Communist Party chief in Vorkuta, said by
telephone regular work had not resumed at any of the 13 mines and
most miners were awaiting formal approval of their 42 demands by
the Soviet Council of Ministers.
   Tass said the strikes created a shortage of 4.5 million tons of
coal, but the ``critical situation'' in the coal-dependent metal
industry had passed.

   In 1971, Michael Dorris became one of the first
bachelors allowed to adopt a child. He also became an unwitting
partner in the child's struggle against fetal alcohol syndrome.
   ``If you grow up with the idea that the world is fair, you can't
accept that these kids never had a chance,'' Dorris, a Dartmouth
professor, said in an interview about his recently published book
on his son's illness.
   After years of research, Dorris came to grips with the fact that
his son's illness was preventable but incurable. He wrote ``The
Broken Cord'' to tell the world about, and perhaps help someone
avoid, a disease passed along by hard-drinking mothers. But it gave
him no surcease from his pain.
   ``It's not been cathartic. One of the problems with this book is
that it does not have an ending,'' said Dorris.
   ``I finished the book when my son was 21, the age of majority
when your child is expected to be independent,'' Dorris said during
a recent stay in Boston. ``But it keeps going on. It's like
constantly opening doors into a dark room.''
   ``Adam,'' the pseudonym he's given his son in the book, now
works four days a week as a dishwasher at a truck stop in New
Hampshire. He lives in a group home and has to be reminded to
bathe, change his clothes, even eat.
   Fetal alcohol syndrome, the nation's third-largest cause of
retardation, was undocumented and unnamed a little more than a
decade ago.
   Nearly 8,000 children a year, or 1 to 3 of every 1,000 born,
have some or all of the syndrome's symptoms. These children, many
born to parents who also have FAS, suffer seizures, have poor
eyesight, balance or hearing. They frequently have curvature of the
spine and too many teeth.
   Their intelligence often is severely impaired; they can't grasp,
retain memories or reason into the future.
   Adam was born on a Sioux reservation to a woman who eventually
died of alcohol poisoning.
   Studies since have revealed that 5 percent to 25 percent of the
children born on some reservations have FAS, and there are
estimates that up to 50 percent of the members of some American
Indian tribes will have been born with it by the year 2000.
   Dorris, whose adoption application was aided by his partial
Indian ancestry, spent two years teaching Adam to tie his
shoelaces. Adam, the eldest of three adopted children, was 5 before
he was toilet-trained.
   ``I've lost my temper a million times and then felt guilty,''
said Dorris, adjunct professor of anthropology at Dartmouth and a
co-founder of the school's Native American studies program. ``But a
very direct anger is at least clear to him _ it's unambiguous.''
   He said the book's original impetus was scientific; he wanted to
document FAS and make the public aware.
   ``Society has to take note that this is a terribly dangerous
problem, he said, noting that the federal government is not
currently funding any FAS-related programs. ``We have to have
education, detox centers and health care for these women.''
   Dorris offers education as an alternative to more drastic
measures that some activists have suggested, such as sterilization
or imprisonment for pregnant women who have previously given birth
to FAS children.
   Dorris said he and his wife, the writer Louise Erdrich _ who in
addition to their three adopted American Indian children have three
biological daughters _ long ago gave up trying to reason with their
son.
   Logic is out of Adam's reach. Dorris confesses that, despite his
training as an anthropologist, he still hopes against rational hope
that his son one day will suddenly see everything clearly.
   ``But it makes no sense; it can't happen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Italian Martyr's 1,600-Year-Old Remains Put to Rest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relics of St. Justin the martyr have been
laid to rest after 1,600 years in which they have been entombed in
the catacombs, secreted away by Italian nobles and displayed in a
Maryland church.
   An urn containing 15 small, brittle bones believed to be St.
Justin's was buried Monday in a shady plot near St. Mary's Roman
Catholic Church.
   ``We've finally put St. Justin to rest,'' said the Rev. John
Murray, who found the bones in a church safe 20 months ago and
conducted the funeral. ``It's not every day that you get to witness
burial of a 1,600-year-old martyr.''
   After he found the relics, Murray pieced together their history,
beginning in Rome in the 4th century A.D., when Justin was beheaded
at age 26.
   Justin was elevated to sainthood soon after his death, and his
remains were buried in the catacombs, the caverns beneath the
Appian Way in Rome used by early Christians.
   Then, in 1757, archaeologists unearthed remains they identified
as St. Justin's, along with what they believed were the remains of
two other martyrs, St Sergius and St. Nazarius, Murray said.
   For the next 110 years, the three sets of relics were cared for
by a series of noble Italian families and bishops. But in 1873,
during a period of civil unrest in Italy, the church sent them to
the Rev. Joseph Wissel in Baltimore for safekeeping.
   Wissell kept the box containing the relics of St. Justin, which
he displayed prominently in the church, and sent the others
elsewhere. During renovations to St. Mary's in the 1960s, priests
put the relics, wrapped in yellowed paper, in a box in the church
safe.
   Murray isn't at all sure the relics will remain in their present
resting place, even though the burial was cleared by the local
church hierarchy.
   ``The Vatican may want me to send the relics back to Rome,''
Murray said. ``If they want me to do that, then we'll dig him up.''

   Two former PTL aides were convicted
Tuesday of evading $525,000 in income taxes on money they took from
the television ministry to buy condominiums, furs, jewelry and
nearly $100,000 worth of shoes.
   A federal jury deliberated five hours before convicting the
brothers, James and David Taggart, on identical charges: conspiracy
to defraud the government and impede the IRS by willfully evading
income taxes, and filing false tax returns for the years 1984,
1985, 1986 and 1987.
   ``Greed doesn't pay, no matter how rich you are, you've got to
pay your taxes,'' said federal prosecutor David Brown after the
verdict. ``The statement was not about PTL; it was about David
Taggart and James Taggart's obligations to pay their taxes no
matter how much they own and what kind of lifestyle they live.''
   Brown said he wasn't surprised the jury took just five hours.
   ``They didn't need to spend a lot of time looking at the
documents,'' he said. ``A person can omit $200 (in income) on their
tax return but it's hard to miss $1 million.''
   ``They were innocent going in and they are innocent coming
out,'' said defense lawyer Ben Cotten. He said he was to blame for
the guilty verdict, citing ``my ineptitude and two very capable and
competent government counsel backed with unlimited resources.''
   Brown said the case was decided by the defendants' own
testimony, but Cotten said they were forced to testify.
   ``They had to take the stand,'' Cotten said. ``They had to tell
their story. If they hadn't, the jury wouldn't have been able to
believe anything but a series of paper trails.''
   Cotten said the Taggarts' reaction to the verdict was ``a calm,
`where do we go from here?''' The brothers refused comment as they
left the courthouse.
   The Taggarts were charged with evasion after they allegedly
spent nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personal luxuries such as
condominiums _ including a $640,000 apartment at Trump Tower in New
York, jewlery and designer clothes. Cotten said the money was
approved by the ministry's founder, Jim Bakker.
   In earlier testimony, a representative from a New York City fur
shop said the Taggarts spent about $35,000 on mink coats and other
furs for themselves at her store. And a salesman for a New York
shoe store said the Taggarts spent nearly $100,000 from 1982-86 on
shoes for themselves.
   Other testimony included the pair spent $320,000 in four
purchases at Cartier's jewelry store in New York, including $96,000
on one ring. They also took European vacations with friends and
family, often crossing the Atlantic on a Concord jet.
   Cotten said his clients weren't bitter at their former boss for
refusing to testify. Bakker invoked his right against
self-incrimination when he was called to the stand.
   Bakker and former PTL executive vice president Richard Dortch go
on trial Aug. 28 on charges of wire and mail fraud.
   Both Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, would often plead
for funds on television. Bakker and Dortch were indicted last Dec.
5 on charges of conspiring to defraud their supporters by diverting
more than $4 million to support their lavish lifestyles. If
convicted, each faces more than 120 years in prison and more than
$5 million in fines.
   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal after
he confessed to a sexual affair with former church secretary
Jessica Hahn.
   The Taggarts joined PTL in the late 1970s as piano players.
Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, was Bakker's top personal
aide. His brother, James, 35, was the interior designer at PTL's
Heritage USA Christian retreat, just south of Charlotte.
   Brown said he would recommend a stiff sentence. Each brother
faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and more than $1 million in
fines. Sentencing was set for Aug. 25.

   White House officials had little to say
Tuesday about Felix Bloch, the State Department diplomat being
investigated as a possible spy, but spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
clearly had Bloch on his mind.
   Fielding a question about another matter, Fitzwater said
President Bush has repeatedly ``expressed his outrage'' about
influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and ``talked to Secretary Bloch on a number of
occasions about remedying the situation.''
   ``Secretary Kemp, I'm sorry,'' Fitzwater quickly added, this
time getting the name of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp right.
   Later, asked about reports that the United States had warned the
Soviets not to spirit Bloch out of the country, Fitzwater said he
did not know of them.
   But noting reports that Bloch was trailed from a relative's home
by both the FBI and Soviet officials, Fitzwater quipped: ``As near
as I can tell, the entire FBI and the Soviet Embassy is living with
the guy. I don't think he's going anywhere unnoticed.''

   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov arrived
Tuesday on an historic visit to Britain and said he doesn't believe
an East-West treaty on conventional forces can be forged as quickly
as President Bush hopes.
   Yazov, the first Soviet defense minister to visit a NATO country
since World War II, also said British and French troops based in
West Germany should be included with American troops in a
conventional arms agreement.
   The general spoke at a news conference with Defense Secretary
George Younger after talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and Younger. Later, he met new Foreign Secretary John Major.
   Yazov was pessimistic when asked if a conventional arms treaty
could be agreed as quickly as Bush urged at the May summit of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Bush challenged Moscow to reach a treaty by next year and carry
it out by 1993. The timetable also has been linked by the West to
talks with the Warsaw Pact on short-range nuclear forces and
nuclear reductions.
   ``Myself, I do not believe that such a deal could be concluded
that quickly,'' Yazov said.
   ``Not all problems are being solved smoothly,'' he said,
although figures decided by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Bush are ``very close.''
   In particular, he said troops from European nations of the
Western alliance should not be excluded from a U.S. proposal to
restrict each side to 275,000 troops in East or West Germany.
Britain, France and other nations keep 170,000 troops in West
Germany, he said.
   ``Everything should be taken into account,'' Yazov said through
an interpreter. ``If these matters are solved, then we don't
believe the process of negotiations will take a long time.''
   He said he and Mrs. Thatcher, ``both took note that the Cold War
times are behind us.''
   A senior British official said talks with Yazov will focus on
Moscow's new defensive military strategy and Soviet views of Bush's
disarmament proposals.
   On charges that the new Soviet military doctrine is defensive
while Soviet forces' grouping remains offensive, Yazov told
reporters ``it is impossible to declare (we are) defensive today
and immediately change the organization.''
   The Soviets have pledged to withdraw 10,000 tanks, 8,500
artillery weapons and 820 aircraft from East European countries.
British officials say the withdrawals are on schedule, but they
suspect ammunition may be left behind to improve the capability of
remaining weapons.
   On Wednesday, Yazov will visit a Royal Air Force base in
Scotland to inspect Phantom and Tornado fighters which sweep NATO's
northern air flank for Soviet intrusions and an aircraft carrier,
HMS Invincible.
   His four-day visit is part of increased East-West military
contacts under Gorbachev's policy of reduced confrontation.
   ``This is the beginning of an official, high level
Soviet-British defense relationship,'' a senior British official
said on condition of anonymity.

   President Bush still opposes any new taxes,
even to pay for drug-fighting programs, and is cool to the new idea
of selling bonds to finance the war on drugs, his spokesman
indicated Tuesday.
   A day after Bush's top drug policy adviser, William Bennett,
said that ``maybe down the road, we will'' use higher taxes to
fight the drug battle, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
emphasized that the president remains ``opposed to raising taxes
for any purpose.''
   Bennett had said that there are ``other choices'' besides taxes,
but also said, ``crack is worse than taxes.''
   There were mixed signals Tuesday from the White House and
Bennett on the advisability of selling savings bonds to pay for
increased anti-drug activity.
   Fitzwater said such a notion was fraught with ``practical
problems.''
   But Bennett said he liked the idea and has raised it with
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Legislation to sell drug bonds has been introduced in Congress. War
bonds were sold to help finance the second World War.
   Such suggestions envision ``a financing mechanism that has a lot
of aspects to it that haven't been thought out _ about how would
the money be paid back, how would it be collected, the interest
rates,'' Fitzwater told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
``But generally speaking any kind of bond system is a part of the
general financing of the government. ... You're still talking about
government borrowing.''
   Fitzwater, downplaying reports that the administration was
looking closely at the idea, noted that Bennett is looking at a lot
of suggestions, including drug bonds, as he considers what
recommendations he will make for a drug-fighting strategy. Bennett,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, is to
report to Bush on Sept. 5.
   Bennett noted Tuesday that the idea for drug-war bonds did not
originate with him, but was pushed by some on Capitol Hill.
   However, he told reporters at a luncheon, ``It does answer one
question for me, which is, I get tons of mail from people asking
what they can do. This would be a very good thing to be able to
say: Buy war bonds.''
   Bennett said his office gets money in the mail. ``We get dollar
bills, five dollar bills, checks. People say, `Please use this for
the war on drugs.'''
   Bennett said that he wasn't calling for a tax increase to pay
for the drug war. ``It's not my job to figure out how to pay for
it,'' he said.
   ``My job is to set the strategy ... how to wage this war on
drugs effectively,'' he said. ``It's Darman's job, and others', to
figure out how to pay for it.''
   How to pay for a greatly expanded anti-drug program is becoming
a topic for heightened debate as Congress wrangles over tradeoffs
in defense and other areas to bring the budget into line.
   ``Everyone anticipates there will be more money needed and more
money spent,'' on fighting the drug epidemic, Fitzwater said. ``The
sources of that money... is a different question.''
   Bennett has refused to say how much he expects the federal
government to invest in the anti-drug effort.
   Two California Republicans, Sen. Pete Wilson and Rep. Jerry
Lewis, introduced legislation last week to sell $4 billion worth of
savings bonds to raise money to fight the drug war. Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., said Monday he was offering a similar bill.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Medicare to Pay for Home Help for Frail Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private commission recommended Tuesday that
Medicare finance adult day care and help at home for frail elderly
people who are struggling to stay out of nursing homes and maintain
their independence.
   The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone, made up of
experts on health policy and aging, recommended that the new
benefit be provided to 1.6 million older Americans who live at home
and suffer from severe physical or mental limitations.
   These people _ most of them women _ currently rely mainly on
family and friends for help with routine tasks of daily life such
as eating, bathing and getting out of bed, the panel said.
   ``Providing a modest personal care benefit to this vulnerable
population could improve the availability of community care, ease
the burden of family caregiving, and help to delay or avoid the
placement of these individuals in nursing homes,'' it said.
   The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fund
philanthropic foundation, recommended that Medicare cover up to 25
hours of in-home care per week and allow two hours of adult day
care to be substituted for each hour of home assistance. The cost
this year would be $6.8 billion.
   The commission's report, ``Help at Home,'' said many informal
caregivers are themselves elderly, of modest means and in poor
health, and need outside assistance to supplement what care they
provide.
   The study said 80 percent of informal caregivers had been
providing assistance seven days a week for at least a year; 9
percent had to quit jobs because of the competing time demands, 21
percent had reduced the number of hours they work and 19 had taken
time off without pay.
   ``This is a story of poor women taking care of poor women,' said
Karen Davis, director of the commission and chairman of the
Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Hygiene and Public Health. ``The emotional and
financial toll on these caregivers can be enormous.''
   The study said about one-third of the frail elderly have to rely
on purchased care to supplement informal help from family and
friends. Those with the most severe impairments will spend an
average $7,800 for home care this year, it estimated.
   ``The out-of-pocket spending for care can be a crushing burden
for the severely impaired and their families,'' said Dr. Robert
Butler, chairman of the commission and of the Department of
Geriatrics and Adult Development at New York's Mount Sinai Medical
Center. ``It is now time to begin to alleviate these heavy
burdens.''
   More than 5 million of the 29 million elderly Americans who live
at home suffer from physical disabilities or cognitive problems
such as loss of memory or Alzheimer's disease, the commission said.
   The proposed home-care benefits would cover only the 1.6 million
with the greatest physical and mental limitations, 300,000 of whom
live alone and are in particular need of home care.
   Medicare would pay 80 percent of the costs for limited amounts
of home care, with Medicaid helping to pay the balance for poor
older Americans. The proposal would cost $6.8 billion if it were in
place for 1989, and the cost would rise to $9.3 billion by the year
2000 as the nation's elderly population continues to grow.

   The death toll from a storm that swept
across India and triggered landslides and flash floods has topped
450, police and news reports said Tuesday.
   Police in Bombay, the capital of western Maharashtra state, said
at least 315 people were killed when the storm ripped through the
region Monday.
   Press Trust of India news agency said at least 115 people were
killed in central Andhra Pradesh state and 26 in eastern Orissa
state.
   The storm was caused by a depression over the Bay of Bengal and
moved northwest after crossing the Orissa coast on Sunday, news
reports said.
   At least 200 people were drowned or died in house collapses in
the Raigad district of Maharashtra, according to reports reaching
state police in Bombay.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 75 people were reported missing after the storm lashed the
coastal district.
   In Bombay, hundreds of trees felled by the storm blocked roads.
Waist-deep waters were receding but traffic in the usually bustling
city was scarce.
   At least 22 people died in the city, police said, with most of
the victims trapped under houses that collapsed in the rain.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has ordered relief measures worth
$250,000 for the victims, United News of India news agency said.

   The European Community on Tuesday
strengthened its ties to Eastern Europe by reaching an agreement on
trade and economic cooperation with Poland.
   The accord is the third between the 12-nation Western European
trading bloc and an East European country since a thaw in relations
in little more than a year.
   A spokesman for the European Community said group officials
would meet with Polish representatives to sign the new pact as soon
as possible.
   The five-year accord sets a timetable for gradually lifting
quotas and tariffs on a range of industrial and farm products.
   It also calls for greater cooperation in such fields as
petrochemicals, construction, mining, energy, transportation,
tourism and telecommunications.
   The trade negotiations began last March.
   The community imported about $3.2 billion in goods from Poland
in 1987 and sent exports of about $2.6 billion dollars.
   The European Community, also known as the Common Market, already
has a trade and cooperation accord with Hungary and a trade
agreement on manufactured goods with Czechoslovakia. Negotiations
are under way for similar arrangements with the Soviet Union and
Bulgaria.
   The Common Market has pushed hard to negotiate trade deals with
East bloc nations since it signed a declaration in June 1988
establishing official relations with the Soviet-led economic bloc,
the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The landmark
declaration ended three decades of economic estrangement between
Western and Eastern Europe.
   Also on Tuesday, a European Community spokesman said its
officials will visit Poland and Hungary this week to prepare for a
conference on economic aid for the two countries.
   The teams will take stock of the situation in each country in
advance of the Aug. 1 meeting in Brussels of officials from 23
countries, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The leaders of the seven richest democracies, meeting at a
summit this month in Paris, called for a special program to
encourage economic reforms in Poland and Hungary. They also urged
emergency shipments of food to Poland, which is suffering serious
shortages, and they put the Common Market in charge of the task.
   Western nations would like to find ways to spur the drive in
Eastern Europe toward more open political and economic systems
without upsetting the Soviet Union.
   The Common Market announced on Monday it had invited 23 nations
_ 18 European countries plus the United States, Canada, Japan,
Australia and New Zealand _ to meet next week to discuss
coordinating aid to Warsaw and Budapest.
   Agriculture ministers representing the 12 Common Market nations
on Monday approved a $120 million food aid package for Poland. The
community intends to take grains, meat, olive oil and citrus fruits
out of surplus stocks to send to the Poles this year and next. The
shipments could begin in the next few weeks.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had asked President Bush
and other leaders at the Paris summit for a multibillion-dollar
rescue package in the next two years.
   He sought $1 billion to restructure food supplies, $2 billion in
new loans and additional financing for a variety of projects. He
also wanted the industrialized nations to reduce and stretch out
payments on Poland's foreign debt of $39 billion.

special-edition tribute to one of ``Washington's well-known,
best-kept secrets.''
   But on Monday, the 35-year-old water purification unit salesman
pleaded guilty in federal court to falsely impersonating a federal
officer.
   His guilty plea was in connection with a story he had told a
girlfriend _ that he was an Army general working for the CIA and
the NSC, and that he needed $1,000 to get out of the CIA, according
to Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Patton.
   ``He told the woman he was trying to disassociate himself from
the CIA, that he needed $1,000 to cover bad checks he had written,
and that they were holding that over his head to keep him in the
CIA,'' Patton said.
   The woman gave him a check on Jan. 31, and Lyons has since
repaid the money, he said.
   Lyons, contacted by telephone Tuesday, did not want to discuss
the case.
   ``I really don't have nothing to say,'' he said before hanging
up.
   Patton said Tuesday the whole thing came undone when Lyons told
his girlfriend he had been convicted in the Iran-Contra arms deal,
had lost his military retirement, and that because of the
possibility of terrorist attack he was under protection of the
Secret Service.
   The government found out about Lyons when the woman contacted
the Secret Service to check the story, Patton said.
   Lyons did serve in the Army, Patton said, and was given an
honorable discharge _ as a private.
   Officers at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., have seen the bogus copy of
the Pentagon Gazette and they were not impressed.
   ``That's the first thing that got me, was what this guy was
wearing on the front of the Pentagon Gazette _ an open-collar shirt
with a gold chain around his neck,'' Lt. Col. John Garlinger said
Tuesday. ``No military officer, I don't care if he's a second
lieutenant or a general, will wear an open-collar shirt with a gold
chain around his neck.''
   Garlinger got a copy of the bogus newsletter from the owner of a
uniform store in Leavenworth, the town on the edge of Fort
Leavenworth. Lyons had plunked down a copy of the newsletter at the
store as a way of identifying himself as a general to buy a
general's uniform, he said.
   The five-page edition of the Pentagon Gazette carried around by
Lyons, dated August 1988, said he ``successfully brought back 285
live POWs and the remains of over 300 missing POWs and MIAs'' from
Vietnam in 1983, an event supposedly overshadowed by the dedication
of the Vietnam veterans wall and memorial in Washington, D.C.
   Bob Sturm, the police chief in Mission, Kan., the Kansas City
suburb where Lyons lives, said Lyons also wore a general's uniform
into a print shop in town to get the article printed.
   ``You can lie and be creative about it and sometimes get by,''
said Garlinger. ``But this kind of stuff in the Pentagon Gazette is
so outrageous.''
   ``Obviously, however, he did convince some folks that he was
telling the truth,'' he said.
   Sentencing for Lyons is set for Sept. 25. he faces a maximum of
three years in prison and fines of $250,000.

   The June 4 fire caused by a gas leak in the Ural
Mountains has killed 645 people, including 181 children, a Soviet
official told the legislature Tuesday.
   Previous Soviet reports cited more than 600 deaths, but did not
give a precise figure.
   Two trains carrying 1,284 passengers and crew members were
engulfed in the inferno caused by a spark from an electrical line.
It ignited a highly flammable mixture of benzine and propane-butane
gas leaking from a pipeline near the city of Ufa about 750 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   The incident is being investigated as a criminal case by the
Soviet prosecutor's office, with results expected in November.
Investigators are focusing on how the pipeline was built and run,
said Vitaly Doguzhiyev, a deputy prime minister heading that state
commission on emergencies.
   The investigation has so far revealed that the pipeline was in
poor condition, in need of repair at several places, and lacking
insulation elsewhere, Tass quoted Doguzhiyev as telling parliament.
   Thirty of the victims have yet to be identified, Tass quoted him
as saying. Of those killed, 213 died in hospitals, 46 of them
children, it said. Another 396 people were treated at hospitals and
released.
   The line has been idle since the accident. Once the case is
closed, Doguzhiyev told parliament, the line will be used to carry
oil rather than gas.

<HEAD>Gingrich Calls for Stepped Up Counterintelligence In Wake Of Bloch
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior House Republican called Tuesday for a
U.S. counterintelligence buildup and expanded surveillance of
Soviet agents as the FBI _ tailed by Soviet agents _ pressed its
spy investigation of career diplomat Felix S. Bloch.
   Newt Gingrich, the GOP whip in the House, said after a White
House meeting with President Bush that the FBI's
counterintelligence capabilities had been weakened over the past 15
years, along with U.S. ability ``to know exactly what the KGB is
doing.''
   The Georgian added: ``I think that as people look at that case,
there is going to be a very serious effort to rethink how much _
how much resources do we need to put into counterintelligence
activities and to what degree do we have to strengthen that
capability. It's obviously a very serious concern.''
   The Soviets, meanwhile, were showing extraordinary interest in
the investigation of the 54-year-old diplomat, even tailing him and
the FBI to New York.
   The unusual Soviet surveillance shows ``they have a lot invested
in this,'' said a government source familiar with the case.
   The United States cautioned the Soviet Union against trying to
smuggle Bloch out of the country, it was learned Monday evening.
The warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the
30-year career diplomat was suspected of spying.
   Even so, Bloch and a caravan of FBI agents were followed by
Soviet Embassy personnel on Saturday from Washington to a New York
City suburb, the government source said.
   Still, the former No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
was not arrested. Several officials suggested the government was
trying to bolster its case against Bloch, and even hoped the
Soviets would try to establish contact with him.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the
department ``has had no contact with the Soviets regarding the
Bloch investigation.'' But she declined to say whether Moscow had
been cautioned against trying to smuggle Bloch out of the country.
   The embattled diplomat was suspended from his job as director of
the Office of Regional Political-Economic Affairs on June 22 and
surrendered his diplomatic passport. But no restrictions were
imposed on his travels by the State Department.
   The Bloch investigation centers on the eight years he served in
Vienna, first as an economic officer and then, from 1981 to 1987,
as deputy chief of mission.
   Senior U.S. officials said Bloch would have had access in the
deputy ambassador's post to all messages that passed between
Washington and the Vienna embassy.
   ``The Central Intelligence Agency would have a responsibility to
keep him informed,'' said an official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``And he would know about arms transfers.''
   In addition, officials have said Bloch participated in a
decision announced by the Commerce Department last week to allow
the sale of a broad range of personal computers to the Soviet Union
and Eastern-bloc countries.
   Austria, as a neutral country, is not bound by the restrictions
the United States, other Western countries and Japan impose on
technology sales.
   To try to prevent security-sensitive sales, the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna, acting on instructions from Washington, tries to dissuade
the Austrians from permitting questionable deals to go through,
officials said.
   The officials stressed that Bloch probably had a larger role to
play in embassy issues because he served under two political _
rather than career _ ambassadors, Helene Von Damm and Ronald Lauder.
   Gingrich's suggestion that U.S. counterintelligence needed to be
built up _ and a suggestion he might use the defense bill now
before Congress to accomplish that end _ got a mixed reception at
the White House.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also was concerned
about the government's capabilities. But, the spokesman said, ``we
don't advocate any specific changes at this point.''

   Orange Bill
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam veterans suffering from cancers and
other ailments presumably linked to exposure to Agent Orange would
receive government compensation under a bill introduced Tuesday in
the House.
   The measure represents the latest round of a struggle between
veterans' advocates, who say the government is ignoring evidence
about the deadly herbicide, and government scientists, who say no
clear cause and effect can be established.
   ``This legislation takes the important breakthrough step in
creating a presumption that certain conditions, if developed in an
individual after exposure, are presumed related to that exposure
and are our country's responsibility _ not a burden of that
conflict to be borne in tragic isolation by the veteran,'' said
Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., a Marine veteran of Vietnam and one
of 60 co-sponsors of the bill.
   The bill, introduced by Reps. Lane Evans, D-Ill., and Martin
Lancaster, D-N.C., allows veterans to be compensated longer and for
more diseases than a version that has cleared the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee.
   Under the House bill, costing about $40 million a year, veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and
basal cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability
benefits. So would their survivors.
   The bill would also establish a presumption of service
connection for any Vietnam veteran with chloracne, a skin
condition, provided it occurred within a year of service.
   The Senate bill, covering only soft tissue sarcoma and
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, would provide benefits until April 15, 1992.
   The House and Senate bills would both require extensive
record-keeping based on health reports and tissue samples from
veterans. Both would ask the National Academy of Sciences to review
scientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, with
the Department of Veterans Affairs making its benefits
determinations based on those reviews.
   Veterans are already allowed to receive outpatient and hospital
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.
   The Senate passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measure
never emerged from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
committee, and the senior minority member, Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
sent their colleagues a three-page letter Tuesday calling the newly
introduced bill ``premature at best.''
   They cited an ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control
on the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,
due for completion next spring. They also cited a federal court
order to change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studies
and the recent creation of a U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals to
review claims.
   But supporters of the bill say the CDC and VA have dragged their
feet in trying to determine whether a link exists between Agent
Orange exposure and the various afflictions.
   CDC was accused in a House Government Operations subcommittee
hearing two weeks ago of botching or rigging its Agent Orange study
to fail. CDC contends it dropped a massive study of Agent Orange
exposure because there was no way to tell who was exposed.
   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide wre sprayed during the
war to remove the lush foliage that provided ground cover to the
enemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmful
chemicals.
   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel served within the
borders of South Vietnam. About 250,000 have told VA they believe
they were exposed, and 35,000 have applied for disability benefits.

   After 75 years as a daily newspaper, the
Clearwater Sun will become a weekly next month, its publisher
announced.
   The change at the Sun results from competition in the Tampa Bay
area from the St. Petersburg Times and the Tampa Tribune, Publisher
Bruce E. Coury said Monday.
   ``We faced a choice of continuing to operate a small daily
newspaper in a market that is already served by two giant
metropolitan newspapers or creating a truly outstanding and
distinctive weekly that could target its resources toward the
specific unfulfilled needs of Clearwater readers and advertisers,''
Coury said in a statement.
   Some staff cuts would be made as a result of the change,
effective Aug. 4, but the extent of those cuts was not yet
determined, Coury said. The newspaper has a daily circulation of
just under 15,000.
   The emphasis of the weekly Clearwater Sun will be ``local
issues, events, people, neighborhoods, and sports. The Sun will be
the newspaper for and about Clearwater,'' Coury said.
   Clearwater Newspapers Inc. will continue to publish the free
Sunrise, with a circulation of more than 100,000 in north Pinellas
County, Coury said. The company also will continue to publish
Thunderbolt, the official weekly newspaper of MacDill Air Force
Base near Tampa.

   Gov. Bob Martinez on Tuesday called a
special legislative session for October to consider new
restrictions on abortions.
   ``We're dealing with lives, the unborn,'' Martinez said. ``I
believe that by a better balance of rights we can provide for more
life here in the state of Florida.''
   In a letter to state House and Senate leaders, the governor
called for legislation to block the use of tax money, public
facilities and public employees for abortions, and for tougher
licensing standards for abortion clinics.
   He also urged that the period of pregnancy in which the state
doesn't restrict abortion be shortened, to five months from six
months.
   The cal for a special session to begin Oct. 10 was a reaction to
a U.S. Supreme Court decision three weeks ago that allows states
greater leeway in regulating abortion.
   Martinez would not stop rape or incest victims from getting
abortions, or women whose lives are threatened by a pregnancy.
Women who are in their first 20 weeks of pregnancy would also have
the option of abortion, but not at public expense.
   Martinez didn't propose specific bills. Rather, he offered what
he called guidelines for laws to be drafted by legislators.
   ``I don't believe we ought to have state dollars to engage in
abortion except for the exceptions I've indicated,'' the governor
said.
   Martinez also asked lawmakers to ensure a pregnant woman has the
medical information to make an informed choice about abortion.
   Connie Amidei, an official with the Tallahassee chapter of the
National Organization for Women, tried on at least three occasions
to shout over reporter's questions to challenge the governor on his
position.
   ``The governor is not accessible, he's not talking to us,'' said
Ms. Amidei, who accused Martinez of seeking political gain on the
issue.
   ``First of all, let me say from the beginning I've said the
polls are not an issue here,'' Martinez said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union also condemned Martinez's
call for a special session and the proposal he submitted for
consideration, spokeswoman Robin Blumner said in Miami.
   Florida law allows abortions during the first six months of
pregnancy. A woman must have permission from two doctors, based on
health reasons, to acquire an abortion in the last trimester of
pregnancy.
   Lawmakers are also awaiting a decision from the Florida Supreme
Court on the state's new parental-consent law, which the
Legislature passed in 1988. That law prohibits minors from getting
an abortion without approval from a parent, guardian or judge.

   Dozens of people protested at the annual
stockholder meeting of one of the world's largest furriers Tuesday,
saying the animal rights movement is making furs ``look
unfashionable and stupid.''
   The protesters gathered at the annual meeting of Evans Inc.,
waving signs with pictures of wounded animals and slogans such as
``Buy a fur and slip into something dead.''
   Evans company policy is not to comment on such protests, but
Randall Barberis, vice president of marketing, said the animal
rights movement has had no effect on business.
   Evans reported a loss of $3.8 million in fiscal 1989 on sales of
$148 million and the industry has seen two straight off years.
   An analyst attributed the performance to mild winters that
lowered demand and lower pelt prices, which reduced the cost of
furs to consumers.
   Evans earlier this month reported a first-quarter loss for
fiscal 1990 of $2.28 million, on sales of $16.5 million, compared
with a loss of $2.32 million on sales of $14.7 million in the same
quarter a year ago.
   ``I think the fur industry is drying up,'' said a woman who
called herself Mink Stole and said she was an actress and member of
the Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   ``We are making fur look unfashionable and stupid,'' the woman
said. ``Fur caters to vanity, so if we hurt vanity people won't buy
it.''
   But an analyst disputed the effects of the animal rights
movement on the industry's performance.
   ``It is impossible to quantify any effect that any anti-fur
movement has had,'' said Linda Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   ``The anti-fur movement has become fairly visible, but also the
retailers have recognized that and the fur industry, which is
traditionally very fragmented, has organized to neutralize the
anti-fur movement with education.''
   This year actually should be a good year for consumers who want
to buy a fur, because pelt prices have declined slightly again,
meaning the price of a finished fur product should be lower, Ms.
Baker said.
   Evans also sees a better year ahead, Barberis said.
   ``I think it is fair to say that, because of those reasons, the
last couple of years have been tough in selling furs, but we think
that there is every reason to be optimistic in coming years in
terms of selling furs to consumers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   More than 200 legislators and members
of the biggest opposition party staged a sit-in Tuesday and
demanded the government apologize for ``fabrications'' about a
lawmaker's trip to North Korea.
   At other rallies Tuesday, radical students demanded the
government not arrest a radical student returning from another
illegal trip to North Korea. Lawmakers and members of the leading
Party for Peace and Democracy sat cross-legged on straw mats in
Seoul, angrily jabbing clenched fists in the air and shouting,
``Apologize, regime of (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' and ``Stop
suppressing the PPD.''
   The party says a national security agency investigation into one
of its lawmaker's illegal trip to North Korea has been enlarged to
destroy the party. Protesters said they will continue the sit-in
until Roh's government apologizes publicly.
   They said the latest ``fabrication'' is a story published
Tuesday by the official news agency Yonhap suggesting party leader
Kim Dae-jung wrote a letter to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   Party leaders do not deny their National Assemblyman Suh
Kyung-won made an illegal trip to Pyongyang, but they say they had
no prior knowledge of the trip and charge investigators are using
``black propaganda'' to destroy the party.
   They visited Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon Tuesday to press for
an apology.
   The government, increasingly embarrassed by secret, illegal
visits to the communist north by a student, a clergyman and the
lawmaker, has increased police surveillance of colleges and
universities and offered rewards for radical student leaders.
   Meanwhile, the Agency for National Security Planning announced
Tuesday its intelligence agents have arrested nine people,
including a college professor, and charged them with violating the
national security law and pressing unification efforts in sympathy
with North Korea.
   The government says it will press similar charges against
radical student Im Su-kyong, who plans to re-enter South Korea on
Thursday, the anniversary of the cease-fire which ended the 1950-53
Korean War, by crossing at Panmunjom truce village in the
demilitarized zone.
   For radicals and dissidents, the border crossing symbolizes
their demands for unifying the peninsula divided since the end of
World War II.
   The United Nations Command, in charge of security at Panmunjom,
said it notified Pyongyang late Tuesday that it ``cannot agree to
the transit'' of Ms. Im, meaning her crossing would violate the
1953 armistice.
   Police have been on top alert for radical student leaders they
feel promoted her illegal visit.
   A news conference at Seoul's Sunkyunkwan University to discuss
Ms. Im's return was aborted Tuesday after 200 riot police blocked
the school's gates and marched to the meeting place. Half a dozen
student leaders fled. None was arrested.
   About 75 radical students at Seoul National University and a
similar number at Seoul's Dongguk University rallied Tuesday to
demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact. They said the soldiers ``hinder unification.''
   The government maintains dialogue on unification must be
conducted through official channels and charges the north is
instigating unrest by trying to bypass those channels.

<HEAD>Bush Stands Firm On Flag Desecration Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush remains ``adamant'' in support
of a constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the flag,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   He said the Justice Department has concluded that federal courts
would rule unconstitutional any statutory attempt to circumvent the
recent Supreme Court decision overturning flag desecration laws.
   ``The only way to protect the flag is through a constitutional
amendment,'' said Fitzwater. He said Congress should pass the
Bush-backed amendment if it ``is serious about protecting the
flag.''
   ``The President is adamant in his support of the public demand
to protect the flag. Flag-burning is an affront to America's
patriotic values. It (the flag) should be constitutionally
protected,'' he said.
   Bush has endorsed an amendment saying that ``The Congress and
the states shall have the power to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States.''
   Some lawmakers and legal scholars, including House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., have raised concerns about what
constitutes desecration and whether the amendment would weaken the
Bill of Rights. Some lawmakers also say enthusiasm for an amendment
is waning among their constituents.
   However, Fitzwater said he thinks public sentiment is running
strongly in favor of the effort to amend the Constitution.
   One reporter asked Fitzwater why the flag needed special
protection when ``crosses have been burned longer in this country
than flags, and despite those burnings, the Christian faith and
church have survived.''
   ``Regardless of that, we still believe flag-burning should not
be legal,'' Fitzwater replied.

<HEAD>Burma Denies British Claim that Opposition Leader's Husband Held</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma on Tuesday denied statements by
British officials that authorities are keeping the British husband
of the country's best-known opposition leader under house arrest
with her.
   In London, Britain's Foreign Office said the Burmese ambassador
was called in and told that Britain could not accept its diplomats
being prevented from seeing the husband, Michael Aris.
   His wife, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her opposition partner Tin Oo
were placed under house arrest by the military goverment on
Thursday. They head the National League for Democracy, the
country's leading opposition group.
   They were arrested a day after pro-democracy protests broke out
in Rangoon, leading to the arrest of 44 people. Even though Ms. Suu
Kyi had canceled her group's rally that day, the government accused
her and her arrested colleague of trying to ``destroy the military
and revive anarchy.''
   A spokesman for the British Foreign Office on Tuesday reiterated
Britain's concern about Aris. Asked whether Britain believed Aris
to be under house arrest at his family's home in Rangoon, the
spokesman said, ``We do believe that to be so.''
   The British spokesman also said British officials visited the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon concerning Aris.
   The spokesman, commenting on condition of anonymity, said
Britain's charge d'affaires was prevented from seeing Aris, an
Oxford University professor and expert on Tibet, when he arrived at
Rangoon airport Saturday. Other attempts to see him also were
unsuccessful, he said.
   Burmese authorities said Aris was not under detention. ``The ...
report about his detention is not true,'' Foreign Affaires Minister
Ohn Gyaw said at a news conference in Rangoon.
   He said Aris had been permitted to join his wife and son after
arriving in Burma on Saturday. He said Aris was allowed to leave
each morning to study Buddhism at a monastery.
   However, under the terms of the house arrest, relatives may
leave the residence only under ``under surveillance.'' They are
forbidden to make contact with foreign embassies, political parties
or people connected with those parties.
   Ohn Gyaw said the British charge d'affaires was told of Aris'
situation.
   The British foreign office spokesman, however, said he was
unaware of such restrictions.
   He said British officials were continuing to press for access to
Aris.
   Gen. Saw Maung seized power in Burma in September. During the
year, the military killed thousands of people in crackdowns to
crush a nationwide popular movement for democracy.
   Burmese authorities briefly reopened telephone and telex lines
today to let reporters file stories on the government's denial of
the British charges.
   The military government has kept communications lines cut for
most of the time since the renewed pro-democracy protests Wednesday
in Rangoon. Authorities had also opened the lines for a government
news conference Friday.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok said today that Rangoon was still
heavily policed by thousands of troops who were brought in
Wednesday. He estimated the force at 20,000 soldiers.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
there were credible reports from Rangoon that longtime socialist
strongman Ne Win had ordered the arrests of the opposition leaders.
   ``The thing that gives these credence is that Aung San Suu Kyi

   The nation's hens shelled out an estimated
5.48 billion eggs in June, down 2 percent from a year earlier, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Figures by the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service showed the reduction reflected a cutback in the number of
birds in the U.S. laying flock, which averaged 266 million in June,
also down 2 percent.
   The rate of lay in June was reported at 2,060 eggs per 100 hens,
compared with 2,053 in June 1988.

<HEAD>Army Says It Repulsed Rebel Attack, Killing 180</HEAD>

   Government forces repulsed an assault
by Moslem guerrillas west of Kabul and killed 180 of the attackers,
the government said Tuesday.
   In other battles, government troops killed 58 rebels and three
Pakistanis, the officials said.
   The reports were sketchy and impossible to verify independently,
and the government mentioned only three fatalities of its own. The
only date given was fot of Kabul, which reportedly
occurred Saturday.
   In that battle, guerrilla forces commanded by Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar attacked government soldiers at Maidan r the attack wesShahr,
capital of
Wardak province, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi
Amani.
   He said the guerrillas were driven back with many wounded, and
they had to abandon their 180 dead.
   He said a large quantity of arms and ammunition was captured or
destroyed in the attack.
   Hekmatyar is a leading member of the interim government created
to take over Afghanistan if the U.S.-backed rebels topple the
Soviet-supported Marxist government in Kabul.
   In the eastern province of Nangarhar, government troops attacked
and killed 38 rebels, including a Hekmatyar commander, in
retaliation for a guerrilla attack outside Jalalabad that killed
two soldiers, the government said. It said 48 guerrillas were
wounded.vernment also said three Pakistani military personnel were
killed when their jeep was attacked near Surkh Diwar, southeast of
Jalalabad.
   The Afghan government has repeatedly accused Pakistan of
fighting alongside the guerrillas. The most powerful rebel groups
are based in Pakistan, but Pakistan says it is not fighting with
them.
   In Herat province near Iran, the Afghan government said, army
troops ambushed guerrillas, killing six of them while capturing
arms and ammunition.
   In southern Kandahar, near the Pakistani border, a guerrilla
attack killed one soldier, and the military retaliated by killing
14 rebels, the government said.
   In Kabul, three more rockets injured five people, including
three children, a government statement said. A total of at least 45
people have died in rocket attacks in the capital since Saturday.
   The government blames the guerrillas for the attacks. The rebels
have in the past accused the government of attacking its own
capital to throw the blame on them.

_ three years to the day before the opening of the 1992 Summer
Games.
   Workers were installing dressing room mirrors, hanging paintings
and taking care of other last-minute details for the stadium's
official inauguration Sept. 8 for the Track and Field World Cup,
said Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee spokeswoman Ines

   The 60,000-seat stadium itself is ready for use, she said.
   The government spent $49.8 million to remodel the stadium, built
for an international exposition in 1929 atop Montjuic Hill, which
overlooks the Mediterranean port city.
   The restoration preserved the stadium's original facade, but
completely rebuilt the interior and track.

   LA CELLE-SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Cambodian peace talks broke
down Tuesday, five days before an international conference, with an
impasse reported between Prime Minister Hun Sen and the three
factions opposing him.
   Hun Sen refused to combine his Vietnamese-backed government
delegation with resistance representatives at the conference that
begins Sunday, and he refused to agree to participation by the
notorious Khmer Rouge guerrillas in an interim government.
   ``There is no use in meeting again,'' said Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, head of the resistance coalition. ``The disagreement is
total.''
   Hun Sen blamed the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the guerrilla
factions, for the breakdown in the talks.
   ``We can now ask whether the international conference will open
or not,'' Hun Sen said, adding that the parties were working with
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas to find a solution.
   ``There are still a few days before the conference and we will
try to find a compromise formula,'' he said.
   The talks at an 18th centry chateau in suburban Paris foundered
mainly on involvement by the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, first at
the negotiating table and then in a proposed interim government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and installed a new
government to end a three-year reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge
in which hundreds of thousands were killed. Hanoi has promised to
finish pulling out its estimated 70,000 troops by the end of
September.
   The Cambodian peace conference is to open Sunday. While no more
top-level meetings were scheduled before then, Hun Sen said he
hoped contacts between the groups would continue.
   The Cambodian prime minister said all issues of agreement
reached during two informal meetings in Jakarta, Indonesia, were
``completely abandoned'' Tuesday. He said the groups were back to
the situation existing a decade ago at the start of the war.
   ``It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot
continue its journey,'' he told a news conference.
   Hun Sen wants two parties representing Cambodia: his government
and Sihanouk's coalition.
   ``To acknowledge that there are two Cambodias is mortal for our
country,'' Sihanouk said. ``We don't want partition.''
   Sihanouk proposed the four parties attend as a single
delegation, a move Hun Sen called ``unacceptable.''
   Under Sihanouk's proposal, the Khmer Rouge would be involved,
but not as a separate entity.
   Hun Sen rejects Khmer Rouge participation in an interim
government, while Sihanouk argues that excluding the most powerful
guerrilla force risks renewed civil war in Cambodia.
   Other points of disagreement were a proposed cease-fire, which
Sihanouk refuses, and the composition of an international
peacekeeping force to monitor the Vietnamese pullout.
   Hun Sen said the final withdrawal will take place Sept. 21-26 by
land, river and sea.
   The breakdown Tuesday came after about four hours of talks
between Hun Sen, Sihanouk, Son Sann, head of the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and Khieu Samphan,
nominal chief of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``Now the problem to resolve is finding a formula to meet at the
international conference,'' said a French Foreign Ministry
spokesman, speaking on condition he not be identified by name. ``We
can always find a formula, maybe not before Sunday.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``It's important for the parties to narrow their differences.'' He
said U.S. officials ``will try to help advance that process.''
   Hun Sen stressed his position that the Paris conference must not
be abandoned. ``For our part, we'll try to do everything so that
the conference can take place,'' he said.
   Among the participants lined up for the international
conference, expected to last about a month, are the United States,
Soviet Union, China, France, Britain, Japan, Canada, Vietnam and
the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   Most are to be represented at the opening by their foreign
ministers, with Secretary of State James A. Baker III attending for
the United States.

<HEAD>Ortega Hopes To Settle Contra Situation at Next Week's Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Tuesday
he believes the issue of demobilizing U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels
can be solved at next week's summit meeting of Central American
presidents.
   Ortega also said he will meet with the Nicaragua's political
opposition shortly before the Aug. 5-7 summit in Tela, Honduras.
   ``I have confidence that we can give a definitive answer to this
problem of the Contras (Nicaraguan rebels) during this meeting in
August,'' Ortega said during a news conference at the foreign
correspondents' club in Managua.
   He said dissolving the force of about 11,000 rebels, based in
camps in Honduras, would ``ease the approach to other problems'' in
the region.
   ``While the Contras are in Honduras, the war among Nicaraguans
continues developing,'' Ortega said.
   At a Central American summit conference Feb. 14 in El Salvador,
Ortega promised to move up general elections in Nicaragua to next
Feb. 25 and to adopt rules to ensure the balloting will be fair.
   For their part, the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica promised to come up with a plan by May 15
to demobilize the Contras in Honduras, and a summit was scheduled
for that date.
   But the conference was postponed several times before it was set
for August.
   The U.S. Congress in mid-April approved $49 million in
non-lethal aid to the Contras to run until after the Nicaraguan
elections in February.
   Ortega, responding to a reporter's question, said a decision by
the Central American presidents ``to postpone the demobilization of
the Contras until February would be yielding to U.S. pressure, and
it would mean accepting the continuation of the war in Nicaragua.''
   Contra and Sandinista leaders signed a temporary cease-fire in
March 1988, a month after the U.S. Congress decided to discontinue
military aid to the rebels.
   Only sporadic skirmishes have been reported since then.
   Ortega said his Sandinista government has fulfilled all the
promises it made at the El Salvador summit.
   He said it moved up the date for elections, released 1,897
former national guard members, encouraged the Contras to lay down
their weapons and join the political process, allowed the formation
of political parties with minimum requirements, and established a
balanced Supreme Electoral Council to oversee elections. The
imprisoned national guardsmen had served in the regime of President
Anastasio Somoza, which lost a civil war to the Sandinistas in July
1979.
   ``I'm taking this list (of accomplishments) to the meeting in
Honduras,'' Ortega said. ``What's going to be tested is the will of
the governments of Central America and in particular the government
of Honduras.
   ``I have hopes that what will prevail is the will of the
governments of Central America ... above the will of the government
of the United States.''
   Ortega said earlier this month he would meet with the leaders of
Nicaragua's opposition political groups to discuss the electoral
laws adopted by the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly.
   He said Tuesday that the meeting would be held next week, and he
hoped all of Nicaragua's 21 legal parties would participate.
   Opposition leaders say the reformed electoral laws still give
the Sandinistas an unfair advantage and Sandinistas dominate the
Supreme Electoral Council.
   Washington has said it wants to keep the Contras as an intact
force until after the elections to make sure the balloting is free
and fair.

   A pregnant 18-year-old woman who police say
was set on fire during an argument with her father gave birth to a
healthy baby Tuesday. She suffered burns over 70 percent of her
body.
   Kimberly Richmond was in serious condition Tuesday at Children's
Medical Hospital in Akron with third-degree burns. She gave birth
to a 4{-pound girl by Caesarean section, said hospital spokeswoman
Carol Wallace.
   Police Capt. Jerry Foys said the woman's father, Joseph
Richmond, 41, was arrested without incident at the hospital and
charged with felonious assault. He was in the Summit County jail on
$2,500 cash bond following arraignment.
   A preliminary hearing was set for Wednesday.
   ``The father said he didn't mean to burn her. He merely meant to
scare her,'' said police Maj. Leonard Strawderman. ``After that, he
wouldn't give any more information.''
   Foys said police do not know what father and daughter argued
about Monday night.
   ``He (Richmond) went and got some flammable liquid _ we think it
was brake fluid _ and poured it onto the girl and set her afire,''
Foys said.
   Strawderman said Ms. Richmond is single and lives with her
parents.
   ``She didn't really give a statement to authorities,''
Strawderman said, adding that investigators could not interview her
because of her condition.
   Ms. Wallace said the baby appeared healthy.
   ``The baby's in great shape. She's a little small but she's
doing really well,'' Ms. Wallace said.

   A Canadian company has developed the first
biodegradable diapers made without chlorine, a U.S. marketing firm
that specializes in environmentally safe products said Tuesday.
   Most leading brands of disposable diapers use plastic linings
that do not break down naturally, clogging the nation's landfills.
Environmental groups and federal officials have warned that
non-biodegradable diapers account for about 2 percent of the
nation's entire waste stream.
   Several companies have begun producing disposable, biodegradable
diapers using cornstarch and other natural absorbent substances.
   The marketing firm, Eco-Matrix, said diaper manufacturer Dafoe &amp;
Dafoe of Brantford, Ontario, has developed a process using hydrogen
peroxide, heat and mechanical action to turn wood pulp into a
creamy, white absorbent material.
   The Canadian diapers will be marketed as Nappies Ultra
Biodegradable diapers, Eco-Matrix said.
   Paper diapers, and many other paper products, are bleached with
chlorine. Dafoe's process eliminates the use of chlorine bleaching.

<HEAD>Dukakis Knew ``I Blew It'' After Debate, New Book Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis knew immediately he had made a
serious error when he responded without emotion to a debate
question about the possibility of his wife being raped and killed.
   ``I blew it,'' Dukakis told an aide as he left the stage after
last October's debate with George Bush, according to a new book
about the 1988 presidential race.
   Dukakis' aides were baffled at his performance, according to the
authors, because he had rehearsed an effective answer to a
soft-on-crime question 13 times during debate preparations.
   The story is recounted in the book by political columnists Jack
Germond and Jules Witcover, titled ``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright
Stars? The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988.''
   Dukakis' response, widely criticized at the time, was to a
question posed by debate moderator Bernard Shaw of CNN, who asked
if he would favor the death penalty if his own wife, Kitty Dukakis,
were raped and murdered.
   ``No, I don't, Bernard,'' the candidate responded, his voice as
flat as if he were being asked about budget deficits. ``And I think
you know I've opposed the death penalty all of my life. I don't see
any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better
and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We've done so
in my own state. ...''
   Dukakis' bloodless answer ``captured the candidate's most
glaring vulnerabilities'' and helped put an end to any chance he
had of defeating Bush, according to the book. It said that as he
walked off the debate stage in Los Angeles, Dukakis said to top
aide John Sasso, ``I blew it.''
   Germond and Witcover write that the three other journalists who
were on the debate panel were told of Shaw's question in advance,
were shocked by it and tried unsuccessfully to talk him into
softening it.
   Advance copies of the book, just published by Warner Books, drew
notice earlier this month for critical comments about Vice
President Dan Quayle that were attributed to Quayle's campaign
aides. President Bush said last week he was offended by Republican
advisers quoted by Germond and Witcover, who called Quayle a
``lightweight'' and described him as having a childlike immaturity.
   The book also describes the Bush campaign's successful focus on
a handful of issues used to create negative feelings among voters
about Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts. Those issues included
Dukakis' veto of a bill requiring students to say the pledge of
allegiance, his support for a law allowing convicted murderers to
be furloughed from prison, and opposition to the death penalty.
   Germond and Witcover said Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater and
media adviser Roger Ailes identified those issues in the spring of
1988 and made plans to use them, despite Bush's later suggestion
that he used them in reaction to intense attacks on him at the
Democratic National Convention in July.
   They quote Ailes as saying, ``It's only a matter of who hits
first and who makes it stick. ... My whole fear was that he
(Dukakis) had bigger negatives on us than we had on him.''
   The book describes Ailes as playing a crucial role in coaching
Bush before a combative, live interview with CBS anchorman Dan
Rather _ a session hailed later by Atwater as a ``defining event''
of the campaign. It said Ailes also suggested Bush's use of
Republican primary opponent Pete DuPont's given first name of
``Pierre'' during a televised debate, a reference that deflated
DuPont's attempt to paint Bush as an elitist.

<HEAD>Angola Says Rebels Shot Down Transport Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday that rebels
shot down a military transport plane, killing 42 of the 48 people
aboard, but the rebels denied it.
   A military official said the Antonov-26 was carrying government
officials and some civilians from Luena to Cazombo in eastern
Moxico province Sunday when a Stinger anti-aircraft missile fired
by UNITA guerrillas hit the left engine.
   He said the twin-engine plane crashed in the bush about 25 miles
west of Cazombo.
   The Washington office of UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, issued a statement denying responsibility.
   ``UNITA suspects that a faction of the MPLA (government) not
supportive of the negotiation process is responsible for placing
the blame on UNITA'' it said. ``UNITA remains committed to the
spirit of Gbadolite and will continue to negotiate in good faith.''
   Western diplomats who follow the Angolan situation from Lisbon
said they thought the plane might have been shot down by a UNITA
faction that did not concur with the agreement reached June 22 at
Gbadolite, Zaire.
   ``It looks like the MPLA came out of last week's round of
negotiations well, and some more extreme elements of UNITA could be
trying to up the military pressure to gain more leverage in the
next round,'' one said.
   MPLA stands for Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
the Marxist faction that won a civil war after independence from
Portugal in 1975 and has governed Angola since.
   Officials on the Soviet-built plane apparently were bound for
Cazombo as part of a program to explain the truce, the military
informant said.
   Angola's government and the rebels accuse each other of
violating a cease-fire that began two days after the agreement and
lasted only a week.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said a woman and a 15-year-old
were among the six survivors of the crash and that the municipal
commissioner of Cazombo was killed.
   It quoted an Angolan military source, not identified, as saying:
``This is more than a cease-fire violation.'' It said reports of
UNITA actions had increased over the weekend.
   Antonov-26 aircraft often are used to transport government
soldiers around Angola, which is twice the size of France.
   Lusa quoted the military source as saying increased rebel
activity might cause the government to postpone the next round of
talks, scheduled for Monday in Zaire.
   Angop, the official Angolan news agency, said rebels attacked
and occupied Quimbele and Cuimba, towns in northern Uige province
near Zaire, last Sunday.
   The military official said UNITA forces ambushed vehicles Monday
in Lunda South province, killing 16 people, and fired mortars at
Kuito, capital of Bie province, killing two or three people.
   Quimbele has been considered a possible northern base for UNITA,
which has a southern stronghold at Jamba.

<HEAD>Bush Extends Import Quotas 30 Months, Then Promises End</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday that he was
extending steel import quotas for another 30 months, but he also
served notice on the steel industry that the trade protection would
expire afterward.
   The president said the 2{-year extension of the import quotas
would give U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills time to negotiate
an end to unfair steel subsidies provided by other countries.
   ``I am mindful of the need to improve the availability of steel
in the United States and to promote price competition,'' Bush said.
   Bush's decision will affect 29 countries that have negotiated
so-called voluntary restraint agreements with the United States.
   Under those agreements, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, the
12-nation European Community and 14 other countries agreed to limit
their imports of steel to 18.4 percent of the U.S. market.
   The quotas were first imposed by the Reagan administration in
1984 and had been scheduled to expire on Sept. 30.
   The steel industry had lobbied for a five-year extention of the
import limits, contending that more time was needed to allow the
domestic industry to complete its modernization.
   However, a coalition of steel users, representing groups ranging
from U.S. auto companies to farmers, had urged the administration
to let the quotas expire on schedule, arguing that the restaints
had cost American consumers millions of dollars and lost more jobs
than they had saved.
   Bush's advisers were deeply split over the issue. One faction
argued that the U.S. steel industry had raked in $2 billion in
profits last year and no longer needed protection. Others argued
that U.S. steel producers still faced stiff competition from
government-subsidized industries in other countries.
   There was never any question that Bush would agree to extend
quotas. Four days before last November's presidential election,
Bush sent a letter to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., pledging to do so.
   Heinz, however, complained that the president had undercut
Hills' negotiating position by fixing a date for the end of quotas.
   ``The chances are slim to none that even the most determined
U.S. negotiators can end a generation of foreign government
subsidizing and unfair practices in a mere 2{ years,'' Heinz said.
``The president's negotiators have only 30 months to achieve a goal
that has eluded us for 20 years.''
   Jon Jenson, a spokesman for the 300-member Coalition of American
Steel Using Manufacturers, said the action was a reasonable
compromise.
   ``It is a positive step away from protection and toward a more
competitive steel market in the United States,'' he said.
   But Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of
America, said Bush's action had fallen short of his campaign
promise.
   ``Our members have already made deep concessions to help the
industry survive ... but we have found the government to be
unwilling to respond to a systematic malaise of unfair (foreign)
steel practices,'' Williams said.
   Reagan's decision to impose steel restaints came after an
industry-union coalition mounted an extensive lobbying campaign
tied to the 1984 election. The quotas succeeded in reducing imports
from 26.5 percent of the American market in 1984 to 20.7 percent
last year.
   Last year, the American steel industry operated at nearly 90
percent of its capacity. Major users of steel, such as Caterpillar
Inc., complained that the quotas had increased the cost of American
steel and made their products made from steel less competitive on
overseas markets.
   Bush's quota extention will allow the foreign market-share to
rise by one percentage point per year until quotas are phased out
entirely on March 31, 1992.
   Hills said the increase would be allocated each year to those
countries which have done the most to eliminate subsidies.
   Bush instructed the Commerce Deparmtent to streamline a
so-called short supply mechanism that allows U.S. steel users to
bypass the quotas if the type of steel they need is in short supply.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski praised
Bush's proposal for attempting to ``strike a careful balance''
between producers and consumers. But he said he would reserve
judgement on whether to support the proposed extension until his
committee held hearings on the subject.
   The legislative authority for the current voluntary restraint
agreements expires Sept. 30.
   Members of the Congressional Steel Caucus said they were
disappointed that the president did not extend the import
restraints for another five years.
   ``His announcement of 2{ years is only half the pie,'' said Rep.
Joseph Gaydos, D-Pa.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., said the president's announcement was
``a partial recognition that the steel program has been a
success.'' But he said ``2{ years fails to recognize that more
remains to be done.''
   ``The steel industry needs five years,'' he said, because ``the
unfair trading practices that brought about the ... program in 1984
still exist.''

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with mission and more remains to come back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two teams of experts will go to Hanoi next
week to work with the Vietnamese in seeking more information about
Americans missing in Vietnam for more than a decade, the Pentagon
announced Tuesday.
   The mission, the seventh to be held, will be made up of members
of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory, Hawaii. Those groups will work with the
Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing Persons.
   More than 2,300 American servicemen are listed as missing in
action in Indochina, including more than 1,700 in Vietnam.
   The Pentagon also said the Vietnamese government informed the
United States it would return the remains of 15 people ``which may
be those of Americans'' next week.
   ``These remains were previously reviewed by U.S. and Vietnamese
forensic experts,'' a Pentagon statement said. ``Arrangements have
been ... for subsequent evaluation in an attempt to establish
individual identification.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the Pentagon said the government had identified
the remains of an American serviceman whose body was shipped home
from Vietnam last December.
   The body of Air Force Capt. Albert E. Rodriguez of
Franklinville, N.Y., was among the remains of 38 servicemen sent to
the United States by the Vietnamese. Since December, 25 of them
have been identified and investigations continued on the others.
   Rodriguez had been missing since March 11, 1968.
   ``The U.S. government recognizes and appreciates the increased
efforts of the Vietnamese government which resulted in accounting
for this American,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   Congressional committees approved six bills
Tuesday providing money in the next fiscal year for federal efforts
ranging from AIDS research to enhanced security at Vice President
Dan Quayle's mansion.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved an $18.4 billion
measure for the Treasury, Postal Service and a slew of other
agencies, a $155.2 billion bill for the departments of Health and
Human Services, Labor and Education and a $5.8 billion package for
the departments of commerce, justice, state and the federal
judiciary.
   Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed
bills containing $44 billion for agriculture programs, $18 billion
for energy and water projects and $10.5 billion for the Interior
Department and for federal cultural programs.
   All six bills, covering operations for fiscal 1990, were
approved on voice votes.
   The day's work was emblematic of lawmakers' stepped-up pace as
they race to complete as much budget business as they can before
their four-week summer recess begins Aug. 5. The 1990 federal
fiscal year begins Oct. 1, and Congress will have only four weeks
of work left until then when it returns in September.
   So far, the full House has approved five of the 13 annual
appropriations bills needed to keep the government functioning,
while the Senate has yet to approve any.
   The treasury-postal service legislation provides $2.3 billion
more than this year's spending level, and just $6 million more than
President Bush sought in the budget he submitted to Congress in
February.
   It contains $2.1 million for security improvements at the vice
president's official residence in Washington.
   On a 29-26 party-line vote, Republicans added an amendment
prohibiting enforcement of Section 89, a provision of the tax code
that forces companies to offer health plans to lower-paid employees
that are equivalent to those given to executives. Businesses have
complained that the law is costly and time-consuming for them.
   The labor-health measure boosts job-training spending by $238
million over this year to nearly $4 billion; builds AIDS spending
by 25 percent to $1.6 billion; devotes $1.6 billion for drug
counseling and education efforts; and provides $180 million for the
homeless, $102 million more than this year.
   The commerce-justice measure would provide $50 million for
reparations to Japanese-Americans who were interred during World
War II. The bill originally contained $20 million for the payments,
but $30 million more was transferred for the fund on a voice vote
from the amount slated to go to the Census Bureau. Under the 1988
law that authorized $1.2 billion in payments to the surviving, $500
million was to be paid next year, but lawmakers cited budget
constraints.
   The agriculture bill increases spending on child nutrition
programs from $498 million in 1989 to $715 million, and ignores a
Bush proposal to cut the agricultural extension service and instead
raises it from $361 million this year to $367 million.
   The energy and water measure provides $225 million for the
superconducting super collider, the research-oriented atom smasher
that the government plans to build in Texas for a total cost of
about $6 billion. The amount is $25 million more than the House has
already voted for. Of the total, $135 million would be to begin
construction and $90 million would be for research and development.
   The bill also includes $9.6 billion for nuclear energy defense
activities and $4.2 billion for water projects.
   The interior legislation increases the National Park Service's
coffers from $734 million this year to $771 million, and holds the
National Endowment for the Arts to $143 million, about $1 million
more than this year.

<HEAD>U.S. Approves Funds For Lebanon; Rejects Warship Escort For Food</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration announced Tuesday it
would give $2 million in emergency aid to Lebanon but rejected
suggestions that it send naval vessels to protect supply shipments
against the possibility of Syrian attack.
   The emergency assistance was approved by President Bush at the
request of the International Committee for the Red Cross to provide
food and medical supplies for victims of the country's 15-year
civil war.
   The United States is also providing $14 million worth of food
through voluntary organizations to feed about 400,000 Lebanese
affected by the fighting, which is pitting Iraqi-backed Christian
troops against Syrian-backed Moslem and Druse militias.
   Details of the U.S. aid were released by Assistant Secretary of
State for Middle Eastern affairs John Kelly to the House
Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
   Kelly outlined the administration's Lebanon policy after
witnesses from private Lebanese-American organizations described
acute shortages of food and fuel triggered by the civil war's worst
round of fighting which began last March.
   He denied contentions by some of the witnesses that U.S. food
supplies were being diverted by Syrian troops who have mounted a
naval blockade of Christian-controlled ports along the
Mediterranean coast, in retaliation for a Christian blockade of
Moslem-controlled ports.
   In response to a question from the panel's chairman, Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., whether the administration had considered an
armed naval escort of the supply ships, Kelly said:
   ``I doubt very seriously that there would be much support in the
Congress for the active involvement of U.S. warships in attempting
to break this blockade. I think this blockade can be eliminated
through persuasion and diplomacy.''
   The thrust of U.S. policy is to lobby in the Arab world,
including in communications with Syria and Iraq, for acceptance of
an Arab League initiative to bring about a ceasefire and a lifting
of the blockades, Kelly said. The six-week effort has failed to
yield results, he conceded.
   ``We are waiting for an Arab League decision, an Arab League
action. There is no U.S. initiative, there is no U.S. separate
plan. These are the people who have a realistic chance of solving
the problem there,'' Kelly said.

<HEAD>Walsh Decries ``Piecemeal'' Appeals in Fernandez Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The independent counsel in the Iran-Contra
investigation said Tuesday the Justice Department is jeopardizing
the case against a former CIA station chief by making ``piecemeal''
appeals that have delayed the trial.
   In a strongly worded letter to the Justice Department, Lawrence
Walsh also suggested that the CIA is raising unjustified concerns
that scuttled Monday's scheduled starting date in the trial of
Joseph Fernandez.
   The spy agency objects to plans by Fernandez's lawyers to
identify two CIA stations and one CIA facility in Latin America.
   The Justice Department, acting on the CIA's concerns, won a
temporary stay of the trial from a federal appeals court judge in
Richmond, Va.
   ``CIA stations exist in Latin American countries,'' Walsh said
in a letter to the Justice Department. ``This is a well-known fact.
   ``The attorney general must decide whether it is so necessary to
preserve an artificial deniability that he should block the
prosecution of a high-ranking CIA officer,'' Walsh's letter said.
   Walsh said the prospect that such information would be disclosed
by Fernandez at his trial doesn't warrant the Justice Department's
filing of a national security affidavit. Such an affidavit would
bar use of the information in Fernandez's trial and could kill the
case.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, unwilling so far to take the
drastic step of filing an affidavit, instead sought the stay from
the appeals court.
   The independent counsel's office ``is generally unwilling to
interrupt trials in order to take piecemeal ... appeals'' on
matters concerning classified information, said Walsh's letter to
acting deputy attorney general Edward Dennis.
   Walsh said the Justice Department's actions ``inevitably disrupt
the trial, alienate'' the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
where the Fernandez trial is supposed to take place ``and
jeopardize a successful prosecution.''
   The prosecutor called on the Justice Department to file the
affidavit. Walsh's office could then appeal any rulings regarding
the affidavit.
   Walsh was responding to a letter earlier in the day from Dennis.
   In it, Dennis said Walsh's suggestion that an affidavit be filed
``is premature, and needlessly imperils not only the government's
ability to challenge erroneous rulings relating to classified
information but also the future viability of your prosecution.''
   Dennis said that the prosecutor's office should have appealed
Monday's ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton, who is
presiding in the Fernandez case.
   Hilton rejected proposals by the government to substitute
numbers for the identities of the CIA stations and facilities in
Latin America and to abandon most of one criminal charge against
Fernandez in exchange for dropping references in open court to
three highly sensitive CIA programs.
   Fernandez, the agency's former station chief in Costa Rica, is
accused of four criminal charges focusing on his alleged lies to
Iran-Contra investigators about his assistance to Oliver North's
resupply network for the Nicaraguan rebels.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday lauded the
achievements of a group of young people from poor backgrounds who
succeeded with help from a jobs program the administration wants to
reauthorize and strengthen.
   ``Since 1983 the Job Training Partnership Act has propelled
America's engine, providing education and training for those
lacking in basic skills, or who are economically disadvantaged,''
the president said in a Rose Garden ceremony.
   He presented achievement awards to 12 young adults who had
limited education and skills, and were from economically depressed
home situations. All of them gained training, instruction or
education through the JTPA, a program that provides federal funds
to assist local governments and private industry in giving job
training and employment for such young people as well as dislocated
workers.
   The $2.4 billion jobs program was co-authored by Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Vice President Dan Quayle, who as a
Republican senator from Indiana claimed the jobs program as his
chief legislative achievement.
   The program has been criticized for achieving more quick job
placement for those with limited skllls who can be trained quickly,
rather than more complete training for the most needy and unskilled
and directing them into careers.
   To shift the program's focus, the administration is proposing
that instead of spending most of the money on the unemployed, who
might not be unskilled, the focus will shift more to the percentage
of unskilled poor.
   ``There's a general consensus that we can improve this to help
redirect the focus to help those most in need,'' said White House
spokesman Steve Hart.
   The proposed revisions are being considered along with
reauthorization for the jobs program.
   The outstanding achievement awards were instigated by the
Department of Labor to commend those who complete training through
the program and succeed at jobs.
   One of the women honored Tuesday, Purtillia Bryant, 21,
recounted how she had come from a broken home in North Carolina to
Washington. She said she could not get a job and had few skills
from her high school education. ``I was angry about my situation
and had no self-confidence and felt rejected,'' she said.
   She was referred to a Washington program funded by the JTPA, the
Opportunities Industrialization Center, where she has improved her
typing and studied computer science, English and math. She is
working as a Navy clerk-typist and at night for a car rental agency
to save money for college and to eventually go into the computer
technology field.
   Her story shows, Bush said, ``how tomorrow can be brighter than
today.''
   Examples of the efforts the jobs program funds are summer youth
programs and aid for workers laid off by plant closings.
   The administration is proposing to amend the program targeting
the aid to the most needy applicants.
   The amendments are similar to changes that were proposed by
Democrats.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who is chairman of the Senate panel
that oversees the JTPA, has proposed several revisions saying,
``The vehicle is sound, but some of our neediest citizens have been
left behind.''

<HEAD>Nissan, UAW Step Up Campaigns On Eve Of Union Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Company and union leaders made last-minute
campaign pushes Tuesday on the eve of a vote to decide whether
Nissan will be the first Japanese car plant organized by the United
Auto Workers.
   About 2,400 workers at the plant south of Nashville were to
begin voting Wednesday to determine whether the UAW will represent
Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co. U.S.A. employees.
   Nissan claimed by closed-circuit television within the plant
that UAW representation could mean a loss of benefits, while the
union used radio commercials to hammer away at its theme of plant
safety.
   Labor observers say the election could be a make-or-break
situation for the UAW, which has yet to gain a foothold at any
major Japanese plants in the United States, except those affiliated
with American automakers.
   Three years ago, the union lost badly in an effort to organize
the Honda Motor Co. plant in Marysville, Ohio.
   Only 13.5 percent of Tennessee's manufacturing work force is
unionized, and UAW membership has declined 33 percent over the past
decade.
   UAW spokesman Maxey Irwin said Tuesday that the election's
importance has been blown out of proportion.
   ``The significance to us has to do with the problems that Nissan
employees have. They're suffering a very brutal (assembly) line
speed and high injury rate,'' Irwin said.
   ``As far as the national significance, I fail to understand
exactly how a win or a loss for the UAW in Smyrna, Tenn., will
affect an organizing drive in Salina, Kan., or Tyler, Texas, or
Eugene, Ore.''
   The company has disputed the union's claim of safety problems,
although it drew a $5,000 fine from Tennessee authorities for
refusing to show its injury log to a group of workers. The fine is
now under appeal.
   Nissan's in-plant video messages blamed the union for layoffs at
General Motors, and they promised tough bargaining sessions if the
UAW wins.
   ``The next thing that would happen if the union won is that the
company would start dealing with the union and not you about what
your wages, benefits and working conditions would be,'' said an
audio copy of one tape obtained by the Nashville Banner.
   The tape said employees should be concerned about strikes, and
that a strike could hurt workers more than Nissan. Television
reports of strike violence and unsuccessful strikes are included in
the videotape, which the UAW said has not been shown to suspected
union supporters.
   ``This tape is a use of threats to intimidate employees into
voting no,'' said Frank Joyce, union spokesman.
   ``The idea that somehow Nissan is currently in a bargaining
relationship on an individual basis with workers is pretty
absurd,'' Joyce said. ``Nissan employees do not set their own
wages, benefits or working conditions.
   ``If they want to declare in advance that they will be hard to
bargain with, we're used to that.''
   Nissan officials declined to comment on the tape Tuesday.

<HEAD>States Will be Encouraged to Impose Stiff Drug Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, who is devising an
anti-drug strategy for the nation, said Tuesday that ``carrots and
sticks'' will be used to encourage states to impose stiff drug
policies.
   ``There will be some carrots and some sticks,'' Bennett, the
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told
reporters at a luncheon.
   ``We will expect states to do certain things if they want
federal funds,'' he said. ``We will expect educational institutions
to finally do certain things if they want education funds.''
   Bennett would not say exactly what the states will be required
to do to keep federal money under the drug strategy that is due
Sept. 5. A draft of the plan is being reviewed by various agencies,
including the National Security Council, he said.
   The focus of the national drug control strategy would be crack,
a cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine, said Bennett.
   ``That's not to say the other drugs aren't important and serious
... but the clearest, most immediate danger to the largest number
of people comes from crack,'' he said.
   ``It's crack that is responsible for the disorder in many of our
cities. It's crack which is endangering the lives of so many
innocent civilians because of the tendency for violence. It's crack
which is appearing with terrible frequency as the drug sought out
by pregnant addicts.''
   While people seem to be turning away from many other drugs, he
said, ``That is not the case with crack. Crack, from all evidence,
is getting worse.''
   Bennett said the strategy will not include any recommendation on
semiautomatic assault-style weapons.
   ``As you know,'' he said, ``the president asked me to think
about that, give him my advice about it. I did that some time ago,
and my advice is between me and the president.''
   In March, at Bennett's urging, the Treasury Department suspended
the import of dozens of styles of the firearms. The department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms earlier this month made the
ban permanent for 43 styles, including the popular Chinese-made
AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi carbine.
   Last week, Bennett urged the American Legislative Exchange
Council, a gathering of state legislators, to take a number of
steps to combat drug abuse in their home states.
   Specifically, he called on them to ensure certain and prompt
punishment of those convicted of using or trafficking in drugs,
action that will require the states to hire more police, judges and
prosecutors and to build new prisons.
   The legislators, he said, must make sure there are minimum
mandatory sentences for drug trafficking, harsh sentences for
anyone caught selling drugs to children or using children to sell
drugs and hold both casual and heavy drug users accountable for
their drug use, including civil fines of up to $10,000 for those
convicted of possession of small amounts of drugs.
   The states also should employ asset forfeiture laws and should
make parole and probation contingent on frequent, mandatory drug
tests, he said. In addition, they must support sound treatment
programs and demand accountability from the treatment programs to
ensure that they work
   States also, Bennett said, must insist that public employers
take personnel action against employees caught using drugs or under
the influence of drugs while on the job.
   Bennett did not indicate Tuesday which of these steps states
must take to keep federal funds flowing.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces exchanged
machine-gun fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line Tuesday during
a lull in artillery battles, and civilians fearing new bombardments
reinforced their shelters.
   Police said a woman was wounded by sniper fire in the Ein
Rummaneh district of Christian east Beirut.
   That raised the casualty toll after 19 weeks of fighting to 453
killed and 1,860 wounded.
   The crackle of machine-gun fire echoing through the capital's
deserted streets kept tension high.
   Families who have not fled the ferocious shelling by both sides
prepared for a new outbreak of heavy artillery exchanges.
   ``I want to be ready when the shelling starts again,'' said
Sunni Moslem gift shop owner Bassem Itani as he filled plastic bags
with sand in the Sanayeh neighborhood of Moslem west Beirut.
   ``Most of the people around here have left. I've no place to go
except my apartment here. My wife and I have decided to stay,'' he
said.
   Itani said the underground shelter in his building was ``well
equipped to protect us. But I'm fortifying the ventilation holes
with sand bags to protect us from shrapnel.''
   Beirut remained a ghost town Tuesday. An estimated 250,000 of
its 1.5 million residents have fled in recent days during ferocious
artillery duels between the Christians and Syrians, who support
Lebanon's Moslem factions.
   Police estimate that 700,000 people from both sectors have fled
since March, when the fighting between the forces led by Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun and the Syrian army broke out.
   The usually crowded beaches along the Moslem sector's seaside
boulevard were empty. Elsewhere, frightened Beirut citizens traded
rumors about when the feared artillery battles will resume.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio sought to dampen the
fears, saying the rumors were ``baseless and speculative.''
   One of the most common rumors said Aoun set a Tuesday deadline
to resume shelling attacks against the Syrians if a three-member
Arab League mediating committee failed to produce a settlement to
the conflict.
   A spokesman for Aoun denied reports of a deadline.
   ``The general has confidence in the Arab summit committee and in
its sincere efforts to contain the deterioration,'' the spokesman
said on condition of anonymity. He refused to elaborate.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and
President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria were charged by an Arab
summit May 26 with finding a settlement to Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war by November.
   But so far they have not even been able to enforce a cease-fire
called in May.
   Saudi Information Minister Ali al-Shaer told reporters in Jiddah
that Fahd has appealed for all parties in Lebanon to stop fighting
to give peace efforts a chance.
   ``The Arab League committee on Lebanon is doing its utmost to
save the country, but this will not be achieved unless all parties
concerned show their goodwill and sincere cooperation to achieve
peace,'' Shaer quoted the monarch as telling a weekly cabinet
meeting in Jiddah.
   The fighting broke out March 8, two days after Aoun blockaded
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of Beirut
in an attempt to restore long-eroded government authority.
   The Syrians and their Moslem allies retaliated by besieging and
shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, home to 1 million
people.
   The Syrians _ who have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate _ and their allies outnumber
Aoun's estimated 20,000 men by about 3-1.

   President Bush gave assurances Tuesday that
Senate restrictions on U.S. contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organization ``will be taken into account'' as the United States
pursues its dialogue with Yasser Arafat's group.
   But he also emphasized that he considers the restrictions to be
unconstitutional and an infringement on his conduct of U.S.
diplomacy.
   Bush did not explicitly rule out U.S. meetings with Salah
Khalaf, who is second-in-command to PLO chairman Arafat, or other
officials suspected of either plotting or carrying out terrorist
acts against Americans.
   Concern over U.S. dealings with Arafat's aide, known also as Abu
Iyad, prompted the Senate to approve an amendment last week
restricting U.S. contacts with the PLO. Abu Iyad is suspected of
masterminding the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich
Olympics in 1972 and the slaying of two American diplomats in the
Sudan in 1973.
   The amendment was watered down before its 97-1 passage to ease
requirements for Bush to report to Congress and to scrap a
prohibition on talking to ``accomplices'' in terrorism.
   The lone dissenter was Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who wanted to
tighten the restrictions.
   The State Department, in an unusual move, announced Bush's
position in a statement by spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. It was
issued after Secretary of State James A. Baker III had talked to
the president and to several senators.
   ``The president strongly believes that legislation that tries to
restrict or manage the conduct of diplomacy is an infringement on
presidential prerogatives and is unconstitutional,'' the statement
said.
   ``While we will continue to view the PLO amendment to the State
Authorization Bill and provisions like it as unconstitutional, he
acknowledges the widespread sentiment in the Congress that produced
this legislation.
   ``Members of Congress should know that this sentiment and
concern will be taken into account as we pursue our policy.''
   The statement also said ``unnamed sources who suggest otherwise
do not speak for the administration.''
   A report Saturday in The Washington Post said administration
officials had refused to bar further meetings with Salah Khalaf.
The newspaper quoted an unidentified department official as saying
the legislation ``doesn't rule out anything.''
   The United States broke its diplomatic isolation of the PLO last
December after Arafat, at the urging of the State Department,
publicly renounced terrorism and said he accepted Israel's right to
exist.
   Several meetings have been held since then in Tunisia. The most
recent sought to weaken PLO resistance to an Israeli plan to hold
elections on the West Bank and in Gaza to chose Palestinians for
negotiations.
   The PLO opposes the plan as a ploy to prevent a Palestinian
state. There is no indication Arafat's group has changed its mind.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Pop Up From Rockies To Atlantic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developing in warm and humid air were widely
scattered Tuesday from the Rockies to the Atlantic and from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
   Showers and thunderstorms were most numerous along the Gulf
Coast, from eastern New Mexico to central Kansas, from eastern
Arkansas to Upper Michigan, and from South Carolina to Ohio.
   Thunderstorms east of Albuquerque, N.M., produced three-quarters
of an inch of rain in 45 minutes, the National Weather Service
said. A thunderstorm in southwestern Lower Michigan produced more
than half an inch of rain in the Battle Creek area in 45 minutes,
it said.
   Thunderstorms developing over the middle Atlantic Coast region
moved slowly with the potential for heavy rain on land already
saturated by heavy rain during the past couple of weeks.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered over
Utah and Arizona.
   Temperatures rose to a record 90 degrees at Marquette, Mich.,
and 91 at Portland, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Monterey, Calif., to 108 at Needles, Calif. Tuesday
morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 32 at Burney, Calif.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Arizona and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah through
the southern Plains to the Atlantic Coast states.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast; in the
lower 90s from the eastern two-thirds of Texas to the Atlantic
Coast states and across much of the West; near 100 in southern
Idaho; and above 100 in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Mauritania Rejects Charges By Senegal, Amnesty International</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday rejected
Senegal's accusations that Mauritania is deporting its own black
minority and accused its southern neighbor of refusing to accept
Senegalese sent home from Mauritania.
   In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Mauritania also
accused Senegal of ``the execution of a premeditated plan against
Mauritania and against Mauritanians living in Senegal whose goods
have been pillaged and who have been victims of massacres and
bodily harm of all kinds.''
   Senegal wrote to the Security Council on Thursday setting out
its charges but not seeking immediate council action.
   Tension between the West African neighbors erupted last April
after a clash along their shared river border. Violence broke out
in both capitals against nationals of the other country. Officials
estimate between 250 to more than 400 people were killed.
   Mauritania's information minister, Mohamed Lemine Ould Ahmed,
issued a separate statement Tuesday denying related allegations by
the human rights organization Amnesty International of torture,
killings and arbitrary arrests by Mauritanian security forces.
   ``Amnesty International accuses us of certain deeds which, in
reality, are the crimes which Senegal has committed and continues
to commit against Mauritanian citizens,'' he said.
   He urged the London-based group to ``concern itself instead with
the situation of thousands of Mauritanians still held hostage in
Senegal in inhuman conditions.''
   Each government blames the other for the violence and for not
protecting the goods and lives of each others' citizens.
   About 20 percent of Mauritania's 2 million people are black,
with the rest mainly Arabs and Berbers. Senegal's population of 6.7
million is almost entirely black.
   After the worst of the violence subsided, Senegal reported black
Mauritanians were arriving in large numbers after being deported
from their native country.
   ``In just a few weeks, the operation in question has affected
some 26,000 individuals, who have been driven from their own
country solely by reason of their ethnic origin and been deported
to Senegal, arriving completely stripped of their property,''
Medoune Fall, Senegal's acting foreign minister, wrote last week in
the letter to the Security Council.
   In reply Tuesday, Mauritania accused Senegal of ``refusing to
accept their own nationals repatriated from Mauritania under the
fallacious pretext that they are Negro-African Mauritanians,
against all the evidence.''

<HEAD>Leader of US Orthodox Rabbis Condemns Israeli Court Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of Orthodox rabbis from the United
States said Tuesday an Israeli Supreme Court ruling that
non-Orthodox conversions to Judaism are valid was ``a travesty''
that would increase divisions among Jews.
   Members of the Israeli parliament from religious parties
threatened to renew demands for a ``Who is a Jew'' amendment.
   Reform and Conservative leaders, who note that their liberal
branches of Judaism have attracted more adherents in the United
States, described the court ruling as a victory.
   Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said he would issue citizenship
papers as ordered by the court, but would withhold his signature.
   Deri ordered his ministry to produce special stickers for new
identity cards saying information in the ``nationality'' and
``personal status'' sections could not be admitted as evidence by
the Orthodox rabbinical authorities.
   Secular legislators protested his action as a challenge to the
rule of law.
   In a 4-1 decision Monday, a Supreme Court panel upheld current
Israeli law and ordered the Interior Ministry to recognize as Jews
and give citizenship papers to a group of converts from the United
States, Brazil and Argentina.
   Before the court ruling, Deri had refused to issue papers until
Orthodox rabbis had validated the certificates of immigrants
converted by Reform or Conservative rabbis.
   Harry Horowitz, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Shamir had encouraged talks among rabbis of the three persuasions
toward a compromise conversion formula that would resolve the ``Who
is a Jew'' controversy.
   ``The prime minister wants these discussions to go on so that
these matter will no longer continue to divide or agitate the
Jewish people,'' Horowitz said in an interview.
   Rabbi Max N. Schreier, an Orthodox rabbi from New York, told a
news conference recognizing non-Orthodox converts ``is a travesty.
The fact that a judicial body recognizes something that goes
against the essence of Jewish law is a very disturbing matter.''
   Schreier is president of the Rabbinical Assembly of America,
which represents about 1.5 million Jews.
   The ``Who is a Jew'' argument stems from Orthodox demands that
converts by Reform and Conservative rabbis be excluded from
automatic Israeli citizenship. The Orthodox argue that such
conversions are invalid because they do not strictly conform to
Halacha, or ancient Jewish law.
   Avraham Verdiger, a legislator from Agudat Israel, said his
ultra-Orthodox party might withdraw support from Shamir's
government, which could disturb the balance between the prime
minister's right-wing Likud bloc and the Labor Party, its
center-left coalition partner. Agudat Israel has five seats in the
120-member Knesset.
   Verdiger also said his party would renew its campaign for a
``Who is a Jew'' amendment that would change Israel's Law of Return
and grant automatic citizenship only to Jews converted according to
Halacha _ effectively only to Orthodox converts. The Knesset has
defeated about a dozen such measures.
   Israeli law now defines a Jew as a person who was born of a
Jewish mother or who has converted and does not profess another
faith.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 17-end, `Tarifi said...on Monday' with 12 grafs to
UPDATE casualties, names of other Palestinians and PFLP threat. No pickup.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-PLO Palestinian lawyer
said Tuesday he had talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
fueling speculation Israel's government is breaking its own ban on
contact with the outlawed group.
   Lawyer Jamil Tarifi said he was invited to meet Shmuel Goren,
government coordinator for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and was taken without advance notice to Shamir's office.
   The meeting occurred ``several days ago,'' Tarifi said,
declining to give the date.
   His name was among those of four Palestinians leaked in Israel
and made public by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis
as having held secret talks with Shamir. The others have denied any
contact.
   When reports first surfaced Monday, Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner
insisted the premier held several meetings only with ``non-PLO
Palestinians.''
   Asked about Tarifi's statements, Pazner said: ``The prime
minister reserves to himself the right not to reveal with whom he
met, neither the content of the talks and especially what the
Palestinian participants said.''
   He added: ``I want to stress what Tarifi says himself, that he
did not get any green light from the PLO and that he is not a PLO
member.''
   But leftist legislator Yossi Sarid told Israel radio Tarifi was
forbidden to run for mayor of Ramallah's El-Bireh suburb because he
was a member of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction.
Tarifi was El-Bireh's deputy mayor from 1976 to 1982.
   At the news conference at his home in Ramallah, the 42-year-old
lawyer described himself as ``a PLO supporter, of course'' but
declined to say whether he has direct contact with PLO leaders.
   But he added, ``Nothing happens in the occupied territories
without the knowledge of the PLO. It is the leadership of the
people.''
   Tarifi's disclosure could further fuel a feud in Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc.
   Earlier this month, Likud hard-liners forced Shamir to accept
conditions for his peace initiative, ruling out many possible
concessions to the Palestinians.
   After the left-leaning Labor party threatened to leave the
governing coalition, Shamir backed off and reaffirmed the original
plan.
   Arafat himself was quoted Monday as saying Israel's government
has opened direct contacts with his group over the peace plan.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel on an
interim settlement to calm the 19-month Palestinian uprising.
   In the latest uprising casualty Tuesday, Arab hospital officials
and the army said 20-year-old Fawsi Mohammed Elidawil died of
gunshot wounds suffered a day earlier, bringing to 520 the toll of
Palestinians killed in clashes with Israelis during the revolt.
Thirty-eight Israelis also have been killed.
   Arab hospital officials said at least 18 Palestinians were shot
and wounded in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip Tuesday.
   In Gaza City, 70-year-old Fatma Mohammed Badwan died of a heart
attack suffered when Israeli soldiers broke into her house in
search of stone-throwers early Tuesday, the hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the circumstances of the death and said a
military doctor tried to revive the woman.
   The Hebrew daily Maariv on Tuesday quoted Shamir as expressing
fear that disclosure of his meeting with Tarifi could damage
efforts to speak with other Palestinians who ``would be afraid for
their lives.'' Maariv reported Monday that Shamir and Tarifi had
met.
   The other Palestinians named in the Tunis report are Jerusalem
journalist Mahmoud Abu Zuluf, Gaza businessman Mansour Al-Shawwa
and West Bank pharmacist Ezziddin Al-Aryan.
   All are known supporters of the PLO, and Al-Aryan is a member of
the Palestine National Council, the PLO parliament.
   Tarifi said he did not know why PLO officials in Tunis had
published the names of the Palestinians who had held talks with
Shamir.
   Nablus businessman Said Kennaan said Tuesday that the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an extremist PLO faction led
by George Habash, has warned supporters of Arafat's Fatah wing not
to meet with Israeli officials, Israel TV reported.
   It did not elaborate, and Kennaan could not be reached for
comment.
   Tarifi said Shamir urged Palestinians to accept his elections
plan, even if it did not make clear what the final status of the
territories would be and the PLO has called for ``linkage'' to an
independent state.
   Tarifi also said he told Shamir to deal with the PLO.
   ``The PLO will accept it (the plan) or it will not be acceptable
to the Palestinian people,'' he said he told Shamir.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say They Will Battle Compromise Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists said Tuesday they would
fight legislation that would impose a 14-month cease-fire in the
battle over logging in the ancient forests of Washington state and
Oregon.
   ``It would be news if we rolled over and played dead on this
one,'' Rich Hoppe, a spokesman for The Wilderness Society, said
after the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the legislation
as an amendment to the interior spending bill for the next fiscal
year.
   ``We are going to try and fight it on the floor,'' said Hoppe,
adding that his organization was talking to a ``handful of senators
who we have reason to believe might support us.''
   James Monteith, director of the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said that while Northwest senators believe they have the
votes ``to put it down our throats,'' the fight was far from over.
   Provisions in the legislation that would restrict appeals and
judicial review of timber sales in the federal forests of the
Northwest have outraged many environmental groups and some
lawmakers from outside the region.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who had earlier raised concerns about
the judicial review language in the legislation, could play a key
role in trying to stop the legislation, said Hoppe.
   ``He has reserved his right to raise this issue on the Senate
floor, but hasn't yet decided what he will do,'' said Jim Cubie, a
Leahy aide.
   While some environmentalists were preparing for floor action,
which could come as early as Wednesday morning, others were urging
a more cautious approach.
   ``I think the most productive first step is to work with the
sponsors,'' said Jim Bloomquist, the Sierra Club's director of
public lands programs.
   Jim Pissot of the National Audubon Society said that while there
was still time to make changes in the legislation, he felt a floor
fight was a ``possibility.''
   The timber industry was preparing for a struggle.
   ``We take them at their word,'' said Mark Rey, a vice president
of the National Forest Products Association.
   ``I find it difficult to believe the environmentalists are going
to make this the Armageddon of this Congress given we are talking
about only a 14-month program,'' said Rey. ``But it illustrates
their continued intransigence in trying to find a reasonable
solution.''
   The legislation would allow the sale of 10 billion board feet of
timber in the federal forests of the Northwest over the next 14
months, or about 10 percent under what was originally planned.
   The plan also calls for not logging significant, large blocks of
old-growth forests, a policy known as ``minimum fragmentation.''
   Under the proposal, significant stands of old-growth would be
defined as having eight trees per acre that are at least 300 years
old or are 40 inches in diameter.
   The proposal also calls for environmentalists to agree to the
release of 1.25 billion board feet of the almost 2 billion board
feet of timber sales currently enjoined by federal courts in
Portland, Ore., and Seattle.
   If environmentalists and the industry cannot agree to release
that volume for sale by Oct. 1, the existing court injunctions
would be dissolved legislatively and the Forest Service and BLM, in
consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and new citizen
advisory boards, would decide what timber would be sold.
   The agreement also would prohibit environmentalists from using
injunctions to block timber sales in the next fiscal year, which
starts Oct. 1.
   The appropriations committee approved the legislation sponsored
by Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Brock Adams, D-Wash., on a
voice vote.

   Birdie May Vogt, who was born to a Union Army
captain the year of Custer's last stand, died at age 112 after
being recognized as the oldest living person, a retirement home
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   ``She was blind and she was deaf. She just kind of faded away,''
said Alice Freeman, a receptionist at East Ridge Retirement
Village. ``We were hoping she would last until her 113th birthday''
which would have been in 11 days.
   She died in her sleep Sunday night at the retirement home's
medical center, said nursing director Alice Ruo.
   ``It never occured to me I'd live to be this old,'' Mrs. Vogt
said at 107. ``I don't know why the Lord leaves me here. My
minister says the Lord still has things for me to do.''
   The 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records listed
her as ``the oldest living person for whom there is adequate
authentication.'' Her birth in Akron, Ohio, on Aug. 3, 1876, was
recorded in a family Bible.
   That year, Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone, Ulysses
S. Grant was president, and Gen. George Custer died at Little Big
Horn.
   Guinness researchers had been unable to document any older
people in the world, but they received reports of two older women,
Carrie White, 114, of Palatka, Fla., and Madame Calment, 113, of
Arles, France.
   The Vietnam News Agency reported this month that Vietnam's most
senior citizen, Ngan Thi Quang, is 142, and the oldest man is
130-year-old Hoang A Giang.
   Mrs. Vogt was born Birdie May Musser, only daughter of a Union
Army captain who served in the Civil War. After her parents died,
she married businessman Irving Vogt at age 52. They had no
children, and she outlived her husband by 48 years.
   Mrs. Vogt moved to Florida after her husband died in 1941 and
moved to the retirement village in 1963.
   She was ``a great old lady,'' said a distant relative, Donald
Vogt of Akron. ``It makes us a little proud to be associated with
her.''
   Vogt, 68, remembered Mrs. Vogt as a ``very proper lady,'' who
was fond of hats, abstained from alcohol and tobacco, and enjoyed
riding around town with her husband in their luxury car, a Franklin.
   The retirement village planned a memorial service, but
arrangements were incomplete, Ms. Freeman said.

<HEAD>Goverment Minister Issues Code for Fetal Tissue Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary David Mellor said Tuesday he had
approved a code of practice for using fetal tissue in brain cell
transplants and research.
   The guidelines, drafted by doctors, lawyers and moral
philosophers, forbid inducements to pregnant women to have
abortions or to schedule them for the convenience of tissue
transplant teams.
   Only isolated brain cells or fragments of tissue may be used, to
prevent the transfer of personality characteristics between donor
and recipient, the code says.
   Mellor told the House of Commons the government would begin
discussions with medical organizations on establishing a commission
or agency to control the movement of fetal tissue.
   That was suggested in a report that set out the guidelines and
was prepared by a committee under the leadership of the Rev. Dr.
John Polkinghorne, dean of Trinity Hall at Cambridge University.
The committtee was appointed in June 1988 after doctors in
Birmingham announced Britain's first brain cell transplants using
fetal tissue.
   Professor Edward Hitchcock, head of the team, said the
operations had helped patients suffering from Parkinson's disease,
a progressive brain disorder. Members of Hitchcock's team are said
to have performed at least 17 such operations.
   They welcomed the Polkinghorne report, as did Dr. Vivienne
Nathanson, secretary of the ethics committee of the British Medical
Association, which represents most of Britain's 97,000 doctors.
   ``We believe it is important that new techniques are properly
controlled, publicly debated and regularly reviewed,'' she said.
   The Polkinghorne report said fetal tissue may be used in
research and treatment as long as a woman's decision to have an
abortion is clearly separated from any decision to use the tissue.
   It said the Health Department should establish an organization
to control the movement of fetal tissue and eliminate contact
between abortion clinics and institutions where the tissue is used.
   ``There should be no monetary exchange for fetuses or fetal
tissue,'' it said. ``Profit from any dealing in fetal tissue is
unethical.''
   The report proposed that all new research or therapy involving
the fetus or fetal tissue be approved by an ethics committee.

<BYLINE>Prosecutor Uses Closing Arguments to Attack Credibility of Ed Meese
^By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III was
``at best incompetent and at worst corrupt,'' a prosecutor said
Tuesday at the racketeering trial of Meese's longtime friend, E.
Robert Wallach.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elliot B. Jacobson attacked the
credibility of Meese, who testified for Wallach, in his closing
arguments after 2{ months of trial.
   Jacobson cited an internal Justice Department review that
faulted Meese for his efforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated,
Mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the Wedtech
Corp., a now-defunct defense contractor.
   Wallach, a San Francisco personal injury lawyer, was charged in
a 21-count racketeering indictment with extracting almost $2
million in illegal payoffs and payments from Wedtech, including
some $525,000 in alleged bribes to Wallach to influence Meese and
other government officials.
   The other defendants are W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech
board member and onetime Meese financial adviser, and a business
associate of theirs, R. Kent London.
   Meese testified that Wallach never asked him to give
preferential treatment to Wedtech.
   Wedtech, once a small machine shop, grew into a $100 million
government contractor through a special Small Business
Administration program that set aside contracts without competitive
bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued to
receive the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes even
after it ceased to be a minority-owned company.
   The Wedtech investigation did not result in any criminal charges
against Meese, but Jacobson said: ``As counsel to the president and
as attorney general, Edwin Meese III was at best incompetent and at
worst corrupt.''
   Jacobson said Meese used his testimony as a ``vehicle not only
to vindicate his best friend but also himself.''
   Jacobson said numerous character witnesses who testified about
Wallach's work for good causes did not know, or chose to ignore,
his bad side.
   ``That is the side of Bob Wallach that wanted money and wanted
power and wanted both in the worst way,'' he said. ``Money was the
driving force in Robert Wallach's life.''
   Jacobson also addressed the credibility of the prosecution's
main witnesses, including Mario Moreno, a former Wedtech vice
chairman who has pleaded guilty in the case.
   He said the witnesses were ``crooks'' but that their testimony
was credible because they were at the center of the criminal
conspiracy.
   Jacobson told the jurors not to believe defense arguments that
corrupt Wedtech officials took advantage of the defendants.
   ``These are three sophisticated men. They weren't duped into
anything,'' he said.
   Defense closing arguments were scheduled for Wednesday.

   The accused's right to silence has been abused in

   ``It is wrong that offenders _ usually the more intelligent and
serious offenders _ should be able to manipulate the criminal
justice system to their own advantage, either to escape conviction
entirely or to delay and obstruct the judicial process,'' said a
report prepared by the panel.
   Last year, Northern Ireland ruled that courts could draw adverse
inference if a defendant refused to answer questions. The order was
specifically intended to combat terrorism in the province.
   At the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
indicated that similar changes were intended in England and Wales.
Scotland has a separate legal system.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd set a deadline of Jan. 25, 1990, for
comments on recommendations by the six-member working panel.
   The report adopts, with reservations, a recommendation made in
1972 by the Criminal Law Revision Committee that juries and
magistrates' courts should be able to draw reasonable inferences
from the accused's silence.
   But the panel also recommended:
   _ Statutory guidelines on factors the court will consider in
drawing inferences from silence.
   _ That failure to answer questions or to mention relevant facts
should not amount to positive evidence of guilt.
   _ Developing a new explanation of rights to be read to suspects.

   Enrique Baron Crespo, a Spanish
Socialist, was elected president of the European Parliament during
the opening session of its five-year term Friday, after the
temporary chairman was greeted by a walkout.
   Baron won 301 of the 475 votes, becoming the first president of
the parliament chosen on the first ballot.
   Before his election, the 180 Socialists and 30 members of Greens
parties in the 518-member chamber walked out in silent protest when
Claude Autant-Lara began to speak.
   Autant-Lara, an 88-year old French movie director, belongs to
France's extreme right-wing National Front. The parliament's rules
stipulate that the oldest legislator preside during the election of
the president.
   Socialists and Greens said a representative of the ``extreme
right-wing forces of division in Europe'' should not open the term
of a parliament that strives for unity among the 12 member nations
of the European Economic Community.
   Baron, who will serve during the first half of the parliament's
term, lost the presidency by five votes in 1986, on the third
ballot, to Lord Plumb, a British Conservative.
   The 45-year old lawyer was Spain's minister for transport,
tourism and communications in 1982-1985. He has been president of
the European Socialist Movement since October 1987.
   Although the parliament is the Common Market's legislature, the
EEC Executive Committee has the real power.

   Top designers Emanuel Ungaro, Karl Lagerfeld at
Chanel and Louis Feraud looked back Tuesday to the Gay Nineties for
inspiration in their couture shows for winter 1990.
   Otherwise they didn't have much in common except nostalgia.
   Ungaro centered his ideas somewhere between tartan taste and the
tarty opulence of a cocotte.
   The master draper indulged his penchant for piling on every rich
fabric in the sewing basket. His tightly draped silk blouses,
dresses and suits with fitted tartan jackets over flowered or
checked tiny skirts had a certain ingenue appeal.
   Easier to wear were the pearly gray daytime pants suits in glen
plaids or checks, the jackets dressed up with puffy sleeves.
Ungaro's signature leg o' mutton rhinestone-buttoned sleeves
cropped up repeatedly.
   For his hot, fitted numbers with draped skirts hitched to reveal
lots of leg he picked pink and blue duchess satins so electrically
hot they hurt the eyes. A lot of cocktail dresses came in
variations on the lame-brocade themes so dear to all designers for
next fall.
   Ungaro mixed this female-siren scene up with velvet bows, satin
frills, taffeta flounces wound around the body like a serpent, plus
acres of guipure, lace and re-embroidered velvet and silk.
   It ended with the models turning like Dresden china dolls on a
music box offering a bonanza of flowered satins and silks in
dresses with shepherdess sleeves, crinolines, bows and flowers, not
to mention marvelous beading, sequin embroidery, acres of ruffles
and lace for good measure.
   Things were somewhat more refined though no less sexy at Chanel,
where Karl Lagerfeld showed to an audience sweltering in marble
halls without air conditioning in the Palais de Chaillot.
   Paloma Picasso, Princess Caroline of Monaco and Bernadette
Chirac, wife of the mayor of Paris, appaluded Lagerfeld's fitted
lines echoing Edwardian or Victorian times.
   The topper defining the line from day to evening was a
wasp-waisted long riding jacket or redingote, unveiled first in
flame red decorated with black panels, piping and grid effects over
a narrow, short skirt. Gloves throughout were a great little touch,
especially with big furry cuffs.
   The Chanel look got a nice update with bold stitching instead of
piping and lots of diagonal pockets for a swinging look.
   Missing from the show was Chanel's top model, Ines de la
Fressange. A Chanel statement said she is ill, though it's rumored
she quarreled with Lagerfeld.
   There were lovely surprises like the turquoise redingote over a
blue-green chiffon skirt.
   And Lagerfeld often left out the skirt altogether, making the
jacket into a mini-dress, as in his ready-to-wear.
   The redingote sometimes was teamed with dressy cocktail numbers
with strapless or spaghetti-strapped bodices. And Lagerfeld, like
Ungaro, occasionally surprised with an electric-pink jacket, paired
with a sarong-wrapped skirt.
   There was more of Lagerfeld to this collection than Chanel,
though pearls, floppy neck bows and chain belts did appear. The
Chanel camellia was all over the place, but most flirtatious in a
tulip-scalloped skirt that looked too short to sit in.
   There was retrospective romance in gold guipure-incrusted
jackets with satin skirts, in fitted velvet bodices over full
lacquered tulle or lame-flowered skirts, in romantic lace dresses
in shades of orange, toast and pearl gray.
   The most wonderful evening gown was a body-hugging pearl pink
satin mermaid sheath worn with a fitted redingote topper, of course.
   Louis Feraud seemed to look back to circa 1930, with brightly
embroidered cloche hats, pleated skirts swinging four inches above
the ankle, boleros and an occasional peplum jacket.
   His big trapeze coats with cutout appliques looked mountainous.
   But his patchwork outfits in jewel colors glowed with good fun.
   And the multicolored flowered cloque laquered silk coat-dress
topped with black fox definitely had the stamp of Feraud the artist.
   The romantic Edwardians here were swathed in acres of fluted and
pleated organza ruffs.
   And Feraud turned out some breathtaking jeweled and beaded
sheaths paved in gold, bronze and copper topped by pearls and amber
and topaz stones.
   After all the nostalgia, romance and opulence everywhere else,
the Guy Laroche collection by Angelo Tarlazzi looked so understated
the creator didn't seem to imbue it with the clout of true couture.
   One would like to praise Tarlazzi _ chosen by Laroche himself to
succeed him when he died. But the capable designer with his own
Paris ready-to-wear firm stayed so far on the cautious side it
looked more like a dirge than a celebratory collection in memory of
Laroche.
   The most striking of his ``plain'' clothes were backless black
cocktail dresses in emulation of Laroche, who created a sensation
with one he designed for film star Mireille Darc a quarter century
ago.

<HEAD>Serbia Proposes Major Political Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbia has proposed sweeping changes
in Yugoslavia's constitution that would increase the powers of the
federal government and protect human rights, the Tanjug news agency
reported Tuesday.
   A statement released by the Serbian Presidency's Commission on
Social Reform said, ``Yugoslavia must become a modern, democratic
and efficient federation,'' according to Tanjug.
   It reported the commission said the federal government ``must be
able to ensure a unified economic market,'' have control over
national defense and security matters, have exclusive power to
conduct foreign policy, set the goals of a scientific research
program and ensure environmental protection.
   The commission also called for the establishment of an
independent judiciary as ``one of the basic democratic
institutions.''
   The proposals, the first to be set out officially by any of
Yugoslavia's six republics and two provinces, states Serbia's views
on a new constitution scheduled to be adopted within two years.
   Yugoslavia's other republics say post-World War II Yugoslavia
was founded on the basis of full equality of all of the regions and
they oppose many of the Serbian proposals. Serbia is the largest
and most populous republic, and the other regions say the proposal
would give Serbia an unfair advantage.
   Under the present constitution the republics have a wide degree
of autonomy in economic and political matters.
   The constitution, adopted in 1974 under the late Josip Broz
Tito, the founder of communist Yugoslavia, has been blamed by many
political leaders for the virtual paralysis of the political
process and the nation's fragmented economy.
   Yugoslavia has a 700 percent inflation rate and rising
unemployment in a struggling economy and the political leaders in
the six republics have been unable to reach agreement on moves to
overcome the crisis.
   The Serbian statement did not call for a multi-party system,
which has been demanded by some Serbian liberals opposed to
Communist Party domination, but said ``the possibility of other
forms of pluralist political organization ... should not be
excluded.''
   It also proposed creation of a legislature with the members
elected by universal suffrage. Under the present consitution equal
numbers of deputies are elected by each republic.

   An oppressive heat that has kept many
Washingtonians inside for days did not stop President Bush from
playing tennis Tuesday.
   Bush's enthusiasm to get to the newly resurfaced White House
courts was undisguised as he stopped to chat with two reporters who
spotted him returning to the White House from the Old Executive
Office Building next door.
   He raved about the new surface, indicating it had a bouncy feel.
   Although it was 90 degrees, and the air was thick with a hazy
humidity, the 65-year-old president said he was off for some
doubles with former Swedish Ambassador Wilhelm Wachtmeister, one of
the capital's most accomplished tennis players. They were joined by
presidential assistant Roger Porter, head of the Office of Policy
Development and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
   Bush, who also was out on the courts Sunday, said his partner
would be Wachtmeister.
   Looking forward to a future sports opportunity, Bush expressed
interest when the two reporters told him he was invited to play in
a softball tournament.

<HEAD>Judge Sets $10 Million Bail For Khashoggi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi can be released
on $10 million bail if he wears an electronic bracelet while he
awaits trial on charges he helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos
allegedly plunder the Philippines, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
   Khashoggi, 53, once among the world's wealthiest men, has been
jailed since he was extradited from Switzerland last Wednesday.
   ``The court recognizes that no precautions, including pretrial
detention, ever conclusively guarantee a defendant's presence at
trial,'' wrote U.S. District Judge John Keenan in his ruling. But,
the judge said, the court believed the ``substantial bail'' and the
restrictions of his freedom would assure that Khashoggi would
appear at trial.
   Keenan also said Khashoggi was unlikely to flee because it would
have a ``ruinous impact upon his ability to conduct business.''
   His lawyer, Robert Morvillo, said Tuesday enough money had been
raised to meet the bail but that paperwork prevented Khashoggi's
immediate release from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
Manhattan.
   The following conditions to Khashoggi's release were imposed by
the judge:
   _ The posting of a $10 million bond, half of which will be
secured by cash or bank books and the other half by property or a
bond. The bond is to have two ``financially secure'' co-signers,
one of whom is to be his brother, Essam Khashoggi.
   _ Khashoggi's movements will be monitored by federal marshals
with an unremovable electronic bracelet attached to his wrist or
ankle.
   _ He is to report twice a week in person and daily by phone to
officials.
   _ Khashoggi must surrender his passport and stay within the
southern district of New York, which includes Manhattan and its
northern suburbs, pending the outcome of the case.
   In setting the high bail, the judge said Khashoggi was an
``enormously wealthy man'' who ``possesses the means to procure
staggering amounts of cash in fewer than 24 hours.''
   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi, the
Marcoses, five other people and the California Overseas Bank in Los
Angeles last October. The ousted president and his wife were
charged with stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets as a cover, was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   He was extradited only for mail fraud and obstruction of justice
because the Swiss government denied extradition on the other
charges, which are not recognized under Swiss law.
   Khashoggi faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on
each of the two charges.
   He is said to have been the main financier and middleman of the
Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret U.S. arms sales to
Iran were channeled to rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
   Khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals, but
his arrest in Switzerland on April 18 marked the first time he had
been jailed.
   Prosecutors say the earliest trial date for Khashoggi and his
co-defendants would be January or February.

   President Bush, who campaigned for president
with a slogan of ``adoption not abortion,'' is urging government
managers to find ways to support and accommodate employees who want
to adopt children.
   Bush in a memorandum directed all department and agency heads to
be as flexible as possible on arranging adoption-related leaves,
print adoption articles in agency newsletters, honor National
Adoption Week in November, and use employee assistance programs to
help workers considering adoption or who ``have a family member
facing a crisis pregnancy.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday
explained the president's motivation in the directive.
   Bush ``simply feels very strongly in adoption, that it's one of
the answers to the abortion problem, and as part of a general
concern about family values,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush directed his Domestic Policy Council of advisers ``to
develop a presidential adoption initiative'' after considering
various ways the government can encourage and facilitate adoption.
   In his directive, the president said, ``It is time for the
leaders of the federal workforce to ensure that our government is
pro-adoption. Adoption works -- for children who need homes, for
people hoping to become parents, and for women facing a crisis
pregnancy.''
   Bush said that 40 percent of pregnancy counseling in this
country does not mention adoption as an option.
   He called on the agency heads to use agency resources,
suggesting the federal Employee Assistance Programs, to help
adoptive parents, and said the departments should begin planning to
celebrate National Adoption Week, focusing on local children who
need adoptive homes.
   The president said supervisors should be ``as flexible as
possible regarding the adoption related leave needs of employees,''
including giving hourly leaves to meet with adoption agencies as
well as longer leaves to care for the adopted children.

   The House Ways and Means Committee voted
Tuesday to cut by half the surtax on older Americans that pays for
Medicare insurance against costs of a catastrophic illness,
shifting some of the cost to both those with lower and those with
higher incomes.
   The panel, responding to a flood of mail from the mainly
higher-income retirees who bear most of the cost of the new
program, also agreed 19-17 to raise the flat premium that all but
the poorest people 65 and older must pay for the coverage.
   In general, couples with income under $25,000 a year would pay
more for coverage; most of those with incomes above that level
would pay less. Those above the $80,000 level would pay more
compared with current law.
   Also included in the committee's amendment was a provision that
allows retirees a once-in-a-lifetime chance to turn down
catastrophic coverage. But to quit that program, they also would
have to give up Part B Medicare, which pays physicians' fees.
   The committee, working on a catchall tax bill, by voice vote
reversed an earlier action that would have repealed what remains of
the consumer interest deduction. That action means about 24 million
couples and individuals will still be able to write off 10 percent
of the interest they pay on automobile, credit card, education and
other loans next year.
   Under the 1986 tax overhaul, the interest writeoff is being
phased out. This year, 20 percent may be deducted; after 1990, no
deduction will be allowed.
   Still awaiting action by the committee is a big political issue:
whether to reduce the tax on capital gains. President Bush wants to
cut the tax rate but Democratic leaders are opposed because they
believe most of the benefit would go to those with incomes over
$100,000 a year.
   There was no indication when the committee would decide that
question.
   Making the decision on how to change the catastrophic program
seemed to be almost as tough. The program became law only a year
ago, but since that time many retirees have complained because
coverage is required of all Medicare beneficiaries and because
higher-income retirees are having to foot the bill for those with
lower incomes.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who said his main concern had been
about middle-income retirees, called the committee's compromise a
major gain.
   Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass., who had complained because of the
flat monthly premium that lower-income retirees have to pay for
coverage, said he and others will still attempt to have the entire
program repealed. As for allowing retirees to opt out of coverage,
he said, even after the committee's action ``it's about as
voluntary as a prison sentence.''
   Under present law, most retirees pay a flat premium of $4 a
month for catastrophic coverage, which covers about one-third of
the cost of the program. The remainder is paid by those 65 and
older whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $150 a
year in federal income tax.
   That remainder pays a 15 percent surtax on top of federal income
tax. The surtax rate is due to climb to 28 percent by 1993.
   The maximum surtax this year is $800 per person, or $1,600 if
both spouses are eligible for Medicare.
   Under the committee's action, the 1989 surtax rate would drop to
7.5 percent of taxes over $150; by 1993 the rate would rise to 14
percent.
   The flat premium for catastrophic coverage, now $4 a month, is
scheduled under current law to rise to $4.90 next year, with
similar increases projected in future years. The committee plan
would increase the 1990 premium by $3.50, $4 in 1991 and $4.10 each
in 1992 and 1993.
   The monthly catastrophic premiums are added to the regular
charges that most retirees pay for Medicare Part B coverage, which
help pay physicians' fees. The regular Part B premium is $27.90
this year and scheduled to rise to $33.40 by 1993.
   To meet requirements for reducing the federal deficit, the
committee voted to delay Medicare reimbursements to doctors and
hospitals by five days at the end of 1990, six days in 1991, three
days in 1992 and one day in 1993. That would produce a budget
saving of $2 billion next year.

   Investigators trying to decide if a man
charged with a New Mexico murder is linked to slayings in three
other states waited Tuesday for the results of ballistics tests on
a gun found in the man's car.
   A second man, arrested in Oklahoma, already has been charged in
two of those killings of store operators and clerks last week.
Police have said no link has been found between the two men.
   The ballistics tests are expected Wednesday, said Don Bullis, a
spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Public Safety in Santa
Fe.
   Greg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, Kan., was arraigned here
Monday on an open charge of murder in the death of a woman who was
shot twice in the head at a mini-mart in Springer. Braun, arrested
at a roadblock near Cimarron, was being held in lieu of $1 million
bond.
   Springer Police Chief Lewie Baker said the handgun found Monday
on the seat of Braun's car was a .25-caliber.
   Paul Renfrow, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
spokesman in Oklahoma City, has said that ballistics tests linked
one weapon to slayings in Ardmore, Okla., Garden City, Kan., and
Pampa, Texas. Authorities have said the victims were shot with a
.25-caliber weapon.
   Investigators from Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas arrived Monday to
try to talk to Braun about those slayings.
   But Ray Floersheim, Braun's public defender, said Tuesday he
would not allow anyone to talk to his client. A preliminary hearing
is tentatively set for Aug. 2, Floersheim said.
   Another man, Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., has been
charged in the Oklahoma and Texas cases. He was being held without
bond in Oklahoma where he was arrested. A preliminary hearing on
the Oklahoma charge is set for Sept. 28.
   Police did not find a gun on Greene.
   Garden City police Capt. Stan Wojdylak said no link has been
found between Braun and Greene.
   Carter County District Attorney Fred Collins of Ardmore, who
filed a first-degree murder charge against Greene, said Monday he
didn't want to discuss that charge until he had studied findings
from New Mexico.
   ``This is the most ridiculous headache. It is not simple,''
Collins said.
   Assistant District Attorney Gary Henry said prosecutors still
believe the evidence against Greene in the Ardmore case is good.
   ``Either he (Greene) is our guy or he's the unluckiest human
being that ever lived,'' Henry said.
   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of the
survivors of the shootings there identified Greene from photographs
as the man who shot them.
   Pampa police have charged Greene with capital murder in the
shooting of a photo processing business owner.

<HEAD>Hastings Denies Wrongdoing as Senator Expresses Doubts About Wiretap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., surprised an
impeachment hearing panel Tuesday when he said wiretap charges
against Judge Alcee Hastings were too weak to warrant removing him
from the bench.
   Hastings denied wrongdoing at his Senate impeachment hearing,
emphasizing, ``None whatsoever'' when asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., if attorney William Borders had ever offered him money to
fix a case.
   Hastings, 52, Miami, is accused of plotting with Washington
lawyer Borders in 1981 to obtain a $150,000 payoff to place two
convicted racketeers on probation instead of imprisoning them. He
also is charged with perjury and improper disclosure of wiretap
information to Dade County Mayor Steve Clark.
   In a surprising development, Gorton, one of 12 senators on a
panel hearing evidence in the case, said that even if the wiretap
evidence proved to be very damaging it would not amount to enough
to remove Hastings from the U.S. District Court bench.
   In a statement, Gorton said his conclusion did not apply to the
other articles of impeachment against Hastings approved by the
House a year ago and now are being weighed by the Senate. He did
not elaborate when asked later.
   ``Sen. Gorton, as he said, was speaking for himself,'' said Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noting he would withhold a decision until all
the evidence was presented.
   Most of Hastings' testimony on Tuesday involved the wiretap
count, and Hastings is expected to testify again on the bribery
charges.
   Leahy, however, arrived late and asked flatly if money to fix a
case ever had been offered by Borders, who was convicted of bribery
conspiracy in 1983 and now is refusing to answer questions before
the panel. He is expected to be called again Thursday.
   Leahy stopped asking questions about bribery after being told
Hastings would testify again later. But the judge firmly offered
his denial. The articles of impeachment also accuse Hastings of
lying to a jury at a 1983 trial at which he was acquitted.
   In emotional testimony, Hastings told the senators that he had
not disclosed the wiretap information.
   ``I did not tell Mayor Clark anything about anything anytime on
earth,'' Hastings said. ``... I take great stock in my ability to
keep a secret.''
   Hastings told the panel that when he was confronted by two Miami
reporters concerning rumors that he had disclosed the information
``I was absolutely livid in the way this information was coming to
me.''
   ``It was rife in the courthouse and it was bouncing all over the
place,'' Hastings said in a calm voice. `` ... It is hard for me to
control my rage as I speak now.''
   He acknowledged under questioning from lawmakers that he had not
initially cooperated with the public integrity section of the
Justice Department in its investigation of the wiretap leak.
   He said he already had been in conflict with the public
integrity section in the bribery conspiracy case and that he felt
they had been unfair to him in the past and were likely to do so
again.

   The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday
refused to finance a planned survey of the intimate details of the
sex lives of Americans aimed at helping scientists better
understandhow AIDS spreads.
   The panel slashed $11 million from President Bush's proposed
budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, money that would have
paid for the survey.
   The project ``does not appear to be an appropriate use of public
funding,'' the committee said.
   In a report accompanying the $155.2 billion appropriations bill
for the Health and Human Services, Labor and Education departments
and for other agencies, the committee said: ``If such a survey is
necessary, it should be supported with nongovernmental funds.''
   ``The Public Health Service is not to proceed with this study,''
the committee report said.
   The bill is headed for the House floor and then to the Senate.
   The proposal to cancel the survey came from the subcommittee on
labor, health and human services and education, which approved the
cancellation in a closed session. Subcommittee staffers refused to
say who proposed it.
   Plans for the survey have been stalled at the Department of
Health and Human Services, which includes the Public Health
Service, since the Office of Management and Budget raised concerns
in April about a pilot questionnaire designed to preceed the larger
survey of 20,000 Americans.
   In response, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan directed public health
officials to review the appropriateness of the questions proposed
for the pilot survey. Department officials say that since then the
survey has been through several levels of review and is now
awaiting consideration of James Mason, the assistant secretary for
health.
   The pilot survey that had been submitted to OMB proposed to ask
participants when they last had sex, what they did and whether
their partner was a man or women. It also asked questions about
oral and anal sex and masturbation.
   Backers said the survey was designed to develop a comprehensive
picture of Americans' sexual practices to help public health
officials better understand the spread of AIDS.
   Conservatives have lobbied strongly against the survey, saying
scientists already know that AIDS is spread through sexual contact
and that the government has no business invading the sexual privacy
of Americans.
   James Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, declined
to comment on the House action except to say ``we are reviewing the
situation.''
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he was ``very disappointed
that this survey may not be done.''
   He noted that a recent General Accounting Office report said
information from the survey was essential for projecting the number
of future AIDS cases and for planning health and hospital care for
the growing number of victims of the disease. The National Academy
of Sciences also said such a survey was necessary for planning AIDS
education efforts.

   Sen. Edward Kennedy, after touring
capital-area AIDS clinics on Tuesday, outlined a comprehensive plan
he said would assure medical care, support services and protection
from discrimination for AIDS patients.
   The Massachusetts Democrat met with AIDS victims and visited
AIDS and drug treatment clinics Tuesday morning. Later he said the
cost of his plan _ about $500 million in fiscal 1990 _ should be
viewed as ``an investment.''
   ``It is justifiable in terms of resources and essential in terms
of public health,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee and a strong advocate for AIDS patients.
   Kennedy noted that the number of Americans diagnosed with AIDS
recently surpassed 100,000 and nearly 60,000 have died from the
disease.
   ``Those who persist in thinking that this epidemic does not
concern them must take note of these figures,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Kennedy said his tour of treatment facilities convinced him of
the need for a strategy to combat ``the twin epidemics of AIDS and
drugs which plague our inner cities.'' He said that will seek
dramatic expansion of out-patient care facilities. Intravenous drug
users and their sexual partners are the fastest growing group of
AIDS victims.
   Belinda Mason, a 30-year-old activist with AIDS who was named
last week by President Bush to serve on the National AIDS
Commission, told reporters Kennedy's plan is ``excellent news for
all of us.''
   She said she has known discrimination all too well since
contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion during childbirth.
Shortly after she was diagnosed in 1987, she recalls hearing that
the pool in her community of Hartford, Ky., was closed ostensibly
for a filtering problem. Soon, however, she learned that ``it was
the presence of my body in the water that led to it being closed.''
   Kennedy's plan, she said, would help make life for AIDS victims
``more humane and equitable.''
   ``People with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and AIDS only
want what everyone else wants _ we want a job and home and the
right to a decent life,'' she said.
   Kennedy said stronger anti-discrimination protection for AIDS
victims is the most important piece of his plan. Such protection
was dropped from an AIDS bill in the last Congress in order to stem
controversy and win passage of the measure.
   Kennedy's committee currently is considering legislation to
strengthen safeguards for AIDS victims against discrimination in
employment, public services, housing, transportation and
communications. The measure is expected to come up next week.
   Kennedy says he also will push to extend for three years a
program that helps low-income AIDS victims pay for life-prolonging
treatments. The program, which expires Sept. 30, won approval from
Kennedy's committee last week.
   Other parts of the Kennedy plan would:
   _Ensure that promising new AIDS treatments are made available as
quickly as possible and that $6 million for community-based drug
testing be doubled next fiscal year.
   _Provide comprehensive medical care and support services for
AIDS patients and housing for the growing number of homeless people
with AIDS.
   _Permit AIDS victims to keep their private health insurance
after they become disabled.
   _Provide AIDS-prevention information to drug users.
   _Help communities hit hardest by AIDS give financial assistance
to hospitals and other facilities overburdened by the crisis.
   Kennedy's $500 million plan would be in addition to Bush's
proposed $1.6 billion for AIDS research and education in fiscal
1990.

   U.S. National Guard pilots went on
standby Tuesday to help fight hundreds of fires that burned
millions of acres of forests and brushwoods in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Ontario.
   Clouds of dense smoke hampered waterbombers and rescue efforts.
   Thundershowers rumbled across the fire belt Tuesday, sprinkling
light rain on the burning hinterland but failing to help control
fires that have forced the evacuation of 20,500 people and
blackened about 3.7 million acres. Many fires raged out of control.
   Firefighters succeeded in holding fire lines around threatened
communities, and officials said only a few houses and lodges have
burned. There have been no reports of injuries or deaths.
   Manitoba Natural Resources Minister Harry Enns said National
Guard pilots stationed in North Dakota were put on standby and
could arrive in Manitoba at any time they are needed.
   ``When the situation becomes such that we can't send up an
aircraft because we haven't got a pilot, then we have these crews
on standby,'' he said.
   They would relieve waterbomber crews and pilots frustrated by
smoke so thick it turned the sun into a reddish smudge.
   Officials said Tuesday night that planes, trains and trucks had
virtually completed the evacuation of people from fire-stricken
areas of Manitoba.
   But in Ontario 40 people were airlifted out of Kasabonika. Most
of the evacuees were frome Manitoba but at least 350 people were
removed from fire-threatened areas in Ontario and 900 were
evacuated in Saskaels
and given vouchers to shop for clothes. Many had fled so hurriedly
the only belongings they had were the clothes they were wearing.
   Winnipeg relief workers organized activities and excursions for
the refugees.
   Officials said seven women from Minnesota on a 600-mile canoe
trip did not realize the danger they faced until they paddled into
Cross Lake, where surprised firefighters watched as they approached.
   The women were flown to Thompson Tuesday and said they were
anxious to continue their wilderness trip. The officials had no
further information about the women.
   The pall has made breathing difficult in the vast northern zone.
Waterbombers could not see the fires blazing in brush and
timberland.
   ``It's like dusk in the middle of the afternoon,'' Northern
Affairs Minister Jim Downey said after returning from the sparsely
populated region on Monday. Downey had flown with Manitoba Premier
Gary Filmon to Thompson, The Pas and Flin Flon, where evacuees are
being taken.
   Filmon said he is considering sending medical staff from
southern Manitoba to relieve doctors and nurses taxed by patients
being treated for smoke inhalation at Thompson, a mining city of
about 15,000. It has taken in more than 3,000 evacuees.
   Hot, dry winds blew flames perilously close to settlements and
mining towns.
   ``It's sometimes an hour-to-hour situation, waiting for the
smoke to lift to a point where a plane can land,'' said provincial
government spokeswoman Diana Soroka.
   Thompson was many miles from the nearest fire Monday, but smoke
shut down its airport temporarily.
   The fire zone begins 250 miles north of Winnipeg and stretches
220 miles from northeastern Saskatchewan to northwestern Ontario.
   Officials estimated 224 fires were burning in Manitoba and 165
in Saskatchewan on Monday, but said smoke obscured some blazes. The
fires became a serious problem last week and evacuations began
Thursday.
   Soroka said some evacuees were being taken by plane, train and
car to Brandon and Winnipeg in the south: ``We're taking them
wherever the room is.'' Military transport planes, helicopters,
hoses, pumps, tents, and other materials have been pouring in from
other parts of Canada and the United States.
   About 1,600 firefighters, 53 helicopters, 11 waterbombers, nine
fixed-wing aircraft and several pieces of heavy equipment, such as
bulldozers, have been thrown into the effort.
   It's estimated $25 million will be spent by the end of the week,
compared with $15 million for the whole season last year.

<HEAD>Smoker Wins Suit Against Airline for Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASCO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chain-smoking politician fumed when a
smoking ban was announced for his flight just before takeoff, but
the airline got burned in a court judgment.
   Pasco Mayor Ed Hendler sued Delta Air Lines for its last-minute
elimination of a smoking section on a flight he took in March. On
Monday, a judge agreed that Delta owed him a refund of his $389
airfare, plus $10 in filing and court costs.
   ``I was not provided the services I paid for,'' Hendler said in
a small claims court complaint. ``I'm very pleased. I'm tired of
being a second-class citizen because I smoke.''
   Franklin County District Judge H.W. ``Pete'' Felsted ruled that
Hendler was owed the price of his ticket because Delta did not give
him specific notice of the possibility of the change.
   Delta has 14 days to appeal. Jim Lundy, a company spokesman in
Atlanta, said Tuesday the airline is reviewing the case.
   He said federal law requires that every non-smoking passenger is
guaranteed a seat, and a plane's smoking section can shrink,
depending on the demand for non-smoking seats.
   ``In the case of this flight, it appears a no-smoking passenger
showed up very near departure. It became apparent that the entire
flight would be designated a no-smoking flight,'' Lundy said.
   Hendler was flying to Washington, D.C., as a representative to
the American Public Transportation Association meeting.
   ``I was a nervous wreck by the time I got there,'' he said,
calling himself a smoking addict.

   The Democratic-controlled House voted Tuesday
to slash nearly $2 billion from President Bush's request for Star
Wars, but the Senate overwhelmingly kept the administration's B-2
bomber plan relatively intact except for a token cut.
   By a vote of 98-1, the Senate endorsed the costly stealth bomber
if it meets flight testing standards and demonstrates that it can
perform its mission of evading radar detection and penetrate Soviet
air space.
   Bush administration officials have expressed hope that the
Senate vote on the bomber in the president's $295 billion defense
budget would serve as a counterbalance to expected votes in the
House cutting the program.
   The House takes up the issue Wednesday when it considers
amendments to eliminate or severly limit the program.
   In crafting its defense blueprint, the House cut $1.8 billion
from the $4.9 billion Bush had proposed for Star Wars, formally
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Lawmakers approved an
amendment to cut $700 million from the program in addition to the
$1.1 billion the House Armed Services Committee had trimmed from
the program.
   The vote was 248-175, with 214 Democrats and 34 Republicans
voting for the reduction.
   ``We serve notice on the administration to bring this futuristic
program down into the world of budget reality,'' Rep. John M.
Spratt, Jr., D-S.C., declared just before the House reduced funds
for the anti-missile shield.
   After reducing SDI spending, the House overwhelmingly approved
using $150 million of the Star Wars money for such items as
helicopters, artillery rockets and Army ammunition, and $300
million for cleanup of nuclear defense facilities.
   Members also approved spending $450 million in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, the 1990 year, and $600 million in fiscal 1991
for military drug interdiction.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on Capitol Hill for a meeting
with Senate Republicans, said the House decision on Star Wars
``seriously undermines the program.''
   ``I'm confident the Senate will do better. I'm confident we will
come out of the Senate with our program basically intact, including
the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 bomber,'' said Cheney,
a former congressman from Wyoming.
   Cheney's prediction for the Senate was largely on target as
lawmakers approved a modest cut of $300 million in the $4.7 billion
requested by Bush for the B-2 in the new fiscal year.
   The Senate restrictions, sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, the panel's ranking GOP member, was intended to
insure that the B-2 perform as advertised before a decision is made
to build a full fleet of 132 planes.
   Echoing administration officials, Nunn said, ``What we want to
do is put great fear in them (the Soviets), ... great pause as to
what we would do and what we are capable of doing after they have
launched a first strike.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., voted against the amendment. Sen.
Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, is hospitalized and did not vote.
   The Senate also voted 99-0 to increase by $1.9 billion in the
new fiscal year, and by $2.1 billion in the following year, the
funds available to provide modern combat gear and weapons for the
troops of the National Guard and military reserve forces.
   In a 98-1 roll call, the Senate also approved a Nunn-Warner
amendment aimed at improving the effectiveness of small infantry
units through the development of improved weapons and equipment.
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., voted no.
   Cheney's concerns about the House held true as member rejected
an amendment to accept the defense secretary's procurement budget.
The vote, largely along party lines, was 278-143.
   Prior to the final Star Wars vote, the House rejected an even
deeper cut in the anti-missile shield as well as an amendment that
would have restored all but $300 million to the administration's
request.
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee,
Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, agreed that conventional forces
need more money, ``but the problem is we're taking it from the
wrong source.''
   ``There comes a point when you keep dipping out of this
particular program you're going to kill it,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Bush would veto
any bill that cuts money for Star Wars, told reporters: ``We're a
long way from considering vetoes. ... We're talking now about
winning, not about vetoes.''
   Republican Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut attributed the
administration's defeat on Star Wars to the emphasis it has placed
on lobbying for the B-2 stealth bomber.
   ``They focused hard on this issue,'' Rowland said, referring to
the bomber. ``They got creamed on SDI.''
   Lawmakers have expressed ``sticker shock'' at the B-2 program's
cost estimates _ $23 billion already invested, eventually a total
of $70 billion for 132 planes or $530 million per copy.
   The House Armed Services Committee voted for deep cuts in the
program, slashing $800 million from the Bush request, and is to
consider measures to terminate the program or place strict limits
on further spending.
   By voice vote Tuesday, the Senate approved an amendment
requiring the Pentagon to report to Congress by December on
alternatives to a 132-bomber force. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., in introducing the measure, said, ``132 is not magic; we
must examine a smaller force.''
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, reiterated its argument that
elimination of the B-2 would force the United States to revise its
position in strategic arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in a letter to
Warner, said, ``It is important that we do not send the wrong
signal to the Soviets regarding U.S. resolve to maintain a strong,
viable triad'' of air, land and sea forces.

   A top Cuban official on Tuesday rejected
U.S. suggestions that Cuba has been lax in combating drug smuggling
to the United States and said Cuba itself has been a favorite
target of U.S. traffickers.
   Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Alarcon also renewed
his government's appeal for U.S.-Cuban cooperation in fighting drug
smuggling.
   Speaking at a lengthy news conference, he bitterly criticized
U.S. policies and cited allegations that high U.S. officials have
trafficked in drugs without prosecution.
   In Washington, meanwhile, a senior State Department official
made similar charges about Cuba at a Capitol Hill hearing.
   Melvyn Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said there was a sharp increase in drug
shipments through Cuban territory in the first six months of this
year despite a sudden crackdown that led to the executions of four
Cuban officials.
   ``Some evidence suggests that Cuba simultaneously facilitates
the flow of drugs in selected cases while prosecuting other cases
to conviction,'' Levitsky added during an appearance before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee narcotics task force.
   Alarcon alleged there was a dramatic contrast between the
American attitude toward U.S. officials suspected of drug
involvement and the decisive action Cuba took against a drug
trafficking ring led by one of the revolution's most trusted
figures, Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa.
   Ochoa and three of his allies were executed on July 13. A number
of other officials received lesser sentences.
   Levitsky dismissed the Cuban proceedings as ``carefully
choreographed show trials'' and said Cuban President Fidel Castro
most likely was aware of high-level involvement in narcotics
trafficking.
   At a later news conference in Cuba, Jorge Gomez Barata, a top
official of the Department of Revolucionary Orientation, was asked
about a U.S. plan to sponsor a television version of Radio Marti, a
special Voice of America broadcast service to Cuba.
   The TV Marti plan is close to final congressional aproval and is
expected to go on the air if it passes certain technical tests set
for this fall..
   Gomez Barata said aproval of the plan is illegal under
international telecommunications law and could ``lead to a crisis''
in relations between the United States and Cuba.
   He said Cuba could jam TV Marti and jammers were ``ready to
start operating at any moment. Cuba is not a country willing to
allow its sovereignty to be trampled on.''
   Alarcon said hundreds of drug traffickers and dozens of aircraft
and small vessels have been captured by Cuban authorities over the
years. He added that ``tons and tons'' of packages of marijuana
have washed up onto Cuban shores.
   Although Cuba could not prove the packages originated in the
United States, he cited statistics showing that U.S. marijuana
production ranked second only to corn among agricultural products.
   Alarcon said the United States and Cuba must ``establish ties of
cooperation'' in combating narcotics smuggling as part of a more
``rational attitude'' for dealing with the problem.
   Castro originally suggested joint cooperation in combating
trafficking, but the State Department reacted coolly to the
proposal.
   Levitsky said Cuba has for years shown indifference to the drug
trade, has not responded when U.S. officials have sought to alert
Havana to specific shipments, and has ignored U.S. indictments of
its officials.
   But he said that ``we are taking a fresh look at areas in which
the government of Cuba could tangibly demonstrate the seriousness
of its claimed willingness to cooperate.''
   Alarcon said the United States has never provided Cuba with any
specific evidence regarding use of Cuban air space or territorial
waters for drug smuggling. He said the Cuban revolution ``will not
tolerate the least flexibility or make the slightest concession
toward this vice or persons related to this vice.''
   Alarcon spoke for almost three hours to a group of journalists _
mostly foreign _ assembled here for the 36th anniversary of
Castro's debut as a guerrilla fighter.
   Castro will mark the occasion with a speech here Wednesday night.

<HEAD>Agreement on Harbor Entry, No Guarantee of Leak-free Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday on
conditions governing the Exxon Valdez's entry into San Diego Bay,
but neither Exxon nor the Coast Guard guaranteed a leak-free
passage by the damaged oil tanker.
   ``I've learned, if nothing else from this experience, not to be
too categorical,'' said Tom Gillette, Exxon Shipping Co.'s external
affairs adviser.
   ``But I think that everything that can reasonably be done, both
from the state standpoint and Exxon's standpoint, is being done,''
Gillette said in a hearing of the Assembly's Select Committee on
Oil Spill Prevention and Response Preparedness.
   The committee, chaired by Assemblyman Ted Lempert, was formed in
the aftermath of the nation's worst oil spill, caused by the Valdez
on March 24 when the ship struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound.
   In another development Tuesday, Exxon Corp., trying to rebuff
criticism suggesting it might not resume its cleanup in Alaska next
year, insisted it would return but stopped short of making a
commitment.
   A July 19 internal memo to Exxon oil spill managers, which was
quoted in media reports Monday, suggested the oil company's cleanup
crews would leave Alaska for good after shutting down for the
winter.
   In Valdez, Alaska, Otto Harrison, general manager for Exxon
Valdez operations in Alaska, said at a hastily called news
conference Tuesday the memo was not intended to ``extend to any
other phase of our cleanup operations'' in the future.
   The memo said that the company would shut down cleanup
operations for the winter ``for safety and operational reasons.''
But it went on to say ``all equipment will be fully demobilized''
and that ``our only commitment for the spring of 1990 is to survey
the shorelines.''
   In California, the oil spill committee was charged with
evaluating the state's ability to respond to a major oil spill and
recommending ways to improve the system.
   The committee focused on the saga of the Exxon Valdez, which
remained about four miles off San Clemente Island and 56 miles from
San Diego.
   The Coast Guard denied the ship entry to San Diego Bay for
repairs on July 10 because of oil leakage and other discharges.
Navigational problems also were created by steel slabs that peeled
away from the hull during the 2,500-mile journey from Alaska.
   Samples from two slicks that coincided with the Valdez's arrival
showed traces of Alaskan North Slope crude mixed with heavy
concentrations of marine life in the ship's shredded cargo tanks.
   But Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro said other preliminary test
results showed no toxicity and barely detectable hydrocarbon levels
in samples of hardened oil residue and seawater from the ship's
cargo tanks.
   ``As far as the Coast Guard is concerned, as long as everything
else has been put in place, I see no reason why the vessel can't
come into port,'' said Montoro.
   As captain of the port, Montoro has the ultimate say on when the
Valdez can enter San Diego Bay en route to National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. for a $25 million repair. The move likely would
take place between Friday and Sunday, he said.
   Still, Montoro said it would be unrealistic to expect the Valdez
to enter the harbor leak-free.
   ``The bottom is completely open in 10 of the 15 tanks,'' he
said. ``But we're very satisfied that whatever small amount (of
debris) does come out, it's not going to adversely affect the
environment.''
   Divers late Monday completed underwater cutting of the seven
jagged steel pieces dangling from the hull. More than 100 tons of
steel were removed and allowed to fall 3,000 feet to the ocean
bottom. The ship could not clear San Diego Harbor shallows with the
plates dangling.

   A series of explosions ignited a B-52 bomber
as civilian ground crews were fueling the aircraft for ground tests
at Kelly Air Force Base, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   One person was killed and 11 others were injured in the accident
Monday night. Four remained hospitalized.
   A team of Air Force investigators was en route to Kelly. Alfred
G. Hansen, commander of Air Force Logistics Command at
Wright-Patterson at Dayton, Ohio, will head the investigation
board, said Kelly spokesman Frank Weatherly.
   He said a formal finding was not expected for several months.
   Lt. Col. Ed Cooke said the B-52, built in 1958, was nearly
finished with a mechanical overhaul. There were no weapons on board
the aircraft because it was being serviced.
   ``Some of the injured workers were inside the aircraft; some
were outside,'' Weatherly said.
   Civilian employee Jesus Pedraza, 38, was killed, said First Lt.
Dave Ebner, Kelly spokesman.
   Another worker, Herman Morris, was in serious condition Tuesday
at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio where he was being
treated for burns, said Ray Perry, hospital spokesman.
   Three other injured workers remained hospitalized Tuesday at
Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center. Weatherly said the other
seven injured workers were treated and released overnight from two
hospitals.
   The bomber, which was based at Eaker Air Force Base in
Blytheville, Ark., had been parked outside Kelly's Building 375, a
mile-long airport hangar used for repairs, Weatherly said.
   The bomber was scheduled to be shipped to Barksdale Air Force
Base, in Bossier City, La., Friday, after maintenance was
completed. But Cooke said the B-52 was very heavily damaged.
   Witnesses as far as a mile away reported hearing several loud
explosions and seeing flames shooting about 25 feet into the air.
   Weatherly said the fire was extinguished in less than an hour,
but it damaged a ground power unit, a tug and a fuel truck.
   Nearly 250 people were evacuated from Building 375 and adjacent
maintenance facilities during the blaze, Weatherly said.

   President Bush on Tuesday nominated U.S.
Marshals Service Director Stanley E. Morris to be deputy director
of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   The long-awaited appointment of a deputy director in charge of
efforts aimed at reducing drug supplies came just six weeks before
that office, headed by William J. Bennett, is required to complete
a national drug control strategy.
   Bennett said earlier Tuesday that his office has completed its
draft of the strategy and had submitted it to the affected agencies
for review.
   ``Obviously we're very pleased'' that Bush nominated Morris,
said Bennett spokesman Larry Cirignano. ``We would hope for a quick
confirmation so that he can get started.''
   Although Morris has been advising Bennett informally through his
role as head of the Marshals Service, ``It's different than coming
on board, getting his staff on board,'' Cirignano said.
   Last week, Morris, Bennett and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
announced the results of an eight-week task force headed by the
Marshals Service that resulted in the arrests of 456 fugitives
wanted on drug charges in the Washington-Baltimore area, including
25 people wanted on drug-related homicide charges.
   Morris has headed the Marshals Service since 1983. Among other
things, it administers the Federal witness protection program and
has custody of seized assets in drug cases valued at more than $960
million.
   Morris was associate deputy attorney general from 1981 to 1983.
He served as deputy associate director for economics and government
at the Office of Management and Budget from 1973 to 1979, and has
been on the faculty at the University of Maryland.
   In other personnel actions on Tuesday, the White House announced
Bush's intention to nominate:
   _John M. Sayre as assistant secretary of the Interior for water
and science. Sayre, an attorney in private practice from Boulder,
Colo., once served as city attorney for Boulder from 1956 to 1963.
   _Raymond G. H. Seitz as assistant secretary of state for
European and Canadian affairs. Seitz is serving in the U.S. Embassy
in London and has served as executive assistant to the secretary of
state and in Zaire, Nairobi, and the Seychelle Islands.
   _Robert R. Randlett as assistant administrator of the Agency for
International Development for legislative affairs. Randlett is
director of public policy issues for Allied-Signal Inc., and
previously worked as congressional liaison officer for the Labor
Department.
   _Barbara E. McTurk as superintendent of the Mint in Denver. She
is a consultant for the state House of Representatives in Colorado,
and was state field director for Bush's presidential campaign last
year.
   _John T.Martino as superintendent of the Mint in Philadelphia.
He is president of Keystone Data in Pennsylvania, and previously
served in several state posts and as assistant to Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa.
   _JoAnn Krukar Webb as director of the National Cemetery System
in the Veterans Affairs Department. She previously was a health
care consultant for ACTION, the national volunteer agency, and was
an ACTION representative on the federal task force on AIDs.

   The United Airlines crew who flew a
DC-10 jumbo jet with no hydraulic controls went by the book until
they ran out of standard procedures and then improvised, the
plane's pilot said Tuesday.
   ``We realized we had more than just an engine failure. It was
apparent to all of us we had lost all of our hydraulic fluid,''
pilot Al C. Haynes said at a news conference in Sioux City, where
Flight 232 crashed a week ago. It was his first public comment on
the crash.
   When he asked flight engineer Dudley Dvorak ``for the procedure
for that, he said there isn't one. So we made it up as we went
along,'' Haynes said.
   Haynes, Dvorak, co-pilot William R. Records and off-duty United
pilot Denny Fitch brought the plane down at Sioux Gateway Airport,
where it crashed, flipped, broke apart and burst into flames. Of
the 296 passengers and crew, 185 survived and 111 were killed.
   Haynes said the crew never contemplated not making it to the
airport.
   ``We were just going to go in and land, and that's what we tried
to do. How could we operate if we didn't believe that?'' he said.
   He would not discuss the cause or technical details of the crash
because the National Transportation Safety Board is still
investigating.
   The pilot said he ``can't wait to get back to work,'' but added:
   ``We must not forget that 111 people perished in this accident.
This crew ... is dedicated to finding the cause of this accident so
we can maybe never have it happen again.''
   Later he and his wife, Darlene, returned home to Seattle to
applause and hugs from their older son, Anthony Haynes, 29, and his
wife Marlene, in front of their small yellow house a few blocks
east of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``It's just great to be home,'' the 57-year-old pilot told a
crowd of reporters gathered outside his house. ``If you can give me
a few days, maybe we can all get together and talk about this.''
   Rob Doughty of United said, however, it might be a month or more
before the crew would give any interviews.
   ``Capt. Haynes is very adamant that the crew tell their story as
a team, because it was a team effort,'' Doughty said.
   Dvorak, 51, who lives in Tacoma, Wash., also flew home Tuesday.
   In Iowa, investigators once again searched corn and soybean
fields about 60 miles from the airport for important pieces of the
DC-10's No. 2 engine, the tail-mounted engine that apparently blew
apart and severed lines of all three hydraulic systems.
   Those hydraulic systems allow pilots to set key wing and tail
panels that control the aircraft's attitude and direction. Without
them, the pilot has little control over the airplane other than his
throttles.
   Meanwhile, in Washington, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner said Tuesday that nothing about the crash indicates that
other DC-10s are unsafe or that anything more now needs to be done
to make them safer. He defended new Federal Aviation Administration
head James Busey, who declared the DC-10 a safe aircraft even
though the cause of the crash has not been determined.
   On Wednesday, NTSB inspector Jack Young planned to visit a
General Electric Co. jet engine plant in the Cincinnati suburb of
Evendale to examine the manufacturing records for engine that blew
apart. The plant made all three of the DC-10's engines.
   Haynes appeared weak and teary-eyed as the news conference began
but grew more composed as he recounted the ordeal. He had cuts on
his face and a blackened left eye.
   Dvorak appeared at the news conference with Haynes but did not
answer questions. Records and Fitch are still in the hospital.
   Haynes said Records was flying the plane when they heard a loud
report and knew an engine had blown. Haynes started the procedure
for shutting down the engine.
   ``Everybody kicked in. Everybody offered their own assistance
without being told. We have a lot of experience here, and it showed
in the cockpit. There's no substitute for experience,'' Haynes said.
   The crew was on the radio first to air traffic controllers in
Minneapolis and then in Sioux City as they battled to land the
plane.
   ``There's nothing like a calm, soothing voice talking to you,
telling you everything you need to know,'' Haynes said.
   Officials said many aboard the plane survived because the jet
came down at the airport, where rescue workers already had been
assembled. Haynes and his crew were credited with getting it there,
but Haynes said: ``There is no hero. There is just a group of four
people who did their job.''
   Investigators said airplanes with the infrared cameras were
concentrating their search for metal pieces from the DC-10's jet
engine in the expanse of farmers' fields.
   ``The parts that we have not recovered are the parts we are very
interested in,'' said Robert MacIntosh, chief NTSB investigator.
   Finding the missing pieces was proving difficult in part because
much of the search area is covered with thick crops. The corn
fields are about 4 feet tall and the soy crops are in bloom.
   MacIntosh said officials were painstakingly reassembling that
tail section in a hangar at the airport to determine where pieces
flew.
   ``We're interested in the trajectory of some of the pieces,'' he
said. ``We feel there were rotating parts that went and penetrated
part of the airframe.''

   Four policemen and eight guerrillas from two
different rebel groups were killed in separate clashes in Lima and
the southern highlands, police said Tuesday.
   In the first incident, 300 Shining Path rebels late Monday
attacked a police post in rural Acobamba with dynamite and
automatic weapons fire, police said.
   Four of the 30 officers at the post and three rebels were
killed. Police said the survivors abandoned the post after an
hour-long battle.
   The rebels then blew up the station and the city hall, and
ransacked stores in the town, located 175 miles southeast of Lima.
   The attackers made off with arms, medicine, food and clothing,
police said.
   Troops were dispatched to Acobamba to pursue the guerrillas,
police said.
   In a second clash, at least 15 guerrillas from the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement Tuesday attacked a Lima police post with
grenades, dynamite and rifle fire. Five rebels were killed in a gun
battle and the others fled, police reported.
   They said there were no casualties among the 15 officers inside
the station, located in the Pueblo Libre working-class section of
Lima.
   Tupac Amaru rebels advocate Cuban-style Marxism.
   Police said the rebels painted slogans on nearby walls and hung
Tupac Amaru flags near the station.
   The guerrillas also set off bombs in three nearby banks and a
telephone office, damaging the buildings and breaking windows,
according to police.
   The movement has been fighting Peru's elected governments since
1984. It takes its name from an 18th century hero who led a peasant
revolt against Spanish rule in the Peruvian highlands.
   Estimates of the number of activists in the organization range
from 500 to 1,500. On April 28, 62 Tupac Amaru guerrillas were
killed when they were surprised by a military patrol near the
highland town of Jauja.
   The movement is smaller and considered less violent than the
Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that took up arms against
the government in 1980.
   The Shining Path began its guerrilla war in the city of
Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, but has since spread its
influence through much of the Andean highlands and into the
coca-producing jungle regions of the northeast.
   The government says more than 15,000 people _ many of them
peasants caught in crossfire between guerrillas and troops _ have
been killed in violence related to the insurgencies.

<HEAD>Taiwan Sends Officers To Take Control Of Ship Implicated In Fish
Sting</HEAD>

   Taiwanese enforcement officers on Tuesday
headed for a rendezvous with a driftnet vessel that has been
shadowed by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter in the North Pacific since it
was implicated in a scheme to sell $1.3 million worth of illegally
caught salmon a week ago.
   The ship carrying Tawianese police officers was expected to
reach the Sung Ching No. 1 and the Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau
within several days, said Ed Wolfe, the State Department's
ambassador for fisheries and oceans.
   After a joint boarding party inspects the Sung Ching No. 1, it
will be turned over to Taiwanese custody. Wolfe said the United
States expects the crew to eventually be prosecuted under Taiwanese
law.
   Taiwan's domestic law restricts the export of salmon and also
limits where Taiwanese driftnet vessels are allowed to fish.
   However, Wolfe said the government of Taiwan had provided ``no
guarantees'' it would prosecute.
   ``We've requested that they do so and it would be in their best
interest,'' he said.
   Taiwan had previously refused to allow U.S. personnel to board
the ship.
   The Sung Ching No. 1 was one of two Taiwanese driftnet vessels
implicated in the illegal sale of salmon to U.S. undercover agents
posing as fish buyers in a six-month sting operation.
   Last week, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as they
emerged from a Seattle bank vault carrying more than $1 million in
cash allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally
caught fish.
   At the time the arrests were made, the Sung Ching No. 1 and the
other Taiwanese ship were preparing to transfer the fish to the
U.S. government chartered fishing tender Redfin in the North
Pacific, north of Midway Island.
   When the captains of the two Taiwanese ships boarded the Redfin
to arrange details of the transfer they were detained but their
vessels fled as the Mogenthau approached.
   Taiwan has until Aug. 29 to sign an agreement with the United
States regulating the conduct of driftnet vessels. The agreement
would permit U.S. inspectors to board Taiwanes vessels and would
require the vessels to carry satellite transponders to signal their
locations.

   A paraplegic sorely inched
closer to the top of blustery El Capitan on Tuesday, trying to make
up for lost time to reach his goal of conquering the granite wall.
   Mark Wellman and his climbing partner Mike Corbett got a late
start on the eighth day of their tortuous trek to the top of the
3,200-foot monolith, although they had planned to begin climbing
the final 700 feet as early as 7 a.m. Instead, they decided they
needed extra rest.
   ``We're both really sore and we're both ready to get off the
mountain,'' Wellman, whose legs are paralyzed, said in a radio
conversation with a park ranger.
   Wellman hopes to reach the top around noon Wednesday, making him
the first paraplegic to make the climb, pulling himself up 6 inches
at a time on ropes placed by Corbett.
   Wellman was paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet
during a climb of the 13,700-foot Gables Peak, south of Yosemite,
in 1982. He trained daily for six months for El Capitan, making 35
practice climbs on other sheer rocks and weight training.
   Corbett has a record 41 ascents of El Capitan.
   Corbett's brother, Tony Corbett of Houston, said he had not seen
his brother in eight years before he watched a recent news report
about the attempt to scale El Capitan.
   ``You can just imagine how I felt when I saw him. It's hard to
say. Elation, I guess you could say,'' Corbett said in a telephone
interview.
   Wellman said his powerful hands are swollen but he is not
injured. He anticipated it would take 7,000 pullups to reach the
summit.
   Their biggest problem has been wind, which Wellman said has been
gusting each day, sometimes blowing them 10 feet out from the cliff
face.

<HEAD>`The Lady in Question,' A Comedy by Charles Busch, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There should be no question about ``The Lady in
Question.''
   Charles Busch's latest send-up of American popular culture _
specifically, those patriotic, sentimental war movies of the 1940s
_ is his best work yet, not only as a playwright but as a performer.
   The production, which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Orpheum
Theater, is a giddy, gender-bender comedy that spoofs those
self-sacrificing heroines, square-jawed heroes and sadistic Nazis
who were staples of the silver screen nearly 50 years ago.
   Busch plays Gertrude Garnet, a touring American concert pianist
who finds herself in the Bavarian mansion of the nefarious Baron
Wilhelm Von Elsner. Among the other occupants are the baron's
cigar-smoking momma, a handsome American professor, a pig-tailed
little girl who looks and acts like a Teutonic version of Patty
McCormack in ``The Bad Seed'' and Gertrude's wise-cracking female
sidekick Kitty.
   The convoluted plot involves the rescue of the professor's
mother, a famous actress, from the clutches of the baron. And it's
Gertrude who must do most of the work. She _ and Busch _ are up to
the task.
   From his hugely successful _ and still running _ ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom'' to ``Pyscho Beach Party'' to ``The Lady in
Question,'' Busch always has played the leading female role in his
plays. Why not? They are tailored to his talent.
   The actor, sporting long red tresses and a different glamorous
outfit for every scene, resembles Joan Crawford, with bits of Norma
Shearer, Greer Garson, Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis and even Greta
Garbo thrown in for effect.
   But his acting is more than skin-deep. Busch seems more assured
and less campy in his creation of this real Hollywood heroine. The
writing is also first-rate. There is a consistency of style and
tone, a never-wavering affection for the material. Busch is a
romantic and that love of the movies shows throughout the play.
   He also has been generous in writing good roles for other
members of what has become a resident troupe of players. There are
strong contributions from such regular members as Andy Halliday as
the evil, oversexed child; Arnie Kolodner as Gertrude's true love,
Meghan Robinson as a gorgon of a mother and Julie Halston as
Gertrude's best buddy.
   Director Kenneth Elliott, who also plays the baron, has just as
light a touch as Busch with the material, and there are fine
production values, particularly a throbbing musical soundtrack and
a set of outlandish wigs for Busch designed by Elizabeth Katherine
Carr. ``The Lady in Question'' definitely rates a date.

<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee said Tuesday it
plans to hire the Chicago law firm that conducted the Jim Wright
investigation to review a complaint against Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich.
   The announcement was the latest indication that the panel is
close to approving a formal investigation of the Georgia
Republican, who arranged a controversial investment partnership to
promote a book he co-authored.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., accused Gingrich in a complaint
last April of violating campaign finance laws, House limits on
outside income and a House rule preventing acceptance of gifts from
those with a direct interest in legislation.
   Gingrich, the second-ranking House GOP leader, said last week
that Richard J. Phelan, the chief attorney in the Wright
investigation, ``strikes me as an honorable man. The committee has
to look at what the standard is for hiring an outside counsel and
do what it thinks is right.''
   He called Alexander's charges ``baseless,'' and said ``any
serious review of the allegations would indicate how politically
motivated they were.''
   Gingrich filed the complaint that helped launch the
investigation of then-Speaker Wright, D-Texas. Wright quit as
speaker and resigned from the House after the committee charged him
with 69 rules violations.
   In a statement Tuesday, Gingrich reviewed his votes and
statements in the Wright case and other congressional ethics cases
of his 1 years in the House and said in light of those positions,
``I have always know that any complaint filed against me would
receive intense scrutiny, even if unfounded. I will cooperate fully
with the committee to expedite this matter.''
   The ethics panel said it asked the House Administration
Committee to approve a contract with the firm of Phelan, Pope &amp;
John Ltd. Phelan was the chief attorney in the investigation of
Wright, and several associates assisted him.
   Phelan has told reporters that his personal time in a new
investigation would be more limited than in the Wright case, but
added the associates could do the work. Phelan also has dropped
hints that he's considering running in the Illinois Democratic
gubernatorial primary next March.
   ``I would assume Mr. Phelan would be part of the legal team,
even though the contract is with the law firm,'' said Ralph Lotkin,
chief counsel for the ethics committee.
   Last Thursday, the ethics panel held its first meeting since the
Wright investigation but made no immediate decision on launching a
preliminary inquiry of Gingrich _ the first step in a formal
investigation.
   The ethics panel said Tuesday: ``The legal assistance would be
for the specific purpose of providing the committee with an
analysis of the complaint and associated materials. The committee
has every expectation that the proposed contract with Phelan, Pope
&amp; John, Ltd. will be approved and that, as soon as this occurs, the
law firm will immediately begin its review.''
   Gingrich admittedly has been seeking advice from a number of
allies, and reportedly has approached former Rep. Ed Bethune, an
Arkansas Republican with a law practice in Washington, for help.
   Alexander's complaint focused on the ``COS Limited
Partnership,'' which consisted of 21 investors who contributed
$5,000 each to promote ``Window of Opportunity,'' a book written by
Gingrich, his wife and a third author. Gingrich was not an
investor, but his wife was paid for running the partnership, formed
in 1984.
   The Alexander complaint contends:
   _The investors' money could be construed as income to Gingrich,
in violation of limitations on House members' outside earnings.
   _The $105,000 raised could constitute a gift to Gingrich from
those with a direct interest in legislation. House rules prohibit
members from keeping gifts of more than $100 from anyone with such
an interest.
   _The money could be considered campaign contributions, subject
to reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign financing
laws. If so, Alexander said, the investment money may have exceeded
contribution limits and may not have been properly reported.

   Ecuadoran authorities held an Eastern Airlines
jetliner and detained its crew after discovering cocaine aboard the
aircraft, the company said Tuesday.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the crew members were told
by Ecuadoran authorities to remain at their hotel in Guayaquil
until Ecuadoran investigators take their depositions. The
investigation was delayed by Simon Bolivar Day festivities, he
added.
   Eastern Flight 51, an A-300, left Miami on Monday on a multileg
flight to Ecuador, Matell said. He said the plane was carefully
checked in Miami, but he noted it was on the ground 43 minutes in
Cali, Colombia, before heading to Guayaquil.
   In Guayaquil, authorities found six packets of cocaine hidden
below the floor of a lavatory, Matell said. Initial company reports
on the incident said three passengers were arrested, but Matell
said Tuesday night he had no information to confirm that.
   Ecuadoran customs officials found that the six packets each
contained 2.2 pounds of cocaine, said Customs Capt. Nilo Montalvo.
   It was the sixth shipment of cocaine found aboard an Eastern
jetliner by drug agents in Ecuador since December, authorities
there said. No Eastern crew members have been arrested in the cases.
   According to reports from anti-drug agents, Guayaquil has become
a ``bridge'' preferred by Colombian drug gangs for sending cocaine
to United States.
   Eastern canceled a return flight Tuesday and will send a new
plane and crew to Guayaquil on Wednesday to resume service. The
multileg flight that also includes Panama flies three times weekly
from Miami, Matell said.
   Matell said several planes have been temporarily impounded in
the last two months, but he said he didn't think the incidents were
related to the strike that began March 4 by Eastern's unions.
   ``This is something we've been battling for a long, long time,''
Matell said. ``No individual company has the resources to shut off
the flow of drugs from South America.''
   Eastern earlier this month was chastised by Perry Rivkind, Miami
district director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, for several recent cases in which Cuban nationals without
legal documents arrived in this country on Eastern's Latin American
routes to Miami. Eastern said that, too, was a traditional problem
on those routes.
   Eastern has reportedly been negotiating to sell its Latin routes
to American Airlines as part of Eastern's efforts to emerge from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization as a smaller, more-efficient
carrier.

   U.S. military authorities restricted
the movements of a Soviet delegation taking part in an Eskimo
conference, participants were told Tuesday.
   The U.S. military told the 18 Soviet delegates to remain in
their hotel during a Sunday night stop at Soendre Stroemfjord, a
U.S. base in Greenland, said the Soviets and the conference
president. Delegates from Alaska and Canada were allowed to move
around the base.
   Canadian Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, said the incident was unfortunate.
   ``The Soviets are equal participants in our congress and should
have been treated that way. ''
   The Soviets are attending the conference for the first time. The
other delegates are from Canada, Alaska and Greenland. The 500
participants represent the world's more than 100,000 Arctic natives.
   Tuesday was the second day of the weeklong conference, being
held in Sisimiut, a town of 5,000 people on Greenland's east coast.
   Ms. Simon, an Inuit from Quebec, told the conference that
self-government remains a vitally important question for the Inuit
_ or Eskimo _ people.
   Greenland has enjoyed home rule since 1979. But in Canada, the
issue is one of acute concern, and negotiations with the Canadian
government are proceeding slowly, Ms. Simon said.
   In Alaska, the Native Land Claims Settlement of 1971 did nothing
to address the issue of self-government, she said.

   The Soviets are showing extraordinary interest
in the spy investigation against State Department official Felix S.
Bloch _ even tailing him and the FBI to New York _ despite a U.S.
warning not to interfere.
   The unusual Soviet surveillance shows ``they have a lot invested
in this,'' said a government source familiar with the case.
   The United States cautioned the Soviet Union against trying to
smuggle Bloch out of the country, it was learned Monday evening.
The warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the
30-year career diplomat was suspected of spying.
   Still, Bloch and a caravan of FBI agents were followed by Soviet
Embassy personnel on Saturday from Washington to a New York City

   Time Inc. took control of Warner
Communications and began forming the world's largest media and
entertainment concern after a court refused a final bid by
Paramount Communications Inc. to block the merger.
   A three-justice panel of the Delaware Supreme Court on Monday
upheld a ruling that denied an injunction sought by Paramount to
stop Time's $14 billion offer for Warner. The ruling affirmed the
right of corporate directors to decide the course of their
companies in the face of hostile bids.
   After the ruling, Paramount abandoned its $200-a-share, $12.2
billion hostile takeover offer for Time.
   Within hours, Time said it had received 100 million shares of
Warner at the close of its tender offer, raising Time's stake to 58

   The government today sought to minimize the impact
of its political troubles on foreign relations with assurances that
planned diplomatic contacts will go ahead, including the defense
chief's visit to Washington.
   But some analysts warned of trouble in foreign economic affairs
and said the growing influence of opposition parties could make
Japan's trade policy more protectionist.
   The governing Liberal Democrats' hard loss in parliamentary
elections, followed by Prime Minister Sousuke Uno decision to
resign after less than two months in office, could seriously erode
the party's ability to set policy.
   Uno's decision Monday means his Cabinet also will resign, but
not until the Liberal Democrats find a new leader, which is
expected to take several weeks as no obvious candidate was in sight.

the most junior member of her Cabinet, John Major, into the
prestigious office of foreign secretary, making him a prime
contender to succeed her.
   The appointment Monday of Major, the 46-year-old son of a
trapeze artist, was the boldest move in Mrs. Thatcher's biggest
government shake-up since she took office in 1979.
   Worried about her Conservative Party government's sliding
popularity, Mrs. Thatcher named new appointees to more than half

   If Jackie Mason can translate his ability to
boil things down to their barest basics, he might have a hit show
on ABC this fall.
   Stars and producers have been sitting in news conferences
answering questions from the 100-plus television critics who are
meeting here to preview 1989-90 programming.
   One TV critic asked Mason whether his ``Chicken Soup,'' with its
heavy emphasis on the ethnicity of its star, would play in the
Midwest.
   ``I don't see why I have to answer to you,'' said Mason, one of
the many times he cracked up the audience.
   In fact, Mason had flown in from Washington to help promote his
new show. Mason won a Tony for his one-man show on Broadway, and
now, he's hooked up with Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, executive
producers of ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Roseanne'' to create a new
sitcom.
   Mason plays a character very much like himelf, an aging Jewish
bachelor. He lives with his mother and is conducting a secret
affair with a Catholic neighbor, played by Lynn Redgrave, who has
several children.
   With Mason holding court, the news conference took on aspects of
a nightclub performance. Even Redgrave got into the act when she
was asked what it was like working with Mason.
   ``Well, I've worked with a few comedians in my day, and I must
say that usually I've understood why they mostly work alone,'' she
said.
   Mason, however, is ``a rarity,'' she added. ``And when I met
him, I realized I was deeply in love with him, and we're planning
to run away.''
   As to the more serious question of whether a mass audience will
take to a sitcom about a very Jewish man who performs monologues on
his roof, and a very Catholic woman with an Irish brogue, Mason
insisted viewers would take to the show.
   He noted he has spent a career performing his stand-up act in
the Midwest as well as elsewhere, and he found no communication
problem.
   ``It's all pure nonsense in my opinion, because all my life as a
comedian, I've been watching gentiles laughing at my humor, and I'm
watching Jews tell me, yech, it's a little too Jewish,'' he said.
   Although he performs a monologue at the beginning and end of the
show, Mason said he found the sitcom format a much more disciplined
structure than he is used to. ``I have very limited experience in
the field of any kind of precise comedy,'' he said. ``I only did a
couple of cockamamie movies that didn't go anyplace.''
   Nevertheless, ABC is taking a chance that Mason will make the
same kind of splash that two other comedians, Bill Cosby and
Roseanne Barr, have made in Carsey-Werner productions.
   Werner said that the two have not seized on a formula here, but
simply saw Mason as an appealing performer. ``We felt that Jackie
Mason is a comedian who, onstage and in his act, he tells the
truth. And he pierces hypocrisy. And he has observations not just
about Jews and gentiles, but about the way the world is that we
found to be perceptive and funny.''
   Mason said he had been offered a number of television
opportunities since his Broadway show became a big hit. He picked
Carsey and Werner because he knew they were successful, and because
they had hired two writers whose work he liked on ``The Redd Foxx
Show,'' Saul Turteltaub and Bernard Orenstein.
   ``So when they told me Turtelbaum (sic) and Orenstein, I said,
`Oy! These same writers from the Foxx show.' And these guys (Carsey
and Werner) with three big hits (they also have ``A Different
World''). And now I didn't care if I liked them personally or
not,'' Mason said. ``I didn't care if they were Jewish or gentile.
I didn't care if they were American citizens. I didn't care if they
were spies from Africa. I didn't care of they came down to burn
down my building. I figured these are the people.''
   Someone asked Carsey how she and Werner are so successful at
creating sitcoms. She noted that she and Werner had been in the
business for years and had failed often enough in the past. ``I was
trying to explain to Jackie on the way down in the elevator. He
asked me, `Why do you guys think that you know what they like out
there?' We said, `Well, you know, for the same reason you know what
joke is going to work.' You do it for lots and lots of years.''
   Carsey said basically, however, success is a result of
identifying with the audience. ``So if we like what we're doing, we
sort of assume that millions of people out there might have the
same feeling about what we're doing.''
   ``But if it's that simple,'' wondered Mason, ``how come it took
you this long to learn it?''
   ``Chicken Soup'' will premiere this fall on ABC.

<HEAD>Like All Real Estate Markets, Condo And Coop Markets Are Cyclical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some parts of the country sellers of housing
condominiums and cooperatives are losing patience with a market so
inert it barely supports hope.
   But don't give up, says an authority on the subject. The condo
concept remains alive and well and is destined to remain a vital
and desirable part of America's housing markets.
   The problem, if there is one in your area, probably arises from
a frenzy of building that left a glut on the market, or because
comparable rental housing is priced competitively.
   Another factor hurting some markets is that investors who bought
co-ops to rent out just a few years ago began dumping them when the
tax laws were changed in 1986 to limit the deductibility of
interest and other costs.
   The selling problems that exist, particularly in the Northeast,
probably have little to do with the desirability of condo or co-op
living but a lot to do with temporary, cyclical market factors.
   Paul Low, president of Lomas Mortgage USA, surveyed the condo
market for U.S. Housing Markets, an expensive publication
circulated among real estate and construction people, and found
many reasons for optimism.
   First, he said, there is evidence of increased acceptance. Each
generation has more members who have grown up in high-density
environments, more who have lived in or near large-scale
multifamily housing, he says.
   Such accommodations, he says, are gaining acceptability ``both
socially and psychologically.''
   Affordability plays a big role. Condo units often are more
affordable, the main reason being the reduced cost of land per
unit, or the fact that more attached than detached units can be
placed on a similar plot.
   Often, the condo is well-located too. While Americans might
still like to live in the wide open spaces, they usually aren't
lucky enough to find such ideals close to their work. Condos often
are closer to employment centers.
   Time seems to be a factor in the condo's favor, although it
wasn't always viewed that way. Conventional wisdom in the 1970s had
America advancing toward the four-day workweek, amid speculation on
how leisure time would be spent.
   It hasn't worked out that way. Says Low: ``Instead of lingering
in gourmet kitchens, we sprint to and from the microwave. Instead
of lazily tending our rose gardens, we hire landscape crews just to
keep our lawns mowed.''
   Demographics favor condos. For double-income couples and working
singles the idea of caring for a sprawling ranch on a large
suburban lot sounds onerous. For them, such a house means work _
the same thing they do all day.
   But that isn't the only demographic factor. Low observes that
the proportion of never-married men in the traditional first-time
homebuying age group has grown even faster than that of women. He
offers these statistics:
   Never-married men constituted 77.7 percent of the 20-24 age
group in 1988, up nine percent from 1980. In the 25-29 age group,
the percentage was 43.3 percent, up about 10 percent from 1980. And
in the 30-34 age category the share of never-married males grew
nine percent.
   That, he says, translates to more solo homeowners and potential
homeowners who, because of various factors, are inclined toward
buying convenience rather than responsibilities and chores in
housing.
   Divorce plays a role. Single parents, male and female, are a
fast-growing group. Security is important too. Social factors also;
singles and newlyweds may like to mingle, perhaps at the swimming
pool that some condos offer.
   Encouraging also for those enduring the tortures of down markets
is an item from the National Association of Realtors showing that
on a national basis existing condos and co-ops have been
appreciating faster than detached units.
   That trend, in fact, has existed since 1986. Last year, condo
and co-op prices rose 6.8 percent nationally, compared with 4.3
percent for one-family detached houses.
   So, if you, the seller, live in one of those pockets of inertia
where nobody bids on your co-op or condo unit, don't lose patience.
While singular factors could be involved, more likely the problem
relates to the market cycle.

   ``People seem to have a high sense of drama about me. Maybe they
can enjoy my music more if they think I'm destroying myself.'' _
Janis Joplin.

<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hair bristling about her shoulders in an untidy
nest, the blowsy high priestess of the blues stumbled to the stage,
spitting and cursing. With two whiskey bottles in each hand, Janis
Joplin faced Woodstock Nation like a drunken gunslinger.
   Even through her fog, she knew she didn't like this gig. No way,
no how. Too many people. Hippies, she managed to slur to the
audience at the Woodstock festival on Aug. 16, 1969, had become a
``whole new minority.''
   Many of the performances at Woodstock were disappointing or
strange or just plain bad, but Joplin's was all three.
   ``She was tortured and crying in the microphone,'' recalls Henry
Diltz, the official Woodstock photographer, in ``Woodtock: The Oral
History,'' a recently published book by Joel Makower.
   ``I don't know really how to describe her. I mean, she really
screamed in agony in those songs. She really meant it. You could
see that in the way she contorted her face and her body and
everything.''
   John Morris, production coordinator for the concert, summed up:
``It was an awful performance.''
   Joplin had been partying strong since her arrival in the Bethel
area. She hung out with Country Joe McDonald at the Holiday Inn
dining room, and they turned it into a bar. She and Country Joe had
once been lovers, and he wrote and performed ``Janis,'' a song
about their romance.
   ``When she walked offstage ... she went into a tent and, I am
sure, shot up instantly,'' recalls Myra Friedman, Joplin's
biographer, in ``Woodstock.''
   ``So it was sad. And her behavior that weekend was indicative of
her depression and addiction and booze. The other thing was that
Janis was not real thrilled by the size of that crowd at all.
   ``She said, `I can't relate to a quarter of a million people.' ''
   Joplin had been in the business barely three years, and when she
hit Woodstock, she was somebody. A personality. A happening. A
rock-blues star who raked in $30,000 for every concert appearance.
And also by Woodstock, she'd had three years of boozing, drugging
and burning out.

   ``When I get scared and worried, I tell myself, `Janis, just
have a good time.' So I juice up real good and that's what I have.''

   A homely soul from Port Arthur, Texas, Joplin took her talent
and guts on the road and hitchhiked with her three-octave voice to
San Francisco just in time for the flowering of Haight-Ashbury.
   She strutted through clubs in North Beach, and on June 11, 1966,
the 23-year-old whiskey-soaked mama from the little Texas town
joined Big Brother and The Holding Company, the house band at San
Francisco's Avalon Ballroom, on stage.
   ``I couldn't believe it _ all that rhythm and power,'' Joplin
later recalled. ``I got stoned just feeling it, like it was the
best dope in the world. It was so sensual, so vibrant, loud, crazy.
   ``I couldn't stay still. I had never danced when I sang, but
there I was moving and jumping. I couldn't hear myself, so I sang
louder and louder. By the end, I was wild.''
   The Avalon is gone now. So is Joplin. She was found at the
Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles four years after her debut with Big
Brother, fresh needle marks in her arm. The coroner's report called
it an accidental overdose of heroin.
   From that day in June until her death Oct. 4, 1970, Joplin
grabbed a generation and held it in her thrall with her raspy,
plaintive voice, her coarse vulnerablitity and her tough
independence.
   A self-avowed beatnik _ not, she would caution, a hippie _ she
became an icon for the Woodstock generation. Hippies, she said,
believed the world could be a better place. ``Beatniks believe
things aren't going to get better ... and say to hell with it, stay
stoned and have a good time.''
   Fame came fast for Joplin. It happened the moment she screamed
her way through Josh White's ``Ball and Chain Blues'' at the
Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967.
   Joplin loved the blues, and her personal hero was Bessie Smith.
On Aug. 8, 1970, she bought a headstone for Smith's grave at the
Mount Lawn cemetery in Philadelphia. The great blues singer died in
1937 after being refused admission to a whites-only hospital.
   ``Black people have the blues because they can't have this and
they can't have that,'' Joplin once said. ``Me, I was brought up in
a middle-class family; I could have had anything. But you need
something more in your gut, man.''
   She covered many artists' songs, including Barry and Robin
Gibb's ``To Love Somebody,'' and Rodgers and Hart's ``Little Girl
Blue.'' But she also wrote songs, including ``Mercedes-Benz,'' and
with organist Gabriel Mekler, ``Kozmic Blues.''

   ``Time keeps moving on
   ``Friends, they keep moving on or turn away
   ``But I never find out why ...
   ``I keep trying to make it right to another day.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Joplin released the ``Cheap Thrills'' LP in 1968 with Big
Brother. She left the band later that year because they just
``weren't growing together anymore.''
   Then The Kozmic Blues Band was formed in 1969, and disbanded
shortly after their one LP, ``I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again
Mama!'' shot to the top of the charts.
   Joplin appeared with Big Brother at Fillmore West and Winterland
in 1969 before putting together her new group, the Full-Tilt Boogie
Band.
   At the time of her death, she was working on a new LP. ``Pearl''
was drawn from unfinished sessions and released in February 1971.
It had the plaintive ``Cry Baby'' and Kris Kristofferson's ``Bobby
McGee'' with its telling refrain: ``Freedom's just another word for
nothin' left to lose.''
   Freedom was hard for Joplin to define. She had fame, she had
talent, she had a lot of time and independence. But she was lonely.
   ``Somehow you lose all the old friends,'' she said. ``The travel
circumstances pull them away. It's hard to make new ones. When
we're not onstage, we rehearse, lay around in bed, check in and out
of motels, watch television. It really is lonely.
   ``I live for that one hour on stage. It's full of feeling. It's
more exciting than you'd expect in a lifetime. It's a rush, honey.''

   Vincent escaped into the depths beneath New
York City with Catherine not far behind screaming his name when
CBS' ``Beauty and the Beast '' ended its second season.
   Despite the cliffhanger, the contemporary fantasy was not on
CBS' schedule for the fall season and for a short time it appeared
Vincent might never surface again.
   ``CBS has ordered 12 new episodes,'' said Ron Perlman, who stars
as the half-man, half-beast Vincent.
   ``The last we heard, CBS said: Be ready to go back on the air as
soon as possible. So, we're going back into production at the same
time we would if we had been renewed for the fall schedule.''
   CBS said the show will be back on sometime in the 1989-90
season. But fans, having heard the same assurances from CBS before
regarding ``Frank's Place'' was cancelled, are expressing their
support for more ``Beauty'' in the near future.
   ``We're letting people know that Viewers for Quality Television
stands ready to channel the passion and enthusiasm for the show,''
said Dorothy Swanson, VQT director, by telephone from Fairfax, Va.
``There is a huge grass roots movement for this show. We don't want
to call anything we're doing campaign and we discourage talk of a
boycott. We should keep our support positive.''
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' is being supported by at least 36 fan
clubs, 65 amateur-published magazines and 40 newsletters, according
to Kimberly Hartman of Fullerton, Ca., who operates Helpers
Network. The network coordinates support from Canada, England and
West Germany.
   ``We knew there'd be a major confrontation over not renewing the
show,'' said Perlman. ``But we went from not being on the schedule
at all to doing 12 shows. That's something.''
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' has not done well in the ratings. In
its most recent appearance for the week ended July 16 it was in
73rd place. But like ``Frank's Place,'' the show has an audience
that is vocal in its loyalty.
   At the core of ``Beauty and the Beast'' is the idyllic love that
develops between Vincent, the man-beast who lives beneath the city,
and Catherine Chandler, the socialite, crime-fighting attorney
whose life is saved by Vincent.
   The show also stars Linda Hamilton as Catherine, Roy Dotrice as
Father, a brilliant recluse who also lives under the city, and Jay
Acovone as Catherine's associate in the district attorney's office.
   The theme is one that goes back to pagan times and has appeared
often in literature, such as ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,''
``Phantom of the Opera'' and the classic children's story, ``Beauty
and the Beast.''
   ``The show has many attractions,'' said Perlman, ``not the least
of which is what Vincent has gone through in his own life and that
hold him back and limit him. He can see other people's struggles.
He is a champion of the underdog. He gives people his undivided
attention.
   ``He has an enormous physical presence that is at once repelling
and magnetic. He's from a time gone by. His thirst for things of
innate beauty is of the Renaissance. People know that time spent
with this character is time spent with truth and beauty. He is the
unattainable love.''
   Perlman said he believes that CBS has not promoted or publicized
the show in the best manner. ``If I was handling this show I'd have
a field day,'' he said. ``Here's a show with a concept that is so
totally different from anything else on television. You have a
character who's unique and larger than life and straight out of
mythology.
   ``Instead, the show's been promoted like it was just another
sitcom. It makes you wonder if someone is at home. I don't want to
sound like sour grapes, but I would have worked a little harder to
point out the speciality of it.''
   When the part was first offered to Perlman two years ago he
nearly turned it down. He had recently completed a role as a
hunchback in ``The Name of the Rose'' and before that had been a
prehistoric man in ``Quest for Fire.'' He did not want to do any
more roles requiring elaborate makeup, but said he was won over as
soon as he read the pilot script.
   Despite the makeup, Perlman is being recognized more and more by
fans.
   ``I have a high profile due to television,'' he says. ``I don't
mind being successful but I hate being famous. Life is hard enough
without the burden of fame. It limits your choices. So many aspects
of your life then are out of your control.''
   Perlman had been on the New York stage and in regional theater
and made two films in Europe. His first movie here was ``The Ice
Pirates.'' Last year he was in the TV movie ``A Stoning in Fulham
County.'' He played a member of an Amish family that was being
persecuted.
   He also has a record album out on which he reads poems while the
theme of ``Beauty and the Beast'' plays in the background. So far
more than 250,000 albums have been sold. It's an outgrowth of the
poems that Vincent reads on the series.

   To many of the Amish who inhabit
northwestern Pennsylvania's countryside, Lucille Sykes is a
godsend, someone they know and trust to help deliver their babies,
one after another, year after year.
   The white-frame, three-room Cradle Time Birthing Clinic in Mrs.
Sykes' backyard was moved there by the Amish after she bought it
from an Amish family that needed a bigger house. Two walls bearing
141 cards with vital statistics and footprints _ the Amish don't
allow photographs _ are records of her work.
   ``It's just a lot more relaxing here at Lucille's,'' 29-year-old
Edna Troyer said one recent afternoon at the clinic made homey by
ruffled curtains, flowered bedsheets, crocheted afghans and
pictures of teddy bears and storks.
   Officials unimpressed by Mrs. Sykes' decade of dedication have
gone to court to stop her from practicing midwifery without a
license. The emotional battle is stirring up normally tranquil
people in normally tranquil parts.
   ``I'm ordinarily not a person to get out and demonstrate or
anything like that. That's not my making,'' said Mrs. Sykes. ``But
I believe that what I'm doing is right and I believe that in order
to have freedom, I guess we have to fight for it. They've touched
something that's very dear to my heart and that has been my life.''
   Her Amish friends and neighbors have been similarly moved. They
have set up a legal defense fund and are voicing
uncharacteristically loud concern.
   ``We don't think she's doing anything wrong. We think she's
doing a good job. She's got the skill already. They probably can't
tell her anything she doesn't know,'' said Daniel Byler, 31, of New
Wilmington.
   Four of Byler's six children were delivered by Mrs. Sykes.
   ``Nobody's out to hurt her, and I'm glad, because she's not a
bad woman. She's a nice person. She means well, she really does.
(But) she's violating the law,'' said Mercer County Children and
Youth Services director Gene Montone.
   Montone says he is bound by law to protect children and that
includes ``improving newborn rights.'' He initiated an
investigation of Mrs. Sykes in the spring after an anonymous
complaint. A criminal charge of unlawful practice was filed against
her for delivering Byler's daughter, Sylvia, on March 23, but was
dropped at a May magistrate's hearing attended by several hundred
Amish.
   ``How can we go forward if we don't have a clear definition of
midwifery?'' District Justice Joseph Gabany asked. ``The press
recently picked up on a 6-year-old who delivered his brother. Is
that midwifery? A taxi driver who delivers a baby in a taxi, is
that a midwife?''
   Undaunted, the state Board of Medicine is seeking an injunction.
   ``The overriding premise here is that the state Board of
Medicine believes people in the business of delivering babies
should be qualified and licensed,'' said Kathy Liebler, a
spokeswoman for the Department of State, which oversees the
11-member medical board.
   Under Pennsylvania law, midwives must be licensed as registered
or graduate nurses who have completed a midwifery course and passed
a state exam. The state has record of 131 licensed midwives.
Montone is recommending one to the Amish.
   ``I don't like to disobey the state's laws at all. But I do
think this is very unnecessary,'' said an Amish bishop who spoke on
condition his name not be used. ``I don't understand why the state
is so concerned with this because they're doing these abortions and
all that kind of crap.
   ``They don't care to murder do they? Why are they so concerned
with this?''
   A determined Mrs. Sykes and the Pennsylvania Midwives
Association are pushing for legislation to recognize the state's 40
to 50 lay midwives. A local grange has joined the cause, denouncing
the ``harassment'' of Mrs. Sykes.
   About 15 states have laws that recognize midwives other than
nurses, although licensing requirements vary, said Sandra Botting,
president of the Midwives Alliance of North America. Of 4,000 to
5,000 practicing midwives in the United States and Canada, about
two-thirds are nurses.
   ``Midwifery is an accepted profession throughout the world. It's
only here that we're having this struggle and it's ridiculous,''
Ms. Botting said.
   Mrs. Sykes began studying under an Amish midwife in eastern
Ohio's Holmes County in 1976. She was encouraged by local Amish,
who have no religious qualms about hospitals but prefer more
natural home deliveries. Cost is also a factor. Mrs. Sykes, for
instance, charges $450 per delivery and in some hardship cases has
accepted bartered goods such as quilts and a porch swing.
   Every other weekend for two years, she traveled from her home
outside Stoneboro to Ohio to train. She struck out on her own in
1978, when an Amish couple called and asked if she would assist in
the birth of their child.
   Mrs. Sykes delivered four babies the first year, 11 the next and
22 the year after that. As of July 17, she had delivered 632 babies
at the clinic or mothers' homes. Virtually all were Amish. None
were stillborn.
   ``The mothers are doing the delivering themselves,'' she said.
``I'm there to monitor, to make sure everything's all right.''
   Last year, Mrs. Sykes sent four mothers to the hospital before
delivery. Two were breech deliveries, with one of the babies dying
shortly after. Another baby was born face first and delivered by
Caesarean section, as with any first-time mother whose cervix
failed to dilate properly.
   Mrs. Sykes sent only one newborn to the hospital in 1988, for
fear the lungs were underdeveloped, but the infant proved to be
fine. She has sent no mothers or babies to the hospital this year,
although two infants later needed treatment, one for spina bifida
and the other for internal deformities.
   ``Once in a while I do have problems,'' she said. ``This is one
reason why I say I need the doctors. I need the hospital once in a
while. But generally speaking, if you're careful to screen your
mothers, you take good, healthy mothers, you're going to have good,
healthy deliveries.''
   Mrs. Sykes is proud of her record: The cards on her clinic walls
represent 110 births in 1988 and 34 as of July 17 this year.
   The small birthing room contains a hospital bed, oxygen tank,
stethoscope, fetalscope, blood-pressure monitor, changing table and
a lava lamp for mental relaxation. In the large outer room are twin
beds with cribs at the foot of each, an incubator, kerosene stove,
air conditioner, couch and kitchen.
   When Edna Troyer visited recently, with her husband, Daniel, in
their horse-drawn buggy, it was to announce that their eighth baby
was due any day. ``I didn't know if you were legal,'' she told Mrs.
Sykes. ``What would I do?''
   Mrs. Sykes is back in business, for now, after refusing to see
pregnant women for the five weeks charges were pending. ``It feels
so right working with them. It feels so good. But when you pick up
a newspaper, it feels so wrong.''
   She acknowledges she could go to nursing school now that her
three children are grown, ``but at 48 that doesn't look attractive
to me.
   ``I'd just as soon they leave me alone and let me go on just
like I have been. It will never be the same again, I'm sure. I just
don't think my life will ever be the same again.''

<HEAD>EEC Approves $120 Million Food Aid Package For Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture ministers representing the
12 nations of the European Economic Community have approved a $120
million food aid program for Poland, which has been hard hit by
food shortages.
   The ministers agreed Monday to draw grains, meat, olive oil and
citrus fruit from surplus stocks to send to Poland this year and
next.
   The emergency food aid, approved by the EEC agriculture
ministers, includes 500,000 tons of wheat for bread, 300,000 tons
of feedgrains, 10,000 tons of meat, 5,000 tons of olive oil and
20,000 tons of citrus fruits. Other products could be added later.
   The community estimated shipment costs at $16 million to $22
million.
   Also on Monday, 23 countries have been invited to meet Aug. 1 to
draft plans for a special program to encourage economic reforms in
Poland and Hungary, the EEC said.
   The conference will be held in response to a request by
President Bush and other Western leaders to come up with a way to
help the two East European countries.
   At the economic summit meeting in Paris, Bush and the leaders of
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan urged emergency
shipments of food to Poland and longer term help for both Poland
and Hungary.
   The Western leaders want to encourage more open political and
economic systems in those countries, without angering the Soviet
Union.
   A Common Market spokesman said officials attending next week's
conference in Brussels will discuss steps to expand trade and
economic cooperation with Hungary and Poland and spur those
governments to take measures to restructure their ailing economies.
   The spokesman said the community had sent out invitations to 18
European countries as well as the United States, Canada, Japan, New
Zealand and Australia. It was not expected that officials from
Poland and Hungary would attend.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had appealed to Bush and
other Western leaders for a multibillion-dollar aid package in the
next two years.
   He asked for $1 billion to restructure food supplies, $2 billion
in new loans and additional financing for other projects. He also
asked the leaders to reduce and stretch out payments on Poland's
foreign debt of $39 billion.
   In a separate development, a delegation from Poland opened what
is expected to be a final round of negotiations on a trade and
economic cooperation agreement with the EEC.
   The pact would be the latest in a series of trade agreements the
community has worked out with East European nations. It previously
signed a trade and cooperation accord with Hungary.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will begin producing a small
sport-utility vehicle in its Toledo, Ohio, plant in mid-1993, an
automotive trade journal reported.
   Ward's Automotive Reports quoted sources Monday as saying
Chrysler's Stickney Avenue plant would be the site for production
of the `JJ,'' a vehicle the company plans to build in a joint
venture with the French automaker Renault.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca announced both the joint venture
and the ``JJ'' project earlier this year. He said some of the
vehicles would be made in Europe and some would be made in North
America but declined to be more specific.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart declined to comment on the
Ward's report.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. and Ashland Oil Inc. said their profits fell in the
latest quarter while Atlantic Richfield Co. and Amerada Hess Corp.
reported net income gains.
   Amoco, based in Chicago, said Monday its net income in the three
months ended June 30 tumbled 25.5 percent to $497 million, or 96
cents a share, from $667 million, or $1.30 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $6.8 billion from $6.1 billion
a year earlier.
   Excluding special charges of $36 million in the second quarter
and $136 million in one-time gains in the year-earlier period,
Amoco's earnings were flat at about $530 million, the company said.
   Arco, based in Los Angeles, reported net income of $467 million,
or $2.66 a share, a 16.7 percent increase from the $400 million, or
$2.19 a share, earned in the same period last year. Revenue dropped
to $4.3 billion from $4.6 billion.
   Ashland's net income declined 22.8 percent in the quarter to $44
million, or 78 cents a share, from $57 million, or $1.02 a share.
Revenue rose to $2.2 billion from $2.1 billion.
   Amerada Hess reported net income of $133.5 million, or $1.65 a
share, compared with a net loss of $23.5 million, or 29 cents a
share, in the second quarter of 1988. Revenue totaled $1.5 billion,
up 67 percent from $882.8 million.
   Analysts said higher crude oil prices in the quarter contributed
to healthier exploration and production earnings for most oil
companies while squeezing refining margins. Crude prices were up
nearly $3 a barrel during the quarter, compared with the
year-earlier period.
   Much of the higher crude costs were passed on to consumers
through higher gasoline prices, which have skyrocketed since March,
analysts said.
   For companies with foreign operations, the strong dollar also
cut into profit margins as product prices became less competitive
overseas.
   For the first six months of 1989, Amoco's earnings fell 16.2
percent to $955 million, or $1.85 a share, vs. $1.14 billion, or
$2.21 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue totaled $13.3
billion, up from $11.8 billion in the same 1988 period.
   Amoco said a big decline in chemical earnings offset gains in
exploration and production and refining and marketing.
   Analysts said weakness in the chemical sector reflected an
overall softening of the U.S. economy.
   Arco's first half net income nearly doubled to $1.2 billion, or
$6.66 a share, from $801 million, or $4.39 a share. Revenue totaled
$8.3 billion, down from $9.2 billion in the 1988 period.
   Arco said it benefited from higher crude prices, record coal
production, increased domestic gas production and increased
refining and marketing earnings.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Ashland had net
income of $126 million, or $2.26 a share, up 6.8 percent from $118
million or $2.10 a share in the year-earlier period. The 1988
results excluded $40 million, or 71 cents a share, added due to
accounting changes.
   Nine-month revenue for the Ashland, Ky.-based company rose to
$6.2 billion from $6 billion.
   New York-based Amerada Hess said its first-half net income grew
to $353.7 million, or $4.35 a share, from $42.2 million, or 51
cents a share, in the 1988 half. Revenue rose to $2.96 billion from
$2.1 billion a year earlier.
   Exploration and production earnings surged to $28 million from
$1.2 million in the second quarter of 1988, while the company's
refining and marketing sector recovered from a $6.5 million loss
last year to post a $125.5 million profit in the quarter.

   Industry analysts expressed surprise at Exxon
Corp.'s costs for cleaning up the Alaska oil spill, which the
world's largest oil company blamed in part for a $1 billion plunge
in its second-quarter profit.
   ``They're spending close to $40 million a week instead of the
$20 million that they estimated earlier,'' Frank P. Knuettel of
Prudential Bache Securities said Monday after Exxon announced its
earnings.
   Also surprising was that Exxon's results did not provide for an
after-tax credit on the oil spill losses, observers said. The
company has said that it would write off the cleanup expense as a
cost of doing business.
   A bill pending in Congress would ban Exxon from deducting the
costs of the cleanup.
   ``They can still take it later on, but for now it's probably a
politically smart move,'' said Bruce Lazier, an analyst with
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   Exxon said that a special provision in the second quarter for
expenses and insurance claims stemming from the March 24 spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound reduced its net income by $850
million, or 67 cents a share.
   Exxon said its net income fell 87 percent to $160 million, or 13
cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the
comparable 1988 quarter.
   Without the provision, earnings would have declined by 16
percent to $1 billion, due to weaker refining profit margins, a
stronger dollar and the U.S. economic slowdown, Exxon said.
   The New York-based company said the estimated provision includes
$600 million already spent on the cleanup as well as estimated
future outlays but does not include the cost of any lawsuits.
   The provision is in addition to insurance coverage of more than
$400 million that will go toward cleaning up the 11 million gallons
of spilled crude, Exxon said.
   Second-quarter revenue for Exxon rose 9 percent, to $23.6
billion from $21.63 billion.
   So far, 143 suits have been filed against the company _ 138
seeking damages and five derivative suits by shareholders _ in
connection with the spill from a grounded Exxon tanker that fouled
hundreds of miles of water and coastline.
   Environmentalists and a number of government officials have
criticized Exxon's handling of the spill, contending the company
was inadequately prepared for the disaster.
   Alaska officials also were dismayed Monday when the oil company
said it would not change its plan to withdraw its oil spill cleanup
forces from Prince William Sound by mid-September for the winter.
   ``Clean-up of the Alaskan oil spill was Exxon's top priority in
the quarter,'' Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in the
company's earnings statement. ``The magnitude of the required
effort is huge and therefore costly.''
   But Rawl said Exxon's financial position remains strong.
   ``We are continuing to pursue our long-term business strategies
and to implement planned capital programs,'' he said.
   For the first six months of 1989, Exxon's provision for the
Alaska oil spill totaled $880 million, including $30 million
charged in the first quarter. Exxon's earnings totaled $1.4
billion, or $1.12 a share, for the first six months, down 46
percent from $2.66 billion, or $1.96 a share, in the first half of
1988.
   Excluding the spill provision, Exxon's first half earnings were
$2.3 billion, or $1.81 a share, down 13 percent. Revenue for the
first half rose to $45.86 billion from $43.63 billion a year
earlier, a 5 percent improvement.
   Exxon said it increased capital and exploration expenditures
about 22 percent in the quarter to $2.2 billion from $1.8 billion.
   Although second-quarter crude prices were $2.85-a-barrel higher
than a year earlier, earnings from exploration and production
declined by $10 million to $693 million.
   Exxon said higher crude prices were offset by higher foreign
taxes and lower production at its North Sea facilities stemming
from accidents and pipeline problems.
   Refining and marketing earnings declined $49 million from last
year to $232 million, reflecting lower margins in foreign markets
and lack of improvement in U.S. markets compared with a year
earlier.
   Analysts said the dollar's strength against foreign currencies
hurt all oil companies operating overseas. A higher dollar makes
U.S. products more expensive in foreign markets.
   Also, a slowdown in the U.S. economy contributed to lower
earnings in the company's chemicals sector as the price of some
products declined.

<HEAD>Takeover Group Says 99 Percent Of NWA Shares Tendered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment group proposing to buy
Northwest Airlines' parent company for $3.65 billion says it is on
the brink of closing the deal as the airline continues contract
talks with its pilots.
   More than 99 percent of the shares of NWA Inc. have been
tendered to Wings Holdings Inc., Alfred Checchi, the former
Marriott Corp. treasurer who heads the group, said Monday.
   Checchi said his financing was nearly in place and he was
pressing for early termination of the waiting period before
finalizing the deal as required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvement Act. The waiting period is scheduled to
expire Wednesday.
   The Federal Trade Commission did not issue a ruling Monday on
his request.
   The $121-a-share tender offer originally was set to expire at
midnight Friday, but Checchi extended it to 5 p.m. EDT Monday.
David Duffy, a Wings spokesman in New York, said the offer may be
extended again.
   Northwest Airlines' pilots union and NWA resumed contract talks
Monday with the help of Josh Javits, chairman of the National
Mediation Board, the union said. Talks were to continue today.
   An agreement with the pilots is considered crucial to Checchi's
plans to acquire the airline because a strike could impair his
ability to generate enough cash to pay for the acquisition, which
will total more than $4 billion.
   Under federal regulations, if the pilots request that
negotiations be declared at an impasse they could strike after a
30-day cooling-off period.
   Tim Thornton, an NWA vice president and its general counsel,
said the primary issues remaining to be settled include wages, work
rules and job security.
   In another development Monday, the state of North Dakota sued to
block Checchi's bid to buy Northwest, saying the deal would violate
what it called the airline's 1986 promise to avoid excessive fare
increases in the state.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bismarck, contends
that if the sale is consummated, the airline won't be able to pay
off its debts without cutting back service, laying off workers and
raising fares.
   Meanwhile, NWA reported record second-quarter earnings Monday of
$70.8 million, or $2.38 a share. The profit was more than double
that of the second quarter a year ago, when the airline earned
$28.4 million, or 97 cents a share.
   Revenues for the second quarter increased 19.3 percent, from
$1.38 billion in the 1988 period to $1.65 billion, the company said.
   Chairman Steven Rothmeier said passenger traffic increased 16
percent over the second quarter of 1988, with capacity growing 15.6
percent. The airline also experienced a 16.8 percent increase in
freight revenues, from $113.5 million in last year's second quarter
to $132.6 million.
   Earnings for the first half were $83.3 million, or $2.82 a
share, on sales of $3.13 billion. That compared with a $15.1
million net loss for the first six months of 1988, when revenues
were $2.62 billion.

<HEAD>Honeywell Announces Sweeping Plan To Enhance Shareholder Value</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. has announced a sweeping
restructuring in which it will cut 4,000 jobs, retreat from its
$1.4 billion weapons business and provide added cash to
shareholders.
   The changes unveiled Monday will make Honeywell less attractive
to corporate raiders.
   The restructuring will include the sale of a ``substantial
portion'' of the company's 50 percent stake in Yamatake-Honeywell,
a Japanese controls maker. Analysts have valued the holding at
nearly $1 billion.
   Chairman James Renier also said the company will repurchase up
to 10 million shares of its common stock on the open market and
increase the annual dividend by 31 percent, beginning in the fourth
quarter.
   A special cash dividend to shareholders is possible, Renier
said, but did not elaborate. He also predicted a $150 million
improvement in operating profits of remaining businesses over the
next 18 months because of the restructuring.
   Honeywell will focus on its main business of controls, which
range from home thermostats to automation equipment for paper mills
and chemical plants.
   Honeywell stock closed up $3.87{ a share to $89.37{ in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Asked if the restructuring would deter a possible hostile
takeover, Renier said, ``Obviously if you enhance shareholder
value, that's definitely beneficial from that point of view.''
   Honeywell's stock price has risen sharply in the last several
weeks following published reports that General Electric Co. was
considering acquiring the company. General Electric has denied the
rumors, saying it has no interest in Honeywell.
   Takeover speculation sprouted after Honeywell announced a $435
million loss in fiscal 1988. The rumors also were fueled by the
defeat in a proxy fight last year of two takeover defenses proposed
by management.
   The group that led the proxy fight, North American Partners of
Fort Worth, Texas, praised the restructuring move.
   ``This is a new management group determined to get the company
focused in on its real jewels, the controls business,'' said
spokesman Eddie Lampert, whose group owns between 4 percent and 5
percent of Honeywell stock. ``We think the stock will move
significantly higher when they execute the plan.''
   The restructuring is obviously a defensive move, said Kurt
Rivard of Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth Inc. Raiders will be
discouraged because the sale of assets by Honeywell will reduce the
breakup value of the company, Rivard said.
   The increased stock price also would make a takeover more
expensive, said John McManus, a securities analyst with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   But McManus and Rivard said the restructuring won't guarantee
independence to Honeywell.
   ``Renier is making sure the shareholders are rewarded for their
ownership, but it doesn't rule out someone making a run at the
company,'' Rivard said.
   Honeywell intends to reduce its dependence on weapons production
but it will keep its business of making aviation and space
controls, which are sold to the military as well as other
customers, the company said.
   Honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the U.S.
Navy and supplies the U.S. Army with ammunition for tanks,
anti-tank weapons, small air-delivered munitions and mines, said
company spokeswoman Susan Eich.
   Weapon sales last year were about $1.4 billion, or about 20
percent, of Honeywell's $7.1 billion in revenue.
   Overall defense contracting, including the parts such as
avionics that are being kept, totaled 35 to 45 percent of Honeywell
sales last year, Renier said.
   Renier would not say whether a sale of the weapons business is
one of the options being considered, but Defense Department
spokesman Glenn Flood, said Honeywell's contracts could be assumed
by another company that bought the business from Honeywell. Rivard,
the Dain Bosworth analyst, said such a sale could bring the company
about $1 billion.
   The reduction in weapons production will ``proceed over time in
a responsible manner that recognizes the U.S. government's interest
in these businesses so as not to adversely affect national security
interests, our government program obligations, or the value of
these businesses to Honeywell shareholders,'' Renier said.
   Negotiations to sell the company's stake in Yamatake-Honeywell,
which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will begin within a
few days, Honeywell spokeswoman Kathy Tunheim said.
   She would not identify potential buyers. Japanese investors
currently own half of the company, she said.
   Honeywell's restructuring program will include the elimination
of 4,000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300
corporate staff positions targeted in an announcement last month,
Renier said.
   Honeywell currently employs about 78,000 workers. Many of the
job cuts will be made through attrition, but some layoffs will be
necessary, Tunheim said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities are at the highest level since last month.
   The Treasury Department, at Monday's auction, sold $6.6 billion
in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.09 percent,
up from 7.87 percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.73 percent, up

   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.22
percent on June 19 and six-month bills averaged 7.78 percent June
26.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.37 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,795.50, and 8.16 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,609.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.96 percent last

<HEAD>Eight Ohioans Charged With Insider Trading on Revco Buyout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another eight people have been accused of
trading on inside information about the 1986 leveraged buyout of
Revco Drug Stores Inc.
   Two separate civil complaints, filed Monday at federal court in
Cleveland and announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in Washington, charged an Aurora, Ohio, couple and six other
Ohioans with illegal use of insider information.
   That brought to 16 the number of people accused of passing or
trading on confidential corporate information about the Revco deal.
   In May, eight people were accused of securities law violations
involving Revco.
   All of them, including Glenn Golenberg, owner of Golenberg &amp;
Co., a Cleveland investment banking concern, settled various civil
SEC charges without admitting or denying guilt. Golenberg was not
accused of trading on inside information.
   Golenberg &amp; Co. was an adviser to Revco management when it
planned to take over the nation's largest drug store chain.
   One of Monday's complaints charged an administrative assistant
at Golenberg &amp; Co., Shirley Shiffman, and her husband, George, both
of Aurora, Ohio.
   The SEC complaint accused Mrs. Shiffman with passing information
about the then-unpublicized buyout, that she should have kept
secret, to her husband, who allegedly made $46,377 trading Revco
common stock and option contracts.
   ``She intends to defend the suit very vigorously,'' said Mrs.
Shiffman's attorney, Jonathan Eisenberg of Washington.
   Her husband's lawyer, Sheldon Burns of Cleveland, was not in his
office when called for comment.
   In the second complaint, six people also were accused of trading
on non-public Revco information.
   All but one of them, Howard Passov of Pepper Pike, Ohio,
immediately settled the allegations with the SEC without admitting
or denying wrongdoing. They included Passov's father, Daniel, who
agreed to pay a total of $50,911 in fines and restitution.
   The other five agreed to pay fines and restitution ranging from
$4,950 to $39,608.
   Howard Passov's lawyer, Brian Eisenberg of Cleveland, said he
had not yet seen the court papers and could not comment.
   According to the complaint, Howard Passov spoke with Golenberg
before the buyout became public by claiming he had learned of the
matter from Revco Chairman Sidney Dworkin, who led a management
group that purchased the company in December 1986.
   Golenberg allegedly sought Sidney Passov's advice about
Dworkin's reaction to the buyout price. There was no allegation of
wrongdoing by Dworkin in the SEC complaint.
   The complaint alleged that the younger Passov purchased and sold
Revco common stock and shared the information with friends and
relatives.
   The others who settled with the SEC were identified as: J.
Christopher Rodeno, the younger Passov's broker, Bainbridge, Ohio;
one of Rodeno's customers, Marvin I. Block, of Beachwood, Ohio; a
friend of the younger Passov, Vincent S. Giorgi, Kirtland, Ohio;
and his brother, Carmen F. Giorgi, Painesville, Ohio.
   Rodeno, who was an account executive at the brokerage Prescott,
Ball &amp; Turben Inc., agreed to a six-month suspension from the
securities and investment industries.
   The complaint against Golenberg in May did not allege that he
personally profited from the confidential information he had about
Revco, but he agreed to pay $469,763 in civil penalties. He was not
in his Cleveland office when called for comment late Monday.

   A new round of white-collar layoffs
is in store at Chrysler Corp. as the automaker tries to trim costs
in the face of sluggish sales.
   Chrysler confirmed Monday that cuts were planned but it declined
to say how many employees may be affected. Chairman Lee Iacocca is
expected to discuss details of the plan Thursday with hundreds of
Chrysler's top managers.
   Of Chrysler's 123,000 workers, 31,000 are white collar.
   ``Ongoing belt-tightening is simply a way of life as we look for
ways to reduce costs,'' company spokeswoman Karen Stewart said.
   ``It's just a basic competitive action, necessary in an industry
where incentive costs, worldwide excess capacity and increasing
competition have forced structural changes on the auto industry.''
   A company statement said the cuts ``would not impact our
long-range product plan, research-and-development budget or capital
spending program.''
   In late 1987, shortly after Chrysler acquired American Motors
Corp., the company trimmed its salaried work force by about 3,600
people, mostly through early retirement and attrition.
   Chrysler's domestic car and truck sales through July 10 were
running 8 percent below last year's level. Sales for the eight
major domestic makers were 4.4 percent lower than last year.
   Chrysler is expected to report its second-quarter earnings next
week. Wall Street analysts have predicted a slightly better
performance than last year, but held out the possibility that
profits could be lower for the period.

   Iran's non-oil exports rose 25 percent in
the first quarter of the current Iranian year over the same period
last year, Tehran radio reported Tuesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Mahmoud Ardekani,
deputy minister of Economy and Finance and head of Iranian customs,
as saying that Iran has exported more than 243,000 tons of non-oil
goods worth $217 million since the beginning of the Iranian year on
March 21.
   Iran's chief non-oil exports are pistachios, dates, textiles
fine hand-made carpets and other handicrafts.
   The exports are under strict government control to prevent
capital flight in the form of goods.
   Iran has been trying to diversify its sources of foreign
exchange, which so far have been wholly reliant on oil.
   Iran needs foreign exchange to rebuild large sectors of its
industry destroyed in the 8-year war with Iraq, which halted last
August with a United Nations-mediated cease-fire.

<HEAD>ITT Earnings Rise 7 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. said Tuesday that second-quarter
earnings rose 7 percent despite softness in the property and
casualty insurance business, its biggest moneymaker.
   Earnings rose to $244 million, or $1.65 per share, from $228
million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $5.2
billion from $5 billion. Excluding special one-time factors,
earnings would have risen 14 percent, the company said.
   For the first half, ITT said earnings rose 9 percent to $444
million, or $3.05 per share, from $407 million, or $2.82 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $10 billion from $9.5 billion in the
1988 first half.
   An industrywide downturn in property and casualty insurance that
hurt results at The Hartford in the first half is expected to
continue for the rest of the year, ITT said. Sheraton Corp.'s
results worsened slightly from South American foreign-exchange
losses.
   Making up for that were improved results in all the company's
product businesses, including defense technology, automotive, fluid
technology, electronic components and pulp and timber, the company
said.
   Alcatel NV, the European-based telecommunications equipment
maker in which ITT has a 37 percent interest, ``continued to
operate exceptionally well,'' ITT said.
   ITT calculates earnings per share on a fully diluted basis, that
is, if all securities that can be converted into common shares were
converted.

<HEAD>Chairman, Three Directors Resign From Britain's Biggest Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and three other directors of
Britain's largest bank, National Westminster Bank PLC, resigned
today in the aftermath of a government report highly critical of
the bank's actions during Blue Arrow PLC's 1987 takeover of
Manpower Inc.
   The announcement followed the resignations of two other bankers,
which were disclosed Monday.
   The Department of Trade and Industry report, released Thursday,
severely criticized a number of Natwest officials for their conduct
in the unsuccessful $1.4 billion sale of Blue Arrow shares to
existing shareholders.
   The share sale was intended to raise money for the British
employment services company's takeover of Manpower, an American
employment services concern.
   County Natwest Ltd., a unit of Natwest, kept the shares that
didn't sell, but failed to disclose its 13.4 percent holding for
nearly three months, in violation of British regulations.
   Resigning from Natwest were Chairman Lord Boardman; Charles
Green and Terry Green, both deputy chief executives at the bank;
and John Plastow, an executive director and general manager.
   Boardman, who is to remain until Sept. 30, said the resignations
hadn't been forced by the Bank of England, the central bank.
   The report accused the Greens and Plastow of poor conduct and
criticized them for not initiating enquiries on the full extent of
the group's holdings of Blue Arrow shares.
   Boardman wasn't criticized in the report. The chairman, in a
letter to Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said he
was resigning because the report unjustifiably criticized the three
directors.
   ``Lord Boardman felt he could not accept the resignations of
these three loyal colleagues of great integrity and remain,''
Natwest said in a statement. He also was resigning to accept
ultimate responsibility for ``failings'' within part of the banking
group, it said.
   Boardman is to be succeeded by Lord Alexander, currently
chairman of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, who previously was
to have taken over on Jan. 1, after Boardman's planned retirement.
The panel is a regulatory body.
   The bank's board of directors met over the weekend to determine
what action to take.
   The trade department has handed its report over to the Serious
Fraud Office, a unit of London's Metropolitan Police responsible
for investigating and prosecuting financial crimes. Both the Bank
of England and the Securities Association also are studying the
report to consider whether to take action against the individuals
and companies involved.
   Nicholas Wells, then the County Natwest corporate advisor
directly responsible for the sale of Blue Arrow shares, resigned
his most recent post as a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
Barclays said Monday.
   Also on Monday, Natwest said David Reed, managing director for
County Natwest's corporate advisory operations, handed in his
resignation.

<HEAD>Carl's Jr. Founder, Family Settle Insider-Trading Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of the Carl's Jr. restaurant
chain and several members of his family agreed to pay $664,000 to
settle a federal lawsuit charging them with insider trading.
   ``Carl just wanted to get it behind it him for the benefit of
his family and children,'' said Thomas Holliday, Karcher's attorney.
   As part of the agreement, Carl N. Karcher and the six family
members named in the civil lawsuit neither admit nor deny guilt.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed the suit in April
1988. It alleged that several Karcher relatives and one company
executive sold stock in Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. to avoid
losses totaling at least $310,000, in advance of a poor earnings
report in 1984.
   Karcher Enterprises runs 460 Carl's Jr. fast-food outlets in
California and other Western states.
   The settlement requires Karcher, 72, to pay $332,000 for the
amount his family allegedly saved by selling their stock at his
advice. The family members will also pay a total of $332,000 to the
government.
   Details of the agreement were completed Monday in a closed-door
session with U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie.
   In addition to Karcher, also named in the suit were his son,
Jerome Karcher, daughters Barbara Karcher-Garrett, Margaret J.
LeVecke, Catherine Karcher-Everly and Karcher's sons-in-law Daniel
Everly and Donald E. Fergus Jr.
   Alvin DeShano, accounting director at Karcher Enterprises, was
also named in the insider-trading case and was the only defendant
charged with criminal securities fraud. He was found innocent by a
Los Angeles jury last month.
   The terms of the agreement involving the Karcher family were
approved by the SEC several weeks ago, said SEC lawyer John Koutsos.
   Donald F. Karcher, Karcher's brother and the president of
Karcher Enterprises, and six members of his side of the family
agreed last February to pay a total of $187,560 to settle their
part in the civil suit. They also did not admit guilt as part of
the agreement.

<TEXT>
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
have begun forming the world's largest communications concern after
a Delaware court cleared the way for the merger.
   A three-justice panel of the Delaware Supreme Court on Monday
upheld a lower court's decision that denied an injunction sought by
Paramount Communications Inc. to block Time's $14 billion tender
offer for Warner.
   After the ruling, Paramount abandoned its $200-per-share, $12.2
billion hostile takeover attempt of Time.
   After more than two hours of arguments, the state's highest
court upheld a July 14 Chancery Court ruling that said the proposed
Time-Warner merger was the result of long-range planning by the two
company's boards and that Paramount and Time shareholders opposed
to the deal could not interfere.
   ``We find no error of law by the Court of Chancery,'' Justice
Henry R. Horsey ruled from the bench. He said a written opinion
would be issued later.
   Paramount attorney Melvyn Cantor declined to comment on the
ruling.
   Time attorney Robert Joffe praised the decision, saying Delaware
law ``was clearly on our side.''
   The ruling affirmed the rights of corporate directors to decide
the future course of their companies in the face of hostile bids.
It could have widespread importance since more than half of the
Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware, as are Time,
Paramount and Warner.
   Paramount, which announced its hostile takeover attempt seven
weeks ago, said in a statement that it would continue to try to
expand through acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or
partnerships. However, it said it would not make a bid for the new
Time Warner Inc.
   Under its $70-a-share offer, Time was to purchase slightly more
than half of Warner's common stock and exchange a combination of
cash and securities valued at $70 a share for the rest.
   Time's tender offer for Warner expired at 5 p.m. EDT Monday.
   Time said today it had been tendered about 176 million Warner
shares, of which 100 million were accepted for the cash part of the
offer. Time said it now owns 59.3 percent of Warner's stock.
   Checks will be mailed out to shareholders beginning on Monday.
Time has not yet determined the breakdown of the
cash-and-securities portion of the deal, which is expected to take
several months to complete.
   In his earlier ruling, Chancery Judge William T. Allen noted
that the proposed Time-Warner deal was announced in March, three
months before Paramount announced its bid for Time.
   Paramount, however, contended that once Time announced plans to
merge with Warner it effectively placed itself up for sale.
Paramount asserted that under Delaware law, Time then had to
consider Paramount's offer.
   Cantor, the Paramount attorney, argued Monday before the Supreme
Court that Time's board had a duty to inquire into Paramount's
initial $175-a-share buyout offer.
   ``We don't question that Time-Warner is a good deal,'' Cantor
said, but he contended Time shareholders should have been allowed
to vote on whether Paramount was offering a better deal in the
short term.
   Michael Klein, an attorney for major Time shareholders,
including Texas investor Robert M. Bass, said thousands of the
company's stockholders opposed the Time-Warner merger. Klein said
that based on previous Delaware court rulings, the Time board was
obligated to consider Paramount's offer.
   Supreme Court Justice Andrew G.T. Moore interjected, however,
that Klein's argument would make a board hostage ``to anyone who
walked in with a bid,'' regardless of a company's long-range plans.
   The justices asked Time attorney Joffe why Time's tender offer
for Warner _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap merger plan _ was
not submitted to a vote by Time shareholders at the company's
annual meeting in June.
   Joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not
involve the issuing of new Time stock. He also said that after
Paramount announced its bid on June 6, the market for Time stock
was in disarray and the share price was seesawing.
   ``This was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Time and Warner both contended the merger would
give shareholders greater value in the long run than Paramount's
offer.
   After the ruling, Klein said the high court's decision tilted
Delaware law in favor of management. He predicted that attorneys
would advise corporations to develop an ``appearance of a long-term
plan'' to ward off potential takeover bids.
   The ruling was widely expected on Wall Street. Time stock closed
down $1 Monday at $137.50 a share. Warner stock rose $1.62{ to
$66.12{ a share and Paramount rose $1.87{ to $59.37{ a share.
   Time stock, which traded at $126 a share before the Paramount
bid, rose to a high of $182.75 before falling in recent weeks as
investors became increasingly pessimistic about Paramount's chances.

   Thought Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
are proceeding with their merger, the two aren't exactly picking up
where they left off on June 6, when Paramount Communications Inc.
tried to spoil the plan.
   Time and Warner, which originally planned to merge in a stock
swap transaction, revised the deal in response to Paramount's $10.7
billion hostile bid for Time, providing instead for Time to acquire
Warner in a $14 billion, $70-a-share tender offer.
   That offer expired at 5 p.m. Monday, several hours after the
Delaware Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling allowing the
merger to proceed.
   Time said today it had been tendered approximately 176 million
of Warner's 200 million outstanding common shares and now owns
approximately 59.3 percent of the company's stock.
   Starting Monday, Warner stockholders will be paid $70 a share in
cash for slightly more than 100 million shares. Time will exchange
the rest at some point in the future _ possibly several months _
for a combination of cash and securities valued at $70 a share. The
so-called ``back end'' of the deal will take place when the
Time-Warner merger is consummated.
   It is not known what kind of securities will be issued, but they
could include new shares of Time common stock.
   Warner stock rose $1.62{ to $66.12{ a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange before the tender offer expired.
   The original merger agreement announced in March required the
approval of Time and Warner stockholders, but Time's acquisition of
Warner does not require shareholder votes.
   Warner shareholders must approve the deal, but they effectively
will do so by tendering their stock to Time. When a shareholder
vote is held, Time Inc. effectively will be the only shareholder.
   After the acquisition is completed, Time's name will change to
Time Warner Inc. and Warner stock will cease trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The corporate structure of the merged company will, at first,
largely resemble Time and Warner as they are now.
   J. Richard Munro, 58, now the chairman of Time, and Steven Ross,
61, the Warner chairman, will serve as co-chairmen and co-chief
executive officers at Time Warner. After both eventually retire,
N.J. Nicholas Jr., now Time's president and soon to be Time
Warner's president, is expected to head the company.
   The two companies' corporate staffs will be integrated, but
``we've vowed there would be no job loss'' as a result of the
merger, said Louis Slovinsky, a Time spokesman.
   Warner's cable television operations will report to Joseph
Collins, the head of Time's cable division, and Warner's book
publishing division will report to the head of Time's publishing
unit, Kelso Sutton, Slovinsky said.
   No other changes were contemplated immediately.
   The companies have denied they plan to sell any assets to help
finance the deal, but published reports say executives have
targeted some divisions, including Time's Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.
book publisher, as possible candidates for sale.
   Some 500 Warner executives and employees reportedly would be
paid a total of about $677 million under stock, option and bonus
plans under the merger.
   Warner Chairman Steven Ross would receive $193 million in
payments and also would receive options on 1.8 million Time Warner
shares.
   The payments _ which were outlined in minutes of a June 15
Warner board meeting _ are considered the largest-ever compensation
package for employees of a company involved in a takeover.

   Soaring inflation has forced border
money changers to measure the Yugoslavian currency in cubic meters,
the national news agency Tanjug reported Tuesday.
   It said that at the Sentilj border crossing between Austria and
Yugoslavia foreign tourists recently exchanged their hard
currencies into ``fourteen cubic meters of dinars.''
   ``Dinars can no longer be measured in millions or billions, or
even in units of length or square meters, but only in cubic
meters,'' Tanjug said quoting the Dnevnik daily of the northern
city of Ljubljana.
   ``We now have a new unit for our national currency _ the cubic
dinar,'' Tanjug said.
   Inflation in Yugoslavia has surpassed the 700 percent mark and
is expected to peak at around 1,000 percent by the end of the year.
The country's largest 100,000 dinar banknote, put into circulation
last month, is currently worth less than $5.

<TEXT>
   House investigators said today their year-long
probe of alleged misconduct at the Internal Revenue Service
revealed serious integrity problems and wrongdoing by some senior
officials.
   Investigator Leonard Bernard said ``there has been a serious
failure on the part of the IRS' national office to effectively
manage employee integrity programs.''
   ``Our investigation revealed, for example, that on a number of
occasions IRS national office officials at the highest levels
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in Washington,
D.C., and elsewhere,'' Bernard said.
   He said he could not quantify the extent of the wrongdoing. But,
he said, the probe revealed ``significant integrity problems exist
among officials at this level.''
   ``Wrongdoing by IRS senior managers is too often ignored
entirely or ineptly investigated, resulting in a clearance for the
wrongdoers,'' Bernard said.
   His testimony opened three days of hearings on the IRS before
the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer
and monetary affairs.
   Bernard said a ``pervasive'' fear exists among IRS employees
that they will suffer personally if they report misconduct by their
superiors or cooperate in an investigation.
   ``In the cases investigated by the subcommittee,'' said Bernard,
``instances of retaliation against those reporting wrongdoing
outnumber by far the instances of punhishment of the wrongdoer.''
   Bernard noted that one of eight misconduct cases he and other
subcommittee aides have been probing involved senior officials up
to the level of deputy assistant commissioner.
   Most attention has been focused on allegations that a former
boss of the criminal investigation division in Los Angeles was
offered a bribe by Guess Inc., a jeans manufacturer, to get an
investigation of a rival, Jordache Enterprises. The IRS cleared
that official, Ronald Saranow, last year.
   Subcommittee investigators have checked several cases in which
IRS employees who called attention to misconduct inside the agency
were subsequently demoted or forced out.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., called
for three days of testimony from the IRS, present and former IRS
employees and the General Accounting Office.
   The IRS has declined comment on the allegations, citing laws
that prohibit disclosure of information about individual tax cases
or about employees under investigation.
   In recent interviews, however, top IRS officials defended the
agency's record in policing itself.
   The agency has an inspection division of 1,300 people to police
120,000 IRS employees, noted Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael J.
Murphy, and a criminal investigation division of 4,700 to watch
over the conduct of more than 100 million taxpayers.
   The inspection division conducts about 2,000 investigations of
allegations against employees each year, and about 48 percent of
the cases involve complaints from other employees, said Teddy R.
Kern, assistant commissioner for inspection.
   The IRS is one of the few federal agencies that require
employees to report wrongdoing by colleagues. Kern said President
Bush soon will seek to impose the same requirement on all federal
employees as part of his ethics-in-government recommendations.
   ``We do look pretty strictly at responsibilities and the code of
conduct'' that all IRS employees must sign, Kern said.
   ``If during an investigation (of IRS employees) we come up with
any violation of federal law ... we will refer the case to the U.S.
attorney, or if it is on an executive or high-level officials, we
will refer it to the Justice Department,'' Kern said.
   In addition, IRS inspectors automatically refer to the Treasury
Department's inspector general any allegation of criminal
wrongdoing by any of the 2,000 IRS high-level officials and
executives.
   In 1987, 88 IRS employees were convicted of crimes, including
embezzlement, selling narcotics and accepting bribes, following
investigations by the agency's inspection division.
   The most highly publicized case of IRS wrongdoing in recent
years was in the Philadelphia district office, where 14 people,
including fashion designer Albert Nippon, were convicted as a
result of a bribery investigation. Bribes totaling more than $1
million were paid to IRS employees.

   Stock prices were higher in moderately active
trading today, boosted by bargain hunters after Monday's sell-off.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 18.02 points to

   Borden Inc. said Tuesday that second-quarter
earnings rose 13.9 percent in spite of continued declines in its
dairy operations.
   Borden Chairman R.J. Ventres cited what he called strong steady
growth in many other businesses, in particular pasta, snacks,
certain grocery items, and domestic films and adhesives.
   New York-based Borden's earnings rose to $83.9 million, or $1.13
a share, from $73.7 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 5.1 percent to $1.87 billion from $1.78 billion.
   For the first half, Borden said earnings rose 13.4 percent to
$143 million, or $1.93 a share, from $126.1 million, or $1.71 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $3.68 billion
from $3.39 billion.
   Operating income in the dairy division fell 15.4 percent, but
the decline was less than half the 36 percent decline reported in
the first quarter of the year. Still, the company said ``intense
price competition continues in the industry, and another increase
in raw milk costs is expected in the third quarter.''

<HEAD>Control Data Loses $497.3 Million In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. on Tuesday reported a
second-quarter loss of $497.3 million, a debacle forecast by
company officials in April when they dumped the ETA Systems
supercomputer subsidiary and slashed 3,100 jobs.
   The bulk of the loss was from special, one-time charges,
although the company also lost about $25 million on the businesses
it has retained, including interest expenses.
   Control Data, once one of the world's largest computer makers,
has been steadily shrinking in a struggle to achieve sustained
profitability.
   ``With those activities largely behind us and an amended credit
agreement in place, we can concentrate on Control Data's ongoing
businesses and work to achieve a profitable second half of the
year,'' Chairman Robert Price said.
   The loss on sales of $804.3 million compares with net earnings
of $9.2 million, or 22 cents a share, in the second quarter of
1988, when sales were $951.7 million.
   The second-quarter earnings plunge meant a loss of $493.8
million for the first six months of the year.
   Shutting down St. Paul-based ETA cost Control Data about $335
million, slightly less than the $350 million originally estimated.
The balance of the charges came from shrinking the Cyber mainframe
division, paying severance to cover corporate staff layoffs and the
company's departure from the training and education business, Price
said.
   Price said losses in the mainframe business, computer
maintenance services and semiconductor division were only partially
offset by profits at Imprimis, the company's disk drive subsidiary.
   Last month, the company said it was selling Imprimis to Seagate
Technology Inc. for about $450 million in cash and securities. The
proceeds from that sale won't be booked until the deal closes,
probably this fall, a Control Data spokesman said.
   Control Data discontinued ETA, saying it was too expensive to
operate. In 1988, the fledgling supercomputer business had losses
of about $100 million. The division never made money for Control
Data.

<HEAD>Outlook for Residential Construction Better Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction contracting will fall about 2
percent this year, less than previously estimated because lower
interest rates should boost residential construction, a forecast
says.
   ``The return of workable interest rates means a fuller
realization of this year's potential for one-family housing and
institutional building,'' George A. Christie, vice president for
McGraw Hill's Construction Information Group, said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Total construction contracting is expected to fall to $254
billion from $258 billion, according to the Dodge-Sweet
Construction Outlook.
   The forecast updates an April projection, which had been for a 3
percent decline in construction contracting.
   Among particular segments, McGraw-Hill forecast a 7 percent drop
in non-residential construction contracting, no change in
residential construction contracting, and a 2 percent drop in
non-building construction, such as construction for transportation
and utilities.

   President Bush said today he will extend steel
import quotas against 29 countries in an effort to spur
negotiations on ending unfair trade practices abroad.
   Bush said he has directed U.S. Trade Representative Carla A.
Hills to negotiate a 30-month extension of the voluntary restraint
agreements that currently limit the countries involved to 18.4
percent of the U.S. market.
   The quotas, first imposed by the Reagan administration in 1984,
had been set to expire Sept. 30. They have limited steel imports
from 29 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the
European Community, into the United States.
   ``I am taking this step to permit the negotiation of an
international consensus to remove unfair trade practices and to
provide more time for the industry to adjust and modernize,'' Bush
said in a statement released by the White House.
   A few days before last November's election, Bush wrote a letter
to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., pledging to renew the import quotas in
some form.
   Nevertheless, there was a major debate inside the Bush
administration on whether to retain the quotas in any form in view
of its strong free market philosophy.
   In extending the voluntary agreements for a transitional period,
Bush said, ``I am mindful of the need to improve the availability
of steel in the United States and to promote price competition.''
   He said he was instructing the Department of Commerce to
``expedite and streamline'' a so-called short supply mechanism that
allows U.S. steel users to bypass the quotas if the type of steel
they need is in shortage.
   Bush said that during ``this transition to an open market, the
ceiling on imports from VRA (voluntary restraint agreement)
countries will be increased at an annual rate of one percentage
point.''
   The increase in allowable imports ``will be allocated to
countries that undertake and abide by disciplines to address
trade-distorting practices,'' he said.
   Bush said he has also directed Hills to seek to negotiate,
through the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and
other bilateral agreements an international consensus on how to end
government subsidies of steel.
   Bush said the extended quotas will end on March 31, 1992.
   ``Thereafter, U.S. steel producers, like other American
industries, will continue to rely on domestic trade laws as an
ultimate assurance against the effects of foreign unfair trade
practices,'' he said.
   ``For decades, governments have supported their steel producers
through subsidies and import restrictions. Steel trade and the
international trading system as a whole have suffered,'' said Bush.
   ``This self-defeating rivalry must end. I urge our trading
partners to work with us to restore free and fair trade to world
markets.''
   U.S. steel manufacturers had lobbied intensely for an extension
of the import quotas, which they maintain have helped rebuild an
industry buffeted by huge losses in the early 1980s.
   But some major steel customers, including Caterpillar Inc. and
dozens of smaller companies, had lobbied with equal vigor against
extending the quotas, which they charged had artifically driven up
the price of the steel they buy.
   They complained that the higher priced steel was forcing them to
charge more for the products they make and impairing U.S. ability
to compete in international markets.
   The U.S. steel industry has become profitable again after
reducing capacity and closing many older, inefficient mills.
Advocates of the import quotas contended the U.S. mills needed more
time to rebuild without unfettered competition from foreign
countries that heavily subsidize steel exports.
   The original Reagan quotas set annual limits on the amount of
steel that 29 nations may ship into the United States.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute reported last week that
steel imports fell sharply in the first five months of 1989, when
foreign steel represented just 17.1 percent of the U.S. market.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on
Tuesday defended Exxon's plans to stop the cleanup of the Alaskan
oil spill Sept. 15, saying the company is living up to its
obligations.
   The secretary, who oversees the Coast Guard and was put in
charge of the cleanup by President Bush, also said it doesn't
trouble him that Exxon will not commmit to doing work next year
before it assesses the need for additional cleanup next spring.
   But a spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Exxon's
obligation does not end in September. Alaska's governor said he
expects Exxon to fulfill a promise to ``stay until the job was
done.''
   Lujan spokesman Steve Goldstein said, ``The secretary has stated
all along that Exxon is fully liable and responsible for that
accident and they have an obligation to ensure full mitigation of
damages and to restore Prince William Sound back to its original
splendor.''
   Skinner said that based on his own visits to the cleanup site,
he believes the people of Alaska are satisfied with Exxon's
performance.
   ``Exxon basically has done everything they told the government
and me they would do,'' Skinner said.
   Skinner said unfavorable weather after Sept. 15 could make
cleanup efforts hazardous.
   ``I think Exxon's concerns are safety-related,'' he said at an
informal news conference. ``The date doesn't surprise me.''
   Skinner had been critical of the oil company's early efforts
after its Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef March 24 and caused the
largest oil spill in U.S. history. About 11 million gallons of
Alaskan crude oil escaped into Prince William Sound.
   An army of 11,000 people, 1,000 vessels and more than 70
aircraft has been mopping up along miles of shorelines stained by
the oil. Skinner estimated Exxon's expenses at between $5 million
and $10 million a day.
   The oil giant on Monday indicated the cost of cleaning up the
spill would total about $1.25 billion and was a major factor behind
a plunge in its second quarter earnings.
   State officials reacted angrily to Exxon's plan to pull out
cleanup forces by mid-September, saying crews should stay until the
area is clean.
   ``It's not enough to declare victory and go home,'' Alaskan Gov.
Steve Cowper said Monday. ``Virtually from the beginning, Exxon
promised Alaskans that the company would stay until the job was
done. I expect them to fulfill that promise.''
   Surveys by the state and the Coast Guard indicate only about
one-third of the cleanup work either has been completed or is in
progress, the governor said.
   Otto Harrison, Exxon's general manager in Valdez, said in a July
19 memo to company officials that no winter cleanup operations will
be conducted because of safety and operational reasons and the
company's only commitment for next spring is to survey the
shorelines.
   Steve Provant, on-scene oil spill coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, said the oil company
should leave some crews behind to deal with oil that may wash off
beaches and cause problems during the winter.
   Skinner said he agreed with Exxon that working in the winter
could pose ``serious risks from a safety viewpoint.''
   He said some people in government and some environmentalists
have had a tendency to ``bash Exxon just to bash them.''
   ``I don't think these people reflect the opinions of the people
in Alaska who have watched this effort go forward,'' the secretary
said.
   Skinner said he will continue to push for legislation that sets
liability for oil spills. The next ``spiller,'' he said, may not be
as willing as Exxon to accept responsibility for the cleanup.

   Look out, Nintendo.
   The newest player in home video games is out to zap and blast
your Super Mario Brothers with special effects so dazzling that its
electronic athletes dance home-run shuffles and its space battles
display arcade-quality flash.
   ``Dad, I got to get this system. This is the greatest game I
ever saw. We'll sell the Nintendo,'' said Joe Silverman, 9, after a
trial run on the TurboGrafx-16 system made by NEC Home Electronics
(U.S.A.) Inc.
   Ditching Nintendo seems like heresy. It is the hottest-selling
toy in America and Super Mario Brothers, named for its mustachioed
heroes, the most popular game.
   Yet the 20 people who played the systems in a weeklong,
side-by-side trial by The Associated Press unanimously praised
NEC's sharper graphics, blazing color and better sound.
   NEC's system, due in stores in November, has twice the computing
power and at least twice the pricetag. The basic unit lists at
$199, with a compact disc option for an extra $399. Game cartridges
the size of a credit card will sell for $45, and about 20 games
will be available.
   A Nintendo unit costs about $80. Its 120 games sell for $25 to
$40.
   But even a telecommunications giant like NEC is going to need
more than heavyweight wizardry to challenge Nintendo, which
monopolizes 80 percent of the video game market.
   Nine-year-old Emmet O'Hanlon preferred NEC's graphics during a
test run but said, ``I wouldn't trade Nintendo at all. No way.''
   Josh Taylor, 19, agreed after playing a baseball game that
features a post-game show and lacks only gold chains and pine tar
for realism.
   ``NEC blows it away. It's far superior.'' Still, he said, ``If I
owned a Nintendo, I don't know if I'd go out and buy the new one.''
   Jenny Boyd, 12, said it would take ``a million dollars to give
up my Nintendo.'' But after playing NEC, she told her 10-year-old
sister, ``Start saving your money. Any money we get will go toward
this. This is a fresh game.''
   Like Nintendo, the NEC system is a game kids, and some adults,
can't stop playing. In a space battle, white-knuckled players raced
to see who can go the farthest and blast the most aliens. In
pinball, getting the high score earned bragging rights.
   James Herman, 9, was particularly awestruck by one NEC game in
which a karate-chopping warrior battles bullies. The hero's eyes
blink, his side bruises and his mouth bleeds.
   ``That's what I call excellent graphics,'' James said. ``This is
such an awesome game.''
   NEC's gadgetry has a 16-bit microprocessor, twice the power of a
Nintendo. A bit measures how much information the processor can
handle at once. Nintendo is testing a souped-up version, and a Sega
of America Inc., subsidiary of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., also
has a 16-bit system on the market.
   But experts say marketing and game appeal may mean more than raw
computing power.
   ``The 16-bit guys are looking for a small niche of the market. I
can't believe they're going to upend Nintendo,'' said Larry Carlat,
editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World Magazine. ``After all those kids and
parents have invested in Nintendo, now you're telling them to put
it away in a closet and start all over again with more money for
better graphics.''
   The battle for the hearts and minds of video game players is far
from child's play because of the megabucks at stake.
   Nintendo of America Inc. sold $1.7 billion worth of games last
year and sales should reach $2.6 billion this year. Since it
introduced its boxy toy in 1985, Nintendo has sold 13 million in
the United States and expects to have 19 million sold by year's end.
   More than 50 million game cartridges will be bought this year.
The hottest game, Super Mario Brothers, is a morality play that
weaves a mustachioed Mario or his brother, Luigi, each a blipping
Everyman, through an electronic labyrinth of waterfalls and secret
passages.
   The farther Mario goes in the fantasy yarn, the tougher the
surrealistic obstacles, and he's apt to die a thousand deaths
before rescuing the princess from the evil Wart by flinging
vegetables at antagonists.
   One of the newest games, Wheel of Fortune, has an electronic
hand-clapping, letter-turning Vanna White.
   In one symptom of video madness, stores that rent movies now
boost profits by renting Nintendo games. A toll-free Nintendo
hotline handles 50,000 calls a week from players desperate for tips
on how to overcome villains and obstacles.
   Nintendo also offers a gadget that allows the handicapped to
play by using sips and puffs of air instead of their hands.
   ``It gives you something to do for a couple of hours a day. It's
pretty addictive,'' said wheelchair-bound Kenny Dvorchak, 25, of
Uniontown, Pa., who was paralyzed from the neck down in a 1983
accident.
   The country's fascination with video games, the marriage of
television and computers, began in 1972 when Atari founder Nolan
Bushnell created Pong, a beeping blip batted with paddles.
   Pong was in the first generation of home video games that came
out in 1975. The newest ones are much more sophisticated.
   ``They're very compelling. They're so convenient, exciting and
accessible,'' said David Surrey, professor of urban studies at St.
Peter's College in Jersey City, N.J. ``The games are a repetition
of age-old themes. It's still cowboys and Indians, the boys save
the girls, and there's a fear of outsiders where you shoot aliens
and monsters.''
   ``All games are addictive if they're good,'' said Brian
Sutton-Smith, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
``There's nothing wrong with that. It's the nature of good play.
Why shouldn't kids be addicted? Usually, they grow out of their
addiction.''

   Nintendo's success story sounds almost as
improbable as the plots of some of its video games.
   In 1985, a year in which U.S. video game sales slid to $100
million from more than $3 billion three years earlier, Nintendo
chose to test its home-computer-game machine in the New York market.
   Those tests told the Japanese toy company it could score big in
the United States with its Nintendo Entertainment System that turns
a television into a game screen.
   Thanks to the popularity of its games, Nintendo revived a
moribund U.S. market to become undisputed champ of home computer
games. Only recently have serious rivals emerged, particularly NEC
Corp., another Japanese company.
   While Nintendo thrived, American companies, such as Atari Corp.
and its predecessor that pioneered the home video game concept,
were nursing wounds suffered from mismanaging the boom of the early
1980s.
   A reason why the initial phenomenon faded in the United States
was that companies failed to control creation and marketing,
allowing a proliferation of dull games.
   Analysts also say the fad that started in 1972 fizzled because
the industry was hampered by the limitations in computer chip
memory of the early 1980s.
   Enter Nintendo of America Inc., the American corporate offspring
of 100-year-old Nintendo Co. Ltd., a Kyoto, Japan-based company
that started as a maker of playing cards.
   From its initial tests, Nintendo has played its cards wisely,
including close monitoring of the development and distribution of
games.
   Most of the cartridges that fit into Nintendo's plastic
electronic boxes are published and sold by outside software
specialists. Through licenses, Nintendo restricts its software
creators, such as in the number of games they can bring out in a
year. Nintendo has about 50 licensees for software and accessories,
such as joysticks. It also has its own software development staff
but the bulk of the work is subcontracted.
   Nintendo also closely tracks demand and yanks poor sellers.
   ``We've had a philosophy of weeding the garden,'' says Peter T.
Main, vice president of marketing at Nintendo of America.
   There are 120 Nintendo titles available in the United States
currently, retailing for roughly $30 to $40 a piece.
   Now, a second round in the video game battle is beginning.
   NEC is challenging Nintendo's dominance with a system that
boasts greater computing power.
   ``The technology that's in our machines allows the software to
deliver a more realistic fantasy,'' says Ken Wirt, assistant vice
president for home entertainment at NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)
Inc., an American subsidiary of the Japanese computer and
telecommunications powerhouse.
   NEC's TurboGrafx-16, to be available in toy and electronics
stores this autumn, contains a 16-bit graphics processor, double
the capacity of Nintendo's. The 16-bit processor allows TurboGrafx
to deliver clearer, more detailed images, faster action sequences
and a wider range of colors.
   The brain of the TurboGrafx is still an 8-bit chip, the same as
Nintendo's, but Wirt says that chip doesn't need additional oomph.
   ``We're not solving differential equations here,'' says Wirt.
``Video games are mostly visual and audio. They're not calculation
intensive.''
   TurboGrafx, which will retail for about $200, or about twice the
price of the basic Nintendo system, has been designed to
accommodate optional equipment, such as a compact disc player and
an audio-video enhancer.
   Wirt says the higher pricetag on NEC's system is justified
because research indicates that 8- to 16-year-olds _ the target age
group _ will play NEC games twice as long as the 60 hours or so
spent playing a Nintendo game.
   Backing up the fancy hardware is NEC's considerable corporate
clout. The company dwarfs Nintendo, with worldwide annual sales of
about $22 billion vs. Nintendo's $1.5 billion in 1988. NEC has a
research and development budget and a staff size that far exceed
Nintendo's.
   Another contender for market share is Sega of America Inc.,
subsidiary of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., veteran of video
arcades. Al Nilsen, director of marketing, says the company's
Genesis 16-bit system, which also will retail for around $200, has
gotten glowing reviews and orders from retailers are surpassing
expectations. Sega will start shipping Genesis in September.
   Features that could give Sega an edge include the optional
TeleGenesis modem and software that will allow videophiles to link
through telephone lines and play video baseball against each other.
Other games will be introduced next year for use with TeleGenesis.
The price of TeleGenesis will be about $100 and using it will cost
the price of a phone call.
   Sega says Genesis will bring many of the popular arcade
classics, such as Altered Beast, into the home and reproduce
arcade-quality graphics.
   Nintendo claims it still can knock out the competition by
introducing dozens of hot games this year, including ``Tetris,'' a
game designed in the Soviet Union, and ``Dragon Warrior.''
   Also, Nintendo's hand-held Game Boy system with its
state-of-the-art technology and stereo sound is expected to be a
hit although toy industry analysts have speculated that the
portable model could steal sales from regular Nintendo systems.
   Nintendo has forecast sales this year at $2.6 billion, up from
1988's $1.7 billion. The entire industry, Nintendo says, will post
sales of $3.4 billion this year compared with $2.3 billion last
year.
   The deciding factor in how much market share competitors grab
from Nintendo probably will be the games themselves, not the
hardware.
   Robert Holmes, chief operating officer of Acclaim Entertainment
Inc., a major Nintendo software licensee, says most video game
developers and marketers already have aligned themselves with
Nintendo.
   Nintendo's devices are in an estimated 17 percent of American
households and Nintendo projects its hardware will be in 26 percent
of all U.S. homes by the end of this year.
   ``Nintendo's position in the marketplace is akin to a tidal
wave. They have the loyalty of the gaming public because of the
diversity of the software,'' says Holmes, adding that NEC and Sega
lack a broad assortment of games.
   NEC plans to have about 20 titles in stores by Christmas and
Sega expects to have 20 to 25.
   Paul Valentine, a toy industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., says the competition is intensifying at a time when the
market for the games could be peaking.
   ``There is no question that the video game fad is reaching its
peak,'' says Valentine. But, he acknowledged: ``I underestimated
the strength and duration of the video game fad in the past.''

   Instead of just zapping aliens from outer space
or punching out a boxing opponent, Nintendo users of the future may
be able to trade stocks, make vacation plans or shop from home.
   ``The fact remains that the good old Nintendo Entertainment
System is a full-blown 8-bit computer system that can do a lot more
than play Super Mario Brothers 2,'' says Peter T. Main, vice
president of marketing at Nintendo of America Inc. in Redmond, Wash.
   Although he wouldn't disclose details of the company's plans, he
said the popularity of the video game system ``presents significant
opportunities for a home information system.''
   Nintendo previously has disclosed talks with American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co., but both indicate the negotiations are in
preliminary stages.
   Presumably, the companies are talking about creating an
interactive communications network that would involve hooking
Nintendo machines to phone lines to receive and send information.
Not only would the linkup allow people to play video games with
others around the country, it eventually could give Nintendo
machine owners access to data supplied by a third party.
   Nintendo has experience in computer networking. In 1987, it was
host of a ``Family Computer Golf Tournament'' in Japan as an
experiment in communications using public phone lines.
   Video golf players across Japan vied against each other while
using the Family Computer System. The machine is in 35 percent of
households there, where Nintendo says it has a 90 percent share of
the home video game market. Nintendo expects to be in 21 percent of
U.S. households by the end of 1989.
   Last year in Japan, Nintendo started the Family Computer
Communications Network System. Through a joint venture with Nomura
Securities Co. Ltd., the system provides securities information and
trading services.
   Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan, parent of the U.S. subsidiary, laid
out its goals for information services in its 1988 financial report.
   In it, President Hiroshi Yamauchi said: ``We firmly believe that
the development of an information system that is easily accessible
to virtually anybody, easy-to-use, and provides even minimal
amounts of valuable data will be successful.''
   ``Based upon this firm belief, we will continue our efforts to
develop and foster this new information market in Japan and
eventually, as consumer interest evolves, in the U.S.A.''
   Nintendo officials delivered the same pitch to Wall Street
securities analysts earlier this summer. The company was trying to
attract interest to the first sale of Nintendo's American
depositary receipts. ADRs allow U.S.-based investors to hold stocks
of foreign companies.
   Analysts say Nintendo is trying to promote its image as a
consumer electronics company, not just a toymaker.
   Being primarily a toy company selling a simple electronic device
was probably to Nintendo's advantage in entering homes. Consumers
who may have had no interest in personal computers actually own one
disguised as a game machine.
   Nintendo's strategy has caused big computer companies to take
notice.
   The move by NEC Corp. into video games was motivated partly by a
desire to establish a pesence in homes. The game machine
TurboGrafx-16 is being introduced in the United States this autumn
by the giant Japanese computer and communications company.
   ``We're in this business because it does a couple of things that
are important strategically,'' says Ken Wirt, assistant vice
president of NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc., NEC's American
subsidiary.
   ``The TurboGrafx is a computer and it is in the home. We believe
that the home market is very important for NEC,'' says Wirt. ``It's
very possible to put the kind of technology in the home that can
form the basis of future uses for the product.''
   Both NEC and Nintendo seem to be pursuing a
get-them-while-their-young approach to gaining customers. After
youngsters get hooked on video games, it may be easier to reel them
in as personal computer buyers when they grow up.
   As Wirt of NEC puts it: ``Children will associate NEC with
high-tech, high-quality products and they are the future consumers
of home electronics.''

<HEAD>Chairman, Three Others Resign Amid Bank Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of National Westminster Bank PLC and
three others resigned over government criticism of Natwest's
actions during a 1987 takeover of a U.S. company, the bank said
Tuesday.
   A total of six officials of Britain's largest bank have resigned
since the government last week assailed bank executives' conduct in
the unsuccessful $1.4 billion stock sale in Blue Arrow PLC during
its takeover of Manpower Inc.
   The report by the Department of Trade and Industry has been
turned over to British law enforcement, banking and securities
regulatory bodies to investigate possible disclosure violations.
   Natwest Chairman Lord Boardman, 70, accepted responsibility for
the bank's ``serious failings,'' Natwest said in a statement.
Boardman was not cited by the Department of Trade and Industry
report released last Thursday.
   Also resigning were Charles Green, 58, and Terry Green, 55, both
deputy chief executives of the bank; and John Plastow, 60, a
general manager. The resignation of two other officials was
disclosed Monday.
   The bank's 29-member board of directors held an emergency
meeting Sunday to determine its response to the government's report
on the deal involving Blue Arrow of Britain, the world's largest
employment services concern.
   The stock sale to existing Blue Arrow shareholders was intended
to raise funds for Blue Arrow's $1.3 billion takeover of the
much-larger Manpower, a Milwaukee-based temporary employment agency.
   According to the government, County Natwest Ltd., a unit of
Natwest, failed to disclose a 13.4 percent holding for nearly three
months after it retained Blue Arrow shares that were not sold. The
failure to disclose would violate British regulatory guidelines.
   The trade department has given its report to the Serious Fraud
Office, which is responsible for prosecuting financial crimes, the
Bank of England and the Securities Association.
   Boardman, who is to remain until Sept. 30, said the resignations
were not forced by the Bank of England, the country's central bank.
   Natwest said the three executive directors believed the damage
to them and the bank made it impossible for them to stay following
publication of the criticism and the subsequent wide publicity.
   The government's report criticized the three men for not
initiating inquiries on the full extent of the group's holdings of
Blue Arrow shares.
   Boardman said in a letter to Bank of England Governor Robin
Leigh-Pemberton he was resigning because he accepted ultimate
responsibility and because the report unjustifiably criticized the
three directors.
   ``Lord Boardman felt he could not accept the resignations of
these three loyal colleagues of great integrity and remain,''
Natwest's statement said.
   Boardman is to be succeeded by Lord Alexander, 52, currently
deputy chairman of the bank and chairman of the regulatory Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers. He was was to have taken over as chairman
Jan. 1, 1990, after Boardman's planned retirement.
   Nicholas Wells, the County Natwest corporate adviser who was
directly responsible for the sale of Blue Arrow shares, resigned as
a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., Barclays said Monday.
   Natwest said Monday that David Reed, managing director for
County Natwest's corporate advisory operations, also resigned.
   The Manpower takeover led to a dramtic boardroom reversal at
Blue Arrow earlier this year in which Chairman Anthony Berry was
replaced by Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's former head.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a government
report showing improvement in the corn and soybean crops.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast calling for
normal temperatures and normal rainfall in the Midwest early next
week also prompted selling, analysts said.
   ``We are in the throes of a weather market, which is usual for
this time of year,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in New
York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop-condition report,
issued late Monday, showed overall improvement in the corn and
soybean fields, especially in Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota, where
dry weather had stressed the crops.
   Last week's soaking rains in the Corn Belt have been replaced by
warm, humid weather, but conditions are neither hot enough nor dry
enough to threaten crops, Spilka said.
   The wheat market generally followed corn and soybean futures
lower, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 3\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
September at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower
with September at $2.29\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ cent

   The stock market turned mixed in afternoon
trading today as blue chips gave up earlier gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.88 at
2,579.10 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street after showing a gain of more than
7 points an hour earlier.
   In the broader market, advancing issues maintained a dwindling
lead over decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with 746 up,
692 down and 512 unchnged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
down 0.07 to 185.96.
   Big Board volume came to 152.3 million shares with one hour left

   Stock prices displayed strength in the early going as bargain
hunters found attractive buys after Monday's selloff. But their
appetites were soon satisfied.
   Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.
in New York, said investors are preoccupied with recession worries.
   ``One has to get a little bit concerned that the slowdown is
coming much too fast,'' said Barbanel. He said instead of heading
for a so-called soft-landing, ``We may have a little bit of a
bumpier landing than expected.''
   A government report on durable goods released today added to a
string of statistics pointing to slow growth. Orders for durable
goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in June after falling
4.4 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported.
   Recent corporate earnings reports indicate various industries
aren't doing all that well coping with the effects of sluggish
economic growth and the strength of the dollar, Barbanel said.``The
stronger dollar may have eaten into the profitability of some
companies,'' he said.

<HEAD>IBM to Take Over Part of Kodak's Data-Processing Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's biggest computer company will run a
large part of the data-processing operations of the world's biggest
photography company under a deal announced Tuesday.
   The contract will mean valuable experience in a relatively new
field for International Business Machines Corp. and cost savings
for Eastman Kodak Co.
   ``This allows the customer to focus on their core business, the
things they're particularly good at, and allows us to focus on the
things we're particularly good at,'' said David E. McDowell, the
president of IBM's National Service Division.
   IBM will build and run a data center at Kodak's Rochester, N.Y.,
headquarters that will take over data-processing work now spread
out over three centers in Rochester and one in Windsor, Colo.
   The budget of the operations involved is a significant portion,
although ``far less than half,'' of Kodak's annual worldwide budget
of $500 million for computing, said Katherine M. Hudson, Kodak's
director of corporate information systems.
   Kodak hopes the contract will save it close to half of what it
has been spending on the operations that are being taken over, she
said. Neither company would disclose terms of their contract.
   Kodak Chairman Colby Chandler said Monday the company would take
a $225 million charge against second-quarter earnings for costs of
consolidating photo-finishing and consumer photography operations
and said he was ``very disappointed'' with operating results. The
computer deal appears to be a step toward solving those problems.
   IBM has been working to become a partner with its customers,
embedding itself deeply in their businesses. It won the Kodak job
in competition with Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of
General Motors Corp.
   The deal with Kodak, although not highly profitable, ``is the
kind of business IBM would like to do more of,'' said Stephen
Cohen, a Gartner Group analyst in Stamford, Conn.
   ``It took IBM maybe 10 years to bring this to this level,'' said
Sonny Monosson, a computer industry watcher in Boston.
   The contract with IBM may eventually be expanded to include
foreign data centers as well as data centers of Kodak's recently
acquired Sterling Drug subsidiary and other U.S. operations, Ms.
Hudson said.
   Excluded will be personal computers and networks, which will be
supplied and serviced under a recently announced contract with
Businessland Inc. Also excluded will be specialty computers, such
as factory-floor models, most of which are made by IBM rival
Digital Equipment Corp.
   IBM's and Kodak's businesses overlap in some areas, such as
image storage and retrieval. But McDowell said the companies see
themselves as partners, not rivals.
   The new data center in Rochester, which IBM will design, build
and staff, will be a showcase for the latest in IBM and Kodak
technology. It will take about two years to finish, but IBM will
take over data-processing responsibilities sooner, this Oct. 2.
   Slightly less than 300 Kodak data-processing employees will
become employees of IBM.
   Kodak uses computers from companies other than IBM, and that
will continue under IBM management, McDowell said. ``We don't have
a particularly strong vendor bias when it comes to solving a
customer's operational problem,'' he said.
   Still, Cohen of Gartner Group said the deal would give IBM a
firmer lock on the Kodak account. ``I don't think Amdahl is going
to stand much of a chance of selling a mainframe to IBM,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shearson, Solomon Brothers Report Higher Quarterly Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. said Tuesday that its
second-quarter profit more than tripled to record levels, while
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. reported a 43 percent jump in
earnings.
   Both brokerage companies said they benefited largely from a
sharp pickup of activity on Wall Street during the spring months.
   Salomon's profit soared to $253 million, or $1.89 a share, in
the three months ended June 30, from $80 million, or 49 cents a
share, in the 1988 quarter.
   The results shattered the previous record profit of $190 million
in the first quarter of 1986 and were more than three times as high
as the 1988 second-quarter earnings of $80 million, or 49 cents a
share. Second-quarter revenue totaled $2.32 billion, up from $1.42
billion.
   For the first half of this year, however, Salomon's earnings
fell slightly to $225 million, or $1.54 a share, from $253 million,
or $1.68, in 1988.
   Shearson's quarterly net income totaled $55 million, or 54 cents
a share, compared with earnings of $39 million, or 37 cents a
share, in 1988. Revenue rose 31 percent to $3.3 billion from $2.5
billion.
   But for the first six months, Shearson netted $40 million, or 31
cents a share, on revenue of $6.3 billion. That was down 65 percent
from earnings of $113 million, or $1.14 a share, and $5 billion in
revenue, last year.
   Salomon said its strong earnings reflected ``the industrywide
improvement in volume in the U.S. bond and equity markets,'' as
well as profits across most product lines.
   The securities segment alone contributed $390 million to
second-quarter consolidated pre-tax earnings of $453 million, the
company said.
   Among other segments, Phibro Energy's pre-tax earnings wre $102
million compared with $30 million in the 1988 quarter.
   ``Crude oil trading was especially strong, benefiting from both
higher prices and volatility,'' the company said in a statement.
``Refining results were also firm ...''
   Shearson, a subsidiary of American Express Co., said a pickup in
investor activity as well as continued cost-cutting efforts were
responsible for the sharp rise in second-quarter income.
   During the period Shearson also strengthened its capital base
through the sale of the Boston Co.'s mutual fund transfer agency,
which added $200 million to shareholders' equity. Last year's
second-quarter results included $69 million of pre-tax expenses
associated with the merger of E.F. Hutton Inc.

<HEAD>2nd-Qtr Earnings Rise at Knight-Ridder, Times Mirror, Washington
Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Co. said Tuesday its second-quarter earnings
nearly tripled from a year earlier as it reported hefty gains on
sales of a newspaper and five television stations, while profits
rose 7.6 percent at Times Mirror Co. and 22.7 percent at The
Washington Post Co.
   Miami-based Knight-Ridder said its net income amounted to $126.9
million, or $2.44 a share, in the three months ended June 30, up
from $45 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12.2 percent to $578.7 million from
$515.9 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax $55.5 million gain on
the sale of five television stations and a pre-tax gain of $49.1
milion on the sale of the Pasadena Star-News.
   Knight-Ridder operating income rose 22.5 percent for the quarter
to $90.3 million from $73.7 million a year earlier.
   The newspaper division's operating profit rose 17.8 percent to
$95.1 million, while the business information services division had
an operating profit of $2.8 million compared with a loss of
$209,000 a year ago.
   Robert Singleton, Knight-Ridder chief financial officer, said
the operating results were better than expected.
   He cited softened newsprint prices and cost discipline and said
retail advertising revenue strengthened in some markets,
particularly Miami and Philadelphia. But Singleton said classified
ad revenue growth slowed in those markets while it remained strong
at the company's San Jose Mercury News.
   For the first six months, Knight-Ridder earned $147.3 million,
or $2.82 a share, nearly double its profit of $78.8 million, or
$1.37 a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue rose to $1.19
billion from $1.01 billion.
   Times Mirror, based in Los Angeles, said it earned $85 million,
or 66 cents a share in the latest quarter compared with $79
million, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Second-quarter revenue
rose 5.3 percent to $861.3 million from $818.1 million a year
earlier.
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive, said the
company's revenue growth slowed in the second quarter due to
economic weakness in the Northeast. ``Until economic conditions in
our markets brighten, we are not likely to see improvement in
operating results,'' he said.
   He said the Los Angeles Times recorded a strong performance, but
advertising volume declines at Newsday and a softening economy in
the New York area hurt the newspaper group's performance. Times
Mirror also owns New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun, The Hartford
Courant, The Morning Call, The (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and
Greenwich Time.
   The company said its cable television group was its strongest
performer, while soft ad demand, a depressed Texas economy and
programming costs hurt results from Times Mirror's broadcast

   The stock market settled for a mixed performance
today as renewed blue chip buying in the late afternoon wasn't
enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average back into positive
territory.
   Stock prices displayed strength in the early going as bargain
hunters found attractive buys after Monday's selloff that drove
down the Dow industrials by more than 22 points.
   But, in the afternoon, it appeared that the appetites for stocks
were satisfied, and the market headed lower. Some renewed buying in
the blue chips allowed the Dow industrials to end with only a minor
loss.
   Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president with Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc.
in New York, said the market is suffering from recurring recession
worries.
   ``One has to get a little bit concerned that the slowdown is
coming much too fast,'' said Barbanel. He said instead of heading
for a so-called soft-landing, the economy ``may have a little bit
of a bumpier landing than expected.''
   A government report on durable goods released today added to a
string of statistics pointing to weak economic activity. Orders for
durable goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in June after
falling 4.4 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported.
   Recent corporate earnings reports indicate various industries
aren't doing all that well coping with the effects of sluggish
economic growth and the strength of the dollar, Barbanel said.
   ``The stronger dollar may have eaten into the profitability of
some companies,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A National Right to Work group has filed suit on
behalf of four Eastern Airlines pilots and their wives seeking
damages and a halt to union picketing of their homes, officials
said Tuesday.
   Among allegations in the suit, filed in Dade County Circuit
Court over the weekend, is that a pilot's wife, Glenda D. Matt,
suffered a miscarriage after harassment from striking union
members, including paint splashed on the couple's home and a rock
thrown against their bedroom window.
   The suit also alleges threats of bombs, arson and death to the
pilots, who have worked despite a strike that began March 4 by
Eastern unions.
   ``Although on the surface, it looks like peaceful picketing,
underneath that there is a reign of terror,'' said Robert Gore,
attorney for the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation in
Springfield, Va.
   Pilots union spokesman Hank Weber said the union doesn't allow
harassment and would discipline any member involved. Weber, who is
among 29 defendants named in the suit along with Eastern's pilots,
Machinists and flight attendants unions, said picketing of private
homes and businesses is legal.
   ``If we have any indication that any illegal acts are being
performed by a member, that member will be removed from the
union,'' Weber said.
   Weber said he wasn't familiar with allegations that Mrs. Matt
suffered a miscarriage.
   ``We are doing something that is legal, peaceful and on public
land,'' Weber said. ``We feel very strongly that there's no doubt
that we do have a constitutional right to free speech.''
   The pilots' suit alleges an illegal pattern of coercion by the
unions, invasion of privacy, violation of Florida's right to work
statute, violation of a Florida statute on residential picketing
and ``intentional infliction of emotional distress.'' No amount of
damages is specified.

<TEXT>
   Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest
health maintenance organization, will undertake a $3.6 billion
expansion in Northern California the next ten years, officials said
Tuesday.
   The expansion, which will result in higher membership dues,
includes major renovations of hospitals in the San Francisco area.
   Kaiser Permanente, which serves2.3 million members in Northern
California, grew at an unprecedented rate in 1988 and must expand
to keep up with projected growth, said Dr. David Lawrence, senior
vice president and regional manager.
   Lawrence said annual membership rates probably would go up 15
percent in 1990, but he said Kaiser should be able to maintain its
position as the least expensive HMO in the area.
   Under the expansion plan, Kaiser will invest $1.65 billion in
the San Francisco Bay area and $907 million in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Valley area, as well as nearly $1 billion throughout the
region.
   Membership growth had averaged about 3 percent annually but
soared to 6 percent in 1988. Administrators expect about 125,000
new members in 1989, also a 6 percent increase.
   Lawrence attributed membership growth to growing population, the
failure of competing HMOs and what he called Kaiser's affordable
rates.

   Sales of cars and trucks made by the eight major
U.S. automakers rose 2.4 percent in mid-July compared with last
year, when sales began leveling off toward the end of the
third-best model year in history, the companies said Tuesday.
   Vehicles made in North America by the companies sold at an
average daily rate of 39,726 during the July 11-20 period this
year, compared with a rate of 38,807 during the same period last
year.
   Car sales rose 1.5 percent and truck sales went up by 3.8
percent.
   In the third quarter last year, sales flattened as automakers
prepared their factories for the next model year, which officially
begins Oct. 1. Automakers used the down time to sell off built-up
inventories of 1988 model year vehicles.
   Car and truck sales since Jan. 1 continued a downward trend,
falling 4 percent to a daily rate of 38,186 vehicles through July
20 percent from a daily rate of 39,781 during the same period last
year.
   Car sales were down 5.3 percent and truck sales were off 1.8
percent during the year-to-date period.
   Chrysler Corp. reported an 18.5 percent drop in its mid-July car
sales, which fell to a daily rate of 2,713 from a 3,328 daily rate
during the period last year. Chrysler's car sales for the year
through July 20 were 14.8 percent behind last year's pace.
   Chrysler's truck sales rose 4.1 percent during the mid-July
period this year and were down 0.4 percent for the entire year.
   Ford Motor Co. said its car sales during the 10-day period this
year were down 2.4 percent from last year, falling to an average
daily rate of 7,486 from a rate of 6,671 cars a day last year. For
the entire year, Ford's cars were selling at a pace 8.6 percent
lower than last year.
   Ford truck sales were up 3.1 percent during the period and down
2.4 percent for the year to date.
   General Motors Corp.'s mid-July car sales fell to a daily rate
of 11,701, 1.4 percent below last year's rate of 11,866 cars a day.
GM's car sales for the year were 8.6 percent behind last year's
pace.
   GM's truck sales were up 3.1 percent in mid-July and down 2.4
percent for the year so far.

   The dollar fell Tuesday as traders picked out
indications that the Federal Reserve was lowering interest rates,
which would make dollar investments less attractive to global
investors.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The federal funds rate, which is directly controlled by the
Federal Reserve, was 91-16 percent late in the day, down from the
level of 9\ percent that had prevailed in recent weeks.
   ``Everybody's looking for secret clues as to when the Fed is
going to ease,'' said Michael Malpede, senior currency analyst at
Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
   The dollar held up after reports on housing sales and orders for
``big ticket'' durable goods because the reports were roughly
consistent with expectations.
   But the dollar lost ground when the Fed failed to drain reserves
from the banking system in the afternoon, as would be necessary to
prop up the federal funds rate at the going level, Malpede said.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, influences a wide variety of other interest rates throughout
the economy.
   Meanwhile, the Japanese yen snapped back from the slump that
followed Sunday's election loss by the Japanese Liberal Democratic
Party and the announcement by Prime Minister Sousuke Uno that he
would resign.
   Traders noted that Japan did not seem to be in a state of
crisis. The Nikkei index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 1.31
percent in Tuesday's session to a record high.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.40 Japanese yen to a closing 142.35
yen. Later in London, it was unchanged at 142.45 yen. In New York
the dollar fell to 141.55 yen from 142.55 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6255 from $1.6185 late
Monday. Later in New York the pound rose to $1.6385 from $1.6260.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8835 West German marks, down from 1.8970; 1.6202
Swiss francs, down from 1.6360; 1.1874 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1887; and 1,357 Italian lire, down from 1,369.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday: 1.6300
Swiss francs, down from 1.6455; 6.4265 French francs, down from
6.4460; 2.1348 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1350; 1,364.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,371.50; 1.1876 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1880.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 42 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$373.41.
   Gold bullion traded late in London at $372.25 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Monday.
   In Zurich, gold dipped to $371.25 bid from $371.50 bid late
Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $373.70 a troy ounce from $373.40. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $373 an ounce, up
from $372.60.
   Silver bullion edged down in London to $5.20 a troy ounce from
$5.21 bid late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.208 an ounce from $5.202.

   Despite predictions the home video
market may have peaked, Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. said
Tuesday its earnings and revenue more than doubled in the second
quarter.
   The nation's largest video rental operation reported quarterly
net income of $8.02 million, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $74
million. That compares with net income of $3.8 million, or 6 cents
a share, on revenue of $35.1 million for the same 1988 period.
   For the six months ending June 30, the company reported net
income of $14.5 million, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of $138.7
million. For the same period last year, Blockbuster reported net
income of $6.04, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $56.5 million.
   The 1988 figures were restated to include the acquisition of Las
Vegas-based Major Video Corp. in January. The company had a 2-for-1
stock split May 31 and reported a 57 cents a share rise for the
year.
   Blockbuster has used the huge popularlity of home videos for an
aggressive international expansion program, which now stands at 365
company-owned stores and 434 franchise stores in 42 states, Canada
and the United Kingdom.
   Nearly $1 million has been spent on the addition of 190 stores
since March 31, said company spokesman Vans Stevenson.
   Paul Kagan Associates, a media research and consulting firm in
Carmel, Calif., noted that home video rentals and sales has
increased sixfold during the past five years to $7.9 billion. But
the firm, as well as many analysts, predict the market will slow
beginning next year.
   Meanwhile, Blockbuster has not been spared criticism during its
rapid climb.
   In May, its stock fell following the release of a report by
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. that Blockbuster artificially inflated its
financial statements by writing off the costs of tapes over three
years, rather than nine months.
   Blockbuster also was in headlines this summer for its refusal to
carry ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' at its company-owned stores.

   Corporate executives contemplating mergers have
a stronger arsenal against unwanted buyout bids now that the
Delaware Supreme Court has upheld Time Inc.'s right to proceed with
its buyout of Warner Communications Inc., legal scholars said
Tuesday.
   Coming at the end of a decade dominated by hostile takeovers,
Monday's decision forcing Paramount Communications Inc. to end its
hostile $12.2 billion bid for Time ``provides a measure of calm to
the boardrooms of Delaware corporations,'' said James D. Cox, a law
professor at Duke University.
   ``There was a basically misguided malaise that Delaware was
needlessly and recklessly championing the cause of bidders and not
providing sufficient deference to incumbent management,'' Cox said.
   Now, Cox said, ``The idea is companies are allowed to formulate
business policies such as engaging in a large and costly
acquisition and to engage in those policies in the face of an offer
by an outsider.''
   The ruling Monday has broad implications across corporate
America. Many of the nation's biggest companies _ like Time,
Paramount and Warner _ are incorporated in Delaware and are subject
to its laws.
   Delaware's highest court upheld the decision by Chancery Court
Judge William T. Allen that the Time-Warner deal, which was
announced three months before Paramount launched its bid in June,
was the result of long-term business planning and neither Paramount
nor Time shareholders could interfere.
   Paramount contended that by agreeing to merge with Warner, Time
effectively put itself up for sale and should have been forced to
consider Paramount's hostile buyout offer.
   The three-judge Supreme Court announced its ruling from the
bench, and was to issue a written opinion at some point in the
future.
   Delaware's exact position will be determined by the written
opinion, Cox said, but ``the line has been more clearly drawn in
the sand as a result of the court's decision and in the facts'' of
the Time case.
   ``I would be mildly surprised if there were any substantial
changes in the rhetoric or principles from those announced in
Allen's decision,'' Cox said.
   Michael Bradley, a University of Michigan law professor, agreed
that the Supreme Court would ``rubber-stamp'' Allen's decision,
which he said ``came came away with no basic principles changed, no
new trends.''
   However, Bradley said, Allen did limit the ability of hostile
bidders to attack companies and broadened the power of directors to
defend against unwanted offers.
   After Allen's decision, ``a merger per se is not viewed as a
defensive tactic,'' Bradley said. ``A merger is seen as an ongoing
operating strategy of the firm and that does not constitute putting
the firm on the block.''
   ``You can pursue those long-range goals without fear of throwing
yourself into the ring,'' Bradley said.
   Bernard Black, a professor at the Columbia University School of
Law, said the Supreme Court's support for Allen's ruling was
consistent with Delaware's middle-of-the-road approach to takeovers.
   Bradley said Allen's ruling ``follows the business judgment rule
that Delaware has long afforded corporate officers.'' The business
judgment rule is a legal concept that generally allows decisions
taken by a board of directors to stand undisturbed if they were
made in good faith.
   Delaware courts were criticized in the past year by legal
experts after decisions that aided successful hostile bids for such
companies as Macmillan Inc. and Pillsbury Co.
   But Black said the state's support for the takeover defense
known as the ``poison pill'' and its strong anti-takeover statute
already have given management more muscle in fighting unwanted bids.
   ``Put those two together and you have to say the overall balance
has shifted fairly strongly in favor of targets,'' Black said,
noting that more companies are successfully fending off hostile
bids.
   Observers expect the Delaware courts to deal with cases similar
to the Time-Paramount battle again in the future.
   For example, companies likely will claim an unwanted bid
interferes with their long-range plans. Michael Klein, an attorney
representing some of Time's shareholders, predicted after Monday's
ruling that lawyers will advise corporations to develop an
``appearance of a long-term plan'' to ward off potential takeovers.
   As companies try to use long-term plans as a shield, the
Delaware courts likely will be called upon to decide in each case
whether such a strategy is a reasonable.

   The stock market settled for a mixed finish in
moderately active trading Tuesday, struggling in the face of a
setback for technology issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed with a minor loss
of 1.90 at 2,583.08 after sporting a gain of more than 18 points at
noon on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by

Exchange-listed stocks, with 772 up, 684 down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board picked up to 179.27 million
shares from 136.26 million on Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 210.79 million shares.
   Stock prices displayed strength in the early going as bargain

<BYLINE>Cotton Rallies To 22-Month High ^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices rose sharply Tuesday, reaching a 22-month
high on the New York Cotton Exchange amid continuing concerns about
the size and quality of the U.S. cotton crop.
   On other markets, soybean futures prices fell for the fourth
straight day; energy futures were lower; livestock and meat were
mostly lower; and precious metals were narrowly mixed.
   Cotton settled .15 cent lower to 1.33 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 74.40 cents a pound, the
highest settlement for a near-month contract since Sept. 25, 1987.
   Heavy rains in the spring and early summer delayed cotton
planting in the Mississippi Delta region and the Texas high plains,
reducing planted acreage to 10.5 million acres from 12.5 million in
1988.
   Despite improvement in the weather since then, expectations for
an extremely small cotton crop persist.
   Those fears were reinforced by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's July 12 crop report, in which the government lowered
its estimate for cotton stocks on July 31, 1990, the end of the
1989-90 marketing year, to 4.5 million bales from the previous
month's estimate of 6.5 million bales.
   ``That is still in people's minds and they see this thing as
really not improving much,'' said Ernest Simon, a cotton-market
analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It's a
small crop and there's a saying in the cotton business that small
crops get smaller.''
   Soybean futures prices fell for the fourth straight day on the
Chicago Board of Trade on bearish weather forecasts and a
government report showing improved crop conditions.
   ``We are in the throes of a weather market, which is usual for
this time of year,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in New
York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The USDA's weekly crop-condition report, issued late Monday,
showed overall improvement in the corn and soybean fields,
especially in Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota, where dry weather had
stressed the crops.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast calling for
normal temperatures and normal rainfall in the Midwest early next
week also prompted selling, analysts said.
   The wheat market generally followed corn and soybean futures
lower, he said.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with September
at $3.86\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with
September at $2.28} a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower
with September at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were } cents to 7 cents
lower with August at $6.61 a bushel.
   Energy futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange
on expectations for a bearish weekly inventory report from the
American Petroleum Institute. But the report, which was issued
after the close, showed a 1.4-million-barrel decline in crude-oil
stocks. The API also said gasoline stocks fell 1.5 million barrels
in the past week while distillate stocks dropped by 800,000 barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 21 cents
lower with September at $18.54 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent
to 1.7 cents lower with August at 49.42 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to 1.09 cents lower with August at 52.07
cents a gallon.
   Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
a continuing sell-off stemming from Friday's USDA cold-storage
report, which showed supplies of frozen pork bellies at near-record
levels. Cattle futures retreated moderately.
   Live cattle settled .32 cent to .45 cent lower with August at
72.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent lower
with August at 83.67 cents a pound; hogs were .95 cent lower to .12
cent higher with August at 45.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent to 1.20 cents lower with August at 27.95 cents a
pound.
   Gold finished nearly unchanged on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Prices were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with August at $374.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.6 cent higher with September at
$5.26 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Sears Net Income Up 21 Percent in Second Quarter, Including One-Time
Gain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. on Tuesday reported a 21
percent increase in its second-quarter earnings, although net
income for its core Merchandise Group rose only 2.5 percent during
the period.
   For the three months ended June 30, net income totaled $391.2
million, or $1.11 a share, on revenue of $13.28 billion. That
compared with earnings of $322.2 million, or 85 cents a share, on
revenue of $12.16 billion during the comparable period last year.
   Net income for the period included $56.3 million from
discontinued operations, reflecting a net gain of $54.9 million
from the sale of the commercial division of the Coldwell Banker
Real Estate group, Sears said.
   That sale was part of a restructuring plan that also includes
the planned sale of the 110-story Sears Tower and the relocation of
the Merchandise Group to suburban Hoffman Estates from downtown
Chicago.
   Last year's second quarter included a $16.1 million loss from
discontinued operations.
   Sears flagship Merchandise Group, which accounts for the bulk of
the company's profit and revenue, reported second quarter income
rose 2.5 percent to $161.6 million on a 7 percent increase in
revenue to $7.71 billion.
   Allstate Insurance Group reported second quarter income of
$199.8 million compared to $190.6 million a year ago, which
included a $19.5 million loss from the discontinued life-health
operation.
   Dean Witter Financial Services Group, which includes Sears'
Discover credit card business, reported second quarter income of
$44.5 million, up from $10.9 million a year ago. Discover Card
operations resulted in income of $16.6 million for the period,
compared with $100,000 a year ago.
   Coldwell Banker Real Estate group had income of $46.4 million _
including the gain from the sale of the commercial division _
compared with $18.5 million in the same period last year, Sears
said.
   ``Although there were signs of slowing economic activity in the
second quarter, the factors which most directly affect the consumer
continue to be positive,'' said Edward A. Brennan, Sears' chairman
and chief executive officer. He said low unemployment, modest
inflation growth and growing real disposal income as some factors.
   Some retail analysts had predicted Sears would show a decrease
in overall earnings due to the initial costs associated with its
restructuring.
   John Landschultz of Cowen &amp; Co. in Chicago, said ``I think that
the retailing operation did better than expected,'' given the
restructuring.
   ``Sears has been in the middle of change, very rapid internal
change, and that generally adds to costs,'' Landschultz said. ``So
I think that...some of the benefits are starting to come in'' from
the restructuring.
   The earnings report ``indicates that they are making progress''
toward the cost-cutting goal, said Monroe Greenstein, an analyst
with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   Greenstein also said the improved figures were better than
expected.
   Sears announced the restructuring plan last fall, designed to
enhance its stock price and focus the retailer's resources on
consumer-oriented businesses.
   The sale of the Sears Tower is still being negotiated, but
Fairweather did not provide details.
   The plan also includes ``everyday low pricing'' at its 825
retail stores, instead of special sale days.

   Sales of domestically made cars and trucks rose
2.4 percent in mid-July despite a sizable decline in Chrysler
Corp.'s car sales, the nation's automakers reported Tuesday.
   The data indicated that the auto industry may be settling at a
lower overall sales level than in 1988 but that a decline so far
this year may have ended.
   The eight major automakers based in the United States said they
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 39,726 during the
July 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 38,807 during
the same period last year.
   A 3.8 percent gain in truck sales was slowed by a 1.5 percent
increase in car sales.
   ``The industry has settled in at a lower level here than '88 on
average,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New
York. ``It's stopped falling off the cliff, it's stopped its free
fall.''
   The results came despite an 18.5 percent decline in Chrysler's
car sales. Merlis said the nation's No. 3 automaker, whose car line
is weighted toward smaller cars, is being stung by a slowdown in
that segment of the market.
   ``What we're seeing here is their exposure to the smaller car
downturn,'' Merlis said.
   Ford Motor Co.'s domestic car sales during the period dropped
2.4 percent and General Motors Corp.'s fell 1.4 percent. Truck
sales by each of the Big Three helped push up their overall sales
figures.
   Ford's trucks sold at a 4.2 percent better clip in mid-July this
year over last year. Chrysler's were up 4.1 percent and GM's
increased by 3.1 percent.
   The results, said John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New
York, ``are definitely better than we have had in the last several
months.''
   Through the first 20 days of the month, cars and trucks have
sold at a rate 5 percent above last year. Sales typically flatten
in the third quarter as manufacturers shut plants to retool for the
coming model year, which begins every Oct. 1, and as they sell the
last of the current model year's cars.
   This year, automakers have offered incentives and there has been
widespread speculation of price increases for 1990 models, both of
which can fuel sales late in the model year.
   Kirnan also said some of the sales reported this month may be
``borrowed'' from later on in the year, as consumers take advantage
of incentives now and avoid price increases later.
   ``I'm more convinced that the sales numbers that we are seeing
in the last 20 days in July are probably coming at the expense of
the fourth quarter and the first quarter (of 1990) ahead,'' he said.
   Incentives have been in place for much of this calendar year.
But they have not generated the kind of consumer interest
automakers desired.
   Through July 20 of this year, car and truck sales were running
at a rate 4 percent behind last year's rate. Car sales were down
5.3 percent and truck sales were off 1.8 percent.
   Chrysler's car sales so far this year were running 14.8 percent
behind last year's pace. The company's truck sales were up 4.1
percent during mid-July this year and down 0.4 percent for the year.
   Ford's year-to-date car sales were 8.6 percent lower that last
year. Its truck sales were up 3.1 percent in mid-July and down 2.4
percent for the year.
   GM's car sales for the year were running 8.6 percent behind the
1988 pace. Its truck sales were up 3.1 percent in mid-July and down
2.4 percent for the year.

   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader
Carey J. Maultasch on Tuesday was barred permanently from the
securities industry for his part in Wall Street's biggest insider
trading scandal.
   Maultasch, 37, once a senior trader under junk bond financier
Michael Milken, the former chief of Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based high yield bond department, settled civil securities
fraud charges in April without admitting or denying guilt.
   As part of the settlement, the Securities and Exchange
Commission instituted an administrative proceeding _ to which
Maultasch previously had agreed _ barring him permanently from
associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser or
investment company.
   ``Previously it was announced that the settlement had been
reached,'' said Teresa A. Koncick, a branch chief with the SEC's
enforcement division. ``This means it is now official.''
   Maultasch was not required to pay any fines or other financial
penalty as part of the settlement. He has not been charged
criminally.
   ``Mr. Maultasch is now obviously out of the securities business,
as he has been for some time,'' said a Maultasch lawyer, Aubrey B.
Harwell Jr., of Nashville, Tenn.
   Harwell said Maultasch was trying to organize a business but
declined to say what kind.
   Another Maultasch lawyer, Reid Weingarten of Washington,
declined to say where Maultasch, formerly of New York, was now
living.
   The SEC charged Maultasch and other Drexel employees, including
Milken, with secretly scheming to break securities laws with jailed
stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, and
Maultasch agreed to settle the SEC charges late last year in New
York. Approval of the settlements by U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack was delayed until June 20 because of a legal challenge by
Milken's lawyers.
   Milken and his brother, Lowell, another former Drexel employee,
who also was charged in the SEC lawsuit, were indicted March 29 on
racketeering and securities fraud charges. They have proclaimed
their innocence and vowed to fight both the civil and criminal
charges.
   Both Milkens have resigned from Drexel. The firm had agreed to
fire them as part of its settlement with the SEC, which also placed
Drexel under strict supervision. Drexel neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing in the SEC settlement.
   The firm also has agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts
and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.

   Supercomputer leader Cray Research Inc. on
Tuesday lowered revenue projections for the year and reported a 75
percent drop in second-quarter earnings.
   The company posted profits of $4.4 million, or 15 cents a share,
compared with $19.1 million, or 61 cents a share, in the second
quarter of 1988. Sales fell about 4 percent to $128.2 million from
$134.3 million.
   President Marcelo A. Gumucio had predicted 10 percent growth in
revenues for 1989, but on Tuesday he said sales for the year are
likely to remain flat. Cray's 1988 sales were $756.3 million.
   ``While we continue to expect a very strong performance in the
second half of the year, our most realistic outlook now is to
maintain revenues for the full year in line with 1988,'' Gumucio
said. ``With this revised revenue outlook, our earnings will
continue to be under pressure.''
   Cray stock closed Tuesday at $44.12{ cents a share, down 75
cents a share.
   Gumucio said contract signings have been delayed because of
``competitive and economic conditions.'' He also said there has
been a shift in product mix ``to more used systems and less new
systems.''
   Cray's earnings for the first six months were $5.9 million, or
20 cents a share, compared with $45.5 million, or $1.46 a share,
for the same period a year ago. Sales dropped to $244.3 million
from $280.2 million.
   ``We have been successfully controlling expenses, and will
continue to do so,'' Gumucio said. ``It is not likely, however,
that expense control will offset other factors.''
   Gumucio said those factors include a reduction in profit margins
due to a higher amount of trade-in allowances and the retirement of
older, returned systems. Also a problem are ``substantial''
increases in engineering and development expense related to the
Cray-3 project _ a developing line of supercomputers designed by
founder Seymour Cray, Gumucio said.
   Cray's project will be spun off into a separate company, but the
change won't occur for several months, Gumucio said. In the first
six months of 1989, the Cray-3 project cost about $20 million.

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines said Tuesday it will
fall short of its originally announced flight schedule for Aug. 1,
but will be on track by Aug. 15.
   ``We made those projections four or five months ago ... the fact
that you're off on the target date by two weeks is not going to
cause anybody concern,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.
   Eastern, which struggled to fly 100 flights daily in the first
weeks after its three unions struck March 4, said it will increase
a July schedule of 225 daily flights to 350 on Aug. 1 and to 390
flights on Aug. 15. Eastern has said it can rebuild without the
unions and plans by year's end to build up to 800 flights compared
to nearly 1,100 daily before the strike.
   The company also announced leasing of five planes and crews from
its Texas Air Corp. sister carrier, Continental Airlines, to help
with the August schedule.
   ``The company announcement says what we've said all along: They
don't have the pilots to meet their Aug. 1 schedule,'' pilots union
spokesman Hank Weber said.
   Most of Eastern's creditors have expressed approval of the
company's rebuilding plans. The unions are backing a buyout bid by
Chicago options trader Joseph Ritchie.
   Weber said his union would challenge the use of Continental
flight crews as a violation of its pilots union contract. He also
said renting planes and crews from Continental was another example
of ``upstreaming'' Eastern cash to the parent Texas Air.
   Eastern also gave figures Tuesday saying it was well ahead of
projections on passenger boardings and seat miles flown. Matell
said Eastern is flying at more than 80 percent capacity.
   ``One thing they fail to say is they're making money,'' Weber
said, saying Eastern may be luring passengers with such fares as
$39 one way between Atlanta and several cities, but is losing money.
   The pilots remain skeptical that Eastern can reach its
rebuilding goals, he said.
   ``Admittedly, we were off target by two weeks,'' Matell said,
blaming ``minor bottlenecks that developed in the training'' and
saying a minor adjustment was to be expected with such a schedule
boost.
   Eastern is giving full assurances to travel agents and
passengers that it will meet its Aug. 15 schedule, Matell said. He
didn't have details on which flights were being delayed from Aug. 1
to Aug. 15.
   He said no other airline has attempted to rebuild the way
Eastern has, with such a large number of new pilots.
   Frank Causey, Eastern vice president for flight operations, said
325 veteran Eastern pilots have crossed union picket lines, 260
pilot recruits have completed training, and 680 recruits are still
in training. Eastern said 107 of the recruits enrolled this week,
and that there were 19 pilot cross-overs Monday.
   Only about 200 of the 3,600 Air Line Pilots Association pilots
crossed picket lines at the strike's beginning.

<HEAD>High-Tech Communications Closing In On Dick Tracy Two-way Wrist Radio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks who want the latest stay-in-touch device
soon can get a wrist beeper that brings high-tech communications
one step closer to the ultimate _ Dick Tracy's two-way wrist
TV-radio.
   Actually, Motorola Inc. was ``thinking more of James Bond than
Dick Tracy'' when it developed its Wrist Watch Pager with Timex
Corp., spokeswoman Pat Schod said Tuesday from the company's
suburban Schaumburg headquarters.
   ``We've been developing this for a long time,'' Ms. Schod said
of the device, which combines a telephone number-display pager with
a digital watch.
   Tracy has been relying on his futuristic marvel _ as he stalks
such underworld unworthies as Pruneface and B.B. Eyes _ since the
hatchet-nosed, steely-eyed, comic-strip cop began pounding his beat
in 1931.
   Still, the wrist pager will be available soon, Motorola says,
while most experts don't expect Dick Tracy's two-way TV-radio to
hit the market before the 21st century.
   Motorola's wrist pager is expected to go on the market in the
first half of 1990 from the company's robotics-assembly plant at
Boynton Beach, Fla., Ms. Schod said.
   She said she did not know how much it woudl cost, although the
device likely will be marketed in the three-figure price range.
   The black pager ``looks like a sports watch'' and weighs less
than two ounces, about the same as a regular watch, Ms. Schod said.
It operates for more than 40 days on one battery.
   As with other types of paging devices, a caller dials the number
assigned to the pager and gets a beeping tone, at which point the
caller enters his telephone number. A beep alerts the wearer to the
calls.
   The wrist pager can store up to eight numbers from incoming
callers, along with the time the calls came in, and shows the
numbers on its liquid crystal display watch face at the touch of a
button.
   There are other compact pagers on the market _ Motorola offers
one beeper about the size of a pen _ but this would be the first in
the convenient wrist watch form, Ms. Schod said.
   The device combines the know-how of Middlebury, Conn.-based
Timex, maker of the nation's best-selling watches, and Motorola,
one of the world's leading manufacturers of electronic equipment,
systems and components, such as two-way radios, cellular telephones
and systems, and data communications and information processing and
handling equipment.
   Motorola handed the electrical design for merging the two
functions, while Timex _ which plans to offer a similar product in
two years _ focused on the timepiece. The companies worked together
on the pager's design and function.

<HEAD>Fleet Prices Heading Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fleet prices for 1990-model Ford and Chrysler
cars will increase as much as 9 percent, a possible sign of things
to come at showrooms.
   If the fleet increases are carried over to the retail market, as
automakers may decide to do later this year, incentives could take
the edge off the higher prices for consumers.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. on Monday released their fleet
prices, the amount automakers charge their largest customers who
order cars by a certain date. General Motors Corp. has not released
its fleet prices.
   If retail prices eventually are set lower, fleet customers get a
rebate.
   Automakers have said in the past that year-to-year price
increases have resulted from the addition of more standard
equipment. For the 1990 model year, the Big Three will equip all or
part of their fleets with driver-side air bags.
   Ford has estimated the device will add $350 to $700 to the price
of a new car. It expects to install 1 million air bags during the
1990 model year.
   Chrysler, which is equipping its million-car fleet with air
bags, said its fleet price will increase an average of $500 a car.
   GM President Robert Stempel said last week that air bags would
boost the price of a car by at least $500, and a replacement air
bag would cost consumers about $1,000. About 500,000 GM cars will
have the air bags as standard equipment.
   Last year, retail car prices went up 2 percent to 3 percent.
Part of the increase for 1990 models probably will be offset by
continued cash incentives, which now range from a few hundred
dollars to $4,000 per car on nearly all automobiles made by the Big
Three and some overseas companies.

<HEAD>Eds: Subs 3rd graf with 2 grafs to UPDATE with talks recessing.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUFFIELD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the United Mine Workers and
Pittston Coal Group Inc. resumed talks Tuesday without the union's
top negotiator because he was arrested for leading a sit-in against
a Pittston plant.
   Bruce Bratten, administrative assistant to UMW Vice President
Cecil Roberts, filled in as talks to end the 3{-month-old strike
resumed after a three-day break.
   The UMW sent four negotiators into a Duffield motel. They were
joined by two Pittston representatives. The two sides met in
adjoining rooms, with a mediator shuttling between them. After
Tuesday's talks, negotiations recessed until Friday.
   UMW Internatonal Secretary Treasurer John Banovic said the
company had not responded to the proposal the union offered Friday.
   Talks were expected to focus on a union proposal offered before
negotiations recessed Friday. The union said the proposal would
address the company's need for miners to work Sundays if Pittston
would consider the UMW's job-security concerns.
   The talks, which began a week ago at the urging of a federal
judge, ended a six-week hiatus in negotiations. The labor dispute
has idled about 1,900 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky.
   Earlier Tuesday, Roberts led a group of of union miners in a
sit-in at Pittston's Moss No. 3 preparation plant to protest what
he described as one-sided treatment the union has been receiving
from local officials. State police arrested 19 people.
   Roberts was charged with obstructing traffic. Federal marshals
enforcing U.S. District Judge Glen Williams' orders limiting
picket-line activity at Pittston operations took Roberts into
custody.
   State Police Sgt. Mike Frank said Roberts and the other miners
were taken to the Appalachian Correctional Unit near Honaker for
processing. Bob Beck, director of the correctional unit, said the
miners were still being processed Tuesday afternoon.
   Frank said state police also had received scattered reports of
strike-related vandalism. He said two vehicles owned by a
replacement worker in Buchanan County were damaged by gunfire. No
one was injured.
   Also, windows were broken and doors were damaged at a
convenience store in Dickenson County, Frank said. Jackrocks _
nails welded together and used to cause flat tires _ were found in
the parking lot, he said.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices declined in moderate trading
Tuesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil,
fell 20 cents to close at $18.54 a barrel. On Monday the contract
lost 77 cents. Contracts for later delivery recorded smaller
declines.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for August delivery
declined 1.09 cents to finish at 52.07 cents a gallon, while No. 2
heating oil for August ended the day at 49.42 cents a gallon, down
0.17 cent. Other contract months also declined.
   The crude market strengthened in the morning on what analysts
said was profit-taking after Monday's sharp declines.
   But bearish sentiment set in late in the session and another
wave of selling resumed.
   Crude prices began falling last week after hovering in the $20
range for several weeks. A decline in gasoline demand reflected by
a buildup of inventory have helped weaken the market.
   Other factors, including a possible end to the coal strike in
the Soviet Union, has added to the decline, analysts said. An end
to the strike has eased fears that the boycott could spread to the
oil sector, they said.

   House investigators said Tuesday their probe
of Internal Revenue Service involvement in eight cases, starting
with a dispute between jeans makers, uncovered widespread
wrongdoing by the criminal divison of the nation's tax agency.
   Investigators Leonard Bernard and Richard Stana said the
Washington headquarters of the service showed a ``serious failure''
to ``effectively manage employee integrity programs.''
   ``Our investigation revealed, for example, that on a number of
occasions, IRS national office officials at the highest levels
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in Washington,
D.C. and elsewhere,'' Stana told the House Government Operations
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, for whom
he and Bernard worked.
   Additionally, underlings at the agency feared retaliation if
they blew the whistle on their superiors, said the investigators.
   ``If improvements are needed we are interested in making the
improvements,'' said Ellen Murphy, director of public affairs for
the IRS. ``We and the subcommittee are headed in the same
direction.''
   The investigators' testimony opened three days of hearings by
the subcommittee. IRS officials were to testify Wednesday and
Thursday.
   Bernard and Stana said at the outset that the vast majority of
IRS employees, including senior officials, understand the
importance of high ethical standards. They admitted that their
probe was limited to a small fraction of the activities of the
Criminal Investigative Division.
   ``However,'' they said, ``the abuses we found underscore the
lack of intensive management review and internal auditing of CID
programs and operations.''
   As the two investigators described it, the fight between the
Jordache and Guess? jeans companies was a tale of limousines,
parties and promises of highly paid jobs revolving around the
former chief of the division's Los Angeles office, Ronald Saranow.
   ``What our investigation disclosed was a powerful criminal
investigation chief who, together with a cadre of loyal
subordinates, was beyond the control of his regional commissioner
and the IRS commissioner in Washington,'' they investigators said.
   The subcommittee's eight cases included two others involving
Saranow and five others involving some senior officials from all
seven IRS regions, including an unidentified official who allegedly
used an IRS undercover boat for a Fourth of July beer party,
improperly paid for with government funds.
   In all, more than 200 interviews were conducted and over 25,000
documents examined, said the investigators.
   Murphy said the IRS would have no comment about specific cases
because of privacy laws coverning taxes.
   Stana said Saranow was approached in 1985 by the originators and
50 percent owners of Guess? jeans, the Marciano brothers of Los
Angeles, Paul, George, Armand and Maurice, with information the
Marcianos said revealed tax fraud by their business partners.
   The partners were the Nakash brothers of New York, Joe, Ralph
and Avi, owners of Jordache Enterprises. The Nakash brothers had
bought 50 percent of Guess? from the Marcianos in 1983.
   When the Marcianos took their allegations to the IRS, they were
involved in heated litigation with the Nakashes to get back that 50
percent.
   The subcommittee investigators said the Marcianos' information
was of ``dubious value and questionable quality'' and never
properly evaluated, but Saranow pursued an aggressive two-year
investigation of the Nakashes anyway, though never turning up a
criminal violation.
   ``We believe the evidence demonstrates that the Marcianos
exercised unusual influence over Ronald Saranow by cultivating a
strong personal and social relationship with him and by offering
him a six-figure salary,'' said Stana and Bernard.
   The Marcianos deny ever offering jobs to Saranow.
   Saranow eventually retired from the IRS and never took a job
with Guess?
   The subcommittee investigators said IRS headquarters officials
entrusted an investigation of Saranow to a woman well known to have
a ``close personal relationship'' with him.
   Russell Davis, an IRS inspector, told Bernard and Stana he was
being pressured to close down the entire matter.
   Davis said he didn't think there would have been any internal
investigation at all if it had not been for an article about
Saranow's relationship with the Marcianos in the November 1987
edition of Forbes magazine, which Stana called ``disturbing.''

<HEAD>J&amp;J Reports 9.6 Percent Increase in Earnings for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong sales of Johnson &amp; Johnson's
disposable contact lenses and a new prescription antihistamine
helped boost the health products giant's second-quarter earnings by
9.6 percent, the company said Tuesday.
   Earnings increased to $297 million, or 89 cents a share, from
$271 million, or 79 cents a share, in the same period of 1988.
Per-share earnings reflect a 2-for-1 stock split.
   Revenue totaled $2.39 billion, up 4.4 percent from 1988
second-quarter sales of $2.29 billion.
   For the first six months of 1989, J&amp;J reported earnings of $614
million, or $1.84 per share, compared with 1988 six-month earnings
of $550 million, or $1.60 per share. Sales totaled $4.84 billion,
up from $4.6 billion in the 1988 period.
   The second-quarter performance was helped by newly developed and
marketed products, including the disposable contact lens Acuvue and
Hismanal, a once-a-day antihistamine that is less sedating, said
Chairman Ralph S. Larsen.
   Soft sales hurt the performance of its consumer business,
including sanitary, health care, dental and baby products, J&amp;J said.
   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales rose 7.7 percent for the second
quarter.
   ``Our pharmaceutical product pipeline is very full,'' Larsen
said. ``In fact, we have more drugs under investigation than at any
other time in Johnson &amp; Johnson history.''

<HEAD>Mobil, Chevron Profits Down, Phillips, Sun Earnings Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp. said Tuesday its second-quarter profit fell 23
percent after a $140 million loss from the sale of its South
African operations.
   Chevron Corp.'s earnings also declined while Phillips Petroleum
Co. and Sun Co. said their net income improved.
   The companies reported that higher crude and gasoline prices and
a strong dollar affected the latest quarter's earnings.
   For the three-month period ended June 30, Mobil's earnings were
$401 million, or 98 cents a share, down from $519 million, or $1.26
a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter. Revenue was nearly flat at
$14 billion, compared with $13.95 billion at the same time last
year.
   Excluding the $140 million loss stemming from its previously
announced pullout from South Africa, New York-based Mobil said is
earnings would have totaled $541 million, 4 percent higher than the
same 1988 quarter.
   Chevron earnings were $404 million, or $1.18 a share, down 22
percent from $520 million, or $1.52 a share, in the 1988 second
quarter. The San Francisco-based company had $8.2 billion in
revenue, a 12 percent rise from $7.3 billion in the year-ago period.
   Chevron said its quarterly profit improved 11 percent after
adjusting both periods for special items and foreign exchange
effects. These reduced earnings by $10 million in the current
period while benefiting results in last year's second quarter by
$148 million.
   Phillips Petroleum said its earnings benefited from higher crude
oil prices, rising to $197 million, or 81 cents a share, from $170
million, or 72 cents a share. Sales for the Bartlesville,
Okla.-based company totaled $3.3 billion from $2.9 billion in the
1988 quarter, a gain of 14.5 percent.
   Sun Co.'s net income climbed to $105 million, or 98 cents a
share, from a net loss of $201 million, or $1.90 a share, in the
second quarter of 1988. Included in the last year's results were
special charges of $297 million after taxes associated with its
domestic exploration and production division, which Sun spun off to
shareholders Nov. 1.
   Excluding these special charges, the latest results would have
been up by $9 million or 9 percent, said the company, based in
Radnor, Pa. Revenue totaled $2.92 billion, up 20 percent from $2.43
billion a year ago.
   Higher crude prices helped oil companies' exploration and
production businesses but cut into refining and marketing profits.
In some cases, the higher cost of crude oil to refiners was offset
by a sharp hike in gasoline prices at the pump.
   Mobil announced April 28 that it was leaving South Africa after
90 years of doing business there. The oil giant said it sold
operations once valued at more than $400 million for about $165
million, including a refinery and commercial petroleum marketing
networks and 12 Mobil affiliates in South Africa, Namibia,
Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.
   Mobil, the second-largest U.S. oil concern behind Exxon Corp.,
was pressured to leave the racially divided nation because of
recent laws making it more difficult for U.S. companies to make
profits from operating in South Africa as well as legislation now
under consideration in Congress calling for a ban on U.S.
operations there.
   For the first six months of 1989, Mobil's profit totaled $830
million, or $2.02 a share, down 22 percent from $1.1 billion, or
$2.59 a share, in the 1988 period. The company's revenue edged up
to $28 billion from $27.9 billion.
   Excluding the South African loss, first-half profit would have
amounted to $970 million, down 9 percent from 1988.
   Mobil's earnings benefited from higher crude and foreign natural
gas prices as well as reduced financing expenses, improved U.S.
refining margins and higher chemical income, which included gains
from asset sales.
   Chevron said its first-half earnings fell 39 percent to $717
million, or 2.09 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $3.43 a share in
the first half of last year. Last year's earnings included a net
gain of $387 million from foreign exchange and asset sales, while
the current quarter benefit from these items totaled $12 million.
   Revenue in the first half totaled $15.9 billion, up from $14.8
billion in the year-earlier period.
   Phillips said its net income in the first half was $387 million,
or $1.59 a share, up 29 percent from $300 million, or $1.27 a
share, in the 1988 half. Revenue rose to $6.4 billion vs. $5.8
billion a year ago.
   The company said it benefited from higher crude prices, which
contributed to sharp gains in its exploration and production
businesses, as well as increased natural gas revenue. Gains from
higher gasoline prices were offset by higher costs of crude oil,
the company said.
   For the first half, Sun earned $186 million, or $1.74 a share,
compared with a loss of $141 million in the 1988 period. Revenue
totaled $5.6 billion, up 15 percent from $4.8 billion.
   Sun said improved earnings in its real estate subsidiary
contributed to the quarter's results but were partially offset by
declines in domestic operations due in part to a tax adjustment
that boosted earnings in last year's second quarter.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission said
Tuesday it fined USAir Inc. for deliberately jamming radio
communications of Eastern Airlines flights at Philadelphia
International Airport.
   Wayne T. McKee, an attorney in the commission's enforcement
division, said USAir and Jetstream International Airlines had been
fined $2,000 each for three incidents related to the lengthy strike
at Eastern.
   He said the disruptions were potentially very dangerous and have
occurred while plane crews talked by radio with control tower
personnel during taxiing, takeoffs and landings.
   ``It's traffic mainly on the ground, sometimes landing and
taking off _ that's really what creates the safety problem,'' McKee
said. He said the interruptions were sporadic but now seemed to
have escalated. ``That's one reason why we decided to quit taking
evidence and take some actions. It went from some brief
transmissions to actual jamming.''
   ``Some of the content of the communications ... indicates it's
related to the (Eastern) strike,'' McKee said.
   Eastern machinists struck the airline on March 4, and many
Eastern pilots have refused to cross picket lines.
   But McKee said Eastern still has been operating at least two
flights a day out of the Philadelphia airport.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI also are
investigating the radio disruptions and the FCC is discussing
possible criminal prosecutions with the U.S. attorney's office,
McKee said.
   Criminal penalties of up to $250,000 in fines and 10 years in
jail are possible for conviction of interfering with airport
communications.
   Similar incidents involving Eastern jets have occurred in
Atlanta and New York City, McKee said.
   He said he did not think anyone had been singled out for blame
yet, but that under FAA rules pilots are responsible for whatever
happens on their planes.
   USAir spokesman John Bronson said from Pittsburgh, `We are
investigating the matter internally and I can't elaborate.''
   The commission levied the maximum fines, $2,000, against both
USAir of Crystal City, Va., and Jetstream of Dayton, Ohio, on
Monday for three incidents, McKee said.
   A USAir plane was involved in one incident of deliberate jamming
of radio communications between an Eastern jet and the airport
control tower, while another USAir plane and a Jetstream aircraft
were involved in separate incidents of ``prohibited superfluous
transmissions.''
   He said the interference occurs when someone deliberately leaves
a microphone open, knocking out communications in planes nearby.
   ``The plane can't hear the tower over the jamming,'' he said.
   At the request of the FAA, the FCC deployed direction finders to
identify the aircraft involved. Their transmissions were recorded,
and their transmitters will leave a unique electronic fingerprint
for later identification.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legendary Betty Crocker received a cold
shoulder Tuesday when her creator, General Mills Inc., said it sold
the rights to two products that bear her name.
   Betty Crocker Brownie Sundae and Betty Crocker Gold Rush Bars
were sold to a New York-based investment group as part of the
group's purchase of Vroman Foods, a division of General Mills that
makes frozen confections.
   ``It's an absolutely fabulous trademark,'' said Thomas G. Dixcy,
president of Weatherly Frozen Food Group Inc., a division of the
investment group Weatherly Private Capital. ``Everyone knows Betty
Crocker.''
   No other Betty Crocker brands were sold in the transaction.
   Dixcy, former president of the company that makes the
market-leading Klondike ice cream bar, said General Mills also sold
frozen Yoplait yogurt as part of the deal. Terms were not disclosed.
   In its 1988 annual report, General Mills said Betty Crocker
Brownie Sundae was the company's leading new product for the 1988
season. The report also said annual unit volume in its frozen
novelties division grew 46 percent in 1988 on the strength of
Yoplait soft frozen yogurt single-serving packages.
   ``We are buying all of General Mills' freezer case products,''
said Thomas McFall of Weatherly Private Capital. ``We own the
exclusive rights to use the names.''

   Independent film producer Management Company
Entertainment Group Inc. said it plans to purchase London-based
film distributor Virgin Vision Ltd. for $83 million.
   The acquisition would greatly expand the operations of the
5-year-old MCEG in the lucrative overseas markets, giving it access

   In addition, Virgin Group will receive 5.4 million shares of
MCEG stock at $3.75 per share, making Virgin Group the largest
minority shareholder of MCEG, the company said.
   MCEG, involved in film production, marketing and talent
management, released ``The Chocolate War.'' Its upcoming releases
include ``Convicts'' with Robert Duvall and ``Boardwalk'' with

<HEAD>Marathon Leads Way To Higher Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said Monday its Marathon Oil Co.
subsidiary led the way as the parent company reported a 17 percent
increase in second quarter profit.
   Earnings rose to $250 million, or 91 cents per share, from $213
million, or 74 cents per share, in the 1988 period. Sales rose 16
percent to $5 billion, up from $4.3 billion in the 1988 quarter.
   Demand for refined oil products remained strong heading into the
summer driving season, the company said. Marathon's exploration and
production operations also performed well.
   USX's steel segment remained well into the black despite a
decline in operating income due to continued weakness in the market
for tubing used in oil and gas exploration.
   First half profit rose by $47.6 percent to $546 million, or $2
per share, from $370 million, or $1.26 per share. Sales grew by 13
percent to $9.41 billion from $8.3 billion in the first half of
1988.
   ``We've also improved our financial position since year-end 1988
by reducing financial obligations by a billion dollars,'' Chairman
Charles A. Corry said.
   Marathon's second-quarter operating income more than doubled
from $119 million on sales of $2.2 billion to $257 million on sales
of $2.9 billion for the comparable quarters.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas, USX's other energy industry holding, lost $13
million, $3 million less than in the year-ago quarter. Sales sagged
4.5 percent, from $201 million to $192 million.
   The company has blamed low natural gas prices for continuing
disappointment at TXO.
   Operating income in the company's steelmaking division, the
nation's largest steel producer, fell 23.3 percent, from $223
million to $171 million. Sales were flat at $1.6 billion.
   USX said it recorded income of $140 million from the sale of the
remaining 75 percent of its iron ore producer, Quebec Cartier
Mining Co., and the sale of half of its Lorain, Ohio, plant to Kobe
Steel in forming a joint venture.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips, Share Prices Hit New High</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar dipped against the Japanese yen in
early trading Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange closed the morning session at another high.
   The dollar opened at 141.50 yen, down 0.85 yen from the previous
day's close of 142.35 yen. It closed the morning session at 141.53
yen, moving in the range of 141.33 to 141.58 yen.
   The dollar closed at 141.60 yen in New York overnight, down from
Monday's finish of 142.55 yen.
   The dollar's movement followed trends in New York and European
markets Tuesday due to expectations that the second-quarter U.S.
gross national product figure, to be announced Thursday, would show
little economic growth, traders said.
   Such an indication usually discourages investors from buying a
nation's currency because it may lead to interest rate cuts, making
the currency less valuable.
   Securities firms and investment trust companies bought the
dollar for U.S. bonds to be issued in early August, said one dealer
with a commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other traders said investors were still reluctant to buy the yen
due to Japan's political uncertainties.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 159.69
points, or 0.46 percent, ending morning trading at 34,698.59. It
had gained 445.57 points for a record 34,538.90 Tuesday.
   ``The index started rising as soon as Mr. (Sousuke) Uno
announced his resignation,'' said a dealer with Nomura Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Prime Minister Uno announced Monday he will resign to take
responibility for a major defeat in a parliamentary election Sunday.
   In the election for half of the 252 seats in parliament's upper
house, Uno's governing Liberal Democratic Party won 36, losing its
majority for the first time in 34 years.
   The Nomura dealer also said a news report that the Labor
Ministry is to reduce income taxes related to rents prompted
participants to buy housing-related issues.
