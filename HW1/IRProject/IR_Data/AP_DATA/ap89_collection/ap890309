<TEXT>
   In an unusual move to avoid another
entertainment industry strike, the two largest actors unions
published their contract demands on Wednesday, two months before
negotiations with producers are set to open.
   The joint statement from the local board of the Screen Actors
Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
was conciliatory in tone, asking for many of the same contract terms
given to the Writers Guild of America following its six-month strike
last year.
   ``We are attempting to greatly accelerate the bargaining process
in order to keep production going at full steam,'' SAG negotiator
Ken Orsatti said in a statement. ``After last year's painful
writers' strike, we don't believe the industry can withstand another
major work stoppage.''
   The SAG-AFTRA release said the two guilds hoped to avert ``the
long, contentious bargaining process'' when their joint contract
with producers expires June 30.
   SAG-AFTRA negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers are scheduled to begin on May 15. Herb
Steinberg, a spokesman for the producers group, said that it would
have no comment on the SAG-AFTRA proposals.
   In their release, the actors unions said they would accept new
rules for overtime work and a new formula for rerun payments for
one-hour television programs. The guilds also asked that producers
raise minimum wages 4 percent each year in the three-year contract,
improve pension and health plans and revise the payment structure
for foreign television syndication.
   SAG, with roughly 70,000 members, is the nation's largest
performers union. The 68,000-member AFTRA is the second largest.

   A small earthquake shook part of the suburban
San Fernando Valley on Wednesday, authorities said.
   The 3:43 p.m. quake measured 3.1 on the Richter scale and was
centered five miles southwest of Van Nuys, said Robert Finn,
spokesman for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   Another little quake measuring 2.6 was recorded at 12:01 p.m.,
and was centered 10 miles northwest of Palm Springs, Finn said.
   It was too small to determine if it was on the San Andreas Fault,
which runs through the North Palm Springs area, he said. There were
no reports of damage or injury.
   Quakes of such magnitude usually don't cause damage in California.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion can
cause slight damage locally, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable
of tremendous damage.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franz Kafka is reappearing in print
in his native Prague after nearly 20 years. But Vaclav Havel, the
Czech dramatist well-known in the West, is in prison and his name is
nowhere to be found on shop or library bookshelves.
   Like much else in a nation caught between the pressures of Soviet
reform today and the Kremlin-imposed orthodoxy of the past,
Czechoslovak literature and the arts present a contradictory picture.
   Hesitant steps toward opening up the state-controlled arts have
returned a few previously unshown films _ including those by
Czech-born Academy Award-winner Milos Forman _ to the movie
theaters, put a handful of more daring plays on the stage and
``legalized'' some underground rock groups.
   This spring, Kafka's novels should go back on sale in Prague.
They had been banned under the Nazis, in the Stalinist 1950s and
were out of print again after the ``Prague Spring'' reforms were
crushed in 1968.
   Literary journals began publishing long articles on Kafka and
some of his notebooks last year, the first time in two decades the
author saw print apart from a collection of short stories published
for the 1983 centenary of his birth.
   But the new attitude to Kafka does not extend to anything or
anyone deemed a political challenge to the orthodox communists
installed by Moscow to rule after 1968. Michal Cernik, head of the
Czech Writers' Union, has said that emigre writers can be published.
   However, both he and official poet Karel Sys, editor of the
relatively outspoken literary weekly Kmen, referred swiftly to top
officials when asked in recent interviews if works by Havel or the
feted emigre writer Milan Kundera (``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being'') might appear soon in Prague.
   Communist party leader Milos Jakes, in a December interview with
the French daily Le Monde, spelled out why.
   ``Kundera is not a bad writer,'' Jakes said when asked whether
works written since Kundera went abroad in 1977 might be published
in Czechoslovakia. ``But he simply takes his specific attitude to us
and to socialism. ... We have many more such talents, but they ...
do not speak openly against socialism.''
   As an active member of the Charter 77 human rights group and a
writer who refuses to leave his homeland, Havel draws far more
official ire than any other cultural figure.
   He was arrested Jan. 16 and went on trial in February on charges
of sedition and obstructing a public official that could jail him
for 2{ years.
   The growing respect for the 52-year-old playwright among
intellectuals and others outside the tiny circle of active
dissidents inside Czechoslovakia is one explanation for the tough
move.
   Havel was feted when called to the stage at a folk music festival
in Lipnice last September, an action that later sparked official
reprisals against the festival host, music critic Jan Rejzek.
   He was the only dissident greeted by name _ with joyful chants of
``Long Live Havel'' _ when the authorities surprisingly permitted an
independent rally in Prague last Dec. 10.
   In contrast to the public silence in Czechoslovakia after Havel
and five other activists were jailed for subversion in 1979, his
January arrest prompted demonstrators in Prague to shout demands for
his release. More than 1,000 intellectuals who had never sided with
Havel in public before voiced the same demand in a letter urging the
communist authorities to open up to the society they rule.
   Further signs of a stirring in the arts are found in the Moravian
capital of Brno, where theater is far more lively than in Prague.
   But political activity carries its price in Brno, too. Eva
Vidlarova, an assistant director at a Brno theater, was detained in
December after organizing a petition to free another jailed cultural
activist, independent publisher Petr Cibulka.
   Fear of such repression leaves many Czech and Slovak
intellectuals wondering what to do to push for the greater freedom
most seek. Like many people in the Soviet bloc, they often retreat
into a private sphere of family, friends and interests. In that cozy
world, characterized by a leading economist as ``somewhere between
Nirvana and lethargy,'' they can pursue cultural activities for
small audiences or chase material comfort.
   In society at large, though, they must often work at jobs that
deaden initiative and cope with irritating consumer shortages _ once
rare in Czechoslovakia.
   As dissatisfaction mounts, official attempts at dialogue and
counsels of patience ring hollow to many.
   ``We know how bad the situation is,'' said Sys in an interview.
``We can discuss it for hours and days. But we live here and we have
to get out of it somehow.''
   There are extremes on both sides in the clash between the
communist authorities and independent groups, Sys said, advocating
dialogue as the solution.
   But intellectuals who attended a meeting with Prague Communist
party boss and Politburo member Miroslav Stepan after the petition
circulated on Havel said the increasingly isolated leadership still
seems unwilling to open up to the society it rules.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the bustling markets that line the
narrow, winding alleys and the muddy Kabul River, war always seems
just around the corner.
   Tanks with their guns fixed and armored personnel carriers block
intersections.
   Young soldiers clutching Kalashnikov rifles in one hand and
plastic prayer beads in the other patrol the streets and stand guard
on rooftops.
   Helicopter gunships chug along the snow-covered mountains lined
with radar installations.
   The Moslem guerrillas battling the forces of Afghanistan's
Soviet-style government are hiding beyond the ridges that form a
bowl around Kabul, the capital city of 2.25 million. They
periodically launch a few rockets into the capital.
   There's little feeling of imminent danger in the marketplaces,
where merchants wrapped in tattered brown shawls and dingy white
turbans sit cross-legged on the ground in front of huge piles of
fruits and vegetables.
   But rumor and speculation are as plentiful now as Russian caviar
and vodka were before the Soviet army pulled out last month.
   ``It's the weather. They (the guerrillas) are waiting for
spring,'' said one vendor, Zahir.
   ``It's the shura,'' added another, Ibrahim, referring to a
guerrilla meeting in Pakistan and suggesting the fighters are too
preoccupied setting up a government-in-exile to launch major
assaults.
   Moscow pulled out the last of its 115,000 troops and ended its
nine-year military involvement in Afghanistan on Feb. 15, leaving
the Afghan forces alone to battle the U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   The departure of the last Soviet soldier passed without much
notice in Afghanistan. Most people seemed more concerned about food
shortages and the lack of fuel to heat their mud brick homes on the
freezing winter nights.
   There were no official ceremonies and only the barest
acknowledgment by the Kabul government of the Kremlin's involvement
in a war that killed 13,000 Soviet soldiers.
   The Soviets have worked tenaciously to ensure that a friendly
government remains in power in Kabul, and they have backed several
ineffective measures aimed at drawing the rebels into a coalition
government.
   President Najib outlined what he called a government of national
reconciliation, urging unity with the guerrillas who have battled
the Kabul regime since a few party members engineered an April 1978
coup and began trying to radically alter the economic, social,
political and religious life of Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas rejected Najib's peace overtures and vowed to
destroy his government.
   The president has in turn tightened his grip on power.
   He declared a state of emergency and suspended many individual
rights. He purged his Cabinet of some members who were not from his
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, replacing them with his
most trusted advisers. And he placed the fate of the country in the
hands of a 21-member military council.
   The government said the actions did not close the door to
negotiations with the guerrillas.
   ``We have to move more cautiously now than ever. But we still
want negotiations. We want a rainbow coalition that represents all
segments of Afghan society,'' said Abdul Fatah Weidi, the Foreign
Ministry's information chief.
   Some diplomats and observers believe the guerrillas may be on the
threshold of power.
   But bitter divisions among the guerrilla factions are evident,
with some supporting establishment of a strict Islamic republic and
others supporting a more broadbased government.
   Many observers believe a power struggle similar to that which has
plagued Najib's party could break out among the guerrillas.
   Pressure has been increasing for policymakers from Western
countries to help mold the guerrillas into a more responsible,
coherent group. But observers in Kabul doubt it will happen.
   ``Outside interference in Afghanistan has historically been a
disaster _ both for the Afghans and for the outside powers. The
Russians ignored this reality,'' said one U.N. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Afghanistan was one of the world's poorest countries before civil
war erupted 10 years ago. Relief officials say it will take years
and billions of dollars just to restore it to its prewar state.
   They estimate they will need $1.6 billion for the first 18 months.
   The country has the world's lowest average life expectancy _ 42
years _ and the highest child mortality rate _ 30 percent of all
children die before the age of 5, according to UNICEF.
   Late last year, a U.N. convoy carrying wheat seeds and fertilizer
took off from Kabul for the guerrilla-controlled Panjsher Valley,
where thousands of farmers hoped to begin planting for the first
time in 10 years.
   It was the first such international effort and was a major test
of whether the country was stable enough to begin rehabilitation
work.
   Several hours outside Kabul, the convoy was hijacked by a rival
guerrilla group. Several U.N. staff members were taken hostage.
   Afghan and Soviet troops responded with tanks, artillery and air
bombardments.
   No was was injured, and the workers were released after four
days. But any illusions relief workers might have had about a quick
and easy end to the suffering were shattered.
   ``We were anxious to do some real rehabilitation work,'' said
Ross Mountain, deputy director of the U.N. Development Program.
   ``But we learned the hard way that there are many, many different
groups out there. It looks like things will have to shake down some
more,'' he said.

   It will be four years on March 11 since Mikhail
S. Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin, instituting a policy of
restructuring the Soviet system and bringing about a greater openess
of that closed society. Following is another in a series of reports
by AP correspondents in Moscow assessing those four years.

   After the Kuibishev food warehouse tied pay raises
to profits, the staff worked so much harder that management no
longer had to dragoon thousands of Muscovites from their usual jobs
to help sort vegetables at harvest time.
   At the Butovo building materials factory, director Mikhail
Bocharov turned a profit just months after being freed from the
Moscow ministry that controlled every kopeck. Bocharov shifted
extraneous workers to producing plank furniture and plastic toys and
plans to raise capital by selling stock to his staff.
   But Muscovites still line up on snowy streets for bruised,
half-frozen apples, because the fruit rots on the trains creeping
2,000 miles to the capital from Central Asia at an average speed of
15 mph. And Butovo's bricks still crack before they leave the
factory for lack of critical Western technology.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has changed so much in the Soviet
economy that bewildered citizens ask if he has given up on
communism. But the problems run so deep that his own economists say
they will need years to raise the low standard of living of the
average Soviet.
   ``To buy women's boots, you need 250 to 300 rubles (about $400 to
$483),'' complained war veteran A. Tabayakov in a letter to Pravda.
``My daughter, who needs them, is paid only 115 rubles ($185) a
month. Where is she supposed to get that kind of money?''
   Four years after Gorbachev took over as leader of the Communist
Party, meat and cheese are rationed in much of the country. Shelves
in state stores are empty, and citizens like Tabayakov's daughter
are forced to pay high prices to new cooperatives or the booming
black market to get essentials. Perestroika, or restructuring, is
getting the blame, Gorbachev admitted recently.
   The shortages are so pervasive they are undermining attempts at
reform.
   ``Wages and bonuses have no effect because the money received
cannot buy anything,'' said Soviet economist Nikolai Schmelov.
   Some Kremlin watchers doubt Gorbachev can repair decades of
damage fast enough to stave off collapse of the economy.
   ``The failure is critical,'' said Columbia University Soviet
expert Seweryn Bialer. ``It cannot go on indefinitely.''
   Conrad Miller, a Silver Spring, Md., computer salesman who spent
seven months exhibiting his products in cities like Minsk and
Tashkent said the people he met didn't share his optimism about
perestroika.
   ``They'd bite my head off, and say, `You do not know. Nothing
ever changes here,''' he said.
   Gorbachev is trying. He is, in fact, ripping the very fabric of
his communist society. He has rejected years of propaganda against
profits, and he is upsetting the cradle-to-grave security guaranteed
even the most worthless worker.
   He promises to revive family farms through long-term leasing of
state land. Currently, uninspired collective farmers can't even
choose their crops without approval from Moscow bureaucrats.
   But the problems Gorbachev inherited are monumental. Construction
firms take 11 years to complete a building. Less than 17 percent of
Soviet products meet world quality standards. The labor force has no
concept of such Western notions as initiative, hard work and
efficiency.
   Secret budget deficits hide many of the failings of a centrally
planned economy, in which an army of apparatchiks has been trying
vainly to allocate everything in the country, right down to the
number of turnips for Tiksi. Prices are still set by bureaucrats
with no regard for the cost of production or the demand for their
goods.
   Gorbachev says he is attacking the budget deficit with a 14
percent cut in defense spending, to be achieved by recalling Soviet
troops from Afghanistan and cutting 500,000 men from the Red Army.
He has halted water projects, including a plan to reverse the flow
of Siberia's mightiest rivers.
   Half the bureaucrats in the government and Communist Party are
slated to lose their positions, which raises the spectre of
unemployment, despite Gorbachev's insistence no one will be left
jobless. Already, at least 180,000 bureaucrats have been moved,
according to the official news agency Tass.
   Gorbachev's most dramatic success has been the legalization of
private cooperatives to provide consumer services in critically
short supply. Co-ops have mushroomed in two years to create 770,000
jobs, typically at more than twice the average salary, because
staffers share the profits.
   Inspired by Gorbachev's vision, military officers dream of
starting their own small businesses, and bureaucrats searching for
new niches in society attend classes in entrepreneurship and
marketing.
   However, Bialer said, Gorbachev also has made costly mistakes.
   The campaign to cut alcoholism by slashing the supply of vodka
cost $40 billion in taxes and revenues, according to Gorbachev's own
estimate. Most of that sum simply moved from the treasury to the
pockets of black marketeers and moonshiners, encouraging the same
sort of corruption spawned by Prohibition in the United States.
   If Gorbachev had started his reforms with agriculture, Bialer
said, he might have solved the critical food shortage by now.
   Instead, cooperative retail shops and services sprang up, and
they are using up scarce raw materials. In the city of Tallinn,
thousands of new co-op taxis eased a chronic transportation
shortage. Now, there's no gasoline, said Estonian Prime Minister
Indrek Toome.
   Gorbachev also has suffered costly bad luck: clean-up and repairs
from the Chernobyl accident and the Armenian earthquake are
estimated at $29.2 billion.
   The falling price of oil means the government must sell three
times as much of its major export to buy the same Danish ham as in
1985. As a result, imports of consumer goods have been slashed.
Coffee, for example, is now a luxury obtainable only through back
doors of restaurants from thieving employees.
   Soviet economists suggested eliminating central planning and
letting the market set prices and supply, but backed down for fear
price increases would spark bloody riots like the ones in Poland in
1970 that toppled Communist Party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka.
   Gorbachev says he wants to ease the shortages first and then let
prices float, to avoid soaring inflation on items such as
refrigerators and TV sets. But Western experts consider that
impossible. As long as prices are too low, they say, no one will
produce anything, and the shortages will remain.
   In the meantime, fear of the coming price reform has exacerbated
the Soviet hoarding habit and helped strip store shelves.
   Long before a market-driven economy can offer even a taste of the
overflowing markets of the West, Soviet citizens will feel its
dislocations. To reach such goals as high-technology jobs, full food
stores and quality consumer products, the Soviet Union must first
confront the pressures of unemployment, rising prices, and economic
disruption.
   Meanwhile, Gorbachev repeatedly tells his people, ``Give me
time.''

   A meningitis epidemic has killed 696
people in central and southern Ethiopia, a Health Ministry official
says.
   Tadelle Tedla, head of the ministry's epidemiology department,
said 9,005 cases were diagnosed by the end of last month and 3
million people had been vaccinated.
   He said on Wednesday that the regions most affected were Shewa,
with 3,000 cases and 54 deaths, and Sidamo and Gemmu Goffa with a
combined 2,900 cases and 169 reported deaths.
   At least 10 people died of the disease in Addis Ababa by the end
of last month and 203 cases were diagnosed in the capital, he added.
   ``We have the health infrustructure and experience in combating
the disease, but it will take some time to contain it effectively,''
Tadelle said.
   Tadelle acknowledged his statistics did not include figures from
``remote and inaccessible'' areas.
   Menigitis is caused by a virus and leads to inflamation of the
membrane surrounding the brain and the spinal cord.

   The Italian news agency ANSA has suspended its
transmissions because of a labor dispute with its teletype operators
over plans to have journalists transmit the news directly from
computer terminals.
   ANSA management said the agency shut down Wednesday night after
teletype operators began transmitting only press releases and not
news written by agency journalists. There was no immediate word on
when service would resume.
   An ANSA source, who asked not to be identified, said the teletype
workers have staged a work slowdown for several weeks to protest the
computerization plans.
   The source said the agency had planned to allow journalists to
begin transmitting news on its French, English and Spanish languages
services on March 16. The source said the agency did not yet plan to
use the system on its main Italian language service.
   The agency shut down for two days in February 1987 after
non-editorial employees struck over plans to introduce computer
terminals in the newsroom.

   A Pan American shuttle flight from New York
was forced to make an emergency landing Wednesday night at Norwood
Airport after pilots detected a vibration, a Federal Aviation
Administration official said.
   Pan Am Flight 794 from Kennedy International Airport landed in
Norwood at about 10:10 p.m. He said pilots heard a vibration and
requested a priority landing when the airplane was five miles south
of Norwood, said Michael Ciccarelli of the FAA.
   ``There were 48 people on board and Pan Am is now arranging to
put people in buses to bring them up to Boston,'' Ciccarelli said.
He said the plane has a capacity of 50 people.
   The FAA did not immediately know the cause of the vibration, but
Ciccarelli said the Dehavilland-7 four-engine aircraft landed safely
and was still at Norwood Airport when the control tower closed at 11
p.m.
   The plane will remain at Norwood until Pan Am and the FAA have a
chance to go over it, he said.

   Novelist E.L. Doctorow wondered what he did
wrong to deserve a state writing honor, and fellow award winner
Robert Creeley said he was glad he decided to become a poet instead
of a veterinarian.
   Doctorow got the Edith Wharton Citation of Merit and Creeley
received the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit at a ceremony Wednesday.
   The New York State Writers Institute presented the awards, which
are given every two years and carry a $10,000 stipend. Doctorow and
Creeley also will give two annual readings in the next two years in
the state.
   Doctorow said he was gratified to be declared a new state
resource, but wondered ``what I have done wrong to deserve it.''
   Such honors from official sources don't sit well with writers,
who prefer to be ``somewhere between the state bird and the
blasphemer with a price on his head,'' Doctorow said.
   Creeley said he once wanted to be a veterinarian ``because I
thought animals wouldn't mind my ineptitude as would people.'' But a
``tune in my head'' from which words later flowed drew him to
writing, said Creeley.
   Doctorow's books include the just published ``Billy Bathgate''
and ``World's Fair,'' winner of the 1986 National Book Award. His
novel ``Ragtime,'' winner of the 1976 National Book Critics Circle
Award, was acclaimed for its blending of real people, such as Harry
Houdini and Sigmund Freud, with Doctorow's own characters.
   Creeley's awards include two Guggenheim fellowships and the
Robert Frost Medal given by the Poetry Society of America. Creeley
is one of the founders of the Black Mountain school of poetry, which
uses sparse language and natural speech rhythms.
   The awards, instituted two years ago, are named for early 20th
century novelist Wharton, whose fiction revealed the hypocrisies of
New York City society, and the 19th century poet Whitman, a Long
Island native.

   Princess Diana marked National No Smoking Day by
visiting lung cancer patients at a London hospital and wishing good
luck to smokers trying to kick the habit.
   The princess, who has banned smoking at her Kensington Palace
home and is a patron of the British Lung Foundation, handed out fake
cigarettes containing lists of helpful hints on how to quit.
   Up to a third of Britain's 14.7 million smokers were expected to
try to give up cigarettes Wednesday. On National No Smoking Day last
year, 2.7 million did their best not to light up.
   ``Good luck to all the people who are giving up smoking today,''
the princess told patients at St. Bartholomew's Hospital.

<HEAD>`Sam the Hammer' Makes a Quick Name for Himself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Samuel Knox Skinner breezed into President
Bush's Cabinet as one of its least-known members, Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., advised the new transportation secretary: ``Don't let them
shove you around.''
   ``I'm not going to take a back seat,'' said Skinner.
   Indeed he hasn't. The man known back in Chicago as ``Sam the
Hammer'' has quickly made a name for himself on the White House
varsity, even as some of its more familiar players are still
reviewing their game plans.
   In short, Skinner soared from obscurity when Eastern Airlines got
stuck on the ground, a happenstance due in no small measure to his
insistence that the carrier's brutal labor-management battle be
allowed to take its natural course, and soon.
   To the dismay of Eastern's employees and all of big labor,
Skinner and the president refused to intervene on the eve of the
machinists' union strike last Saturday, despite a mediation board's
recommendation that a presidential emergency panel be named to
attempt to settle the longstanding dispute. Under the law, that
would have precluded any work stoppage for an additional 60 days.
   ``This dispute has been going on for 17 months,'' Skinner
declared. ``It's time we get it resolved. There was no guarantee
that in 60 days we're going to be any better off than we are now.''
   Some analysts believe that virtually guarantees the imminent
collapse of Eastern and the loss of jobs and pension benefits for
thousands of employees who had hoped for government help in their
battle against the payroll-cutting tactics of Eastern's owner, Frank
Lorenzo.
   Skinner further piqued labor's anger when he served notice that
the administration would battle secondary picketing and sympathy
strikes elsewhere in the transportation sector, despite a 1967
Supreme Court decision which sanctioned such efforts. And, without
taking formal action, he has criticized the ``by-the-rules''
slowdown of pilots for other airlines.
   Actual work stoppages at non-Eastern sites, Skinner vows, will be
met with an attempt to persuade Congress to enact a statutory
prohibition ``that's on my desk, ready to go up to the Hill in five
minutes, if necessary.''
   Meanwhile, Skinner has spurned congressional appeals to rethink
the option of a presidential emergency board. Instead, he has
relayed veto threats over a House committee's bill to force Bush to
appoint such a panel.
   Union officials say Skinner is following precisely the
tough-on-labor pattern established by one of his predecessors, Drew
Lewis, early in Ronald Reagan's first term, when the administration
fired thousands of air traffic controllers who went on strike.
   William Winpisinger, president of the International Association
of Machinists, accused Skinner and Bush of attempting ``to confine
this dispute to a narrow arena where Lorenzo can bring all his
resources to bear'' against the striking employees.
   ``His statements read like they were written by Lorenzo,'' said
IAM Vice President John Peterpaul. ``If George Bush wants a kinder,
gentler nation, he's getting the wrong advice from Sam Skinner.''
   Skinner insists he's not out to teach labor a lesson, but neither
will he tolerate allowing the machinists ``to shut down American
industry and hold American industry hostage.''
   ``Why should commuters in Chicago and New York, and auto workers
in Detroit, be involved in this dispute?'' he asked. ``They should
not.''
   Neither has he minced words about Lorenzo. ``Mr. Lorenzo has
obviously not got the trust and confidence of his company. A company
doesn't work unless it's a team,'' he said Wednesday. ``Congress
can't get involved and the president can't get involved. You don't
create a working relationship between a company and its employees by
congressional act.''
   Skinner's decision to force the Eastern showdown and his blunt
rhetoric on the issue come as no surprise to those who know him as a
tough, pragmatic Chicago lawyer who spent much of his career in the
shadow of his political mentor, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Skinner was his top assistant when Thompson was U.S. attorney in
Chicago. The governor recalls his deputy didn't quite fit into the
``velvet hammer'' school of prosecutors. Instead, according to
Thompson, ``he was just a hammer.''
   Skinner, 50, helped Thompson prosecute one of the biggest federal
corruption trials in Illinois history, the bribery case against
former Gov. Otto Kerner, who was convicted in 1973. He later
succeeded Thompson as U.S. attorney, and headed Bush's presidential
campaigns in Illinois both in 1980 and last year.
   Until Bush tapped him for the transportation post, he was
chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern
Illinois, the nation's second-largest transportation system. He is
also an instrument-rated pilot, intimately familiar with the air
traffic control problems at O'Hare International, the world's
busiest airport.
   RTA Executive Director Theodore Weigle Jr. said Skinner is ``a
visionary. He thinks big. He's been playing in the big leagues for
quite a long time on his own. He's not the least bit intimidated by
big issues or big politics.''
   Just six days after Bush was sworn in, Skinner swept to unanimous
Senate confirmation. He won high praise from Commerce Committee
Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., notably one of the most vociferous
opponents of another Bush nominee, Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower. ``You've done a superb job,'' said Hollings during Skinner's
confirmation hearing. ``You're a breath of fresh air.''
   At the RTA, Skinner was credited with putting a bloated,
financially faltering agency on sound footing and developing a
long-range transportation plan for the Chicago area. He cut the
agency's staff 20 percent and raised fares for transit customers.
   Skinner, married with three children, began his career as an IBM
salesman. He graduated from night law school at De Paul University
in 1966 and went to work in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago in
1967, the same year he was named IBM's top salesman in the 17-state
Midwestern region. He twice won the Justice Department's Outstanding
Service Award.
   ``He's very aggressive, and very determined to succeed in
whatever he does,'' said Thompson.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's first
months in office have brought a splash of color and a dose of
culture to a Pakistan that had grown grim and gray under her
predecessor, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   But this newfound sense of social freedom has created some deep
conflicts in this Moslem nation of 107 million people.
   A group of Islamic clergy have designated Friday, Bhutto's 99th
day in power, as a day of protest against her allegedly secular
policies. They claim religious law bars a woman from governing an
Islamic country.
   Others disagree, and have welcomed the swift social changes her
young reign has wrought.
   ``We had become a joyless society before she hit the scene,''
said a senior Pakistani diplomat who requested anonymity.
   Zia, who died in a plane crash in August, ruled 11 years under a
combination of martial law and strict Islamic practice.
   But Ms. Bhutto, a 35-year-old Oxford and Harvard graduate,
believes Islam should be a religion and not a form of government.
   Her attitude seemed to catch on quickly after she emerged
victorious from the November elections.
   A young, brother-and-sister duo of singers and dancers known as
Nazia and Zohaib were the first act of their kind to to hit the
state-owned television soon after Ms. Bhutto's inauguration on Dec.
2. The one-hour gala left millions of bored Pakistanis humming the
tunes for days.
   Several rightist groups were quick to dub the TV show un-Islamic
and filed lawsuits to seek to have the producers and performers
punished. The courts dismissed the cases.
   Now, a new wave of theatrical satire is rising in the cities of
Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi. The acts are full of barbs aimed at
government bureaucrats.
   One play called ``Divorce Me, My Wife,'' takes a swipe at women's
rule. Several females have begun appearing on the screen without
covering their heads with the traditional ``dopatta,'' or head
scarf, worn even by Bhutto herself in deference to the still
politically strong religious lobby.
   While Ms. Bhutto's cultural openness takes hold, she remains
careful not to unecessarily offend Islamic sensitivity. She has
directed women in government to refrain from shaking hands with men,
Pakistani or foreign.
   Meanwhile, left-leaning Pakistanis such as Ms. Bhutto have
stopped accusing state-run media of being monopolized by the clergy.
   Pakistani newspapers and magazines are enjoying their newfound
liberty with ads and fashion photos featuring shapely female models.
   At a dinner for newspaper editors shortly before his death, Zia
waved copies of newspapers and magazines that displayed fashion
pictures of women.
   ``Are these the publications of an Islamic country?'' Zia
demanded. ``I leave the future decision to you.'' Most of the
editors were blushing.
   While Pakistani women are enjoying newfound liberties, men are
not far behind.
   One of the first masculine items to disappear from government
offices under the new Bhutto era was the traditional, pajama-like
baggy trousers and long shirts which Pakistanis call ``shalwar
kameez.''
   Now, most bureaucrats wear Western business suits.

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are expressing doubt about
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s ability to supervise the
nation's sickest savings and loans and simultaneously regulate
commercial banks.
   As an interim step in President Bush's plan for the savings and
loan crisis, the FDIC _ a bank regulator _ is taking control of more
than 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the ability of the FDIC to handle
its current workload and to also take on the additional burden
assigned by the Bush plan,'' Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman
of the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, said
Wednesday.
   ``We should not blindly transfer a whole burden of
responsibilities to an agency that clearly has problems of its
own,'' he said, citing reports that seven banks in Texas had not
been examined for the past four years.
   However, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said, ``We believe we
are up to the task.''
   Seidman said the FDIC is diverting about 500 bank examiners from
its force of 2,029 to work on S&amp;Ls. He conceded the agency would be
strained for two to three months, but said only 200 to 250 FDIC
examiners would be needed after the initial takeovers.
   In the meantime, the FDIC's list of problem banks has been
declining, he said, and the agency will hire about another 150
examiners by the end of the year. It also is raising salaries to
retain experienced employees, he said.
   White House budget director Richard Darman has agreed to testify
before Annunzio's subcommittee later this month. Initially, Darman
had refused, saying he would testify only before the full banking
committee.
   However, he reversed his position after Annunzio sent a letter to
President Bush complaining that Darman's ``ego problems'' threatened
to delay congressional action on the S&amp;L crisis.
   At another hearing, before the Senate Banking Committee,
commercial bank groups endorsed the Bush plan, which would maintain
separate deposit insurance funds for banks and S&amp;Ls.
   Executives of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said
earlier this week that the funds should be merged as a way of
forcing banks to help pay for the S&amp;L crisis.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, told reporters he opposes any plan to mingle the S&amp;L and
bank insurance funds.
   ``I believe one drowning man is enough,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said time pressures mean Congress likely will pass the
administration's off-budget borrowing plan for resolving the crisis,
even though he personally favors direct Treasury spending.
   He also said he favors giving S&amp;Ls that concentrate on home
mortgage lending a break in meeting stricter capital standards.
   In related action, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., introduced a
bill Wednesday to repeal tax breaks benefiting buyers of failed
banks and S&amp;Ls. He said tax rules may be encouraging the new owners
to operate the institutions less efficiently. Seidman has asked that
the tax benefits continue beyond their scheduled expiration at the
end of this year.

<HEAD>Senate Official Says He Will Reimburse Any Improper Payments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni says he
will reimburse the Senate for any improper expenses he submitted
during a dozen taxpayer-financed trips in 1987-88, but insists he
did nothing wrong.
   Giugni said Wednesday he submitted his trip records to the Senate
Rules Committee, and will make the repayments if panel Chairman
Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., finds ``anything improper.''
   The Senate's second-ranking staff official said in an interview
that he conducted official business on all of the trips, including
the six to the former Honolulu policeman's native Hawaii.
   Giugni said trips that included non-Senate business were only
partially billed to taxpayers.
   Giugni said he traveled to inspect security at senators' state
offices, to check on a computer network he ordered installed, to
provide security at last year's two national political conventions,
and to meet senators' state office staff members.
   ``I've got to be a people person,'' he said. ``They get to know
who the sergeant-at-arms is when they pick up the phone.''
   Serving as the Senate's chief purchasing officer with a $115
million budget, Giugni said, ``I have telecommunications, I have a
computer system to discuss with (Senate) offices. I could have gone
to more places. Hawaii is my own state. I'm more tempted to go to my
state than Texas.''
   Giugni's travels were reported in Wednesday's Washington Post,
which said that he took eight trips to Hawaii from December 1987 to
August 1988. The official disputed that number, saying there were
six trips including one in 1987 for which he was unable to find his
records.
   Another trip to Hawaii in 1987 began in New Orleans, the official
said.
   Giugni said the purpose of an 11-day trip to Hawaii, on which he
was accompanied by two aides, was to familiarize the Capitol police
chief with security problems.
   ``The chief of police had never been to Honolulu, and I wanted
him to look at the security at the federal building,'' Giugni said.
``They have major security problems.''
   Giugni, who has authority over the Capitol police, also set up
meetings between Congress' police chief, Frank A. Kerrigan, and
Hawaii police officials to discuss security.
   On two trips where taxpayers financed only part of the cost,
Giugni said, he went to Hawaii to be master of ceremonies at a Boy
Scout fund-raising function, and to attend a meeting of a hospital
rehabilitation board on which he serves.
   The Post cited figures indicating that Giugni's Dec. 27-30, 1987,
trip to Hawaii, for which he couldn't locate records, cost $2,274.
Giugni billed the Senate $436 for a Feb. 4-8 trip to Honolulu for
the rehabilitation board meeting, after which, the official said, he
visited Senate offices.
   A seven-day trip over the July 4 weekend last year was taken at
the invitation of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which paid for
Giugni's air fare. Giugni charged the Senate for $522.77 in personal
expenses.
   The Capitol Police Board paid for the travel of Giugni and
Kerrigan on their trip to Hawaii, but Giugni's budget paid $1,195
for his per diem expenses. The $5,779 travel and per diem expenses
of Giugni's two aides were charged to the sergeant-at-arms budget.
   Giugni's other trips during the past two years included visits to
Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Reno in Nevada, El Paso,
Texas, and New Mexico, he said.

   You can't be sued for being rude, an appeals court
said.
   The state Court of Appeals' ruling, which overturned a lower
court decision, resulted from a lawsuit filed by a woman who
contended she had to quit her job and undergo therapy because of a
co-worker's alleged obnoxious behavior.
   Nita Mundy, former branch manager of the Anchor Savings Bank in
suburban Hapeville, had charged that a public relations officer had
subjected her to a series of humiliating pranks.
   ``Alleged tasteless and rude social conduct ... is not
actionable,'' the appeals court said.
   The court ruled that the Jonesboro woman had no grounds to
collect damages from her boss or the co-worker.
   Mrs. Mundy said Wednesday she has not worked since August 1985
and still is being treated for the distress she claimed fellow
employee H. Street Kornegay had caused. After leaving her job, she
said, she could not even go into a bank for more than a year.
   ``My job itself was not bad at all,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``I really enjoyed my job.''
   But during her last six months of work, life became difficult,
Mrs. Mundy said.
   ``Working with the added stress, or distress, created such an
environment that eventually I could not function as a manager,'' she
said. ``It was very distressing. It took away from me personally and
professionally.''
   Among other things, Mrs. Mundy's lawsuit said, Kornegay
questioned whether whether her hair color was real in the presence
of her colleagues, interrupted her while she was talking to
customers and swept objects off her desk while she was on the
telephone with a customer.
   These incidents, ``whether considered individually or
collectively, do not, as a matter of law, rise to the requisite
level of egregious or outrageous behavior which justifiably results
in that severe fright, humiliation, embarrassment or outrage which
no reasonable person is expected to endure,'' the appeals court said
in its Feb. 22 decision.
   The decision overturned a lower court ruling that would have
allowed the lawsuit to go to trial.
   Mrs. Mundy's attorney, James T. Perry, said no appeal was planned.
   Kornegay, now retired, did not return telephone messages left
Wednesday by The Associated Press. According to the court ruling, he
denied Mrs. Mundy's allegations. Wade K. Copeland, who represented
the bank, was out of town and could not be contacted.
   Mrs. Mundy said she thought Kornegay disliked her because she was
a strong manager, though he was not under her supervision.
   ``It was more or less a premeditated plan to get me out of the
branch from his personal belief that a woman could not manage (a
bank) as well as a man,'' she said. ``I ran the branch and he didn't
want me to be a strong manager.''

<HEAD>Resentment Over Bush Campaign Ads Lingers Among Blacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican Party's attempts to attract more
blacks will be hampered by the same resentment over the 1988
presidential campaign that drove GOP Chairman Lee Atwater from the
board of Howard University, black leaders and analysts say.
   ``Using Willie Horton the way he was used was deeply felt within
the black community,'' Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said Wednesday,
referring to the black Massachusetts murderer and rapist highlighted
in President Bush's campaign ads.
   For now, however, more of that resentment is aimed at Atwater,
who ran the Bush campaign, than at Bush himself, said Linda Williams
of the Joint Center for Political Studies, an independent group that
focuses on issues of concern to blacks.
   ``A lot of younger blacks and older blacks, too, are willing to
give George Bush a chance, and yet Atwater is in a kind of separate
category right now,'' she said.
   The president was flying to New York late today to be the keynote
speaker at a United Negro College Fund banquet.
   Michelle Stent, director of the fund's Washington legislative
office, said, ``The college fund has a very close and good
relationship with the president and his family.''
   Atwater resigned from the board of overseers at Howard, a
predominantly black school, after protesting students occupied the
administration building and demanded his removal.
   The students cited the Bush campaign ads that featured Horton, a
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a
Massachusetts prison and later raped a Maryland woman. The ads
alleged that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
supported allowing convicted murderers weekend furloughs from prison.
   The ads prominently featured a picture of Horton. Democrats,
including Jesse Jackson, contended that they played on racial fears.
   ``The signals that were sent in the Willie Horton ad were not so
much about furloughs, but about race-inciting fears in white people
and creating very painful feelings among African-Americans,''
Jackson said Wednesday.
   ``Unfortunately, Lee Atwater symbolizes the worst of that
situation.''
   Atwater, who was the president's choice to take over as party
leader after the election, has said one of his goals is to attract
more black voters to the GOP.
   He attended a commemorative service in Atlanta for the late
Martin Luther King Jr. An accomplished rhythm and blues guitar
player, Atwater also has made highly publicized appearances with
black musicians including B.B. King.
   ``I think it was a good thing he attended the (King) service,''
said Lewis, a former civil rights activist. But, he went on, ``It's
going to take more than attending a service in honor of Martin
Luther King Jr. It's going to take much more than that.''
   Coming to the defense of Atwater was Alan Keyes, a black who was
the GOP's candidate for Senate in Maryland in 1988.
   Keyes disputed that the Willie Horton ads were racist.
   ``When I look at Willie Horton, I see a criminal, I don't see a
black person,'' he said.
   But Ms. Williams said simply playing the guitar with black
musicians won't be enough to change Atwater's image with blacks.
   ``People are waiting to see from Atwater something more than
symbolism,'' she said. ``He's talked about winning 20 percent or
more of the black vote. He's been on stage with B.B. King and so
forth.
   ``Blacks are beginning to say there's no other group in America
that people think liking their music affects their voter choice.''

<HEAD>FAA to Bar Blind, Deaf and Handicapped from Exit Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration wants to
bar blind or deaf passengers or passengers whose handicaps make them
unable to open an airliner's emergency exit door from sitting in the
exit row seats.
   The proposed rule, to be published Monday on the eve of a Senate
hearing on discrimination against the blind in air travel, has
already brought criticism from the National Federation of the Blind
and a handicapped veterans group.
   ``This proposal is both silly and discriminatory, and we'll
resist it,'' Mark Maurer, president of the federation, said
Wednesday.
   ``I feel crummy about it,'' said James Gashel, the federation's
government affairs director who was ejected from a United Airlines
plane by police last year in Chicago after refusing to leave an exit
door seat.
   But FAA spokesman John Leyden called the matter ``a critical
safety issue'' and said people in those seats have an added
responsibility.
   The FAA says that seating people who wouldn't be able to operate
the emergency exit door in other rows of the aircraft ``enhances
their safety as well as that of other passengers.''
   The Air Transportation Association, which represents airlines,
said the rule is needed to provide uniform procedures for airlines.
Rules on exit door seating vary among the airlines, said spokeswoman
Leslie Roland.
   Don McGuire, spokesman for Braniff Airlines, said handicapped
people on Braniff flights are asked not to sit in seats next to
exits but are allowed to if they insist. American Airlines spokesman
Jim Brown said the carrier already bars exit door seating to women
close to giving birth, handicapped people or children.
   An FAA rulemaking notice said handicapped people often believe
the airlines have no right to refuse them seats by the exit. A 1986
law guarantees the handicapped full access to air travel, but allows
the FAA to impose seating restrictions for safety.
   The proposed rule would limit exit row seating in domestic
airliners to people who can open the doors and take other actions
that will expedite the evacuation of an aircraft in an accident or
other emergency.
   ``The proposal would affect the seat locations of persons with
physical and mental disabilities, parents with small children, obese
and frail persons, children traveling alone and others who can
impede evacuation when seated in exit rows,'' the FAA said. Leyden
said this would also include those who are blind or deaf or for any
other reason might have difficulty operating the door.
   ``In a way, the people in those seats become auxiliary flight
attendants,'' Leyden said. ``They have to assess the situation, look
out the window to see if it's safe to open the door _ there might be
fire on the wing _ and then open the door and lead people to safety,
choosing the safest path.''
   The blind federation's Maurer said that in some cases an alert
blind person might be the best passenger to have next to an exit
door, especially if the plane filled with smoke, because that person
would be used to being unable to see.
   David Capozzi, an official of the Paralyzed Veterans of America,
said the FAA rules would go too far and might prevent people in
wheelchairs from boarding some commuter flights where the exit row
might be the only one with enough room for them.
   Under the proposed rule, each carrier would have to submit its
procedures for FAA approval. It would take effect after a 90-day
period for public comment, unless the FAA sees reason to change it.

   An Environmental Protection Agency draft report
detailing damage to the Alaskan tundra from oil drilling was ``very
preliminary'' and gives no reason to stop further oil exploration in
the area, says a Senate backer of drilling.
   The report, leaked to The New York Times, has not had adequate
review by EPA managers and requires ``substantial work before it is
finished,'' Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Wednesday.
   ``The EPA was apparently doing some on-site work to establish
information for guidelines they are going to issue in the future,''
he said. ``This is all very preliminary.''
   The draft was a summary of a ``trip report'' after a visit to the
North Slope, said Tom Williams, a member of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee staff.
   According to a story Sunday in the Times, the draft relates
improper and careless management of chemical oil wastes by companies
in the Prudhoe Bay oilfields.
   Legislation before the committee would allow oil exploration in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, just east of Prudhoe Bay.
   The refuge is considered a promising area for a strike that could
produce as much as 3.2 billion barrels of oil, but it also is the
breeding ground for North America's largest remaining herd of
migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears, musk oxen,
wolves, arctic foxes, waterfowl and fish.
   The EPA draft report said acres of tundra have been blackened by
chemical spills, oil wastes seeping from drilling pads, stacks of
leaking chemical drums, a mine flooded by a diverted river,
overflowing waste disposal pits and failure to comply with federal
regulations governing the handling of hazardous materials.
   Murkowski said that since the drilling in Prudhoe Bay began,
there have been advancements in technology that minimize damage to
the environment.
   Furthermore, he said, if no oil is found, the area will revert
completely to its natural state.
   But Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., who opposes the bill, said the
government should establish an overall energy policy before it
starts looking for more oil.
   ``Our policies toward energy conservation are so bad we can't
even get the architect of the Capitol to agree to more efficient
lighting,'' he said. ``We ought to be very aggressively looking at
ways to lessen our dependence on fossil fuel.''
   In reference to the effects of Arctic drilling, Wirth said,
``Anybody who would suggest that what has gone on up there has not
been damaging to the environment is just blowing smoke.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., characterized the government's energy
policy as ``go out and find it, dig it up and use it up as fast as
possible.''
   ``I want to hold this bill hostage in exchange for a national
energy policy,'' he said. ``We don't have an energy policy and we
need one.''

   The state senate is considering a bill
that would fight drugs with a jackpot _ a $75,000 lottery involving
those who turn in major pushers.
   The bill, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, 7-0,
Wednesday and now goes to the full Senate, calls for a sheriff and
district attorney to certify the names of informants. The governor
would draw a winner each year.
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Mac Parsons, said money is the best way

<HEAD>Corn Slow Growing, but Slower Going on USDA Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If, as they say, on a hot, steamy night in Iowa
you can hear the corn grow, it probably is louder than the arrival
of new political appointees at the Agriculture Department.
   The pace quickened this week, however, with President Bush's
announcement late Tuesday that he intended to appoint Richard Thomas
Crowder, a Pillsbury Co. executive, as undersecretary for
international affairs and commodity programs.
   Crowder's selection was the third announced for USDA since Bush
began putting his team together last fall. The other two were
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, the only one yet confirmed,
and Jack Parnell of California, named Feb. 28 as deputy secretary,
the No. 2 job in the department.
   Other senior positions include one other undersecretary for small
community and rural development and seven assistant secretaries
having responsibilities for a wide range of USDA services, from
foreign affairs to meat inspection and public information.
   Yeutter's salary is $99,500 a year, the deputy's $89,500, the
undersecretaries' $82,500, and the assistant secretaries' $77,500.
   Additionally, there are dozens of deputies at all levels,
administrators of various USDA agencies, plus scores of state
directors for certain of the agencies _ not to mention hundreds of
non-salaried appointments to departmental boards and advisory panels
at federal and state levels.
   The top job appointments are presidential and require Senate
approval. As a general rule, the lower-level jobs are named by the
secretary of agriculture.
   William J. Riley Jr., director of personnel for the department
and its far-flung work force of about 106,000 full-time employees,
said Wednesday in an interview that USDA has approximately 150
political ``Schedule C'' and around 40 non-career Senior Executive
Service jobs that are considered political appointments.
   But Riley stressed that the numbers were approximate and that he
had no estimate of how many would be filled by holdovers from the
Reagan administration.
   The jobs, he said, include state directors for the Farmers Home
Administration and the state executive directors of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   About the time Bush took office on Jan. 20, Deputy Secretary
Peter Myers, who will be leaving, informed political job holders
that they ``may or may not be maintained here'' by the new
administration and to prepare letters of resignation to be effective
at the pleasure of the new secretary, Riley said.
   ``As people are found to make replacements, the existing Schedule
Cs may either be retained in their jobs or their resignations
accepted,'' he said. ``But there is nothing in large, large
numbers.''
   Riley was asked about reports that other departments had issued
``pink slips'' to many political job holders and that April 1 was
the deadline for departure.
   ``No, not at Agriculture,'' he said. ``Some of them have already
left and some will be leaving prior to the first of April, and I'm
sure some of them will be here after that.''
   Riley was also asked about rumors that up to 150 potential new
job holders had been put on USDA's payroll as a reserve, squirreled
away to fill openings as they become available.
   ``There have been some people who have been brought on board,
obviously, but 150 people `squirreled away' is about 600 percent
higher than the actual figure,'' he said. ``We've brought on
approximately 25 people. In an administration change, that's a
small, small number.''
   Riley said he preferred to think of the shift from Reagan to Bush
as evolutionary, not revolutionary.
   ``When you have an evolution, it's a lot slower and more
professional _ and it's a lot less bloody than a revolution,'' he
said.

   If catfish farming is a fast-growing business
in some parts of the United States, can snail ranching be far
behind? Perhaps not if enterprising producers take a hint from the
Agriculture Department.
   ``Don't be fooled by their fancy French name, escargots,'' says
the department's Foreign Agricultural Service. ``Many of the snails
the French eat aren't French at all. Instead they hail from such
countries as Greece, Turkey, Indonesia and Czechoslovakia.''
   It's possible that U.S. snails could corner a share of the
market, the agency said in AgExporter magazine.
   The French consume as much as 40,000 metric tons of snails
annually, and domestic production can't keep up with demand, the
report said. In 1987, for example, 7,681 tons were imported, or
nearly a fifth of yearly use.
   More than three-fourths of the imports are fresh, frozen or
refrigerated. Canned snails represent about 2 percent of the total,
with other processed snails making up the remainder.
   ``There is no duty on fresh frozen or refrigerated snail imports,
but a 20 percent ad valorem duty is applied to all imports that are
prepared or preserved,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department is proposing a
change in federal regulations so that swine from China can be
imported in 1989 for research purposes.
   The change would include procedures so that the department's
Agricultural Research Service can import the Chinese hogs, officials
said Wednesday. The changes, or protocol, could be used later by
other importers.
   Under the plan, the Chinese swine would have to undergo extensive
quarantine at the department's animal import center in Key West,
Fla., to be sure the animals are free of disease, including
foot-and-mouth disease, which is present in China.
   After quarantine, the swine will be released to the USDA agency,
Iowa State University and the University of Illinois. By
crossbreeding U.S. swine with the Chinese animals, researchers hope
to improve the productivity of the American pork industry.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilot Says Someone Broke Onto Air Channels With Taunts Of
`Scab'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot at strike-crippled Eastern Airlines said
Thursday shouts of ``scab'' and static interfered with his
communications to air traffic controllers as he took off from
Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport.
   ``The word `scab' was used on the radio,'' said Capt. Roger P.
Pipkin, who was flying Flight 5679 to Miami on Monday with a crew of
six and three passengers aboard the Boeing 757.
   ``I haven't said that any danger was posed. But if frequencies
are going to be used for reasons other than air traffic control then
we have a problem,'' said Pipkin, who has flown for Eastern for 27
years. ``I have no idea who the voices were. I have no idea who
caused the interference.''
   Pipkin said the interference, which lasted seven minutes, was on
four separate frequencies and occurred during ``taxi out, take off
and climb out.''
   Voices were heard on three of the frequencies and static was on
the fourth, said Pipkin, who claimed the interference blocked a call
clearing him to a new heading.
   Jack Barker, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Atlanta, said the incident was reported to the FBI.
   ``There was some interference on the frequencies from some
unknown person on the air,'' Barker said. ``The pilot was able to
communicate. There just was other spurious transmissions on the
frequency.''
   ``We were of course involved,'' Barker added. ``We had an
inspector meet the plane in Miami ... the FBI has it now.''
   Air Line Pilots Association members contacted in Miami said it
was the first they had heard of the incident, and doubted that any
of their members were responsible.
   ``I find it highly unlikely that an ALPA pilot would do it. It
could have been anybody,'' said Jack Gordon, an Eastern pilot at the
ALPA communications center in Miami.
   Pipkin, 52, is one of the few Eastern pilots who crossed picket
lines. Nearly 3,600 APLA pilots at Eastern have honored a strike by
the Miami-based carrier's 8,500 Machinists, who walked off the job
Saturday.

   The FBI says it cannot keep track of the 15,000
``zealous'' Iranian students in this country who might carry out
retribution over the novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Blaming the problem in part on State Department visa policies,
the FBI's Oliver ``Buck'' Revell told a Senate subcommittee on
Wednesday, ``We cannot control our borders, even for our own
self-protection.''
   The panel was looking into the impact of threats issued by Iran's
Ayatollah Khomeini against British author Salman Rushdie and the
publishers and sellers of his book.
   Revell, executive assistant investigations director, told the
subcommittee that the FBI is keeping surveillance over 200 or more
``hard core'' Iranian nationals in the United States.
   But ``there are a large number (of students) here, both legally
and illegally, who are zealous adherents to the Khomeini rhetoric
... and pursuit of violence,'' Revell said.
   Underscoring the impact of Khomeini's threats, representatives of
the book's U.S. publisher, Viking-Penguin, and a major bookstore
chain, Waldenbooks, declined to appear at the hearing after earlier
saying they would attend.
   A committee source said the publisher had cited security concerns
in refusing the invitation. Neither company would answer queries as
to why it had skipped the hearing.
   Revell said roughly 30,000 Iranian citizens are in the United
States on student visas, and at least that many more are in the
country illegally. Some 10,000 to 15,000 are activists with
sympathies for Khomeini's fundamentalist Shiite regime, he said, and
many receive government money to help them stay in the United States
or are affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.
   He said those Iranians, most of them students, represent a
greater threat because the FBI has neither the authority nor
resources to track or evaluate them in the way it handles the far
smaller number of Iranians with known terrorist links.
   Revell told the Senate Foreign Relations terrorism subcommittee
that the students are ``more dangerous than any sort of
infrastructure or organizational activity'' because they cannot be
monitored and because the State Department's standards for issuing
visas are lax.
   But a newspaper editor warned that the situation should not be
made an excuse to crack down on foreigners who dissent from U.S.
values.
   ``It would be a travesty if this crisis ... resulted in further
effort to diminish access of dissident voices from outside our
country,'' said John Seigenthaler, publisher of the Nashville
Tennessean and president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors. ``That, it seems to me, would be embracing the Ayatollah's
way.''
   Khomeini's blanket threat, with its promise of martyrdom should a
follower die attempting retribution for the book, and his
government's offer of a reward of up to $5.2 million for the death
of Rushdie, escalate the terrorist threat beyond that normally faced
by the FBI, Revell said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, agreed.
``When the Ayatollah threw out his death threat, he threw a
different kind of bomb,'' he said. ``But it was and is a terrorist
bomb nevertheless'' and threatens American freedoms as well as lives.
   Revell said the FBI so far knows of 178 threats to booksellers by
telephone and by letter, received in cities from New York to San
Francisco to Houston. While the bureau has no authority to offer
protection, it has immediately responded to each threat and
investigated, he said.
   The Waldenbooks official who declined to appear at the hearing
instead submitted a statement complaining that the government was
slow to come to the defense of booksellers.
   ``It would have probably been helpful had the government, and
specifically the Department of Justice, offered a much higher
profile from the beginning,'' said Harry Hoffman, the chain's chief
executive officer. ``I don't believe the severity of this current
situation was understood by anyone except those who were receiving
the threats.''
   On Feb. 28, a Waldenbooks and another bookstore in Berkeley,
Calif., and a printing plant in New York City were firebombed, but
Revell said the bureau has not been able to determine whether those
incidents stemmed from Khomeini's decree.

<HEAD>Many Elderly Paying Unnecessary Medicare Premiums, Survey Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only nine states began paying Medicare premiums
for the elderly poor under a law that took effect Jan. 1, and less
than half have begun taking steps to inform would-be beneficiaries
they are eligible, a new survey says.
   As a result, many of the elderly still have $31.90 a month
deducted from their Social Security checks although the
state-federal Medicaid program is supposed to pay the Medicare
premium for those who live significantly below the poverty line.
   The $31.90 covers the optional portion of Medicare that pays
doctor bills.
   ``This is completely unacceptable,'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
said Wednesday. ``The purpose of this `Medicare buy-in' requirement
was to protect the poorest of the elderly and disabled from what at
their income levels is an extreme financial burden.''
   Waxman's remarks and the Villers Foundation survey dealt with a
requirement in legislation to expand the Medicare program, including
coverage of catastrophic illness, starting Jan. 1.
   The requirement says states must use their Medicaid programs to
pay Medicare premiums and other costs for beneficiaries with incomes
below 85 percent of the poverty line.
   Waxman, a main force behind the new legislation, said widespread
failure of states to comply ``may well be an ominous sign for other
mandates coming down the line.''
   He referred to such things as expanded Medicaid coverage for
pregnant women and newborn infants that also have been switched from
optional to mandatory, but have not taken effect yet.
   Under the Medicare expansion, all but five states are required to
pay Medicare premiums for recipients with incomes below 85 percent
of the official poverty line _ $5,980 for an individual or $8,020
for a couple.
   Moreover, Medicaid is supposed to pay any hospital deductibles or
other co-payments that otherwise would be required of Medicare
beneficiaries.
   The five with exceptions _ Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio
and Utah _ are supposed to cover Medicare recipients up to 80
percent of the poverty line in the first year.
   Within five years, all states and the District of Columbia are
supposed to be paying the premiums for Medicare recipients up to 100
percent of the poverty line.
   Medicaid is the state-federal health program for the poor and
Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and disabled.
   There are an estimated 3.5 million elderly Americans living below
the poverty line, but roughly 1 million are so poor they already
have their Medicare costs picked up by Medicaid.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that of the remaining
2.5 million or so who would be eligible, 590,000 will actually sign
up for the $31.90 benefit program.
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of the Villers Foundation,
said only nine states started providing coverage Jan. 1 as required:
Florida, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and South Dakota.
   Waxman said he did not know whether the fault for the others'
failure was at the local level or failure of federal officials to
get guidelines out in time.
   At any rate, he said: ``Where the fault lies ... is really not
the issue. We need to assure, as quickly as possible, that
low-income Medicare beneficiaries in all states are protected from
catastrophic Medicare cost-sharing.''
   Pollack said the most disturbing finding of the survey, conducted
for Villers by Sarah Shuptrine &amp; Associates of Columbia, S.C., was
that only 24 states and the District of Columbia have taken concrete
steps toward notifying poor Medicare beneficaries in their
jurisdictions that they may be eligible to have Medicaid pay their
Medicare premiums.
   Villers is a private foundation that concentrates on issues
affecting the poor, particularly the elderly poor.

<HEAD>City Of Angels Offers Help To Paraplegic, But Where Is He?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plight of a homeless paraplegic whose
wheelchair was stolen as he slept in a parking lot unleashed an
outpouring of public sympathy, but the man disappeared before he
could accept any offers of help.
   Details about George Donovan's life and his misfortune were not
all that clear, but people who tried to help him said the theft was
typical: a snapshot of misery on Skid Row.
   ``George is a victim of the victims,'' said Ray McCann,
communications director at the Union Rescue Mission where Donovan
found shelter briefly.
   Police agreed Donovan, who claimed to be a veteran, was the
victim of Skid Row thieves. And although people who have heard about
the theft wanted to help, there was no one to refer them to, said
Lt. Fred Nixon, a police spokesman.
   The incident began Tuesday evening when Donovan, 47, awakened in
a parking lot and found his wheelchair was gone, said Officer Joe
Mariani, another police spokesman.
   Police said they found Donovan propped up against a wall in an
alley near the downtown Greyhound Bus Station.
   Before taking him to the Union Rescue Mission, police tried to
find him shelter for three hours, calling the Veterans
Administration, the county social services department and even a
detoxification center, although he hadn't been drinking, McCann
said. They wouldn't take Donovan because he wasn't sick or injured,
wasn't ambulatory or because they didn't have room.
   ``It's just dreadful,'' said Blanche Carey, 61, of Lomita after
she heard a radio account of Donovan's plight. She offered to donate
electric and manual wheelchairs she can no longer use.
   ``We don't have a lot of money. But here is one man who has
become crippled for his country and apparently there is no one who
cares, who is doing anything,'' she said.
   ``We've got a real outpouring of people who want to help,'' said
Carl Fielstra, ministry director at the Union Rescue Mission.
Following the news reports about Donovan, the 98-year-old downtown
mission received calls all day offering help and donations, he said.
   But Donovan's whereabouts were unknown. He was in a friend's care
when he left a hospital early Wednesday and was not considered
missing, said police Cmdr. George Morrison.
   ``He's not a police problem, except to the extent that we were
trying to help him,'' Morrison said.
   Although there were some reports that Donovan had been roughed up
by the thieves, the police report stated only that the chair was
stolen as he slept. Fielstra said Donovan told him he had been
attacked.
   ``Regardless the bonafides of the story, he's crippled, on the
street,'' Fielstra said. ``We'll take him.''
   At the mission, Donovan had complained of pain in the stomach and
groin and was taken by ambulance to County-USC Medical Center late
Tuesday, McCann said.
   At the hospital, he complained of pain in his left leg and side.
But after about four hours, Donovan left with a friend and said they
were going to the VA, said hospital spokeswoman Adelaida DeLaCerda.
   Donovan never showed up at a VA hospital, however, said Larry
Caird, spokesman for the agency's western region.
   Police spokesman Mariani said Donovan had a veteran's
identification card.
   Donovan would appear to be eligible for veteran's benefits and
would have received care if he had come to a VA hospital, Caird
said. He said he had no information about Donovan's service record.
   McCann said Donovan receives veteran's benefits and has some
trouble with a ``bad hip socket.'' However, McCann said he did not
know anything about Donovan's military service or how he became a
paraplegic.
   ``He has been in and out of our facility,'' McCann said. ``He is
a street person. We do know him by sight.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen declared himself for fellow
Texan John Tower as defense secretary, but he waited until after
Democratic leaders said they didn't need the vote.
   Bentsen didn't expend on Tower the party clout he gained in his
vice presidential campaign, keeping a low profile in the battle that
has torn the Senate.
   In his speech Wednesday on the Senate floor, Bentsen put his
endorsement into terms of personal sympathy rather than political
allegiance, reflecting the 14 years he served with Tower in the
Senate and his own experience as a scrutinized candidate.
   ``This event, so painful to John Tower, has been difficult to me.
... We have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man
dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights while his
aughters sat listening,'' he said.
   ``Last fall, I learned firsthand what it's like to have reporters
looking up every friend you've had in the last 60 years, or asking
what you ate for breakfast,'' he said.
   Tower supporters temporarily were cheered by Bentsen's decision.
   ``I think that the timing would have been better if it came
earlier in the debate. But at this stage, I'll take him any time I
can get him,'' said Tower friend Paul Eggers.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had already
told reporters he didn't need Bentsen's vote. And after Bentsen
spoke, four Democrats considered as possible swing votes announced
they were against the nominee.
   Bentsen's decision was consistent with his position in January
when he presented Tower to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
praising him as a good choice not only for hawks but for liberals
critical of Pentagon overspending.
   ``John Tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check
from the U.S. Treasury to the Pentagon,'' Bentsen said then.
   But as the showdown over the nomination grew in intensity,
Bentsen declined to say how he'd vote.
   A change in his position, or strong lobbying for Tower, could
have had great impact, given the visibility he has held since he was
Michael Dukakis' running mate on the Democratic ticket last fall.
   Bush telephoned Bentsen repeatedly. Tower supporters in Texas
organized telephone calls and letters to his office.
   But Bentsen, just elected to a new six-year Senate at the same
time he lost his vice presidential bid, told reporters he felt
little political pressure.
   Texans have ``a long tradition of closing ranks,'' said Joseph
O'Neill, a Washington lobbyist who has been Bentsen's top Senate
aide and was chief of staff for his vice presidential campaign.
   But a vote against Tower would not have been particularly
damaging either, said George Shipley, an Austin political consultant.
   ``There is no wellspring of support here for Tower,'' Shipley
said. ``The silence is thundering.''
   Shipley noted that Tower himself had voted against several
presidential nominations including that of a fellow Texan _ Ray
Marshall, who was President Carter's nominee for labor secretary in
1977.
   But Lance Tarrance, a Houston Republican pollster, said Bentsen's
move was shrewd in his home state, where conservatives who supported
him the past were aggravated by his partnership with Dukakis and
opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.
   ``By deciding to vote for Tower, Bentsen has taken care of two
nagging political problems,'' Tarrance said.
   Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta pollster and consultant to Senate
Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, said he saw broader political
implications in Bentsen's stance.
   ``There's something in that woodpile that ain't all wood,'' he
said. ``For the Democratic vice presidential nominee to bolt the
party, it sounds to me like he wants to run for president,'' he said.

   Call it the crawfish war.
   When Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower said Louisiana
crawfish are smaller, smellier, dirtier, dumber and less tasty than
those in the Lone Star State, his counterpart in Louisiana was quick
to respond.
   ``Jim Hightower will have to back out and crawl,'' Commissioner
Bob Odom said Wednesday, referring to the way a startled crawfish
runs from danger.
   ``The one market we've gone head to head with Texas crawfish has
been in the Swedish market,'' Odom said.
   ``Louisiana beat the hell out of them.''
   But Hightower crowed about his state's crawfish, saying the Texas
variety were cleaner because packers put them through a brief fast
to clean out intestinal impurities.
   ``At long last we have a pure Texas crawfish that is going to
save us Texans from the shame and humiliation that we have
experienced over the last many, many generations of having to eat
those smelly, mud-coated, itty-bitty, slow-witted crawfish from
Louisiana,'' Hightower said.
   The crawfish skirmish is of no little consequence. Hightower
estimated that the crawfish industry could mean $120 million in
direct sales for Texas farmers and about 1,000 jobs.

   Jennifer Brown isn't looking for a
little Michelangelo, but she did teach her middle school art
students something about the difficulties of painting the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel.
   Ms. Brown's students at the Childers Middle School were required
recently to draw on paper taped to the bottom of their desks.
   ``There were a lot of moans and groans,'' she said. ``Some
thought it was cruel. Some thought it was cool. But once they got
started I think most of the students enjoyed it.''
   The youngsters spent parts of three days on their backs, drawing
a likeness of their hands.
   ``Michelangelo painted figures on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel, so we painted hands instead, which is a part of the body, at
least,'' she said.
   The teacher said some students who had trouble with other
assignments excelled on this project. ``I joked with some of them
that they would have to draw on their backs all the time,'' Ms.
Brown said.

   A new generation of student activists
marched peacefully throughout Poland to pay tribute to their
predecessors and mark the 20th anniversary of a violent crackdown on
campus unrest.
   Thousands of students turned out for rallies and marches in at
least six cities Wednesday. Some disturbances were reported, but the
rallies still were in sharp contrast to the March 1968 events they
commemorated.
   Contributing to the calm mood was the announcement Tuesday that
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa had won government agreement to
legalize the Independent Students Association, or NZS, after a
seven-year ban.
   In Warsaw, police on Wednesday helped direct traffic around two
separate demonstrations held with the permission of municipal
officials.
   More than 5,000 young people _ led by a woman pushing twins in a
baby carriage _ marched through the capital's downtown streets. The
marchers chanted, ``No success without NZS!''
   An evening march later drew about 2,000 people.
   At Jagiellonian University in Krakow in southern Poland, 3,000
students listened to an address by opposition activist Adam Michnik,
a veteran of the 1968 protest. ``It's a moving day for me because
what happened 21 years ago changed my generation and my life,'' he
told the students.
   The students heeded an appeal from the university rector and
stayed on the campus, avoiding a confrontation with police.
   About 1,000 people gathered at the Polytechnic Institute in
Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, said local opposition activist
Jozef Pinior.
   He said that later, a few hundred youths began marching and
carrying banners of the radical splinter group Fighting Solidarity.
Pinior said police allowed them to walk a mile or so before stopping
the demonstration.
   Sixteen people were briefly detained, he said.
   When the evening march ended in Warsaw, 50 to 100 youths from
Fighting Solidarity and the RSA, an anarchist movement, held their
own march for several blocks before riot police blocked their path.
   Someone in the crowd threw a smokebomb at police, and a few
others threw stones before the crowd melted away.
   The official PAP news agency reported peaceful rallies in Poznan,
Lublin and Olsztyn.
   On March 8, 1968, police and Communist Party worker-activists
invaded Warsaw University's campus and attacked students protesting
the expulsion of Michnik and another student, who had spoken out
against closure of a performance of Adam Mickiewicz's patriotic play
``Forefather's Eve.''
   The episode and subsequent clashes between students and police
radicalized many young people who later became leading figures in
the Solidarity free trade union movement. It also provided a pretext
for an anti-Semitic, anti-intellectual purge that caused thousands
of people to lose jobs in an internal party power struggle.
   ``The March (1968) events ... make us aware of a certain great
truth _ how pitifully ineffective are the efforts of all those who
stand against the natural and inborn wish for freedom,'' Warsaw
University rector Grzegorz Bialkowski told the students before they
marched to a monument to Mickiewicz.

   Government troops today arrested a
renegade military officer sought in a series of coup plots allegedly
financed by ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, military officials
said.
   President Corazon Aquino congratulated the armed forces and said
the capture of former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan after a two-year
manhunt ``will lead to greater stability in this country.''
   Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao said Cabauatan, who was wearing
civilian clothes and disguised with eyeglasses and a goatee, was
arrested by soldiers as he left a suburban Manila restaurant after
midnight.
   Dumlao said soldiers, tipped off earlier that Cabauatan would be
at the restaurant, initially did not recognize the renegade officer
when they arrived at the restaurant.
   But Dumlao said one soldier saluted a bearded man who resembled
Cabauatan, and Cabauatan instinctively returned it, leading to his
arrest.
   Cabauatan was taken to the Philippine Constabulary's Camp Crame,
where authorities presented him briefly at a news conference. No
interviews were allowed. Cabauatan shook his head no when reporters
asked him to make a statement.
   Cabauatan, 42, was the most prominent anti-Aquino military figure
captured since the December 1987 arrest of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt in
which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded.
   Honasan escaped in April and remains at large.
   Cabauatan was sought after a January 1987 coup attempt, when
renegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in the
capital. The government called it an attempt to restore Marcos to
power.
   He also took part in an abortive coup at The Manila Hotel in July
1986 and was linked to an attack on the stockade at Manila's Fort
Bonifacio the following April.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, head of the Philippines Constabulary,
said the military had ``very strong indications that the money being
used by this group came from ex-President Marcos,'' who fled to
exile in Hawaii after being ousted in a February 1986
military-civilian uprising.
   Cabauatan went underground after the January 1987 coup attempt.
   He gave frequent clandestine news conferences to announce the
organization of the Nationalist Army of the Philippines to continue
his struggle against Mrs. Aquino.
   Military officials said they were preparing several rebellion
charges against him in addition to the two existing mutiny cases.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Thursday, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 129.23 yen, up 0.50 yen from Wednesday's
128.73-yen finish. The currency, which opened at 129.32 yen, moved
in a range of 129.10-129.40 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 100.28-point
loser the previous day, shed another 181.21 points, or 0.57 percent,
to end trading at 31,656.45.
   Dealers said the stock index fell as investors stepped to the
sidelines because of the weakening yen.
   Buying interest was also discouraged by news reports Thursday
saying that U.S. sources suspected some Japanese companies,
including Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, were involved in a chemical
weapons plant in Libya, said a trader with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   Affected by the news, Mitsubishi-related issues lost ground, he
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Trading was inactive and lacking incentives due to a
wait-and-see attitude among participants who are also waiting for
the U.S. employment figure due out Friday,'' the dealer added.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is to announce the nation's jobless
rate for February on Friday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened higher in Tokyo following
overnight gains in New York in response to comments by Michael
Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Adivsers,
said an analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo.
   Speaking before a congressional committee, Boskin said the
administration has ``not ruled out a discussion'' of taxes as part
of budget negotiations with Congress. Some analysts said the
comments were good news for the dollar.
   But the dollar-yen rate in Tokyo moved in a tight range in the
absence of major market-affecting news, said the analyst. ``Trading
was inactive except for some position adjustments and profit-taking
by speculative investors,'' he said, speaking anonymously.

<HEAD>Fuel Additive Found Effective For Dissolving Gallstones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Injections of a powerful solvent and two other new
treatments should make gallbladder surgery unnecessary for many of
the 500,000 Americans who undergo the operation each year,
researchers reported today.
   Mayo Clinic doctors described in the New England Journal of
Medicine their use of methyl tert-butyl ether, a substance that
until now has been used largely as a gasoline octane booster and as
an industrial solvent.
   Injecting it directly into the gallbladder, doctors found that it
quickly dissolved large stones, freeing patients from their painful
condition.
   ``We have learned that we can use the technology successfully in
a broad range of anatomical circumstances,'' said Dr. Johnson L.
Thistle, who pioneered the procedure. ``We have become quite
comfortable with the feeling that we can do it safely and
effectively.''
   However, the experimental technique has competition from two
other therapies that also promise to replace gallbladder removal,
which until now has been the standard treatment for gallstones and
trails only Caesarean sections as the most common form of abdominal
surgery.
   A stone-crushing machine called a lithotriptor, already widely
used for kidney stones, is being tested against gallstones, and a
stone-dissolving drug was recently approved for routine use.
   ``All three of them need to be considered,'' said Dr. Gerald
Salen of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in East Orange,
N.J. ``They offer an alternative to an operation. Most patients can
have their stones treated with one of these techniques.''
   Salen said the three treatments may be useful for many of the
350,000 or so people who undergo elective gallbladder surgery
annually. In 1987, 526,000 Americans had their gallbladders taken
out. Surgery will still be necessary for 150,000 people who need
emergency treatment.
   Thistle's technique works only on gallstones made of cholesterol,
which are the majority of all stones. He estimates the therapy might
be useful for at least half of all people who now need gallbladder
surgery.
   In the technique, doctors push a long needle into the patient's
abdomen, through the liver and into the gallbladder. They then
replace it with a skinny tube and infuse ether. Usually after a day
of treatment, the stones are gone, even when the gallbladder
contains many stones or ones that are especially large.
   Patients can go home within a day or two and quickly return to
work. By contrast, gallbladder surgery requires a week in the
hospital and six weeks of recuperation.
   Thistle first described his initial testing of the procedure four
years ago. In the latest report, he outlined the results of
treatment of 75 gallstone victims. In 72, the stones almost
completely went away.
   A drawback of the approach is the difficulty of accurately
putting a tube into the gallbladder. It requires a radiologist who
is ``skilled at placing little tubes in little places,'' Thistle
said.
   Doctors at several medical centers also are experimenting with
lithotriptors, which use shock waves to crush gallstones still
inside the body.
   Unlike the ether treatment, lithotriptors don't put anything
inside the body, and require relatively little technical skill to
operate. While they quickly disintegrate moderate-size stones, they
do not appear to work as well as ether in people with large or
multiple stones.
   The other alternative is ursodiol, a stone-dissolving pill that
in October was approved for routine use. It is most effective for
people with a few small stones, which may take two years to
disappear completely.

   Large employers would be required to provide up
to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to care for newborn or
seriously ill children, under a bill approved by a House committee.
   The bill passed Wednesday, a major part of congressional
Democrats' domestic agenda, also would require companies with 50 or
more employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extended
time off to take care of ailing parents.
   And it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave
for the workers' own serious illness.
   In each instance, the only direct cost to the employer would be
to continue whatever company-paid health benefits that were in force
at the time the worker requested leave.
   However, many private and public employers, including the
National League of Cities, oppose the measure on grounds it would be
overly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workers
requesting such extended leaves even though the direct financial
cost might be minimal.

   The conference, scheduled Friday through Sunday in New York, is

<NOTE>Producer of Electicity-Using `Worm Gett'r' Complains of Ban Effort</NOTE>

   An Idaho businessman is complaining that the
Consumer Product Safety Commission's staff used heavy-handed tactics
in trying to ban his only product, a metal worm-harvesting probe
that uses electric currents.
   Philip A. Dye of Caldwell, Idaho, told the consumer protection
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that agency
staff members acted in an underhanded fashion in their investigation
of his product and refused to discuss possible safety improvements.
   His problems, he said, showed that members of the commission
should be ``equipped with business knowledge and experience, and
most of all, what is lacking now, common sense.''
   A safety commission spokesman declined substantive comment, but a
commission member defended the agency's effort to get the product
off the market, suggesting the device ``probably is against every
known product standard in the civilized world.''
   Dye and his wife operate P &amp; M Enterprises, producing the ``Worm
Gett'r,'' a device to drive worms to the earth's surface.
   It is made up of two, six or 12 metal prongs inserted into the
ground and connected to a common two-wire, 120-volt AC household
circuit. The current flowing into the ground forces worms desired by
fishermen to rise to the surface.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels say time has run
out on their offer to hold peace talks with the government and they
are now calling for a boycott of the March 19 presidential elections.
   But the guerrillas, in a communique, said they may resume
discussions with political leaders after the vote and that they
favor participation in the election by the leftist political front
with which they maintain links.
   The rebel announcement Wednesday put at least a temporary end to
the peace process they initiated Jan. 24 by offering to take part in
the vote and respect its outcome if it were postponed to September
and their security and anti-fraud concerns addressed.
   The Christian Democratic government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte had failed to arrange talks with the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front to consider the plan.
   The opposition rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, which
controls the legislature and is favored to win the presidency,
vigorously objected to any election delay.
   Noting that the government took more than a month to respond to
the proposal, the rebel communique said that time had run out.
   ``In these conditions of so much delay and deceit ... the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front declares that it maintains
its offer of peace and will continue to struggle for it. But it
considers that holding a meeting now with the government .. . would
be to lend ourselves to further deceit of our people and of world
opinion,'' the communique said.
   ``Only after the election, which will be fraudulent, could there
be another attempt to negotiate peace among the (rebels), the
government, the Legislative Assembly and the political parties,''
said the communique, which was called in to a local radio station.
   ``The (front) calls on the masses to combatively repudiate this
fraudulent election,'' it said. The guerrillas have repudiated the
five previous national elections held this decade.
   The rebel communique approved participation in the election by
the Democratic Convergence, the political front that maintains links
with the guerrillas. It said guerrilla combatants ``consider that
the Convergence's participation in the elections, at a disadvantage
and against fraud, is intended to help clear the path toward peace.''
   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
the 9-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led guerrillas and the
U.S.-supported government.

<HEAD>Chinese Attacking Tax Collectors; Police To Escort Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police will now accompany tax collectors on their
rounds to prevent more attacks of the sort that have since 1985
claimed the lives of 13 of the civil servants and injured 6,800,
official reports say.
   ``The masses are attacking, surrounding, beating officials from
the State Administration of Taxation who are trying to collect
taxes,'' The People's Daily said Wednesday.
   The paper told the story of pig farmers in Jiangxi province who
stuffed four tax collectors into a pig pen after the officials
demanded payment.
   ``Man and pig mixed together as they drove the collectors from
town to town,'' the story said. ``One of the criminals stood on the
crate and urinated on the officials.'' Police later arrested them
and in February they were sentenced to several years in prison.
   Tax evasion runs rampant throughout China, especially among
artists, actors and businessmen, who make more than $108 a month,
the minimum taxable amount. The average urban Chinese makes about
$25 a month; the average rural Chinese makes about $12 a month.
   ``Why should I pay taxes?'' said a well-known actress who makes
about $13,500 a year _ 44 times the average. ``All those forms to
fill out. I'd rather spend my money on fun things like eating and
clothes.''
   ``In every corner of China, there's tax evasion,'' according to
the People's Daily. ``Businessmen lie when they fill in forms,
famous artists `donate' their paintings for a hefty sum, actors
don't use their real names and ask for payment in cash.''
   But individuals aren't the only ones guilty of malfeasance.
State-run companies and collective enterprises also cheat. In recent
years, the percent of tax income in the country's national income
has fallen from 35 percent to about 26 percent.
   Still, most reports concentrate on entrepreneurs, possibly
because they have less power than larger firms to suppress criticism
about them in the state-run press.
   The reports of widespread tax evasion and violent opposition to
tax collectors are an indication of growing corruption and
restiveness in China.
   Economic reforms designed to introduce elements of a market
economy in China's state-run system have created vast differentials
of wealth and opportunities for cheating. The reforms have also
triggered inflation of more than 26 percent, the highest price rises
since the 1949 revolution. This in turn has sparked an angry
response.
   Increased tax revenue is supposed to play a critical role in
funding the reforms. The government's inability to collect
sufficient funds is hurting the program, reports have said.
   China began to tax individual incomes in 1980. In 1987, it
instituted a progressive income tax for all citizens and private
businesses.
   Individuals pay taxes on a sliding scale beginning at 20 percent
for every $108 earned a month and ending at 60 percent for incomes
of more than $216.
   Large state-run companies pay 55 percent of their profits, while
smaller companies and collective pay on a sliding scale that tops
out at 55 percent. Individual businesses are taxed like individuals
with the addition of production and business taxes.
   One of the problems is that the state has been slow to punish tax
evaders.
   ``Every since 1987, we have yet to hear of a tax evader being
sent to court,'' the People's Daily said.
   It also said many beatings of tax collectors have gone unpunished.
   ``Some of the crimes have been settled by fines, others are being
called simply civil disputes,'' it said. ``This has allowed many
criminals to go scot free and hurt efforts to stop anti-tax
violence.''
   It said that since 1985, 7,807 cases of beatings and attacks had
been reported. In addition to the 13 dead, 27 officials have been
crippled and 786 collectors were seriously injured.
   Yu Lei, deputy chief of the Ministry of Public Security, said the
situation had to stop.
   ``We will not tolerate a continuation of this situation,'' he
said, speaking on national television Tuesday night. ``We will begin
dealing very harshly with these criminals.''

resolution. That motion was approved by 17 Third World nations and
opposed by 11 Western nations, plus Togo and Peru.
   Nine Third World countries and the Soviet bloc abstained.
   Human rights groups have accused Iraqi authorities of using
chemical weapons against Iraq's Kurdish minority and ordering mass
executions.
   Last week, the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International accused Iraq of torturing the children of enemies of
the government to punish and extract confessions.
   Amnesty International said in a statement that it was ``deeply
disturbed'' by the outcome of the Iraq vote, which it said ``seemed
irreconcilable with a genuine commitment to bring a a halt to human
rights violations in Iraq.''
   The commission did criticize Iran, voting 20-6 to adopt a
resolution citing ``continued reports of grave and persistent
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.''
   The resolution, sponsored by 13 Western nations, listed reports
of a ``wave of summary executions'' in the second half of 1988 and
``numerous reports of ill-treatment and torture'' of detainees.
   Voting in favor were all Western members of the 43-nation panel
as well as Iraq, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda and
Venezuela.
   Sri Lanka, Somalia, Ethiopia, Cuba, Bangladesh, and Pakistan cast
opposing votes. Twelve Third World countries abstained, and all four
Soviet bloc members did not participate in the vote.
   The commission also approved a resolution expressing ``dismay at
continued acts of extreme violence from all sources in Chile'' and
``concern at the persistence of serious violations of human rights
and fundamental freedoms.''
   But it also noted that the government has respected the outcome
of the Oct. 5 referendum, in which an overwhelming majority of
citizens voted against continued rule by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

   For rent: Furn rms, util, heat inc, meals _ limited vu.
   Call your local jailer.
   Prison officials around the nation who desperately need to reduce
their overcrowded inmate populations are increasingly looking to
send prisoners to local jails with rooms to rent.
   In some cases, lockups with the space to spare have paid for more
than half their budgets with the renting scheme. But in at least one
jail, the arrangement backfired when inmates, angry about a move
across the country, vandalized the cells.
   Still, the complaint from many jailers isn't the new inmates, but
the number of telephone calls from prospective renters.
   ``I turn people down almost every day,'' said Lt. James Ross, who
runs the Allegan County Jail in southwest Michigan. About half of
the jail's 174 beds are often rented to out-of-county convicts.
   About 27,000 prisoners, or 10 percent of the inmates in the
nation's largest jails, are being held for other agencies, said
Lawrence Greenfeld, director of corrections statistics for the U.S.
Department of Justice. Most of the displaced inmates come from state
prison systems, which pay a per diem to the county jail, Greenfeld
said.
   Jails with space often have contracts with the state and federal
governments to hold inmates from overcrowded lockups.
   One of the pressures to alleviate overcrowding comes from federal
or local court capacity restrictions. In Michigan, for instance, a
state law requires early release for inmates if a county jail is
above capacity for 21 consecutive days.
   ``Sheriffs throughout the state have recognized there is money to
be made and are becoming conscious that they can make a profit by
renting out,'' said Dale Davis, executive director of the Michigan
Sheriff's Association.
   In Clare County, Mich., other jurisdictions are charged $40 per
day to house an inmate at the jail, said Sheriff Howard Haskin. He
said about $25 or $30 of that is profit.
   ``The lights and heat are on anyway, so all we're really paying
for is three meals a day,'' he said.
   Allegan County expects to take in about $1.35 million in 1989 by
leasing jail space to other counties. That will pay for about 70
percent of the jail's anticipated budget expenditures for the year.
   In Illinois, about a third of the Peoria County Jail's 220
inmates are from other Illinois counties and federal agencies.
   Charging $50 per day per inmate, the jail took in $718,000 last
year in rent, or about half of the sheriff's department's annual
revenue, said budget coordinator Carol Van Winkle.
   Until recently, the practice of transferring inmates from one
county to another had been common in California.
   ``That stopped when everyone became overcrowded,'' said Richard
Rainey, vice president of the California Sheriff's Association.
   Rainey said the severity of overcrowding has led to jail
expansion and has forced counties to look closely at alternatives
such as community service, parole and home monitoring programs.
   But there are drawbacks to boarding inmates hundreds of miles
from their homes and families.
   ``If you place a pretrial person in a jail 200 or 300 miles away
from home and from his attorney, he's buried in terms of his legal
defense,'' said Ed Koren, a staff attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union National Prisons Project.
   The loss of contact with family and friends also makes adjustment
more difficult when the inmate is released, Koren said.
   And occasionally, a sheriff's dream about raising revenue in an
jail with empty cells can turn into a nightmare.
   In December, the 509-bed Spokane County Jail in Washington signed
a $1.1 million contract with the District of Columbia's Department
of Corrections to accept 50 of the city's inmates.
   Since then, the inmates have set mattresses on fire and stuffed
up toilets to protest their 2,600-mile transfer.
   ``It's not going too well,'' Capt. Donald Manning said.

<HEAD>Administration on Verge of Unveiling New Third World Debt Approach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration may announce a new
approach to the Third World debt problem by the end of the week,
officials say.
   The Treasury Department has completed its review of the debt
topic, officials said, although the president has not yet approved
the recommended changes.
   Officials said Wednesday if that approval is gained, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady could outline the new administration's
approach to the debt issue when he addresses a conference on Third
World debt at the State Department on Friday.
   Officials would not comment on a published report that the Bush
administration planned several initiatives to encourage banks to
voluntarily forgive a portion of the debt.
   Such an approach would mark a major change from the Baker plan,
which has guided U.S. policy on debt issues since it was first
unveiled by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III in 1985.
   Baker's approach emphasized new lending rather than broadbased
efforts to reduce the debt burden.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in Wednesday's editions that the
Bush administration has been considering proposals that would
involve reduction in interest rates and principal on a portion of
the $1.3 trillion in debt held by developing countries.
   The newspaper reported that the administration plan rules out any
new direct U.S. government spending to support the debt reduction
efforts. Instead, the administration proposal would call for
diverting a portion of existing resources at the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund to debt reduction and away from making
new loans.
   The new administration is receiving pressure from major U.S.
allies to go beyond the Baker plan and support some sort of
debt-relief program.
   That pressure intensified last week after riots in Venezuela
which were touched off after the newly elected government of Carlos
Andres Perez announced austerity measures as part of an agreement
with the IMF to get more loans for Venezuela, one of Latin America's
biggest debtors.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. John Sununu made a second career
of pooh-poohing Michael Dukakis' claims about the Massachusetts
economy during the presidential race. Now, Democrats say, the White
House chief of staff is sporting his own black eye.
   Just five days after Sununu announced a state surplus as he left
to serve President Bush, his successor, Judd Gregg, said New
Hampshire was saddled with a deficit. Today, the governor and
legislators are still struggling to keep the state's books in
balance.
   ``Where did Governor Sununu's $10 million surplus go, or was it
never there?'' Democratic state Sen. James St. Jean asked recently
in calling on Sununu and Gregg, both Republicans, to explain.
   House Democratic Leader Mary Chambers proposed that if she were
Gregg, ``I'd punch John Sununu in the nose.''
   Some critics suggest Sununu did to Gregg what he accused his
Democratic predecessor of doing in 1982 _ telling ``the big lie'' by
intentionally masking a deficit.
   Sununu did indeed project a $10 million surplus in the current
$571 million general-spending budget when he bade farewell to
legislators Jan. 4. And Gregg, less than a week later, warned of a
potential $13 million deficit when he cut most state spending by 3
percent for the remainder of the fiscal year.
   What galls critics is that Sununu, in projecting a surplus,
didn't deduct anything for bills he knew were coming due; Gregg did
in predicting a deficit.
   Gregg, however, a former congressman who soundly defeated a
Democratic lawyer in an election to succeed Sununu, defended the
former governor.
   ``You always want to put the best spin on things,'' Gregg said
recently. ``He did what most politicians in his position would have
done.''
   Critics say that in not mentioning the bills Sununu painted too
rosy a picture. Sununu said they weren't listening closely to what
he's been saying for two years.
   ``For folks to say I didn't say revenues were tight is just not
true,'' he said. ``I was the one who said it was going to be a
tough, tough biennium.''
   Sununu was well aware of the bills for programs including lawyers
for poor defendants and court-ordered placements of troubled
juveniles, but he said the amount had not been established.
   Sununu and Gregg also differed on two other critical elements in
the surplus-deficit calculation: how much revenue the state will
take in during the year ending June 30, and how much money will be
left over _ appropriated but not spent _ in various state accounts.
   Together, those differences alone made Sununu about $13 million
more optimistic than Gregg.
   Some Democrats suggest Sununu padded figures to make himself look
good, even as he was criticizing Dukakis, last year's Democratic
presidential candidate, for boasting about the economy in
neighboring Massachusetts.
   But Gregg himself agrees that the deteriorating fiscal picture
wasn't predictable. He does not challenge Sununu's assertion that
when he left, the forecast was for a small surplus even after the
bills were paid.
   ``You could still have been optimistic into December,'' Gregg
said, ``and if I were a departing governor, I suspect I would have
been.''
   Sununu added, ``I felt we still would have been able to manage
it.''
   Even now, Gregg and legislators don't agree on how much money the
state will take in this year. Projecting revenues, Gregg said,
``remains very much a crystal-ball game.''
   Gregg said the main reason is the unpredictability of the state's
business profits tax, its top moneymaker.
   Gregg warned against exaggerating the state's difficulties.
Spending cuts, not tapping the state's rainy day fund or raising
taxes, will take care of the projected deficit, he said.
   ``My sense is we are still in a very manageable problem,'' he
said.

<HEAD>In Reversal, New Hampshire Wants To Block Seabrook Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a break with 15 years of state support
for the Seabrook nuclear power plant, Gov. Judd Gregg announced he
will ask a federal bankruptcy judge to block low-power testing of
the reactor.
   Gregg, who two months ago succeeded staunch Seabrook supporter
John Sununu, said Wednesday the testing shouldn't start until
commercial operation is assured.
   ``If Seabrook never goes on-line (commercially), then low-power
testing will have been a wasted exercise, the resultant
contamination will have been avoidable and the expense will have
been unnecessary,'' the Republican governor said in a statement.
   Seabrook officials hope to start the tests within weeks and begin
commercial operation within a year.
   Spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire officials ``have concerns that this may lead to additional
unnecessary delays and cost increases for Seabrook and may further
delay our getting Seabrook's power, which we need.''
   But Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams sought to play down the
development and said Gregg ``must be misinformed'' about the effects
of low-power testing on the plant.
   Seabrook opponents greeted Gregg's announcement as a major
setback for the long-delayed project.
   ``The one thing the owners could always say was that they had the
state on their side. We're delighted to have company in this
fight,'' said Mary Breslauer, spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney
General James Shannon, who has fought Seabrook licensing on the
grounds that Massachusetts residents near the plant could not be
safely evacuated if there were an accident.
   Anti-Seabrook lawyer Robert Backus called Gregg's announcement
``monumentally good news.''
   The $5.9 billion project was completed in July 1986 but remains
idle because of evacuation-planning and financial obstacles.
   Seabrook's main owner, Public Service, sought bankruptcy
protection in January 1988. Other Seabrook owners have been
faltering.
   Gregg said the state will argue to Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos
that letting Seabrook conduct atomic tests is not sound business
judgment ``unless it has first obtained the clearances necessary to
begin full-power operation, including final evacuation plans.''
   Public Service, one of five members of the Seabrook owners'
executive committee, has maintained it does not need Yacos' approval
to start the tests. The judge has not ruled on the issue.
   In December, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Seabrook's troubled finances do not pose a safety concern for
low-power tests as long as the owners prove they can come up with
$72.1 million to decommission the reactor if the tests are conducted
but the plant never operates commercially.
   Seabrook owners initially hoped to give that assurance in
January, but they have yet to do so.
   Public Service owns 36 percent of Seabrook, and Gregg said the
state opposes letting the company take on what he estimated as $25
million more liability for low-power decommissioning.
   Gregg said that contaminating Seabrook with atomic testing ``will
needlessly render the facility useless for alternate applications.''
   Williams, the Seabrook spokesman, countered: ``There's nothing to
suggest that the plant would be rendered useless. Any contamination
would be negligible.''
   Public Service began the project in 1972, initially planning two
1,150-megawatt reactors at a cost of less than $1 billion, the first
to operate commercially in 1979 and the second in 1981. Seabrook's
owners abandoned the second reactor in 1986.
   The project suffered years of delays over environmental issues,
and in the late 1970s became the site of mass protests, resulting in
more than 2,000 arrests.
   Sununu, who in 1984 helped Public Service sell bonds that paid
for the plant's completion, now is President Bush's chief of staff.

<TEXT>
   A host of the state-run
television network's morning talk show has taken temporarily leave
after making a racist remark off-camera that was broadcast
nationwide.
   During Wednesday's telecast of ``Good Morning South Africa,''
there was an interview with a black housemaid in which she talked
about problems finding someone to look after her children while she
worked.
   After the interview, a voice was heard to say: ``I'll bet you
she's got 14 children, and each from a different father.''
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. confirmed today that David
Hall-Green, one of the program's four hosts, had made the remark.
The company said the incident was under investigation and Hall-Green
had taken a temporary leave for health reasons ``because he was
under stress.''
   The Labor Party, which controls the mixed-race house of the
three-chambered Parliament, today called for Hall-Green's suspension.

   A sociologist is studying whether the
rise in weekend residents like herself are to blame for traffic
jams, high housing costs and the disappearance of dairy farms, as
locals in this quaint town claim.
   ``When social change happens, people create explanations of why
it's happening,'' said Roberta Satow Wool, associate professor of
sociology at Brooklyn College in New York.
   ``I'd like to look at their explanations of why it's happened
versus ... the objective reasons why it's happening.''
   Wool, her husband and their two children have spent their
weekends in a modest, white clapboard house overlooking the state's
northwest hills since 1980. She estimates as many as 20 percent of
this town's 3,960 residents are weekenders, mostly from New York
City about 85 miles to the southwest.
   Spurred by complaints voiced by longtime residents, Wool has
spent two years examining how weekenders have affected housing
costs, taxes, jobs, consumer buying patterns and the quality of life
in the last decade. She is finishing her work by surveying local
attitudes toward part-time residents.
   ``I started off on a guilt trip,'' she said. ``I started out
feeling, `Gee, we have intruded in this place and we've had a very
negative impact.'''
   She hopes to finish this summer and publish her findings in a
book about American communities being compiled by the New School for
Social Research in New York City. She says her work will have
implications for other towns where wealthy urbanites have bought
weekend homes in increasing numbers, a trend called rural
gentrification.
   According to studies by the U.S. Department of Commerce and
researchers at City University of New York, the number of second
homes in the United States has surged since 1950, when there were an
average of 40,000 built each year, Wool said.
   The number jumped to 130,000 a year in the 1970s and there were
more than 3 million second homes in 1977, the last year for which
national figures were available, she said.
   Locals say Washington has been transformed from an agrarian
community into what William Bader, the town's unofficial historian,
calls a ``cosmopolis _ an affluent parlour town'' populated on
weekends by doctors, lawyers and Wall Street executives.
   Groceries, butcher shops and hardware stores have given way to
upscale shops, including a fancy jewelry store and a book store that
caters to affluent New Yorkers, he others said.
   ``I'm not saying it's good and I'm not saying it's bad,'' Bader
said. ``As with any kind of an economic change, there is always
somebody that benefits and somebody that gets hurt. The young locals
just can't afford to live here.''
   ``There are some very distinguished people who have bought homes
here and in their own way, they have contributed a lot to the
community,'' said Thomas P. Whitney, owner of the Hickory Stick
Bookshop.
   Bruce Bailey Sr., a lifelong resident who owned a garbage
collection business until he retired, says he must drive further to
shop for basic necessities. ``It's tough to get a quart of milk,''
said Bailey, 63.
   Parking is so short on Saturday mornings in Washington Depot, the
shopping district, that some residents are calling for traffic
restrictions, he said.
   The number of people buying second homes in Washington jumped
from five in 1982 to 52 in 1986, Wool said. The median price of a
home increased from $75,000 in 1980 to $240,000 in 1987, according
to figures compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the state Office
of Policy and Management.

   Rain and snow fell along the southern and middle Atlantic Coast
today, with a winter storm in North Carolina being blamed for five
deaths, while several record high temperatures were set in the West
and Southwest.
   Four people were killed on icy roads in North Carolina, and a
woman died of hypothermia in her unheated house after refusing to go
to the hospital, authorities said.
   Meantime, forecasters stood by their prediction that temperatures
would reach the 70s by Sunday. ``It's hard to believe, isn't it?''
said Michael Sabones of the National Weather Service office at
Raleigh-Durham International Airport. ``But that's the way things
have gone lately.''
   In the West, rainshowers fell in northern California and
southwestern Oregon, and snow in California's higher elevations.
   Skies this morning were cloudy along much of the Atlantic Coast,
as well as from the middle and upper Mississippi Valley to the
northern and central Pacific Coast, and across the southern Pacific
Coast region.
   In Colorado, Denver's 74-degree reading broke the old record of
72 set in 1986 for the date and Alamosa's record of 67 erased the
old high reading of 63, also set in 1986. Other record highs for the
date were set in Las Vegas, where an 87-degree reading broke the
1972 record of 84 and Tucson, Ariz., where 90 degrees surpassed the
88 of 1957.
   Wednesday's high temperature was 92 degrees at Laughlin, Nev.,
and three Arizona cities, Buckeye, Phoenix and Yuma.
   Today's forecast called for rain across the northern and central
Pacific Coast region into the northern and central Plateau; showers
lingering along the North Carolina and eastern Florida coasts.
   Predicted highs: 30s from northern Minnesota through the northern
Great Lakes region into northern New England; 60s and 70s from the
central and southern California Coast through the central valleys of
California, the central Rockies, the central and southern Plains,
and the Gulf Coast region into southern Florida; 80s from the desert
Southwest into the southern Rockies and west Texas; 90s in southern
Arizona.
   The rest of nation was expected to reach the 40s and 50s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 13 degrees
below zero at Houlton, Maine, to 71 at Phoenix.

   An Eastern Airlines pilot who crossed picket lines
said today that static and cries of ``scab'' interfered with his
radio communication with air traffic controllers.
   The incident was reported to the Federal Aviation Administration
and the FBI, which has recordings of the interference, FAA spokesman
Jack Barker in Atlanta said.
   ``The word `scab' was used on the radio,'' said Capt. Roger P.
Pipkin, who was flying Flight 5679 from Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport to Miami on Monday with a crew of six and
three passengers aboard.
   ``I haven't said that any danger was posed,'' said Pipkin, who
has flown for Eastern for 27 years. ``But if frequencies are going
to be used for reasons other than air traffic control then we have a
problem.''
   Pipkin said he has no idea who caused the interference, which
lasted seven minutes and occurred during ``taxi out, take off and
climb out.''
   Pipkin said he heard voices on three frequencies and static on a
fourth, blocking a call for clearance to a new heading.
   Most aircraft, including private planes, have radios that can
transmit on aviation frequencies used by commerical jetliners.
Signals also could have been sent from a portable transmitter
available in specialty stores for several hundred dollars, officials
said.
   Barker said the pilot was able to communicate despite the
interference.
   ``The frequencies were not jammed. There was some interference on
the frequencies from some unknown person on the air,'' Barker said.
``The FBI has it now.''
   Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association, whose members
have refused to cross the Machinsts' picket lines, said they were
unaware of the incident.
   ``I find it highly unlikely that an ALPA pilot would do it. It
could have been anybody,'' said Jack Gordon, an Eastern pilot at the
ALPA communications center in Miami.
   ``It's just contrary to everything you're taught. The safety
factor alone is enough to stop you. You don't jam channels,'' Gordon
said. ``Being a pilot, that's the last thing I'd do. My fellow
airmen wouldn't do it either.''
   Pipkin, 52, is one of only a few of Eastern's 3,600 pilots to
cross picket lines during the strike by the Miami-based carrier's
8,500 Machinists, who walked off the job Saturday.
   Eastern has dropped all service expect its Northeast Shuttle and
several flights from Miami to Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile.

airlock, abandoning Earth's atmosphere for one created to test the
systems of Biosphere II, a futuristic, closed ecosystem which won't
be completed for about 15 months.
   ``I will live, move and breathe in another life system,'' Ms.
Alling said before she entered the airlock. She later told reporters
over a videotape hookup that she felt like a pioneer.
   ``It is another world, and a world apart from where you are. It
is a remarkable feat,'' she said.
   Researchers from the Soviet Union have experimented with
non-food-producing closed systems, and the University of Hawaii has
kept a closed experiment going for 20 years, but no one has
integrated natural processes into a long-term habitat capable of
sustaining human life, project director Margaret Augustine said.
   That is the mission of Biosphere II, which will provide a world
within a world for eight ``biospherians'' from September 1990 until
September 1992, she said.
   Biosphere II will feature desert, ocean, farmed land, marsh,
savanna and jungle ``biomes,'' or life zones, with 250 animal
species ranging from goats to insects and 3,800 plant species. The
human habitat, listed as another biome, will include laboratories
and an amphitheater in a six-story building resembling a mosque.
   Ms. Augustine and other officers of Space Biospheres Ventures, a
private company largely funded by Texas oilman Edward P. Bass,
expect the $30 million project to pay for itself in sales of
biospheres to governments and researchers for space colonization,
preservation of endangered species or other projects.
   Ms. Alling said her experiment will be the longest test so far a
human-inhabited module cut off from Earth's atmosphere and food
chains.
   There have been 2{ years of unmanned studies in the test module
and a three-day manned study.
   The Yale University-trained biologist wore a red jumpsuit as she
entered the enclosure, a greenhouse about the size of a single-car
garage at the base but topped with a glass-and-steel canopy that
makes it 20 feet high and traps 15,000 cubic feet of air.
   The module, stocked with flora and fauna as well as a private
quarters for Ms. Alling, is a fraction of the size of Biosphere II,
which will put 5 million cubic feet under glass over a 2{-acre site.
But planners expect this week's experiment to prove the worth of
their calculations that plants, organisms and solar-powered
equipment can purify the air and water and replenish the oxygen
supply of the biospherians.
   ``The import of this thing is monumental'' because of information
to be gathered, said Linda Leigh, a design coordinator.
   The small enclosure kept Ms. Alling's world devoid of chickens,
goats and other vertebrates expected to populate Biosphere II.
   However, Ms. Alling said she would have no trouble dining on
2,500 calories a day from 29 types of fruit and vegetables, as well
as two aquarium fish which she will kill and eat as part of the test.
   Air circulation works on a system similar to Biosphere II's: Hot
air will rise over the desert section of the module, pick up
moisture over a 1 million-gallon ocean and release it as rain over a
rain forest. Solar fans and a turbine will send air back over the
desert to begin the cycle again.
   Ms. Alling, a 29-year-old marine-mammal scientist, will monitor
systems inside while project managers outside do the same, as well
as record Ms. Alling's heart and respiration rate and other vital
signs.
   She has already learned to enjoy the enclosed environment, which
she said ``has the wonderful smell of a rich tropical rain forest.''

<HEAD>Government Agrees To Drop Claims Against Senior Union Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has agreed to drop its claims
against the second-ranking Teamsters official in return for his
efforts to increase democracy and fight corruption in the union,
lawyers said.
   The settlement with Weldon Mathis, the union's
secretary-treasurer, was announced in U.S. District Court Wednesday
just days before the government's case against the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters was scheduled to go to trial.
   It remained unclear whether Mathis would go through with the pact
should the union oppose it and demand his resignation.
   In January, after three other officers settled, the Teamsters
board passed a resolution requiring any member of the leadership who
settles with the government to resign from the board. Mathis and his
allies want to remain on the board.
   The government has been negotiating with the union and some of
its leaders in recent weeks. But talks with leaders loyal to union
President William J. McCarthy have ended, said James T. Grady, the
union's general counsel.
   Mathis challenged McCarthy for leadership of the 1.7
million-member union after the death of Jackie Presser in July.
   The government's civil suit seeks to use federal racketeering
laws to oust the union's senior leadership and impose reforms.
Originally named as defendants were the union, 18 members of its
executive board and 26 alleged leaders of organized crime. The trial
is scheduled to begin Monday.
   Also Wednesday, Judge David N. Edelstein separated from the case
all of the government's claims against five reputed organized crime
figures, saying those claims would be tried separately.
   The government previously dropped from the case the 21 other
people it identified as Mafia leaders after some were ordered and
others agreed to refrain from involvement with the union.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union says it will accept World
Court rulings in cases involving human rights treaties, a gesture
that signals an end to Soviet resistance to being judged by other
nations.
   State Department officials hailed the move as ``a major step''
and said they hoped the Soviets would now join the United States in
accepting the court's rulings in all but the most sensitive national
security cases.
   The United Nations' legal office on Wednesday released a letter
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze wrote to
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar withdrawing Soviet
reservations on six human rights treaties.
   His letter suggested, however, that the Soviet Union would agree
to the court's arbitration in all human rights cases. The 15-judge
officially neutral court deals with cases brought by states and has
no authority to deal with complaints filed by private individuals or
organizations.
   Shevardnadze noted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
proposed in his December address to the General Assembly that all
countries recognize World Court jurisdiction ``with respect to the
interpretation and application of human rights agreements.''
   In Geneva, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly L. Adamyshin
said the changes Gorbachev is pursuing are aimed at ``the
development of a state based on the rule of law.''
   ``We want to build it by drawing on the general democratic
achievements of human civilization,'' he said.
   A senior State Department official called the announcement ``a
major step.'' The official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
noted that the Soviets previously contended the court ``was
dominated by Western influences.''
   The Netherlands-based tribunal, formally known as the
International Court of Justice at The Hague, was established in 1945
and is the main judicial arm of the United Nations. While it has no
powers of enforcement, its rulings weigh heavily on world opinion.
   Three years ago, the United States rejected the court's authority
when Nicaragua brought a case charging Washington with trying to
subvert the leftist Sandinista government.
   Washington and Moscow have been holding talks, however, in an
effort to get an agreement with Britain, France and China to
recognize the court's authority in most treaties.
   A World Court official in The Hague today called the Soviet move
a declaration of Moscow's intention to give the court a more
prominent role in international affairs.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that only
once had the court handled a case involving one of the six treaties
in which Shevardnadze said the Soviets would recognize the court's
binding jurisdiction
   They are:
   _The 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
   _The 1979 Convention on the Elimination All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women;
   _The 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination;
   _The 1952 Convention on the Political Rights of Women;
   _The 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitutions of Others;
   _The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide.
   Moscow had signed the treaties, but said it did not accept World
Court authority in disputes.
   U.S. and Soviet legal experts have held two rounds of talks since
July aimed at strengthening the court's authority in all but the
most sensitive political cases.
   Washington also suggests that the United States, Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France declare certain cases inappropriate for
the court's jurisdiction, such as national security issues or the
use of force.
   That would avoid cases such as the 1986 Nicaraguan-U.S. dispute,
in which Nicaragua charged the United States was illegally mining
its harbors. After the World Court ruled it had jurisdiction in the
case, the United States refused to appear before the tribunal or
honor its verdict, which favored the Sandinistas.
   In 1946, the United States had accepted the compulsory
jurisdiction of the World Court in all cases except those within the
jurisdiction of U.S. courts.

<TEXT>
   China today answered U.S. criticism of its use of
force to quell dissent in Tibet, saying it has the right to maintain
order within its boundaries and will not tolerate foreign meddling.
   ``Tibet is an inalienable part of China,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Li Zhaoxing said. ``Tibetan affairs are China's internal
affairs which brook no interference by a foreign government,
organization or individual.''
   Li characterized the violence in Tibet as ``a serious riot
deliberately engineered by a handful of separatists in an attempt to
split China. This is what the Chinese government and people can
never tolerate.''
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman on Wednesday
criticized the Chinese government's use of force against
demonstrators.
   ``While we recognize the right of a government to maintain order,
we object to the unwarranted use of lethal force,'' he said.
   China says 12 people were killed in three days of violent clashes
between police and pro-independence Tibetans. Tibetans have put the
death toll far higher and claim most of the victims were shot by
security forces.
   On Tuesday, China put the Tibetan capital of Lhasa under martial
law and reportedly has arrested large numbers of protesters.
   Redman said the U.S. government had expressed its concerns to the
Chinese government. ``We stressed a concern in the United States
over human rights in Tibet.''
   Li, speaking at a weekly briefing, also criticized a recent U.S.
decision that Chinese employees at the United Nations may not travel
farther than 25 miles from midtown Manhattan on personal business.
   The restriction has previously applied to other socialist nations.
   ``The discriminatory travel restrictions imposed on Chinese U.N.
employees by the United States run counter to the norms of
international law and the legal obligation undertaken by the United
States in accordance with the U.N. Charter,'' Li said.
   ``China flatly rejects these unreasonable restrictions.'' Li said
China has called on the United Nations ``to urge the United States
to abolish this discriminatory measure immediately.''

<HEAD>Persistence Pays For Man Wrongly Accused In Theft Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you don't believe that it pays to be
persistent, just ask Michael Ray Tanner. But be sure you ask the
right Michael Ray Tanner.
   The Michael Ray Tanner who knows that persistence pays is the
same man who finally convinced a Harris County prosecutor that the
wrong man had been arrested on a felony theft charge.
   But it wasn't easy. Tanner said even the woman who was with him
when he was arrested won't talk to him.
   A Harris County deputy arrested Tanner on Feb. 12 on a 1986
warrant accusing him of stealing $6,000 worth of computer discs.
Tanner, a 31-year-old electronics technician from suburban Katy,
took an unusual step to prove he was the wrong man.
   He began calling prosecutor Ruben Perez.
   Perez said: ``I told him I shouldn't be talking to him and that
anything he said could be used against him, but he just kept telling
me we had the wrong man. ... Finally I started to sense a ring of
credibility. He literally convinced me on the phone.''
   The matter was resolved Wednesday during a confrontation between
Tanner and Joseph H. Wofford Jr., whose tapes had been stolen three
years ago.
   Wofford took one look at the technician in the courtroom and told
Perez that Tanner was not the Michael Ray Tanner who had stolen the
tapes.
   The judge then signed a dismissal order that exonerated the
innocent Tanner.
   The other Tanner, 35, who is accused of taking 20 discs from
Wofford's business and attempting to ransom them back for $1,500, is
still at large, authorities say.
   The younger Tanner said his problems began when his Jeep got
stuck in the mud. A deputy who came out to help ran a check on the
man's driver's license and arrested him on the old warrant.
   ``I was on a date with a girl I'd just met, and now she won't
even talk to me,'' Tanner lamented. ``The deputy wouldn't even let
me go back to the Jeep to tell her. He said, `I'll take care of
it.'''
   Tanner spent most of a day in jail before paying a bondsman $300
to post a $2,000 bond.
   Tanner said he never hired a lawyer, choosing instead to take his
case directly to Perez.
   ``If I'd been guilty, I sure wouldn't have called him, but I had
nothing to lose,'' Tanner said. ``I had to do something.''

<HEAD>Strongman Tom Owens Injured In Stunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weightlifter and stunt man Tom Owen, who
once let a tractor-trailer rig roll across his stomach, finally met
his match.
   The operator of a home for abused children suffered two broken
ribs Wednesday after a pickup truck loaded with 20 children rolled
across his stomach.
   ``I've never been hurt like this before,'' Owen said by telephone
from his bed at AMI Brookwood Medical Center. ``The pain was so bad
I thought I might die.''
   Owen, founder and director of the King's Ranch in Chelsea, was
admitted to the hospital with abdominal injuries and was being kept
overnight for observation, a spokeswoman said.
   Owen, 38, had performed the stunt hundreds of times when he
agreed to do it Wednesday for a photographer from the National
Enquirer.
   The problem, Owen said, was he didn't have a ramp to catch the
wheel of the truck once it had rolled across his stomach. Owen
usually uses two ramps _ one of each side of his stomach _ but he
decided to use only one ramp Wednesday because he thought it would
make a better picture.
   A dozen spectators and the truckload of children watched quietly
as Owen writhed on the ground in pain. For several minutes, Owen
appeared dazed before he finally looked around and said, ``Is it
over? I must have blacked out.''
   Owen, who has won dozens of trophies in weight-lifting contests,
started performing his daredevil feats about 10 years ago to raise
money for the ranch.
   Until Wednesday, his only serious injury was a broken hand, the
result of a truck tire landing on his hand, he said. He also has
broken several teeth during stunts in which he pulls trucks and
lifts heavy objects with his mouth.

<DATELINE>WATKINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small plane and a home-built aircraft
apparently collided in the air, killing four men, including three
members of one family, authorities said.
   Witnesses said they watched one of the planes, a single-engine
Cessna, plummet into a muddy field Wednesday afternoon near
Interstate 70 about 15 miles east of Denver.
   ``I just heard a snap, like a collision. When I looked up, I saw
the right wing of an aircraft had been torn off and it was spiraling
to the ground,'' said Rorie Barta of Basalt, who was at the Watkins
truck stop at the time.
   Another witness, truck stop attendant Gene Newman, also saw the
wing come off and then watched the Cessna drop ``like a wet potato.''
   ``It looked like a wing came off _ that one (the Cessna) just
looked like it dropped,'' said Newman. ``I never did see the other
plane.''
   Greg Feith, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Denver, said three men were found dead in the
wreckage of the four-seat Cessna 172K in a muddy field about a mile
southeast of Watkins.
   Another man was found dead amid the debris of the home-built,
single-seat fiberglass and wood aircraft 300 yards away, said Arnold
Scott of the NTSB.
   Frederick Lee Wright, 37, of Akron was identified as the pilot of
the Cessna, which also carried his brother-in-law, Craig Andrew
Willeke, 34, of Otis, and father, Harold Lee Wright, 67, of Akron,
according to Arapahoe County chief deputy coroner Jim Stork.
   The pilot of the home-built plane, a Quickie Q-2 model, was
identified as Robert M. Bucy, 41, of Aurora.
   Scott said he would attempt to confirm today whether there was an
in-flight collision, although witnesses said pieces from the
home-built craft were found close to the crashed Cessna.
   Feith and Lt. John Maki of the County Sheriff's Department said
it was possible one or both of the planes' pilots may have been
watching area fire departments battle a brush fire two miles south
of the crash scene when they collided.
   The Cessna was believed to have taken off from Akron, 90 miles
northeast of Watkins, while the home-built plane had taken off
minutes before the crash from the Aurora airport, about three miles
from the crash site, airport officials said.
   Scott said home-built planes are certified by the Federal
Aviation Administration and are not necessarily more dangerous than
conventional aircraft.

   President Bush should stand by his nomination
of John Tower for secretary of defense, former presidents Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford said during a joint appearance.
   ``At no time did I see John Tower in a position which impaired
his integrity or capabilities,'' Ford said Wednesday night during a
news conference before he and Carter appeared in a forum at Tulane
University.
   ``My opinion is that he is well qualified to serve and he will be
secretary of defense,'' said the Republican former president.
   Democrats in the Senate have called on Bush to withdraw Tower's
nomination, which has been jeopardized by allegations of excessive
drinking and womanizing.
   Carter said Bush's choice for the post should be honored.
   ``I don't think it would harm relations to allow Tower to
serve,'' the Democrat said.
   Ford and Carter met in a debate on ``The American Presidency.''
The forum was part of Tulane's Direction '89 speaker series.
   The two crossed political party affiliations and agreed on most
of the topics.
   Both said Bush should stay out of the current Eastern Airlines
strike.
   ``If I were president I would not intercede in negotiations
involving Eastern Airlines,'' Carter said.
   Ford said it would be ``unfortunate'' if Bush were to get
involved between labor and management in the walkout by Eastern
machinists.
   ``It is certainly tragic that one of our great American airlines
will probably never fly again,'' he said. ``(But) the controversy
will have no significant impact on the labor movement ... unless
secondary boycotts occur.''

   A comatose woman who received an abortion
last month after a bitter legal battle has made enough progress to
transfer to a rehabilitation center, relatives say.
   Nancy Klein, who remains in a coma at North Shore University
Hospital in Manhasset, just east of New York City, was to be moved
today to a rehabilitation center in Edison, N.J.
   ``Nancy is moving onto a whole new world,'' her mother, Anne
Zusselman of Delray Beach, Fla., said Wednesday in an interview with
The Associated Press from the Klein home in Upper Brookville.
   ``We think she is ready, and we're going for it.''
   Mrs. Klein, 32, suffered severe brain damage in a Dec. 13 car
accident.
   Her husband, Martin, 34, went to court to be appointed her legal
guardian so he could authorize an abortion that doctors said could
improve her chances of survival.
   Anti-abortionists fought a three-week court battle to block the
abortion, appealing all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before the
case was thrown out.
   The abortion was performed Feb. 11 when Mrs. Klein was 18 weeks
pregnant.
   Although hospital physicians believe Mrs. Klein only has a slim
chance of recovery, family members say they have seen an improvement
since the abortion.
   She can move her head to both sides, open her mouth and lift her
left arm on command. ``She can even give us the thumbs up sign,''
Mrs. Zusselman said.
   But Carol Hauptman, a spokeswoman for North Shore, said Mrs.
Klein's condition remained unchanged.
   The Klein's 3-year-old daughter has visited her mother twice in
the hospital.
   ``We don't know how much Nancy knows but she seems to be happy
when the baby visits,'' said Mrs. Zusselman.
   The family believes Mrs. Klein now requires intensive daily
therapy that the hospital isn't equipped to provide.
   The Robert Wood Johnson Rehabilitation Institute of John F.
Kennedy Hospital has a renowned brain trauma unit. It provides eye
and speech therapy and equipment that includes a chair that will
help Mrs. Klein hold her head up.
   ``They will give her an intensive workout, as much as she can
take,'' Mrs. Zusselman said.

   Students hurled firebombs at a U.S.
Navy frigate anchored in the southern port of Pusan but failed to
hit their target, authorities said. Four people were arrested.
   Police said four students in a rented car drove past security
guards outside the port then hurled a tear gas grenade and three
firebombs at the 3,877-ton Ouellet, which is taking part in joint
military exercises between South Korea and the United States, police
said.
   Police said the firebombs fell about 50 yards short of the ship,
which arrived in Pusan on Monday.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the students were
demanding an end to the joint exercises. Police seized two tear gas
grenades, three firebombs, three iron pipes and four South Korean
flags, it said.
   U.S. military authorities have said about 200,000 U.S. and South
Korean troops would be mobilized in the massive exercises, which
begin next Tuesday and are to last 10 days.
   Dissidents and radical students contend the exercises would
heighten tension on the divided Korean peninsula and hamper peace
talks with communist North Korea.
   North Korea has demanded a halt to the exercises for months,
calling them preparation for a nuclear attack on the north. U.S. and
South Korean officials describe the exercises as strictly defensive.

<HEAD>Company To Pay Refunds To Policy-Holders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Farm Insurance has agreed to pay
refunds to thousands of new policy-holders charged higher auto
insurance rates after California voters approved a proposition to
slash rates last year.
   But the state's largest automobile insurer will go ahead with a
9.6 percent rate increase charged to all of its auto insurance
customers more than a month ago. The state Department of Insurance
has scheduled a hearing on the legality of the increase.
   The refunds were announced Wednesday as a settlement of charges
by the department that State Farm had discriminated illegally
against new customers.
   The company, which insures 2.8 million drivers in California,
started assigning new customers to a higher-priced subsidiary, State
Farm Fire and Casualty Co., after Nov. 8, when voters approved the
rate-slashing Proposition 103 initiative.
   State Farm Fire and Casualty charges 20 to 60 percent more than
State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., the ``preferred-risk''
subsidiary.
   It was the first increase by a major California insurer since the
passage of Proposition 103, which calls for a one-year rollback of
auto and property insurance rates to 20 percent cut below November
1987 levels. The state Supreme Court has blocked the rollback while
it considers insurance company lawsuits claiming the initiative is
unconstitutional.
   The department contended State Farms' actions violated a
pre-Proposition 103 law forbidding arbitrary discrimination among
insurance customers. State Farm said it had suffered large
underwriting losses in California and was entitled to refuse new
customers in any subsidiary as long as all customers were treated
alike.
   The department said as many as 10,000 new customers were placed
with the higher-priced company. The details of the refund plan were
due in two weeks.
   ``We're pleased with the results of our negotiations,'' said
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. ``Now the policy-holders
will get immediate action instead of seeing the issue drag through
courts for years.''
   James Mattesich, a lawyer for State Farm, said part of the
settlement was an agreement by the department that the company's
actions had been ``reasonable and consistent with prior regulatory
practice.''

<HEAD>Hunger Strikers Will Go Free Or Face Trial</HEAD>

   Authorities have agreed to
release or file formal charges against 35 black inmates who have
been hospitalized because of their hunger strikes, their lawyers
said today.
   Lawyer Mahmood Cajee said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
agreed on Tuesday to make a decision on the status of each of the 35
prisoners, who are among hundreds of black inmates being held
without charge.
   The 35 prisoners, some of whom have been on hunger strikes for 19
days, are inmates at a prison in the southeastern city of
Pietermaritzburg.
   Cajee said the detainees resumed eating Wednesday evening. ``The
detainees are ecstatic,'' he said.
   The attorney declined to say how many of the 35 would be freed
and how many would be charged, but said he expected the Law and
Order Ministry to announce its decisions within a matter of days.
   Lawyer Rishi Thakurdin, who also represents some of the inmates,
said some of those released would be placed under restrictions
limiting their movements and prohibiting involvement in political
activities.
   A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, said Vlok
was ``examining the status of each and every detainee (nationwide)
but we don't want to comment on individual cases.''
   Detainees in Johannesburg began fasting Jan. 23, demanding to be
freed or put on trial. The hunger strikes quickly spread to other
cities, and Vlok said Feb. 16 he would release a ``substantial
number'' of detainees.
   The government says it since has freed 279 detainees and more
than 500 people remain held without charge. Anti-apartheid groups
say 202 people have been released while about 700 remain in
detention.
   The groups say Vlok has reneged on his promise, that he had given
the impression that more than half the detainees would be released
by the beginning of March. There have been widespread calls for an
end to all detentions without trial.
   About 20 detainees in Durban and a smaller number at Modderbee
Prison east of Johannesburg reportedly remain on hunger strikes.
   Vlok said Wednesday that 23 detainees hospitalized due to their
hunger strikes have been returned to prison.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying lengths of time under the nearly 3-year-old state of
emergency.
   Emergency regulations give security forces wide powers and ban or
restrict many forms of peaceful protest.
   In a separate development today, two black men convicted of
murder were hanged in Pretoria, raising the number of executions
this year to four.
   Human rights organizations recently praised the government for
the sharp decline in the rate of executions. A total of 117 people
were executed last year and 164 were hanged in 1987.

   Britain imprisons proportionately more people than
any other major West European country, an inmate aid group said
today.
   The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of
Offenders said British prisons held 55,729 people last month,
representing 98.2 prisoners for every 100,000 in the population.
   Comparative figures were Austria 96.0, Finland 93.0 and France
92.0.
   ``These disturbing figures reinforce the case for a greater use
of non-custodial penalties for non-violent offenders,'' said the
association's director, Vivien Stern.

   Drug agents were alerted to look out for
possible retaliation from cocaine dealers after the indictment of 33
wholesale jewelers on charges of participating in a $1 billion money
laundering ring.
   ``We are getting feedback now which indicates we will get some
major retaliation against law enforcement,'' said John Zienter, head
of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Los Angeles.
   Zienter and other law enforcement officials announced the
indictments at a news conference Wednesday. Four others were
indicted last week in San Jose. The officials also made their first
public comments on the money laundering probe code-named Operation
Polar Cap.
   The indictments on charges of money laundering and conspiracy to
aid and abet narcotics trafficking struck a major blow to the
Colombian drug cartels, officials said.
   ``The amount of money laundered is staggering,'' U.S. attorney
Robert Bonner said of the $1 billion alleged to have been moved out
of the country in two years. ``The amount represents proceeds of
approximately 70 tons of cocaine sold in the United States in two
years.''
   The jewelers are alleged to have operated the money laundering
business in the heart of the Los Angeles jewelry district. They were
arrested Feb. 22.
   Bonner said the 15-month probe netted more than $80 million in
real estate, gold and cash seized from the defendants. It included a
$17 million, 10-story building in the center of the jewelry district
that allegedly was purchased with cocaine profits.
   The grand jury indictments focused on operations run by Nazareth
and Vahe Andonian and Wanis ``Joseph'' Koyomejian, who operated
jewelry and gold bullion companies in Los Angeles.
   In addition to defendants of Armenian, Turkish and Syrian
descent, the indictments also named several Latin Americans, one of
whom was said to oversee the entire money laundering operation from
his post in Uruguay. That defendant, Raul Vivas, is in custody in
Uruguay, Bonner said.
   The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment. The maximum sentence for money laundering is 20 years
and fines up to $25 million.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Academy of Sciences today
named U.S. space researcher James A. Van Allen winner of the 1989
Crafoord Prize for his discovery of the radiation belts surrounding
the Earth.
   Van Allen, professor emeritus at the University of Iowa, also was
cited for providing the first instruments ever carried to another
planet, those taken on the 1963 mission to Venus by Mariner II.
   The prize, which includes a $252,000 cash award, is given
annually by the same institution that awards the Nobel Prizes. The
award was founded in 1980 for excellence in physical sciences
outside those stipulated by the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel:
chemistry, physics, and medicine.
   Van Allen began experimenting in nuclear physics by developing
instruments for counting charged particles, the academy said. After
World War II, when he served in the Navy, he applied his methods to
the study of cosmic rays and the earth's geomagnetic field, using
rockets he helped develop.
   His experience in rocketry and instrumentation put him at the
forefront of space research at a time when the United States and the
Soviet Union had begun their race to put satellites and men in space.
   His work with the Explorer I satellite led to the discovery in
1958 of the earth's radiation belts, now called the Van Allen belts.
   As head of the astronomy and physics department of the University
of Iowa, Van Allen developed new satellites in the early 1960s and
trained some of the leaders in space research, the academy said.
   He has published close to 250 scientific papers on studies
ranging from solar wind to the magnetospheres of the various planets.

<TEXT>
   Howard University students today ended their
three-day occupation of the school's administration building that
led Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater to resign from the
board of trustees.
   ``We have done it,'' said protest spokeswoman April Silver. ``We
have made not a national statement but an international statement to
the world.''
   Students left the building by 4 a.m. after receiving a letter
from university officials promising they will not be punished for
participating in the action, said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for the
Coalition for Concerned Students.
   The officials also agreed to work on improvements to financial
aid and curriculum at the predominantly black university, Lewis said.
   ``You stood up and said `we have an insult level,' and Howard has
established a watershed movement,'' civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson told the students as the takeover ended.
   Jackson, Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and Walter Fauntroy, the District
of Columbia's delegate to Congress, met into the early-morning hours
with the students.
   Jackson called the outcome ``a great victory.''
   He said the students had two major interests. ``On one hand, they
were concerned about being a part of the political process on the
campus, which (university) president (James) Cheek agreed to in a
very amicable way, and also they were concerned about the politics
of the (Bush) administration. They want an end to race-conscious
politics.''
   Lewis said some students remained in the building today to repair
any damage that was caused during the occupation, which began Monday
as students protested Atwater's appointment to the board of trustees.
   Atwater resigned Tuesday, saying he was worried the occupation
might lead to injuries of students.
   After learning they had succeeded in driving Atwater from the
board of trustees, the students focused their attention on other
demands involving curriculum, financial aid and improved security.
   The demonstration disrupted classes and the students on Wednesday
blocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used for
temporary administrative offices.
   Atwater was appointed to the board in December. Students started
the protest on Friday when they disrupted a convocation ceremony for
the school's charter day that was to have included a speech by
comedian and philanthropist Bill Cosby.
   The students recommended that Cosby be named to replace Atwater.
   Atwater complained Wednesday that he was the victim of an
``unfair portrayal'' of his civil rights positions by Howard
students.
   ``All I was trying to do was help Howard University,'' Atwater
said. ``The president of the school knew that _ the board of
trustees knew, and I think some of the students knew.''
   Students contended that Atwater encouraged racism while managing
President Bush's 1988 campaign by focusing on convict Willie Horton
Jr., who is black. Horton raped a Maryland woman while on furlough
from a Massachusetts prison.
   Jackson thanked Cheek for the way he handled the demonstration.
``These struggles to make life better don't always end on this note.
Many students have been expelled to make their point and that didn't
happen at Howard,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama today praised the Tibetan
nationalist struggle and condemned Chinese repression in the
disputed region, the scene of bloody riots this week.
   Tibetan demonstrations for independence have left at least 16
people dead and forced the imposition of martial law in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital.
   ``No amount of repression, however brutal and violent, can
silence the voice of freedom and justice,'' the Tibetan spiritual
leader said in a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the
Tibetan uprising against China.
   ``Unfortunately, the Chinese leadership still fails to understand
... the extent of dissatisfaction among the Tibetan people,'' said
the statement, issued by the office of the Dali Lama's
representative in New Delhi.
   The Dalai Lama, spiritual leaders of Tibetans, fled to India
after the failed March 10, 1959, uprising against the Chinese in
Lhasa.
   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of Chinese territory
for seven centuries. But most Tibetans maintain it was an
independent nation before the communists moved into Tibet in 1949.
   ``We honor ... more than 1 million Tibetans who have died as the
result of four decades of Chinese occupation,'' the Dali Lama said.
   His government-in-exile, headquartered in the town of Dharmsala,
260 miles north of New Delhi, offered on Wednesday to hold talks on
the future of Tibet with the Chinese government.
   ``Despite the current tragic events, we are still ready to hold
talks with the Chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found,''
said Tashi Wangdi, the Tibetan leader's chief representative.
   China offered in September to hold talks with the Dalai Lama on
the future of Tibet if he dropped demands for Tibetan independence.
   The Dalai Lama's adminstration accepted the offer but said the
only reasonable basis for resolving the issue was ``a self-govering
democratic entity'' in Tibet ``in association with the People's
Republic of China.''
   The talks were to start in January, but snags developed in
December when the Chinese said they preferred to meet in Beijing,
not Geneva.
   The Tibetans rejected Beijing, saying a meeting in the Chinese
capital would portray the Tibetan issue as an internal Chinese
problem.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-five nations, including the Soviet
Union and the United States, today began talks aimed at closer
East-West relations.
   Separate talks on reductions in NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional
armed forces were to begin later today.
   The negotiations on ``confidence- and security-building
measures'' involve all the countries that signed the 1975 Helsinki
accords on human rights and include all European countries except
self-isolated Albania.
   In January, the nations adopted the concluding document of the
Helsinki review Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which spells out far-reaching human rights and provisions for
economic cooperation in Europe.
   Foreign ministers of the 35 nations Wednesday ended a three-day
conference that set the stage for today's talks, which may last for
several years before practical agreements are reached.
   The arms control negotiations replace and expand the Mutual and
Balanced Force Reduction talks, which ended without agreement after
15 years.
   But the new talks _ called the Negotiations on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe _ come during a time of improved relations between
the superpowers and are expected to produce results. They will
involve the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the seven Warsaw Pact members.
   NATO wants the East to make deep cuts in tanks and troops. NATO
has proposed overall limits of 20,000 tanks for each side, 16,500
artillery pieces for each side and 28,000 armored troop carriers for
each alliance.
   The British foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said NATO's
proposals would reduce Soviet tanks and artillery in Europe by
two-thirds and armored troop carriers by more than 50 percent.
   The Warsaw Pact has proposed reductions in troop numbers and all
weapons, including battlefield nuclear weapons. But the United
States and most of its allies insist that nuclear weapons must be
dealt with separately.

   Oral arguments it will conducted April 26 in a
case the Supreme Court is being asked to use to overturn or greatly
alter its 1973 legalizing abortion.
   A 60-minute session in the Missouri case, the most closely
watched controversy at the high court this year, will take place on
the 1988-89 term's last scheduled day of arguments.
   The justices are expected to announce their decision by July.
   At issue are Missouri abortion regulations struck down by a
federal appeals court.
   Although the case could be resolved without altering the court's
1973 landmark decision, Missouri authorities and the Bush
administration are urging the court to reconsider its 16-year-old
ruling in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
   Justice Department lawyers have asked the court to let state
legislatures decide what legal protections, if any, should be given
to women seeking abortions.
   The court's 1973 decision said women have a constitutional right
to seek abortions, and greatly limited governmental authority to
interfere with that right.

   Frontrunners in the 1,168-mile
Anchorage-to-Nome sled dog race edged closer to the halfway point
today after a musher who placed ninth last year took the lead.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe was the first to reach the checkpoint at Takotna,
arriving at 6:53 p.m. Wednesday, less than 2{ hours after she left
McGrath. Defending champion Susan Butcher held the No. 2 spot,
leaving McGrath at 5:16 p.m., 48 minutes after Jonrowe.
   Standings Wednesday night in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
showed Joe Runyan, Rick Swenson and Martin Buser in the lineup
immediately behind Jonrowe and Butcher. The rest of the top 10
consisted of Joe Garnie, Jerry Riley, Jacques Philip, Lavon Barve
and Tim Osmar. Nine of the 10 are Alaskans. Philip is from France.
   Takotna is 128 miles from Iditarod, the halfway point. The first
musher at Iditarod is to receive a silver trophy and $3,000 in
silver ingots. The race carries a $250,000 purse, with the winner at
Nome qualifying for $50,000.
   Jonrowe is running in her seventh Iditarod and Butcher is
shooting for a fourth consecutive win. The two women are friends,
and Jonrowe has purchased dogs from Butcher's kennel in Manley.
   Standings Wednesday night showed 15 of the Iditarod's 45 mushers
either were in McGrath or just beyond the Kuskokwim River town. Most
of the others had reported in at Nikolai, the checkpoint 48 miles
east of McGrath.
   Iditarod founder Joe Redington held 12th place in the evening
standings.
   Forty-nine mushers left the starting line Saturday in Anchorage.
Four have dropped out.

<HEAD>Report: Anti-Rushdie Commando Spotted in Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A news agency today quoted intelligence
sources as saying an Iranian commando unit was in Spain recently,
apparently trying to obtain weapons to kill author Salman Rushdie.
   According to the EFE news agency, the sources said the Iranians
dispersed and infiltrated Britain, France and West Germany and that
authorities in those countries were notified. It said the Iranians
were trailed in Spain more than 10 days ago.
   The sources, who were identified only as being close to the
investigation, were quoted as saying information obtained through
telephone taps revealed the group was unable to obtain weapons in
Spain and that no arrests were made due to lack of evidence.
   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14 sentenced Rushdie
to death for his new novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say
blasphemes Islam. Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for
Rushdie's death.
   The writer lives in Britain and has been in hiding since the
death order.
   The commando group consisted of five men and two women, said the
sources. The agency said five members entered Spain from Morocco,
using Moroccan passports and posing as migrant workers.
   The other two arrived in Madrid from Beirut aboard a Middle East
Airlines flight and met up with the five in an apartment in northern
Madrid, the sources told EFE.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Luis Peiro said the ministry could
neither confirm nor deny the report. ``This information didn't come
from us, and we're still checking on its veracity,'' he said.
   The commandos remained under surveillance during the week they
spent in Spain, apparently trying to make contacts to get arms and
explosives to kill Rushdie, according to EFE.
   When they were unable to secure weapons, two of the Iranians
drove to the port of Santander and caught a ferry to England, EFE
said. Three other Iranians drove to France, EFE said. The two who
had arrived from Beirut took a flight to Munich, West Germany, the
agency said.

   A teacher fired for wearing jeans and no
tie to class says he has no option but to wait on the outcome of a
grievance after the state Supreme Court refused to intervene in his
case.
   The court on Wednesday unanimously refused former Point Pleasant
High School math teacher Bill Webb's request that it order him
reinstated pending the grievance hearing.
   Webb's lawyer asked the court to overturn a Mason County Circuit
Court decision denying his request to be reinstated while he
challenges his dismissal.
   Webb, of Gallipolis, Ohio, was fired for refusing to abide by a
dress code prohibiting him from wearing blue jeans and requiring him
to wear a tie. He appealed the dismissal to the state Education
Employees Grievance Board, which conducted a hearing Jan. 27 but has
issued no ruling.
   Mason County Circuit Judge James O. Holliday on Feb. 21 denied
Webb's request for an injunction requiring the county school board
to give him his job back pending the outcome of his appeal. The high
court voted 5-0 against hearing the case.
   ``It seems they are very much concerned with keeping the
grievance system intact,'' Webb said after the court's decision. He
said his next action would be determined by the state hearing
examiners' decision, which is due in early April.
   Webb, a 20-year veteran of the Mason County school system, was
suspended three times during the fall for refusing to wear a tie and
dress pants to school. On Halloween, he was suspended indefinitely
and was fired on Dec. 21.
   In the meantime, he has applied for jobs at a manufacturing plant
in Ohio and a college and has been doing odd jobs around his house.
   ``It it wasn't for the frustration of dealing with these people,
it's been all right. I've done everything I've wanted to do since
Halloween,'' Webb said.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia today became the first
country to officially recognize the Afghan guerrilla
government-in-exile.
   Saudi Arabia did so because the members of the
government-in-exile were chosen freely by the Moslem guerrilla
leaders, the official Saudi Press Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as saying.
   Saudi Arabia, home of Islam's holiest shrines, carries
considerable weight in the Moslem world. The oil-rich kingdom has
given the Moslem guerrillas considerable support in their struggle
against the Afghan government and the Soviet army, which withdrew
last month after nine years of fighting.
   The United States and Pakistan also supplied the anti-communist
forces with weapons and funding during the Soviet intervention.
   Saudi Arabia will host a meeting of foreign ministers from the
46-member Islamic Conference organization later this month. Among
other issues the conference will discuss recognizing the Afghan
guerrilla's government-in-exile, which was proclaimed in Pakistan on
Feb. 24.
   The president of the guerrilla government, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi
on Wednesday called on the United Nations and the Islamic Conference
organization to recognize the new leaderhsip of the insurgency.

everyone,'' she said. The woman, who runs a small hotel in Lhasa,
was interviewed by telephone from Beijing. Foreign reporters were
barred from the city.
   China on Tuesday declared martial law in the city of 70,000
following three days of rioting by Tibetans demanding independence
from China and the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
   China today added four people to the number killed during
protests in Lhasa on Sunday, bringing the official toll to 16 dead
and about 100 wounded.
   Western travelers say many more have died, and most Tibetans
reportedly put the toll at between 20 and 30.
   The government also denied that it had abused Tibetans' human
rights.
   The Tibetan woman said most of the city's foreigners, estimated
at 140, left in buses. About 40 flew into to Chengdu, the capital of
neighboring Sichuan province.
   The woman said soldiers then began detaining large numbers of
Tibetans. She said she could not estimate how many people were being
taking away. ``Many people. It is many more than when the foreigners
were here,'' she said.
   Upon arriving in Chengdu, tourists said Tibetans had become
increasingly scared after the imposition of martial law.
   ``People begged us repeatedly over the last few days _ `Tell the
world, help us please,''' said one American from New Orleans, who
spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Chinese reprisals.
   ``They grab your hand and say `Help us,' and they cry,'' said a
West German woman.
   A group of tourists that flew to Chengdu issued a statement they
said would be sent to the United Nations and to the Dalai Lama, who
lives in exile in India.
   ``It is our urgent and heartfelt wish that the world community
should carefully and critically examine the causes of this conflict
and the methods and motives of the authorities,'' said the statement.
   ``While the Tibetan demonstrators became violent and destructive
in expressing their anger and frustration, we feel the magnitude and
bloodiness of the crisis has been caused by the incompetence of the
authorities.
   ``Shootings by the authorities have been excessive,
unpredictable, indiscriminate and there have on occasion been
atrocities,'' it said.
   State-run radio reported the four additional deaths and said the
people died in the hospital ``during emergency life-saving
procedures.'' The report did not say whether the dead were Tibetans.
   Foreigners say some Tibetans claim as many as 100 people were
killed by police, although those claims could not be confirmed.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, in a weekly briefing,
denied Chinese authorities were violating the human rights of
Tibetans.
   ``Recently a handful of separatists committed beating, smashing,
looting and burning in a deliberate attempt to start a riot,'' Li
said. ``These violent incidents aimed at splitting the motherland
were a serious breach of law. It is not a question of human rights,
religion or nationality.''
   Li also blamed the disturbances on the ``clique'' of the Dalai
Lama.
   During the riots, thousands of Tibetans rampaged through the
streets and ransacked Chinese-owned shops. On Wednesday, travelers
reported seeing police dragging Tibetans out of their homes and
hauling them away in trucks.
   The official Chinese media has given no figures on arrests, but
the Communist Party's official People's Daily reported from Lhasa
how police raided one home and dragged a screaming man outside. They
then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket.
   The man's wife was quoted as saying, ``Hurry up and dress and go
with them. I told you not to take part (in the riots) but you just
had to do it.''
   China's official Xinhua News Agency, meanwhile, accused Tibetan
separatists living abroad of smuggling weapons into Tibet and
instigating the riots.
   Foreign travelers said they saw no signs of Tibetans firing on
police.
   Xinhua said, ``The Tibetan separatist clique based abroad has
recently sent its men into Tibet under the guise of tourists to
incite riots, and they have also smuggled weapons into the region.''
   It was an apparent reference to the followers of the Dalai Lama,
who fled Tibet following a failed uprising against China's army in
March 1959.
   Friday is the 30th anniversary of that rebellion, and martial law
was imposed in part to prevent further anti-Chinese demonstrations
on that day.
   The Dalai Lama, in a statement marking the anniversary, praised
the Tibetan struggle and condemned Chinese oppression.
   ``No amount of repression, however brutal and violent, can
silence the voice of freedom and justice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bitten Snake Expert Released From Hospital, Doesn't Blame Viper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old snake researcher bitten by a
deadly viper last week was released from the hospital and has
returned to his laboratory.
   William Haast, whose illness touched off an international effort
to find antivenin to save him, was released Wednedsay.
   He said the Pakistani pit viper was only defending itself,
blaming the bite on his own carelessness. It was the 148th time he
had been bitten during his career as a researcher and the 19th time
he was hospitalized.
   ``They have a reputation for striking out,'' he said Wednesday.
``They can reach out from the ground over two feet.''
   Haast was bitten Feb. 28. Because he did not expect the reaction
to be as serious as it was, he did not enter the University of Utah
Health Sciences Center until the following day.
   He was treated with antivenin flown in from California when it
was discovered he was allergic to the serum on hand.
   Through the efforts of a White House aide, more serums were
obtained from England, from the Soviet Union and even from private
sources in Iran. But in the end, the serums from overseas were not
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because Haast
appeared to be recovering.
   Haast said the people who sent in the antivenins were ``the real
heroes of this story.''
   He is director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
University of Utah. He keeps an estimated 1,000 poisonous snakes at
the lab, where venom is extracted for research and the manufacture
of antivenins.
   Hospital spokesman John Dwan said Haast would still have to have
blood tests every other day for the next week or so.

<HEAD>Nine Former Iranian Embassy Employees Told to Leave in 10 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine former employees of the Iranian Embassy will
be deported if they do not leave Britain voluntarily within 10 days,
a government spokesman said today.
   Also today, Spain's national news agency EFE quoted intelligence
sources as saying an Iranian commando team was recently in that
country trying to obtain weapons, apparently to kill British author
Salman Rushdie.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said Iran's death sentence
against Rushdie has damaged Islam more than the controversial novel,
which some say blasphemes Islam.
   Kuwait today joined other Moslem nations in condemning the book,
and it banned all works by the author, who was born into a Moslem
family.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' led Iran to break relations with Britain
on Tuesday. Britain, in turn, announced Wednesday it plans to expel
``a number'' of Iranians because of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
refusal to revoke his death sentence against Rushdie.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
expulsion order applied to up to 30 Iranians ``who are held to be
close to the regime.'' There are about 25,000 Iranians in Britain,
including 2,400 students.
   ``I can confirm to you that the names of nine Iranian individuals
have been sent over to the FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office),''
a spokesman for the Home Office, the department responsible for
immigration, said today.
   ``This would be to initiate the proceedings to secure their
removal,'' he said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. When asked if they were former embassy employees who no
longer have diplomatic status, he said, ``I can confirm that.''
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said his officials were checking all
people stationed in Britain by Iran to decide ``which of them we can
no longer safely receive here.''
   ``I think we are dealing here with a regime which is different
from the others, a regime which in recent weeks has gone back to
preaching violence,'' Hurd told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding, reportedly under
police guard, since Feb. 14, when Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill
him. Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   According to the Spanish news report, seven Iranians were tracked
in Spain more than 10 days ago but have since dispersed and
infiltrated Britain, West Germany and France. The news agency quoted
sources as saying authorities in those countries were warned.
   EFE quoted the sources as saying the group was apparently tried
but failed to obtain weapons in Spain to kill Rushdie. No charges
were filed because of lack of evidence, it quoted the sources as
saying.
   The Iraqi president was quoted today as telling the Saudi
newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that Rushdie is ``bad and ill-disposed.''
   But he was also quoted as saying, ``This (death threat) does more
damage to Islam than Salman Rushdie's book.'' It was the first
public statement from the Iraqi president on the Rushdie affair.
   Kuwait's government urged Moslems across the world to boycott all
books published by The Penguin Group, which published ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   In a separate decision, the Information Ministry banned all books
written by Rushdie.
   The novel has been banned in almost all Moslem countries, and
riots against it have killed 19 people.

   The New Orleans Symphony took the stage for
the first time since it ran out of money 14 months ago and feted a
rare sell-out crowd with balloons, jazz bands and Cajun buffet.
   ``This is a great victory for the city,'' Mayor Sidney Barthelemy
told the crowd Wednesday. ``This is a great victory for the people.
... We can't go anywhere but up.''
   The long absence generated a crush for tickets. In addition to
the opening night sellout, officials said all seats for Saturday
night were sold and only 200 remained for the next Thursday's
performance in the 1,750-seat Orpheum Theater.
   Symphony officials said they could remember only one previous
sell-out in the Orpheum _ a benefit with violinist Itzhak Perlman.
   Ron Jones, president of the board, said 70 percent of season
tickets have been sold and officials expect to sell 90 percent of
seats in advance.
   Organizers turned the opening into a celebration. There were
flowers for women in the audience, a welcome line of local
television anchors and a high school jazz band playing in the lobby.
   During the closing bows, balloons rained from the ceiling as in a
political convention. Afterward, the whole crowd was invited to a
hotel across the street where some of the city's finest restaurants
catered a buffet that included jambalaya, red beans and rice, shrimp
pasta and oyster soup.
   The crowd loved it.
   ``I can remember the night they closed,'' said Eean McNaughton,
an architect who has been attending the symphony here for 30 years.
``It really makes this an exuberant night.''
   A massive fund-raising and the sale of the Orpheum erased a $4
million debt. The theater's buyers, whose names haven't been
disclosed, are letting the symphony play rent-free for five years.
   In addition, the board of directors and staff were restructured.
   The symphony has scheduled a short 12-week spring season. Full
34-week seasons are being prepared for the next two years.
   The opening program, with music director Maxim Shostakovich
conducting, included ``Fanfare For A New Beginning,'' composed by
orchestra flutist Richard Harrison.
   Alexander Slobodyanik was guest pianist for Chopin's Concerto No.
1 in E Minor.
   ``The orchestra sounds better than it has for a long time,
because the people are in a better mood,'' said Greg Miller, a
trombonist who is the musicians' personnel manager. ``It is hard to
concentrate on Beethoven when you are worrying about paying the
rent.''
   The shutdown took its toll on the musicians, however. Thirteen of
the 89 orchestra members were listed in the program as ``on leave.''
Many have new jobs, including concert master Joseph Kim who is now
concert master of the Seoul Symphony in South Korea.
   Kim flew back to New Orleans for the opening and will be featured
next week in Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. It is uncertain whether
he will return next year.

<HEAD>Sullivan Offers Help for Clean-Needle Programs to Fight AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs 7th graf, New York, to correct that Tacoma, Wash.,
also has needle program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's top official in the
fight against AIDS says the federal government will help communities
that want to give clean needles to drug addicts to slow the spread
of the deadly disease.
   Louis Sullivan, health and human services secretary, says
programs that provide clean needles to drug addicts deserve
consideration by local communities, but controversy over the idea
will limit federal involvement until there is evidence that such
programs work.
   ``While I don't subscribe to the view that it condones drug
abuse, there are other people in society who do, so the issue here
is to try to work through this problem,'' Sullivan said Wednesday in
an interview.
   Sullivan said he would need to look ``very carefully'' at whether
the federal government should pay for needle-exchange programs, but
that in the meantime it could provide such support as trained health
workers to advise on how to set up programs.
   He also stressed that while he would encourage communities to
experiment with needle exchanges, the federal government should not
require communities to have such programs.
   ``These are activities that really mandate local decisions from
the local communities around the country ... but we would be very
supportive of such efforts if the communities make those
decisions,'' he said.
   New York City, where more than half of the city's 200,000 heroin
addicts are believed to be infected with the AIDS virus, and Tacoma,
Wash., are the only U.S. cities with a government-sponsored
needle-exchange program. Private efforts are under way or being
planned in several other cities, following the lead of several
European cities which say their programs have succeeded in slowing
the spread of AIDS without increasing drug abuse.
   But the New York program has run into strong opposition from
black and Hispanic leaders who say giving needles to addicts
continues their dependence on drugs. Those opponents say efforts
should be focused on treatment of drug abuse.
   Officials say the infection rate for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome has been slowing in the gay community because of increased
awareness and use of safe sex practices. But they say the virus is
spreading rapidly among drug addicts through sharing of contaminated
needles.
   Infected addicts then spread the lethal disease to their sexual
partners and to their babies.
   Sullivan said the department needs to target educational
campaigns better to reach drug addicts and inform them about how the
virus is spread.
   ``We may very well not be tailoring the message to the specific
segments of the community in the way that they can be most
effective,'' he said.
   On other AIDS topics he said:
   _He would support a federally funded study into the sexual
practices of Americans as a way to get a better handle on the AIDS
epidemic and where it's headed.
   ``From a public health standpoint, this is information we
desperately need if we're going to have a reasonable chance of
stemming this epidemic,'' he said.
   _A New York group that announced this week it will help import
prescription drugs not available in the United States for use by
people with AIDS does not appear to be breaking any laws, but he
said the government will try to learn more about the effort.
   ``As long as laws are not broken, we would certainly not stand in
the way, but we would want to be sure that the public understands
that this is not an activity that is endorsed by this department,''
he said. ``But we recognize the desperateness of the situation.''

<HEAD>Researchers Find Sex Difference in Mate Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men and women aren't just different, they
also have different attitudes about what makes a good mate, says a
researcher who quizzed both sexes in dozens of cultures worldwide.
   While both sexes value kindness and intelligence, the five-year
study suggests sexual differences in mate selection are virtually
universal and probably rooted in man's evolution.
   Fifty scientists studied more than 10,000 people of both sexes
from 37 cultures in 33 countries to rate the desirability of 31
characteristics in a mate, said David M. Buss, a University of
Michigan psychology professor who directed the International Mate
Selection Project.
   The study is to be published in the March issue of Behavioral and
Brain Sciences.
   The two basic differences emerged in nearly every culture, from
Australians with western lifestyles to the Zulus of rural South
Africa, Buss said.
   ``Men worldwide place greater value on mates who are young and
physically attractive,'' Buss said Wednesday.
   ``Women prefer mates who are somewhat older, have good financial
prospects and are ambitious and industrious,'' he said.
   But the research also showed both sexes value kindness and
intelligence more than income or physical appearance, Buss said.
   ``When I first found these sex differences in samples within the
United States, people were skeptical that they would be found across
cultures,'' he said. ``I was skeptical as well. But after the data
from 37 cultures were analyzed statistically, I was surprised at how
pervasive the sex differences were.''
   Earlier animal studies have confirmed the theory that females
prefer mates who bear greater gifts, hold better territories or
display higher rank, Buss said.
   Cross-cultural similarities in choosing a mate may result from
patterns set by our ancestors, including a woman's traditional
dependence on a man for food, shelter and protection, he said.
   Western European and North American men included in the study
preferred mates who were at least one year younger, Buss said. By
contrast, men surveyed from Greece, Iran, Colombia and Bulgaria
opted for mates who were three to four years younger, while Nigerian
and Zambian men preferred women six or seven years younger.
   Women from Indonesia, Nigeria and Zambia most emphasized the
earning potential of their prospective grooms, he said. Dutch,
British and Zulu women placed the lowest values on a man's
money-making abilities. American women considered finances important
but not crucial.
   The value placed on chastity varied widely from culture to
culture, Buss said. Men from 23 of the 37 cultures considered
marrying a virgin more important than did women.
   Both sexes in China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Taiwan and Israel
stressed the value of chastity, the study found. But most Western
Europeans said prior sexual experience was irrelevant in a potential
mate, Buss said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airline's decision to seek Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection from creditors today means the strike-crippled carrier
could continue to operate, although it may have difficulty imposing
wage cuts on union employees.
   Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, companies are
shielded from creditors while they continue to operate and
reorganize their finances. Any reorganization plan is subject to
approval by the bankruptcy court and creditors.
   Eastern could continue flying, as other carriers have after
seeking bankruptcy court protection.
   But Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.,
would have a tougher time imposing lower wages on striking employees
than he did when he reorganized Continental Airlines under federal
bankruptcy law in 1983.
   Congress amended federal laws in 1984 to require bankrupt
companies to negotiate with unions and prove economic necessity
before abrogating their contracts.
   The Eastern strike began Saturday with a walkout by 8,500 members
of Eastern's Machinists union in a dispute over Lorenzo's proposed
$125 million in wage cuts.
   The Miami-based airline reduced its operations to about 4 percent
of its scheduled flights and sent thousands of employees home after
Eastern pilots and flight attendants joined the Machinists walkout.

   All foreigners were removed from Lhasa
today, and Chinese troops began rounding up Tibetans, said a Tibetan
woman.
   ``Soldiers are all over the place, and they're grabbing
everyone,'' she said. The woman, who runs a small hotel in Lhasa,
was interviewed by telephone from Beijing. Foreign reporters were
barred from the city.
   China on Tuesday declared martial law in the city of 70,000
following three days of rioting by Tibetans demanding independence
from China and the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
   China today added four people to the number killed during
protests in Lhasa on Sunday, bringing the official toll to 16 dead
and about 100 wounded.
   Western travelers say many more have died, and most Tibetans
reportedly put the toll at between 20 and 30.
   The government also denied that it had abused Tibetans' human
rights.
   The Tibetan woman said most of the city's foreigners, estimated
at 140, left in buses. About 40 flew into to Chengdu, the capital of
neighboring Sichuan province.
   The woman said soldiers then began detaining large numbers of
Tibetans. She said she could not estimate how many people were being
taking away. ``Many people. It is many more than when the foreigners
were here,'' she said.
   Upon arriving in Chengdu, tourists said Tibetans had become
increasingly scared after the imposition of martial law.
   ``People begged us repeatedly over the last few days _ `Tell the
world, help us please,''' said one American from New Orleans, who
spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Chinese reprisals.
   ``They grab your hand and say `Help us,' and they cry,'' said a
West German woman.
   A group of tourists that flew to Chengdu issued a statement they
said would be sent to the United Nations and to the Dalai Lama, who
lives in exile in India.
   ``It is our urgent and heartfelt wish that the world community
should carefully and critically examine the causes of this conflict
and the methods and motives of the authorities,'' said the statement.
   ``While the Tibetan demonstrators became violent and destructive
in expressing their anger and frustration, we feel the magnitude and
bloodiness of the crisis has been caused by the incompetence of the
authorities.
   ``Shootings by the authorities have been excessive,
unpredictable, indiscriminate and there have on occasion been
atrocities,'' it said.
   State-run radio reported the four additional deaths and said the
people died in the hospital ``during emergency life-saving
procedures.'' The report did not say whether the dead were Tibetans.
   Foreigners say some Tibetans claim as many as 100 people were
killed by police, although those claims could not be confirmed.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, in a weekly briefing,
denied Chinese authorities were violating the human rights of
Tibetans.
   ``Recently a handful of separatists committed beating, smashing,
looting and burning in a deliberate attempt to start a riot,'' Li
said. ``These violent incidents aimed at splitting the motherland
were a serious breach of law. It is not a question of human rights,
religion or nationality.''
   Li also blamed the disturbances on the ``clique'' of the Dalai
Lama.
   During the riots, thousands of Tibetans rampaged through the
streets and ransacked Chinese-owned shops. On Wednesday, travelers
reported seeing police dragging Tibetans out of their homes and
hauling them away in trucks.
   The official Chinese media has given no figures on arrests, but
the Communist Party's official People's Daily reported from Lhasa
how police raided one home and dragged a screaming man outside. They
then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket.
   The man's wife was quoted as saying, ``Hurry up and dress and go
with them. I told you not to take part (in the riots) but you just
had to do it.''
   China's official Xinhua News Agency, meanwhile, accused Tibetan
separatists living abroad of smuggling weapons into Tibet and
instigating the riots.
   Foreign travelers said they saw no signs of Tibetans firing on
police.
   Xinhua said, ``The Tibetan separatist clique based abroad has
recently sent its men into Tibet under the guise of tourists to
incite riots, and they have also smuggled weapons into the region.''
   It was an apparent reference to the followers of the Dalai Lama,
who fled Tibet following a failed uprising against China's army in
March 1959.
   Friday is the 30th anniversary of that rebellion, and martial law
was imposed in part to prevent further anti-Chinese demonstrations
on that day.
   The Dalai Lama, in a statement marking the anniversary, praised
the Tibetan struggle and condemned Chinese oppression.
   ``No amount of repression, however brutal and violent, can
silence the voice of freedom and justice,'' he said.

making both military alliances ``strictly defensive'' by the year
2000 after gradual reductions in troops and weapons.
   Oleg A. Grinevski, the Soviet ambassador to the new talks on
reducing conventional weapons, outlined the Warsaw Pact proposals at
the start of the negotiations involving the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Separate talks on closer East-West relations also began today in
Vienna. Those talks involve the 35 nations, including the Soviet
Union and United States, that signed the 1975 Helsinki accords on
human rights.
   Grinevski stressed the Warsaw Pact's opposition to a Western
proposal to upgrade 700 Lance nuclear missiles to double their range
to about 150 miles. The missiles are mostly in West Germany.
   Reading a prepared statement, Grinevski declared: ``It should be
clearly understood that good will has its limits. We have made quite
a few major unilateral steps.''
   He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
announcement to pull out about 50,000 men and their weaponry from
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary during the next two years
and pledges by other Soviet bloc countries to scale down their
armies and defense budgets.
   ``Let no one cherish the hope that our profound internal changes
will be making us more malleable and agreeable to unreasonable
demands or inflated bids,'' Grinevski said.
   Judging by the Warsaw Pact presentation and prior NATO proposals,
the two alliances differ substantially on how and what reduce, and
to what extent.
   The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization proposes deep
cuts in battle tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel
carriers. It says the seven-member Warsaw Pact has a 2-to-1 edge in
such equipment.
   The Warsaw Pact paper proposes three stages of reducing personnel
and arms up to the year 2000.
   From 1991 to 1994, participants would eliminate ``imbalances and
asymmetries'' between the alliances and ``would take steps to
eliminate the capability to launch a surprise attack or initiate a
large-scale offensive action.'' The amount of arms the alliances are
allowed to maintain would be reduced by about 15 percent, according
to the Warsaw Pact.
   From 1994 to 1997, the bloc proposed reductions of armed forces
by 25 percent, or 500,000 men.
   In the last stage, the armed forces of the NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations should be given ``a strictly defensive character,''
according to the paper.
   It included combat aircraft among the weapons to be cut. But NATO
is unwilling to discuss the inclusion of combat aircraft at this
point.
   NATO has proposed overall limits of 40,000 tanks on both sides,
33,000 artillery peices overall and 56,000 troop carriers. It also
proposed a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000 artillery pieces and 16,800
armored troop carriers for any one nation.
   Weaponry stationed outside one's home country would be limited to
32,000 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troop
carriers in each bloc, according to NATO proposals.
   Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said this would
cut Soviet tanks and artillery in Europe by two-thirds and armored
troop carriers by more than 50 percent.
   The United States and most other NATO countries have ruled out
negotiations on nuclear or even dual-capable weapons system, stating
that they are not included in the mandate for the new arms talks.
   But Grinevski said, ``The more agreement we shall have on the
conventional side, the more (are) necessary steps, measures or
negotiations concerning other types of security _ tactical nuclear
weapons, and their modernization, and the naval situation.''
   Nuclear weapons ``are not on the agenda, but they exist around
us. It's impossible to close our eyes to that. I'm just warning
about that, nothing more,'' he said.
   The arms control negotiations replace and expand the Mutual and
Balanced Force Reduction talks, which ended without agreement after
15 years.
   The new talks _ called the Negotiations on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe _ come during a time of improved relations between
the superpowers and are expected to produce results.

   Police today arrested and briefly held 2,000
people who tried to march on the state legislature to protest Union
Carbide Co.'s $470 million settlement in the Bhopal gas disaster,
officials said.
   About 5,000 demonstrators, many carrying small children and
waving banners saying ``We Want Justice,'' marched from the
shantytowns affected by the 1984 gas leak to the Madhya Pradesh
state legislature, said a police spokesman who insisted on anonymity.
   About 2,000 marchers, including 500 women, tried to cross a
police barricade half a mile from the building and were arrested,
the spokesman said.
   A few demonstrators wrestled briefly with police before being
taken by buses to jail, where they were charged with violating an
order prohibiting the assembly of more than five people on the
legislature grounds, he said.
   The spokesman said all were released this evening.
   On Feb. 14, the Supreme Court in New Delhi ordered Union Carbide
to pay $470 million as the final settlement of all claims stemming
from the world's worst industrial disaster.
   More than 3,400 people died when toxic methyl isocyanate leaked
from a pesticide plant run by Union Carbide's subsidiary, Union
Carbide of India Ltd. More than 20,000 others were injured.
   Many shops and business throughout this central Indian city
closed today in a daylong strike to protest the settlement, which
also absolved the U.S.-based multinational of any criminal or civil
liability for the gas leak.
   The protests came on the opening day of the legislature's budget
session.
   Opposition politicians wore black arm bands bearing skulls and
crossbones and shouted ``Down with Union Carbide.'' Some carried
placades saying, ``The settlement smells of kickbacks.''
   ``The result of the settlement has been that Union Carbide shares
have gone sky high and the prestige and honor of India has been
ground to dust,'' said Atal Bihari Bajpayi, a leader of the
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. ``India has let the Third World
down.''
   About 570,000 victims, many of whom lived in shantytowns around
the factory, filed compensation claims. Parliament passed the Bhopal
Gas Leak Disater Act 1985 giving the government the authority to act
on behalf of the victims.
   A panel of five Supreme Court justices is hearing arguments this
week on a petition challenging the government's authority to act as
the sole representative of the victims.
   The federal government originally sued Union Carbide for $3
billion, claiming the gas leak was caused by negligence.
   Union Carbide, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., said the gas leak
was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

   More than 1,000 musicians, actors and other artists
gathered to lobby the legislature to restore $19 million in arts
funding to the state budget, saying culture returns more than that
to the state.
   They argued that jobs, ticket sales, tourism and enrichment of
schools and communities justify full state funding for the
Massachusetts Council on the Arts and Humanities.
   In a rally outside the Statehouse on Wednesday, they brandished
signs that said ``Don't stop the music'' and ``Keep the arts alive.''
   The state House of Representatives is debating a $12.3 billion
budget proposal for next year that eliminates $19 million proposed
by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for the council, which makes grants to
dozens of cultural institutions and individual artists.
   The legislature is considering a no-frills budget because the
current fiscal year is expected to end up at least $600 million in
the red since anticipated corporate tax revenue has not materialized.
   Democratic House leaders, retreating from the zero funding
recommended by the House Ways and Means committee two weeks ago,
have decided to support a plan that would tap the state Lottery
Commission's prize money to restore $9.5 million to the council.
   But arts advocates want restoration of full funding, arguing that
the money spent on the arts more than pays for itself. Last year,
arts funding yielded $23 million in state taxes, they said.
   ``Culture is good business, and the economic impact is
substantial,'' said Nancy Finkelstein, executive director of the
Massachusetts Cultural Alliance.
   Holly Sidford, executive director of the New England Foundation
for the Arts, said her group has compiled statistics that show
non-profit arts groups contributed $1.2 billion to the state's
economy. She said arts organizations employed 20,000 people and
served 20 million ticket buyers, five times the number who attended
professional sports events.

<HEAD>Top Vatican Official Says U.S. Bishops Yield To Academicians</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Ratzinger criticism of U.S. bishops,
American comments. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A top Vatican cardinal, addressing American
Catholic leaders, accused bishops of allowing their authority to be
usurped by academic experts, officials said today.
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the powerful Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith, appealed to the Americans attending a
special Vatican meeting to assert their authority and be ``martyrs''
for church teaching.
   Some U.S. bishops countered that compromising on some church
issues ``should not be seen as weakness,'' as long as matters of
faith are not sacrificed.
   The issue of the U.S. bishops' role was at the center of an
extraordinary meeting involving 35 American Catholic leaders
summoned by Pope John Paul II to discuss the independent-minded
American flock.
   The Vatican has criticized American Catholics' dissent from Rome
on matters such as artificial birth control and divorce.
   At the meeting's opening session, Ratzinger charged that in many
places theological experts have expressed their own ideas through
the mass media. He said they ``have taken the place of bishops as
teachers, causing a growing insecurity and disorientation'' among
the faithful.
   Bishops, he said, were pressured to be administrators rather than
strong champions of church doctrine.
   ``Bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative model,
little defending their magisterial authority'' over that of
theological experts, the West German cardinal said, according to a
summary of his speech.
   ``Those who announce the Gospel must also be martyrs, in the most
profound sense of the word,'' he said.
   Ratzinger's speech Wednesday evening was to set the Vatican's
tone for this week's four-day meeting, according to church
officials. Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro and the Rev. John
Lynch, secretary of the U.S. National Conference of Bishops, briefed
reporters today on the closed session.
   In opening remarks at the meeting, Archbishop John L. May,
president of the U.S. bishops' conference, said Americans would not
put up with an authoritarian approach from the church.
   Other bishops, led by Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis-St.
Paul, responded to Ratzinger's speech by saying that give-and-take
in the American church did not endanger Catholicism.
   ``Several bishops said that in the United States, compromise _ as
long as you're not giving away the store ... is not in and of itself
a bad word or a bad process,'' said Lynch.
   The bishops, he said, declared ``that to keep the dialogue open,
which can sometimes be read as weakness, but which in our American
experience often leads to a good end, should not be seen as
weakness.''
   ``While it can be risky, it does sometimes lead to the successful
conclusion of problems'' between bishops and theological experts, or
between the church hierarchy and the faithful, the bishops said,
according to Lynch.
   The Vatican has billed this week's encounter as a series of open
discussions of issues raised during the pope's 1987 U.S. visit and
periodic bishops' trips to Rome.
   On Wednesday evening, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said
``there were no expressed disagreements'' to the speech by Ratzinger
or one he gave on the bishops' role.
   However, several of the bishops' statements drove home the
contention of some Americans that Vatican criticism stems in part
from a lack of understanding of the U.S. church.
   Speaking of U.S. society at Wednesday's meeting, May said:
``Authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or culture.
Individual freedom is prized supremely. Religious doctrine and moral
teaching are widely judged by these criteria.
   ``Therefore to assert that there is a church teaching with
authority binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of
contradiction to many Americans who consider the divine right of
bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings,'' said May, of St.
Louis.
   In his speech, O'Connor said U.S. bishops had been fulfilling
their teaching role.
   ``I explained my personal conviction that for 200 years, the
bishops of the United States have demonstrated their commitment as
teachers. Too often they are dismissed simply as fund-raisers or
school-builders,'' he said in an interview Wednesday night. He said,
however, that it was not the Vatican but U.S. critics who made those
charges.
   A conflict appeared to develop between the Vatican and the U.S.
bishops over releasing texts of speeches from the closed sessions.
The Vatican released May's opening remarks but not the speeches by
O'Connor or Ratzinger.
   Vatican officials prevailed today, issuing summaries of the
speeches.

   An artist's haunting, surrealist paintings
went on view today as a tribute from his friends who won't let his
art die despite his tragic life and death.
   Colleagues liken John Wicklund's work to early efforts by
Salvador Dali and compare his tragic life and premature death to
Vincent Van Gogh's.
   They arranged for the monthlong exhibit of Wicklund's works at a
gallery here, about 40 miles north of Chicago.
   ``His art showed very lonely, always abandoned houses,'' his best
friend, Francis Smolinski, said Wednesday. ``To him they were
buildings that had a lot of love at one time. Now they were empty,
ready to be torn down.''
   Wicklund's art imitated his life up to the day he died sometime
between Dec. 20 and Dec. 30, Smolinski said.
   Although he had just been released from an alcohol detoxification
center, Wicklund was depressed and dejected when he stopped by
Smolinski's house in Gurnee on Dec. 20, the friend said. He suffered
from a lack of inspiration and grieved over his sister in
California, who was comatose and near death, Smolinski said.
   After Wicklund left, Smolinski became alarmed and spent 10 days
searching for his friend. Smolinski finally found Wicklund's frozen
body beneath a tree in a nearby stand of woods with vodka bottles
scattered around.
   Lynn Schornick, director of the Jack Benny Center for the Arts,
called the exhibit of Wicklund's watercolors and drawings haunting
and disturbing.
   ``I think there's no denying he had a real genius,'' Schornick
said. ``Almost none of (the works) have any people in them, and the
windows ... You can't see in them at all. There's simply no one
home.''
   Wicklund won a number of art contests and was an active member of
the Lake County Art League.
   ``He had this facade of humor ... and his work was just the
antithesis of that _ solemn, serious,'' said Ed Kanwischer, an art
professor who said Wicklund often sat in on his classes at the
College of Lake County.
   ``I knew he was doomed to die, you know, like Van Gogh,''
Kanwischer said.
   He said he and other league members organized the exhibit and
plan to auction off some works to raise money for a grave marker.
   ``We just felt his death shouldn't be the end,'' he said.

<HEAD>Three Injured After Propane in Water Causes Toilet Explosions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORDYCE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Propane gas accidentally injected into a
city water line caused three toilets to explode in separate
buildings, injuring three people, authorities said.
   ``I've never seen the like, or heard of anything like this,''
Fire Chief Roy Wayne Moseley said Wednesday. ``Things come and
things go, but when a man sees water burning, maybe it's time to
go.''
   He said an accidental hookup allowed the propane to enter the
water system from a pressurized railroad tank car at a company that
uses water to clean railroad cars. Flushing released bubbles of the
highly flammable gas.
   He said each explosion was set off by ``either a space heater or
a hot-water tank or some source of open flame near the toilet. There
was an ignition source nearby in each case.''
   Peronie Weathers said he was sleeping Tuesday afternoon when he
heard his 15-year-old daughter, Retha, scream.
   ``When she flushed it _ boom. I heard her calling, `Daddy come
here. Daddy come here. The house is on fire,''' Weathers said.
   Retha was treated at Dallas County Hospital and released.
   Weathers said he lost everything in the fire. ``When there is no
time to get your britches and shoes, that's bad,'' he said.
   Wendell Rex Wells, 48, said he heard a strange bubbling sound
coming from a toilet at the Benton Casket Manufacturing Co., where
he works, and touched the tank lid.
   ``Whomp, the commode burst into flames,'' he said. The blast
slammed the bathroom door and set fire to the room and his clothing.
He was hospitalized in Little Rock.
   Another young woman was in fair condition in a Little Rock
hospital after an explosion at her home.
   Moseley said the improper hookup was made at Transitank Corp.,
which cleans and refurbishes railroad cars and routinely works on
cars carrying propane.
   ``When they have propane in a car they have to bleed that off and
pull it through a tower and burn it off,'' he said. ``Then they
inject steam, water and air into the car to clean it. We have
determined through investigation that there was a crossover hookup,
we believe by accident, that actually brought propane from a
pressurized car into the water system.''

   Israeli troops shot and wounded seven
Palestinians today, and a Palestinian was electrocuted when soldiers
ordered him to remove a Palestinian flag from an electricity pole,
Arab reports said.
   The army denied its soldiers were involved in Wednesday night's
electrocution. It said it was checking the injury reports.
   It was the second straight day of a general strike called by
Arabs to mark the 15-month anniversary of the uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The head of Israel's military government in the West Bank, Brig.
Gen. Shaike Erez, met two hours with 25 prominent Palestinians in
Nablus and asked them how the uprising, known by the Arabic word
``intefadeh,'' could be ended.
   ``I told him this is the generation of the occupation who rose up
against Israel, and the intefadeh will never be ended until an
international peace conference is convened in which the PLO is a
partner on equal footing,'' Dr. Hatem Abu-Ghazaleh, a physician and
author who attended the meeting, told The Associated Press. Israel
refuses to negotiate with the PLO, saying it is a terrorist
organization.
   The meeting came after troops lifted a curfew that had been
imposed on the city of Nablus since Feb. 24, when an Israeli soldier
was killed by a cement block dropped on his head.
   Troops shot and wounded seven Palestinians, including a
15-year-old boy, in the West Bank, Arab hospital officials said.
Arab reports also said two Nablus men suffered serious head injuries
after being beaten by troops.
   On Wednesday night, 27-year-old Ibrahim Haled Hubal was
electrocuted in the West Bank village of Kharbat Al-Masbah, Arab
reports said. The reports said Hubal was killed after troops ordered
him to climb an electricity pole to remove a Palestinian flag.
Palestinian flags are outlawed in Israel.
   An army official said no troops were in the village at the time
and that Hubal may have climbed the pole to hang a flag.
   His death brought to 392 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising. Seventeen Israelis have died.
   The report of the electrocution came two days after the army
issued orders prohibiting soldiers from sending Arabs up electric
poles to retrieve Palestinian flags. Several Palestinians have been
electrocuted this way since the start of the uprising in December
1987.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Anti-Discrimination Law for Golf Clubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Court of Appeals has upheld a law
denying a golf course property tax break to the prestigious Burning
Tree Club unless it accepts women as members.
   The private club at Bethesda in Maryland's Washington suburbs has
historically numbered congressmen, cabinet officials and U.S.
Supreme Court justices among its members.
   The tax break, which applies to both state and county taxes,
allows clubs to pay a special rate by agreeing to maintain a golf
course as open space and not use it for commercial or residential
development.
   The 1986 law on accepting women was declared unconstitutional
July 22, 1987, by Anne Arundel Circuit Judge Martin A. Wolff,
because of a provision allowing clubs to exclude ``certain sexes on
specific days or at specific times.'' He said the entire law was
invalid because that one section violated the state's equal rights
amendment.
   The state's highest court on Wednesday agreed that the exemption
allowing discrimination on certain days or certain times was
unconstitutional, but said that didn't invalidate the entire law.
   As a result, clubs accepting the preferential tax treatment will
have to admit women and can't set aside times or days exclusively
for men or women.
   Burning Tree is the only Maryland club maintaining a men-only
membership policy that takes advantage of the property tax break.
   Court records showed that for the 1986-87 tax year, Burning Tree
saved about $300,000 in state and local taxes under the open space
tax exemption.
   Robert Zarnoch, an assistant state attorney general, said other
clubs in Maryland claim the preferred tax rate while setting aside
tee times for men or women.
   James Dunbar, a lawyer who represented Burning Tree before the
appeals court, said he had not had time to read and digest the 5-2
majority opinion and dissent and couldn't comment on whether there
will be a further appeal.

<TEXT>
   The commander of the 5th Brigade
has been relieved of his post as a result of an investigation into
the massacre of 10 peasants, military and government sources said
today.
   The sources, who declined to be identified pending announcement
of the probe's conclusions, said the removal is not final. But they
said it was unlikely Col. Jose Chavez Caceres would be reinstated as
commander of the 5th Brigade based in San Vicente, 40 miles east of
San Salvador.
   Chavez is not suspected of direct involvement in the slayings,
the sources said. His whereabouts were unknown.
   ``His responsibility appears to be limited to believing his
subordinates'' when they tried to cover up the army's role, said one
source.
   According to relatives, neighbors and witnesses, the massacre
took place on Sept. 21, when soldiers from the 5th Brigade's Jiboa
battalion marched into San Francisco, a hamlet of about 15 families
in San Vicente province.
   The soldiers detained most of the residents in a one-room school
and accused them of collaborating with leftist guerrillas.
   Working from a list, the troopers separated seven men and three
women and took them to a nearby ravine. They tied them up with
strips of green fabric and killed them with explosives _ either
grenades or captured guerrilla mines _ and rifle fire, according to
the witnesses.
   The army at first said the 10 corpses discovered in the ravine
were guerrillas killed in an army ambush. Then it said they were
detainees who, while being marched away from San Francisco, were
killed in a guerrilla ambush.
   Three officers who were in San Francisco the day of the killings
have been detained and at least one will be indicted on murder
charges this month by San Sebastian Judge Alcides Guandique,
according to sources close to the case.
   If such an indictment takes place, it would be the first time an
army officer has ever been indicted for politically motivated
killing of non-combatants in El Salvador's 9-year-old civil war.

   Former Education Secretary William Bennett's
nomination to head the war against drugs sailed through the Senate
Judiciary Committee today and lawmakers planned to take it right to
the floor for confirmation.
   ``I have no doubt he'll grab the job and run with it and really
do a very good job,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said as the panel
voted 13-1 for Bennett.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., an ally of teacher groups, was the lone
dissenter, saying Bennett had sought a cut in the drug education
budget in his previous post and that his record as an administrator
at the department ``was not strong.''
   ``My fear is that we're going to have a lot of visibility and not
much action. I hope I'm wrong,'' Simon said.
   Lawmakers were shooting for a late-afternoon Senate floor vote on
Bennett, although they said scheduling problems could sidetrack it.
   Even before his confirmation, Bennett's responsibilities were
increasing, with President Bush handing him the politically volatile
issue of whether to ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons.
   Bennett met Wednesday with National Rifle Association
representatives to seek ``input and advice,'' said Bennett spokesman
Don Hamilton. ``I'm rather confident he has not made up his mind.''
   Bennett, whose designated job often has been referred to as
``drug czar,'' can now add the title ``gun czar,'' joked Hamilton.
   ``He's not too upset about it, really,'' he said.
   But although he hasn't made up his mind whether assault weapons
should be banned, Bennett's eventual stance is certain to prompt
some disagreement in the White House. Bush, a member of the National
Rifle Association, has said he opposes a ban, while first lady
Barbara Bush supports one.
   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of five
California schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on the
assault-style weapons.
   Bennett is ``concerned with the problem and he'd like to seek a
solution that's consonant with the Constitution and individuals'
rights concerning firearms. But he doesn't want to see that
firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys,''
Hamilton said.
   The issue came up at Bennett's confirmation hearings last week
when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy asked him about a memo he wrote last
year when he was education secretary.
   In the March 14, 1988, memo to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, Bennett asked Meese to consider supporting legislation ``to
better manage the production, importation and sale of automatic
weapons and other firearms, as sought by the major law enforcement
organizations.''
   Bennett hesitated when asked during the hearings whether he now
supports legislation limiting access to weapons such as modified
AK-47s and Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can be
switched easily back and forth from semi-automatic to automatic.
   He told the committee his decision on that issue would be part of
the national drug control strategy, due 180 days after he takes
office.
   ``I will admit a personal reservation about private ownership of
AK-47s,'' Bennett told the committee. ``I'm not a gun owner. ... The
president knows I have my concerns.''
   Asked by committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del, whether
he believes there's a correlation between easy access to weapons and
the violence of drug dealing, Bennett said, ``I don't think there's
any doubt about it.''
   However, he added, ``You still have to take the people's right to
bear arms seriously.''
   He left open the possibility that he may ultimately disagree with
Bush's opposition to a ban.
   ``The fact that it's been spoken about by the president does not
mean it's off the table,'' Bennett said at the hearings.
   Bush said at a news conference Tuesday that he discussed the
testimony with Bennett afterward.
   ``I told Bill, I said, `Look, I don't worry about what you said
up there,''' Bush said. ``I said, `I can identify with what was
behind your thinking on that very, very easily. I'd like to find
some accommodation.'''
   Bush said that if Bennett comes up with a ``sensible'' proposal,
``I'll take a hard look at it.''

<HEAD>Client Goes Free, `Lawyer' Is Jailed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The client got off with a suspended
sentence, but the fellow who said he was the attorney was booked and
jailed.
   Fancy legal talk may have contributed to Clifford John's arrest
Wednesday in Jefferson County Court after he claimed to be a lawyer.
   ``Although not all attorneys are terribly articulate, this one
was worse than the average,'' said Judge Robert Morris. ``He used
big words that had no meaning within the sentences they were used
... Even our worst attorneys don't do that.''
   Authorities say they still aren't sure just what legal
credentials John has, but they said they do know he's not a licensed
attorney in Colorado.
   John, 37, appeared in court with his client Feb. 24 but asked for
a continuance. Morris then checked state records and found that
John's attorney number actually belonged to a woman who is an
assistant Colorado attorney general.
   When John came to the sentencing, ``He started talking, and he
still didn't sound very much like an attorney,'' Morris said.
   John's client, who faced a drunken driving charge, was ordered to
pay $320 in court costs and was given a suspended $500 fine and a
suspended 180-day jail sentence.
   The 20-year-old defendant, Monte Castaneda, received the minimum
sentence, which Morris said was not affected by John. Castaneda did
not pay attorney's fees, said Mark Pautler, chief deputy district
attorney.
   John, formerly a salesman for The Denver department stores,
apparently had an office in Denver. ``It does appear from looking at
his appointment books that he has additional clients,'' Pautler said.
   John, booked in Jefferson County Jail on $5,000 bond, was
scheduled to make his next court appearance today, facing possible
charges of criminal impersonation and forgery.

<TEXT>
   Two British soldiers were killed
and six wounded near Londonderry when their jeeps were blown apart
by a land mine that shattered windows half a mile away, police said
today.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
shortly before midnight Wednesday, but suspicion fell on the Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Police said today they had arrested two men but did not identify
them.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the British Cabinet member
responsible for law and order, said Wednesday an IRA unit was at
large on the British mainland.
   His announcement followed the discovery of an arms and explosives
cache near Scarborough, in northeast England, where Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will address a conference of the national council
of her governing Conservative Party next week. The discovery of the
weapons prompted news media speculation that the IRA might be
planning a second bid to kill her.
   Sgt. John Brown, a spokesman at police headquarters in Belfast,
said the attack on the soldiers occurred just outside Londonderry,
Northern Ireland's second largest city, two miles from the border
with the Republic of Ireland.
   He said an army patrol in two armored jeeps was traveling north
on a main road leading from Londonderry when the land mine buried in
an embankment beside the road was detonated. The second of the two
jeeps caught the full blast.
   Police estimated 400 pounds of explosive were used.
   The blast blew in windows up to half a mile away and was
reportedly heard up to 30 miles away.
   The army identified the dead soldiers Thursday as Miles Daniel
Amos, 18, and Stephen Geoffrey Cummins, 24.
   The command wire was found leading to a nearby industrial estate
from where the bomber would have had a clear view of the road, Brown
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher survived an IRA bomb attack on Oct. 12, 1984 in
which five people died during the Conservatives' annual convention
at the south coast resort of Brighton. The blast partly demolished
the hotel where she, many of her Cabinet and many other prominent
Conservatives were staying.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland
under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Sandinista Newspaper Claims U.S. Re-arming Contras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Sandinista newspaper
claimed today that U.S. helicopters and pilots are ferrying weapons
to the Nicaraguan rebel forces in Honduras.
   Barricada, mouthpiece of the leftist government party, based its
report on unidentified sources ``in national political circles'' in
Honduras.
   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the Contras, as the
guerrillas are known, in February 1988 but continued humanitarian
aid, which runs out at the end of this month.
   President Bush has said he will ask Congress to extend the
non-lethal assistance to the Contras, about 11,000 of which are
living in jungle camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border with
thousands of relatives.
   ``U.S. helicopters and pilots taking part in the `Ahuas Tara 89'
joint military maneuvers in Honduran territory are supplying arms
and ammunition to the Contra forces,'' Barricada said in a
front-page article.
   It said weapons shipments leave from the Tocontin, Palmerola and
Isla del Cisne (Swan Island) air force bases to Contra camps in
Yamales and Mokoron.
   According to Barricada, the operations involving five U.S.
helicopters started in mid-February. It said the helicopters are
UH-1H and Bell-212 models.
   Barricada said shipments have been made also using DC-6 cargo
planes from private company whose stockholders, the paper said, are
Honduran military officers.
   The Honduran-U.S. maneuvers began in late January and are
scheduled through July and involve about 3,000 U.S. and Honduran
military personnel. They are largely command and construction
exercises.

<TEXT>
   A water main break cut off water to millions
of people in northern New Jersey this morning, forcing officials to
close schools and seek help from the National Guard.
   The break in the 52-inch main occurred at 5 a.m. between the two
main plants of the Hackensack Water Co., according to company
spokeswoman Martha Green. Water began flowing again to most of the
company's customers about 9:30 a.m., but it was at very low pressure
and residents were being urged to boil drinking water.
   Ken Madden, of the Bergen County emergency management office,
said National Guard tankers were brought to the armory in Teaneck,
where water would be distributed to those who need it.
   The company supplies water to 750,000 customers, or several
million people, in most of Bergen County and in the northern part of
Hudson County, officials said.
   The flow of water from the huge main, which washed out part of
New Milford Avenue here, was shut off by about 7:25 a.m., officials
said. Most of the water flowed back into the nearby Hackensack River
and did not threaten homes.
   Bob Weiner, a water company spokesman, said work crews isolated
the damaged pipe by about 9 a.m., closing valves near it and routing
water through other pipes. About a half-hour later, the water began
flowing, but it would take several hours to build enough pressure to
return service to normal, he said.
   In the meantime, he recommended that residents boil tap water for
at least a few minutes before using it, since some contaminants may
have gotten into the pipelines during the break.
   While most customers were beginning to get low-pressure water,
Weiner said, an unknown number still had service cut off entirely.
   Gov. Thomas Kean toured the site of the break this morning.
   Bergen County Superintendent of Schools Ray Kelly canceled
classes at all county public schools except for three districts not
served by Hackensack Water Co.

   Army Maj. Gen. James H. Rumbaugh, commander of
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, died of injuries
suffered during a parachute accident in Honduras, the Pentagon said
today.
   Rumbaugh died while being flown to the Brooke Army Medical Center
in San Antonio, Texas, said Defense Department spokesman Maj. John
Smith.
   Rumbaugh, 49, was participating in the annual Ahuas Tara 89
exercise with a forward surgical deployment team.
   According to Pentagon sources, who insisted on anonymity,
Rumbaugh suffered abdominal injuries during a jump Tuesday. They
said Rumbaugh did not seek medical attention until Wednesday morning
and died that evening.
   Army and Pentagon officials declined to say why a two-star
general was participating in a jump and how extensive Rumbaugh's
parachute experience was.
   Rumbaugh took command of Walter Reed last August. A native of
Washington, Pa., Rumbaugh earned his medical degree from the Thomas
Jefferson University School of Medicine in Philadelphia.
   He joined the Army in 1963 while completing his studies and then
served his internship and a residency in psychiatry at Walter Reed.
   Rumbaugh earned his first star as a brigadier general in
September 1986 and his second last October. His decorations included
the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal
with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army Commendation Medal and the Expert
Field Medical Badge.

   Edward Powers, the FBI agent who helped
solve the $2.2 million Brinks armored car robbery in 1950 and was
picked to manage the first modern U.S. lottery, died Tuesday in Fort
Myers, Fla., at age 75.
   Powers, as FBI agent in charge of the Boston office, spent six
years trying to solve the Brinks case. The break came when one of
the holdup men informed on the others because he felt he didn't get
his fair share of the loot.
   In 1963, he was hired to manage the New Hampshire lottery because
its sponsors wanted to prove it could be run without organized crime
influence. He retired in 1978 and moved to Florida.
   A 400-page reference manual, ``Handbook of U.S. Lottery

<HEAD>Canada Supreme Court Won't Rule on Fetus Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to decide the issue
of whether a fetus has constitutional rights, saying it will not
deal with the question while the country has no abortion law.
   The court, in a 7-0 ruling, said deciding the issue ``is not in
the public interest due to the potential uncertainty'' that could
result in the absence of abortion legislation.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since January 1988, when
the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional Canada's
restrictions on abortion. The lack of a new law has brought
abortion-on-demand to many cities and led to angry protests by
anti-abortion groups.
   Today's ruling was the result of a case brought last year by
anti-abortion activist Joe Borowski.
   Borowski, in Winnipeg with a bottle of chilled champagne ready to
celebrate, said instead he'd dump it down the toilet or spike it and
send it to the judges. ``I'm shocked and disgusted and dismayed,''
he said.
   In its eight-page ruling, the court said the government should
have moved last year to quash the case.
   ``Failure to do so has resulted in needless expense'' for
Borowski, it said, and it ordered the government to pay his costs.
   Karen Murawsky, a lobbyist for the anti-abortionist Campaign Life
coalition, agreed the court hasn't protected the fetus, but she said
it hasn't ruled the fetus doesn't deserve protection, either. She
hopes for a new law.
   ``The federal government doesn't need the guidance of the Supreme
Court to bring in a good law,'' Ms. Murawsky said.
   Norma Scaraborough of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League
told reporters she's pleased with the decision and hopes the
government ``will see we can carry on the way we are and we can
leave the situation the way it is.''

<HEAD>Golden Arches Planned a Few Blocks From Kremlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people from the United States, Canada and
West Germany will help Soviets serve Big Macs and french fries to
Muscovites when the golden arches go up a few blocks from Red Square
next year, Pravda said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper, which usually fills its
columns with the latest official political announcements, printed a
quarter-page article headlined, ``Will the Big Mac Debut Soon?''
Alongside was a drawing of the trademark golden arches above the
words, ``Moskva McDonald's.''
   ``We very much want to open the first restaurant at year's end or
at the latest in the first quarter of next year,'' said Vladimir I.
Malishkov, chief of the food service administration of the Moscow
City Council.
   First, the company must finish building its own factory in Moscow
to make ingredients, said George A. Cohon, president of McDonald's
Restaurants of Canada Ltd.
   Foreigners will be flipping burgers and serving shakes alongside
Soviet workers when the 650-seat restaurant opens on Gorky Street,
near Red Square, Cohon told Pravda. Twenty restaurants are planned
in the country.
   The article made it clear that Muscovites deserve a break from
substandard food service, but indicated a McDonald's fast food
restaurant is still ``a dream.''
   Soviets often must settle for tasteless food in dingy cafeterias
or from outdoor vendors in less-than-sanitary conditions.
   The article temptingly described the ease, yet unknown to
Soviets, of being able ``to give an order, and within moments walk
away from the counter with appetizing food packaged in pretty
plastic containers.''
   ``The hamburgers are not only tasty, they melt in your mouth,''
Pravda said.
   The inside of the restaurant ``is a kingdom of cleanliness and
coziness. And they do it all for you,'' Pravda said, mimicking one
of McDonald's advertising slogans.
   But Pravda reminded Soviets they have been promised better food
service many times.
   ``Alas, the miracle hasn't happened. Will it happen this time?''
Pravda asked.
   In April, Cohon and Malishkov signed the joint venture agreement
to open McDonald's restaurants in the Soviet Union. The agreement
gave McDonald's of Canada a 49 percent share in the
Soviet-controlled firm.
   At the time, officials said Soviets would be able to buy a Big
Mac for about $3.

<HEAD>Big Engines, Luxury Cars Trendy Items at Geneva Motor Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extravagant, sporty cars with powerful engines and
fancy technical frills are headline items at the 1989 Geneva Motor
Show, reflecting the auto industry's buoyant confidence.
   Organizers of the annual show, which opened Thursday and runs
until March 19, cite the worldwide comeback of the top-priced sports
car and renewed competition in the compact model range as this
year's major themes.
   Billed as the European show most representative of the global
industry, Geneva is considered a prime testing ground for automakers
because of Switzerland's liberal import policy and lack of a
domestic industry, which make it a highly competitive market.
   Opel, Volkswagen and Toyota were the top-selling makes in
Switzerland last year, followed by Ford Europe, Fiat and France's
Peugeot.
   The industry's optimism is evident after low oil prices and a
continuing economic boom in Western countries spurred world car
production to its fourth straight record high last year.
   The show appears aimed at Western Europe, where environmental
worries had an impact on the car industry through the mid-1980s.
   But that concern seems to be waning. The European Community has
launched a drive to cut harmful exhaust emissions, and use of
pollution-reducing catalytic converters, though hardly universal, is
rising.
   At Geneva, Mercedes unveiled its revived SL roadster series,
aimed at recapturing affluent buyers from its West German rival BMW,
whose 7-series is considered the leader in the upscale market.
   BMW's display featured the M5, a model introduced last fall with
a 315-horsepower six-cylinder engine.
   Not to be outdone, General Motors Corp. offered an updated
Corvette sports model with a 32-valve V-8. The Corvette ZR1, is
expected to cost about $50,000. GM officials have not said when the
ZR1 will go on sale in the United States or Europe.
   Porsche, the West German maker of prestige sports cars,
highlighted a new automatic tire pressure monitoring system in its
top-of-the-line 928-S4 model, which lists for $74,900.
   Volvo of Sweden offered a heated steering wheel for its
higher-priced cars.
   Recognizing the continuing vast market potential for affordable
compact cars especially in Europe, Ford Motor Co.'s West German
division premiered a complete revamp of its successful Fiesta
hatchback, of which more than 4.5 million have been built since 1976.
   Main innovations include four-door models, more passenger space
and an updated body. Prices have remained stable, ranging from about
$8,200 for the basic models to $12,500 for a sporty three-door.
   Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz said in opening the 59th
show that the event was a ``convincing denial'' of a clash between
economic and environmental goals.

   Thirty-five Vietnamese refugees
were rescued by a Japanese tanker after their boat sank during bad
weather in the South China Sea off Malaysia, authorities said
Thursday.
   The incident occurred on Wednesday, the second day of a three-day
meeting on Indochinese refugees.
   The group of 30 men, two women and three children were picked up
by the tanker Nessei Maru, said Capt. Jaffar Lamri, head of the
Maritime Rescue Coordination Center.
   He told the National News Agency Bernama the incident occurred
when the apparently overloaded boat broke when it was hit by strong
waves and capsized about 220 miles off Malaysia's Trengganu coast.
   The boat was said to be heading for Malaysia after leaving
Vietnam, Jaffar said.
   The rescue center was put on standby after being alerted by a
ship in the area that a boat had sunk and several people were
floating in the sea, he said. The center contacted all ships in the
area and received a message from the 238,517-ton Nissei Maru saying
it had rescued the passengers.
   The Vietnamese refugees were taken to Singapore for treatment,
Jaffar said.

<TEXT>
   A major underground nuclear weapons test
rocked the Nevada desert at dawn today, unleashing a shock felt atop
some Las Vegas hotel-casinos 85 miles away, authorities said.
   The test carried a force of 20 to 150 kilotons, the highest
allowed under test limitation treaties, and created a shock that
registered 5.1 on the Richter scale of ground motion. All U.S. tests
are listed as either less than 20 kilotons or as 20 to 150 kilotons.
   Thirteen protesters demonstrated at the main entrance to the
desert site and 11 were arrested for trespassing.
   The test, conducted at 6:05 a.m., was 55 minutes earlier than
originally scheduled to take advantage of more favorable wind
conditions, according to Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer.
   The test, code-named Ingot, was the third conducted at the Nevada
Test Site this year. The nuclear device was buried in a shaft 1,600
feet beneath the surface of Yucca Flat.
   Boyer, speaking from a control point 15 miles from ground zero,
reported ``considerable ground motion'' at the time of detonation.
   ``The seismograph needle is swinging wildly from side to side,''
Boyer said. ``Video cameras on the ground are getting quite a jolt.''
   ``The situation appears normal,'' Boyer said, watching monitors
at the control building. ``It doesn't look like there were any
problems whatsoever.''
   Boyer said test controllers reported a subsidence at ground zero
44 minutes after the blast. A subsidence, or ground collapse, is a
favorable sign because it indicates the test cavity has been sealed,
preventing any leak of radioactive gases.
   Motion from the blast was recorded by monitors atop some
high-rise hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, but telephone operators at the
resorts reported receiving no calls from guests inquiring about the
blast.
   Waverly Person, a spokesman at the National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the 5.1 Richter scale
reading was not as high as some previous tests. The Richter scale is
a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake. A quake magnitude
of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated area.
   The test was the 690th announced shot since testing began in
Nevada in January 1951. Twelve tests were conducted in 1988. It was
conducted under the sponsorship of Lawrence-Livermore Laboratories.

   Two men pleaded guilty today to trying to
bribe former Navy officials, in one case buying an official's
condominium in Idaho for an inflated price in an attempt to
influence decisions on lucrative Pentagon contracts.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the pleas from Charles F.
Gardner, a former vice president of Unisys Corp., and James G. Neal,
a private consultant for Unisys, ``will move this investigation
forward ... at a tremendous pace.''
   He called the pleas, as well as one from Kenneth F. Brooke, a
``significant development'' in the 2{-year-old investigation into
fraud in the Defense Department's purchasing procedures. The case
has focused on allegations that companies tried to manipulate the
system by using consultants to pay bribes for inside information
about contracts.
   Gardner, 58, who worked until March 1988 for a Unisys division in
Great Neck, N.Y., appeared before U.S. District Judge Claude Hylton
in a packed courtroom.
   ``Guilty. Guilty. Guilty,'' he said in a strong voice when asked
how he pleaded to charges of bribery, conspiracy to file false
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax
return.
   Gardner is a key figure whose cooperation could be significant in
helping prosecutors make major cases in the long-running
investigation. Today's charges link him directly to Melvyn Paisley,
the former assistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering
and systems, and, to date, the highest-ranking official publicly
identified in the case.
   Gardner also has ties to a group of firms and individuals on Long
Island whose offices have been searched by the FBI. The government
has said it is looking into possible extortion of campaign
contributions to congressmen in the Long Island segment of the
investigation.
   Documents provided by prosecutors said Gardner sought to bribe
Paisley by arranging for the purchase of Paisley's condominiium at
the Sun Valley, Idaho, ski resort in August 1986.
   ``Gardner instructed James G. Neal that the condominium was to be
purchased for $149,000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lower
the price were to be undertaken, even though the unit was
overprice,'' Hudson said in a statement. ``The condominium was
subsequently sold for $100,000.''
   Hudson said the condominium purchase at an inflated price was
designed to influence Paisley's actions on two Pentagon contracts
sought by Unisys. The prosecutor refused to say what Paisley did on
Unisys' behalf. Paisley has not been charged with any crime.
   In another case, Gardner caused the campaign committees of Rep.
Roy Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., to receive
illegal campaign contributions of $1,000 each, Hudson said.
   ``In addition, Gardner caused Unisys to make and present a false
claim to the departments of Navy and Air Force for services not
performed,'' he said.
   Gardner, who with the others agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
in the ongoing investigation, faces up to 23 years in prison and
fines of up to $750,000.
   Neal, 63, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe Garland Tomlin
Jr., who at the time was a Navy employee. Neal paid Tomlin about
$400,000 to influence Tomlin official decisions, prosecutors said.
Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.
   Neal also pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government
and conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true
taxable income. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of
$750,000.
   Brooke, 40, a stepson of William Galvin, a consultant whose name
has been linked to Paisley's, evaded his taxes in 1985, prosecutors
said. He faces a sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up
to $250,000.
   Hylton set sentencing for July 14.

   The Alcoholic Beverage Commission ordered
the state's nearly 200 bingo operators to cease operations today
because of a Tennessee Supreme Court ruling that the game is an
unconstitutional lottery.
   The ABC voted unanimously to inform license holders of the
suspension and of a March 30 hearing on the issue.
   The action was based on a memorandum from Attorney General
Charles Burson, who advised the agency to suspend the licenses ``and
thereby immediately terminate bingo operations in this state.''
   Commissioner Carl Jones said he sympathized with charities and
elderly bingo players who would miss the game.
   ``I've seen them come in and cry,'' he said.
   Commissioner Dale Woodall said he did not think there was any
chance that bingo licenses could be issued again unless a
Constitutional Convention were held to remove the lottery
prohibition.

   A man accused of trying to obtain
secrets from a U.S. Navy base was sentenced today to nine years in
prison for spying for the Soviet Union.
   Stephen Ratkai, 26, had pleaded guilty in Newfoundland Supreme
Court to one count of espionage and another count of attempted
espionage. He faced a maximum prison sentence of 14 years on each
count. Ratkai was sentenced to nine years on each count, to be
served concurrently.
   ``Your conduct and the paraphernalia with which you worked showed
that you were more than just a courier,'' said Judge Fintan Aylward.
``You were a well-trained and intelligent individual. You knew what
to do and how to do it.''
   ``I cannot say what harm was done to national security, but the
potential was substantial, and you were well aware of it,'' the
judge said.
   Ratkai, a Canadian citizen who grew up in Nova Scotia and
Hungary, was arrested in St. John's during a sting operation set up
by Canadian and U.S. intelligence officers in June.
   Prosecutors say that over 13 months, beginning in May 1987,
Ratkai made three trips aimed at obtaining secret documents from the
U.S. Navy base in Argentia, in eastern Newfoundland.
   During the sting operation, Ratkai met with a U.S. undercover
agent, Lt. Donna Geiger. Canadian and U.S. officials videotaped one
of the meetings, during which Ratkai gave Ms. Geiger money and
pressed her for more information about the U.S. base.
   When Ratkai was arrested, he was carrying more than $4,700 and a
portable kit for developing film.

   The debate over preserving the ozone layer
dramatizes the gap between the industrialized West, which pledges to
clean up pollutants it no longer needs, and developing nations that
are just beginning to use them.
   Prodded by increasing scientific evidence that
chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, are destroying the ozone shield,
the West has promised to ban or significantly reduce their use by
the end of the century.
   Third World countries do not dispute the facts and figures, but
are just embarking on large-scale expansion of refrigeration, air
conditioning, plastics and electronics industries, most of which
depend on CFCs.
   ``This raises a major moral problem in the West,'' Australia's
science minister acknowledged at an international conference in
London this week on the ozone layer, which filters out
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the sun.
   ``Can we ask the developed world to adopt lower standards of
convenience and amenity than we do?'' asked the minister, Barry
Jones.
   The dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide DDT.
The West discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals and
imposed bans or restrictions in 1970-71 against the wishes of
developing nations, which feared a resurgence of disease-carrying
insects.
   Another environmental issue dividing the West from the Third
world is the dumping of toxic waste.
   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya told the London conference
that recent dumpings in Africa of toxic chemicals from industrial
countries were ``unfriendly actions ... equivalent to declaring war
on the Earth's ecosystem.''
   On the ozone issue, developing countries demand Western help in
financing any switch from CFCs to safe substitutes.
   The chemicals, developed in the United States more than 50 years
ago as the working fluid for refrigerators, also are used in
aerosols, fast-food packaging and computer solvents. About 1.2
million tons are produced annually, more than 76 percent in the
United States and European Economic Community.
   When CFCs reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up, as much as 100
years after emission, they break apart and their chlorine atoms
deplete the fragile ozone layer. CFCs also trap heat, increasing
Earth's temperature in a process known as the greenhouse effect.
   ``The adverse effects are going to be more serious for developing
countries due to their geographical situation and limited ability to
fund defensive strategies,'' said physicist Mohammed Ilyas of the
University of Science of Malaysia.
   In 1977, the United States announced it was phasing out the use
of CFCs in aerosols. Canada, Norway and Sweden followed suit.
   Washington now says it will ban all CFCs by 1999 if safe
substitutes become available. The 12-nation EEC has agreed to a
similar timetable but its environment commissioner, Carlo Ripa di
Meana, wants an earlier target.
   Australia plans a phaseout by 1998 and Japan says it will agree
to a ban if other countries do. The Soviet Union says it needs more
scientific evidence of the damage.
   Thirty-one countries have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol
requiring the amount of CFCs to be cut in half by 1999. Their
representatives will meet in Helsinki, Finland, in May for the first
full review of the treaty.
   Another 20 countries have agreed to sign up, but China, India and
Brazil, with rapidly growing populations, are not among them. They
have urged Western nations to create a fund to help them acquire
technology to replace CFCs, but insist the money not be deducted
from existing aid.
   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons would
mean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for
the promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' said Z.R. Ansari,
India's environment minister. ``The poor are no more prepared to
wait and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait any
longer.''
   China's environment commissioner, Liu Ming Pu, told the
conference his nation of 1.1 billion people uses less than 2 percent
of the world's CFCs.
   Western nations say the potential for CFC use in the developing
world is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made by industrial
countries.
   Even if all CFCs were banned immediately, scientists estimate two
centuries would be needed to repair the damage.
   The West wants developing countries to bypass CFCs and move
directly to safe substitutes, which still being developed and may be
more expensive.
   Considerable sympathy was evident at the conference for the Third
World argument, which Britain's Prince Charles called ``a powerful
one.''
   Jones, the Australian minister, said if his country was entitled
to a refrigerator in each of its 4 million households ``then it
ought to be appropriate for 250 to 300 million Chinese households.''

   The government today denied reports that a Japanese
manufacturer in line to make a new version of the F-16 fighter jet
was involved in construction of what Washington says is a Libyan
chemical weapons plant.
   ``I have said in this forum again and again that we have made a
thorough study on this problem. ... We found that there was no
evidence that Japanese companies have been involved in this
project,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   ``I can now confirm that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has never
been engaged in the export of equipment or dispatch of engineers as
reported in The Detroit News,'' Watanabe added.
   The Detroit News on Wednesday quoted unidentified U.S.
congressional and Defense Department sources as saying they had been
told of Mitsubishi's alleged participation in the Libyan project by
intelligence sources in Washington. Kyodo News Service carried a
similar report today.
   Mitsubishi, in a news conference today, also denied the reports.
   In Washington, Marlin Fitzwater, a spokesman for President Bush,
said: ``We continue to investigate this matter.''
   At the same time, he said, ``The Japanese government has given us
assurances that there is no intention of any Japanese involvement
with the Libyan project and has denied emphatically any involvement
by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' technicians or engineers in the
Libyan chemical project.''
   The reports said intelligence sources had told a closed-door
session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that 50 Japanese
technicians and engineers were at a chemical complex in the desert
south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli to install metal-machining
equipment used to make bomb canisters for poison gas.
   Libya denies the plant is for making chemical weapons, saying
that it is a pharmaceuticals factory.
   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
department had no evidence Mitsubishi had helped to install
equipment at the plant.
   Watanabe said Japan had conveyed its findings to Washington
through regular communications channels.
   ``From the statement made by Mr. Redman, I take it they have
accepted our information,'' he said.
   He then read a statement that said:
   ``Through the exchange of information between the U.S. government
and Japan, the following views are fully shared by the two
governments:
   ``According to the investigation of the government of Japan so
far, there is no information indicating that Japanese firms were
involved in Libya's production of chemical weapons agents and its
facilities.''
   The Kyodo report said the allegations against Mitsubishi were
``expected to spur congressional moves to persuade the U.S.
government to scrap a plan for General Dynamics to provide
(Mitsubishi) with high technology'' to build Japan's new fighter
jet, called the FSX, a version of the U.S. F-16.
   Mitsubishi is involved in a proposed joint venture with the
United States to build the plane. The venture was negotiated during
the Reagan administration and is now under review by the Bush
administration.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater on Wednesday
declined to comment directly on the reports about Mitsubishi and
said President Bush had not yet made a final decision on the FSX
project.

   A woman whose son was given detention for
missing high school believed it wasn't his fault _ so she served the
punishment for him.
   Vickey Esquivel said she turned off her three boys' alarm clocks
after she heard from a friend that school had been canceled because
of a winter storm Jan. 30.
   It wasn't.
   The Esquivels realized that school was in session after the
snowstorm stopped and one of the boys ran into two of his teachers
at a store in this farming community 60 miles from Kansas City. The
teachers were getting lunch.
   That story was good enough to get the youngest and middle son off
the hook, but the Pomona High School principal wanted Sam, 16, to
serve a detention.
   Instead, Ms. Esquivel spent an hour and 45 minutes vacuuming and
cleaning at school March 3 and again Tuesday.
   The idea of having Ms. Esquivel serve the sentence came from
Superintendent James Cain, who said he ``made the comment more in
jest than in meaning.''
   After taking him up on the idea, Ms. Esquivel said she is
satisfied. So is Sam, though he wonders why his mother stopped at
serving detention.
   ``She could have done my homework,'' he said.

   The state's tourism slogan, ``Wander
Indiana,'' may get the boot after seven years on T-shirts, tote
bags, coffee mugs and license plates.
   It just isn't working, market research shows, so the state
Department of Commerce is considering dropping it.
   People in Chicago and Cincinnati were asked recently what they
thought about the ``Wander Indiana'' television and print ads.
   ``They didn't know what it meant,'' Denise L. Miller, the state's
new tourism director, said Wednesday. ``It was aimless, not really
exciting. It made us sound hick.''
   A similar survey of Indianapolis residents reinforced the
findings. ``They were even nastier about `Wander Indiana,''' said
Miller.
   Miller said the state's tourism contract with an advertising
agency is up for review in June. The stakes are high. The state
estimates tourism pumps $6.2 billion into Indiana's economy each
year.
   To attract even more revenue, Miller has asked the Legislature to
boost tourism appropriations to $4 million by 1991, from the present
$2.1 million.
   Miller said that is much less than what the state's neighbors
spend when they invite Hoosiers to ``Say Yes to Michigan,'' ``Escape
to Wisconsin,'' travel to ``Ohio, the heart of it all,'' or let
Illinois ``put you in a happy state.''

<HEAD>North Lawyer: Trying To Undermine Credibility of Jail Conversation</HEAD>

jury on witness' credibility</HEAD>

   Oliver North's lawyer today attacked the
credibility of a fund-raiser for the Contras, saying he gave
inconsistent accounts of a conversation in which North allegedly
said he didn't care whether he went to jail or lied to Congress.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan said Carl ``Spitz'' Channell never
even mentioned North's alleged comments in interviews with
government investigators on Jan. 9, 1987, and March 12, 1987.
   Channell first mentioned the alleged North remarks to Texas
billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt on April 25, 1987, three days before
Channell entered a plea agreement with the government under which he
is cooperating with the prosecution in exchange for admitting to a
single felony charge.
   ``You told prosecutors that ... North was willing to lie if his
activities became public,'' but there was no mention of Congress,
Sullivan told Channell in relating his April 25, 1987, interview
with prosecutors.
   But in the prosecution's redirect examination, lawyer Michael
Bromwich brought out that Channell never had been asked about the
``jail'' and ``lying'' conversations in those interviews. Bromwich
also showed through questioning that some of the earlier statements
presented to Channell were summaries, not stenographic transcripts.
   ``Were you ever told in words or substance, `Give us Ollie
North,'?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``No,'' said Channell.
   ``Were you ever told your sentence depended on whether North
would be convicted or acquitted?'' Bromwich asked.
   ``No, I've been told just the opposite...,'' said Channell.
   Channell said also that he never had control over the millions he
raised but that North and Rich Miller did. In congressional
testimony it was brought out that Miller's firm helped funnel money
raised by Channell to secret Swiss bank accounts controlled by North
and others.
   Channell testified four times in June 1987, but said that it was
Hunt who asked North two questions and North simply answered yes to
each.
   On Wednesday, Channell testified that on Sept. 11, 1985, after
dinner at the Petroleum Club in Dallas, Hunt asked North if he was
worried about ``getting in trouble'' for his activities on behalf of
the Contras.
   ``I don't care if I have to go to jail for this, I don't care if
I have to lie to Congress about this,'' North said, to which Hunt
``just chortled,'' Channell related.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell interrupted Sullivan's
cross-examination to observe that Channell on the witness stand had
given ``three versions already'' of the Hunt-North conversation.
   Sullivan went on to say that in September 1987 testimony,
Channell said ``absolutely nothing'' about North's supposed remarks
on jail and lying to Congress.
   ``You didn't put them in Hunt's mouth and you didn't put them in
North's mouth,'' Sullivan told Channell. The judge then told the
jurors that ``each and every inconsistent statement you may consider
... in your appraisal of the credibility of this witness.''
   On Wednesday, Channell testified that President Reagan made a
dramatic appearance at a White House meeting to thank 25 wealthy
contributors who gave money to support the Contras.
   Channell pleaded guilty in 1987 to conspiring to defraud the
Treasury by using a tax-exempt foundation for a non-exempt purpose _
raising money for Contra military activities. One of the counts
against North, who helped direct the Reagan administration's secret
Contra assistance efforts, is that he participated in the tax
conspiracy.
   North also is accused of lying to Congress and the attorney
general about the activities, which occurred during a period in
which Congress had banned U.S. aid to the rebels.
   More than $10 million was raised for the Contras from private
donors through Channell's tax-exempt National Endowment for the
Preservation of Liberty.
   Channell said that during the White House meeting with Reagan,
one donor, C. Thomas Clagett, pointed to pictures of former
Presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and said, ``Mr.
President, why don't you act like those people and do something?''
   ``Tom,'' Reagan replied, ``I am doing the best I can. It's very
tough,'' Channell recalled.
   One contributor from a prominent Austin, Texas, family, Ellen
Garwood, gave ``around $2.5 million or maybe a little more,'' said
Channell.
   Ms. Garwood made the contributions after ``Col. North began to
talk'' to her and other donors ``about the terminal crisis'' of the
Contras, said Channell.
   The White House aide told Ms. Garwood that the Contras ``were
about finished and unless money was raised we were going to lose the
whole five-year effort of supporting democracy in Central America,''
Channell said.
   NEPL originally had been set up to educate the public about
American political and social institutions.
   ``I was aware we had varied from our mandate'' in 1985 and 1986
by raising private Contra aid, said Channell. ``But I felt that was
something we could resolve.'' Channell said he had no evidence that
the money being raised was going for lethal aid.
   Robert McFarlane, North's former boss as national security
adviser, is tentatively scheduled to testify Friday in the North
trial. He pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding
information from Congress and was given a $20,000 fine and two
years' probation.

<HEAD>Vets Group Sues in Fight Against Japanese-American Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans group said Thursday it had filed a
federal lawsuit challenging a law to compensate Japanese-Americans
who were interned during World War II.
   Under the law, the U.S. government is to provide $20,000 in
compensation to each of some 60,000 surviving Japanese-Americans who
were interned by the government. A total of about 120,000
Japanese-Americans were put in camps after Pearl Harbor.
   John P. Coale, a Washington attorney handling the lawsuit filed
in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said the court
action was based on the fact that the legislation does not provide
compensation for 2,000 to 3,000 German- and Italian-Americans who
were also interned during the war.
   ``The Japanese-Americans are singled out to be compensated,''
Coale told a news conference.
   Regarding their internment, Coale said, ``We're not saying it was
a fair action, but there were many, many unfair actions during World
War II.''
   The suit was filed on behalf of the American War Veterans Relief
Association, a 30,000-member group based in Anaheim, Calif. The
organization provides emergency financial assistance and shelter to
needy veterans.
   John Kirby, the group's administrator, said, ``Millions of
veterans over the age of 60 who served faithfully in World War II
live in fear that Congress will cut their Social Security and
Medicaid benefits.''
   ``This suit is being filed for those veterans who are outraged
that the same Congress which has pledged to handle the federal
deficit problem has passed a law handing out $1.25 billion'' in
compensation, he said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weekly animal market is one of the most
popular places in Baghdad, a cacophony of trilling songbirds,
barking dogs and bleating goats, where the mundane mixes with the
exotic.
   The souk il-hayawanat, as it's known, unfolds every Friday
morning outside the Mosque of the Caliphs, across the street from
the main bazaar.
   Six months after the cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iran,
Iraq doesn't have the hard currency needed to pay for the imported
video cassette recorders and tape decks that are found elsewhere in
the Arab world. Those that are available generally are out of the
reach of most people, and many stores are empty.
   But the 300-yard stretch of sidewalk where the animal bazaar is
held throngs with Iraqis looking for a bargain in pets, a watchdog
or a goat to provide milk.
   Like other bazaars, this one is divided by speciality, with
carrier pigeons taking up the most space. Buyers squeeze the neck,
splay the feet, unfurl the wings and look in the eyes for any signs
of sickness.
   One customer, Najib, 35, says it's all in the nose.
   ``I must have (one with) a big nose,'' he said. ``That means it's
a strong bird. If you see a big nose, that's the best bird.''
   He was looking for a carrier pigeon to cover the 255 miles
between Baghdad and the southern port of Basra. A good one can cost
about $90.
   But there also are nightingales, parakeets, turkeys, geese,
roosters, chicks, parrots, exotic marsh birds, falcons, ducks,
finches and goldfish.
   One section is taken up with dozens of vendors selling little
aquarium fish swimming around glass jars stacked on benches.
   In the middle of the animals, there's all the paraphernalia
needed to care for them: massive bird cages, mounds of seeds and
fish tanks.
   The crowd attracts other hawkers selling sesame cakes, hearts of
palm and even lucky stones.
   The people inevitably spill into the traffic swirling past just
feet away. Some cars slow while their occupants gawk at the animals.
   A policeman adds his bullhorn to the din as he prods traffic and
pedestrians to keep moving and keep apart.
   Occasionally someone waving through the cars with a seven-foot
birdcage on his shoulders will bring traffic to a screeching halt.
   Some customers come to buy white fantailed pigeons to decorate
the garden at about $250. But even these are not the most expensive
birds on sale.
   A pair of white parrots with yellow crests from the Soviet Union
drew a huge crowd with their ability to say ``Papa, Kaka and
Yacouv,'' apparently the names of their owners. The asking price was
a hefty $750.
   As the crowd reached its thickest around noon, the inevitable
accidents occurred. Birds were trampled underfoot or someone holding
one was jostled and the bird flew free.
   One parakeet escaped and lodged on the gates of the mosque.
Orange peels lobbed at it failed to budge it. Even the amplified
noon prayer booming from loudspeakers in the ancient minaret barely
ruffled a feather.
   ``Forget it,'' said someone in the crowd. ``It's gone to pray.''

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan's proposed drug rehabilitation
center has won conditional approval of a permit, but the facility
must meet a long list of conditions that include heavy security
before it can open.
   Lake View Terrace residents who have opposed the Nancy Reagan
Center, fearing it would increase crime and lower property values,
said they would appeal Wednesday's ruling by a Los Angeles County
zoning official.
   ``It seems as if they make it a fortress, it will be
acceptable,'' said Lew Snow, vice president of the community's
homeowners association. ``It won't.''
   Zoning Administrator Darryl Fisher said homeowner fears about
crime and lower property values, while understandable, were based on
misinformation and a lack of understanding of the proposal for the
center 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.
   However, he imposed 22 conditions on the permit, including
requirements to build a 7-foot security fence, use only one entrance
staffed 24 hours with a guard and employ a video security system.
   Officials at Phoenix House, the nonprofit agency proposing the
center, said they were encouraged by the ruling but objected to some
of the conditions, including the permit's two-year limit.
   ``That could have an incredible impact,'' said Larraine Mohr,
Phoenix House senior vice president.
   Phoenix House, which operates 10 facilities across the country,
has proposed a residential high school and treatment center for as
many as 150 teen-agers and 60 young adults, plus a research and
education center.

   Warmer superpower relations have not stopped a
Soviet agency from spreading timeworn charges that the FBI murdered
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and that the CIA massacred Jim Jones
and 900 of his People's Temple followers in Guyana.
   It's all part of ``glasnost,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of greater openness, according to a top editor at the Soviet
press agency Novosti. But U.S. officials call it blatant lying and
say it's designed to harm the reputation of the United States.
   The anti-American charges, and literally hundreds more like them,
are contained in booklets published recently by Novosti, whose motto
is ``Information for Peace and International Friendship.''
   The deputy editor-in-chief of Novosti's North American
department, Yevgeny A. Posdnyakov, says the slick publications are
not just recycled Cold War-type propaganda. He claims they are part
of the campaign for greater frankness and wider debate launched by
Gorbachev.
   ``There is a need to write about everything so people will make
up their own mind and understand things,'' Posdnyakov said in an
interview. ``The demand that some zones be free from inquiry by
journalists would be an attack on glasnost.''
   The view from Washington is far different: at least one of the
Novosti books, ``Once Again About the CIA,'' is full of untruths and
innuendo designed to smear the reputation of the United States, U.S.
officials charge.
   ``We have discussed this book with the Soviets as a particularly
egregious example of what we call disinformation,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert. ``It contains outright
falsehoods, and we've told them we don't think the continued
distribution of this book is in keeping with the increasing positive
tone of our relationship.''
   Nevertheless, ``Once Again About the CIA,'' whose cover shows
bloody corpses imposed on the Central Intelligence Agency's seal, is
being distributed in special waiting rooms of Moscow airports
reserved for foreigners. According to Posdnyakov, 10,000 copies were
printed in English.
   Novosti publications also are available in Intourist hotels,
whose clientele is largely foreign; from Aeroflot, the Soviet
airline; and from Soviet embassies and other institutions abroad.
   Paradoxically, the publication of the books, largely intended for
foreign markets, comes as official media whose audience is mostly
Soviet are finding much about the United States to praise. Ogonyok
magazine recently asked whether a U.S.-style jury system could be
instituted, and on Thursday the Communist Party daily Pravda lauded
the taste of McDonald's hamburgers.
   The Novosti books strike a far different note. Among recent
releases:
   _ ``Silent Terror,'' billed as ``the book U.S. censors don't want
Americans to read.'' Written by former U.S. cancer researcher Arnold
Lockshin and his wife, Lauren, who obtained political asylum in the
Soviet Union in 1986, the book recounts ``the silent campaign of
harassment and terror which the FBI (the U.S. political police)
organized to force them to conform politically _ or be sorry.''
   The former Houston couple _ members of the Communist Party U.S.A.
who came to Moscow with their three children _ accuse the FBI of
waging an intimidation campaign that included the bugging of their
home, false entries on their telephone bills, harassment of their
daughter, Jennifer, by her high school Russian teacher and the
killing of mice that Lockshin was using in experiments at Houston's
Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research.
   The Lockshins also say it was an ``inescapable conclusion ...
that the FBI murdered King,'' the late civil rights leader.
   Their book was printed in 10,000 copies in English, Posdnyakov
said. ``When Lockshin proposed having the book published, it was a
scoop the agency couldn't pass up,'' he said.
   _ ``American Cultural Invasion in Europe'' by Yuri Kagramanov,
with a 12,000-copy press run in English, has a cover showing a satyr
wearing a cowboy hat seemingly about to rape a naked woman
symbolizing Europe. Its author quotes writers ranging from Norwegian
novelist Knut Hamsun to jazz pioneer Dave Brubeck to buttress his
thesis that U.S. ``bourgeois ideology and culture'' are overrunning
the Old World.
   _ ``Once Again About the CIA,'' in 117 pages, accuses the U.S.
intelligence service of committing the ``monstrous crime'' of
killing the Rev. Jim Jones and over 900 of his followers at
Jonestown, Guyana in 1978 and of assassinating foreign leaders like
Panama's Omar Torrijos and the Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
   The booklet all but openly charges the CIA with the unsuccessful
attempt on the pope's life in 1981, which an Italian state
prosecutor linked instead to the secret service of Bulgaria, a
Soviet ally.
   ``There is some evidence indicating the CIA had a finger in the
attempted assaasination of Pope John Paul II,'' the book says.
``John Paul II made enemies in the West by his statements in defense
of peace ... and against the capitalist exploitation of the working
people.''
   Posdnyakov said he had no knowledge of the official U.S. protests
over ``Once Again About the CIA,'' but said that thanks to glasnost,
the agency could now take up its case with Novosti.
   ``The chief editor has said that he'll publish the CIA
disclaimers if we put out a second edition, and provided, of course,
that the CIA can prove that its version of events is true,''
Posdnyakov said.

   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis, said
today that she continues to fight her alcoholism but plans to resume
her busy public life and schedule.
   ``I am an alcoholic,'' she said, adding that she hoped the public
nature of her visit to a treatment center would encourage others to
follow her route.
   ``I would have preferred to deal with my private trouble in
private,'' she said, acknowledging that was not possible as the wife
of Massachusetts' governor.
   ``One of the mysteries of this disease is that you can have a
loving family, a network of caring friends and still face recovery
every day,'' she said, asking that she be afforded some privacy
during the fight.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, responded to an outpouring of more than 2,000
letters from well wishers with a letter of her own published today
on the front page of USA Today.
   The letter said, in part, ``I have always believed that every
experience we have in life provides an opportunity for growth and
learning. The thousands of letters I received from you contributed
to my growth and I have drawn strength from all that you have shared
with me.''
   Mrs. Dukakis returned home Tuesday after spending 31 days at
Edgehill Newport, a private short-term treatment facility in Rhode
Island. It offers an intensive treatment program following a
detoxification period.
   In the three months following her husband's defeat in November's
presidential election, Mrs. Dukakis' drinking became a serious
problem, the governor said. He described it as her chemical
dependency resurfacing. He blamed exhaustion, stress and ``the
post-election let-down.''

   Afghan government radio said today
that 20 Pakistani and U.S. advisers were killed during a battle with
government troops in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province. A
U.S. official denied the report.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported that Moslem
guerrillas fired rockets Wednesday at the airport in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, killing four people including a small child.
   The United States and Pakistan back the guerrillas. But the
nations have denied sending personnel to Afghanistan to help the
insurgents, despite repeated charges to the contrary by
Afghanistan's communist government.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 500 Pakistani military
personnel also were killed in Wednesday's fighting near the eastern
city of Jalalabad.
   Maj. Robin Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, denied that U.S.
advisers were killed and said: ``There are no Department of Defense
advisers inside Afghanistan.'' She said in an interview in
Washington that the only U.S. soldiers in the region are in
Pakistan, where they are training guerrillas to neutralize lands
mines in a program initiated by the United Nations.
   Sources close to the guerrillas said fighting has been heavy
around Jalalabad during the past several days.
   A guerrilla spokesman in Pakistan, who requested anonymity, said
today that the insurgents had attacked Jalalabad's airport with
long-range artillery.
   Some guerrilla sources and Pakistan's official television said on
Wednesday that the airport had fallen to the insurgents. Other
guerrilla sources have contradicted those reports.
   Jalalabad is 45 miles west of the Pakistan border and on the main
highway linking the Afghan capital with Pakistan.
   Radio Kabul said ``100s of criminals'' were killed by government
troops protecting the city.
   The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan last month after nine
years of supporting the communist government.
   The guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the Afghan government and
have formed a government-in-exile in Pakistan to take over.
   Saudi Arabia today became the first country to officially
recognize the government-in-exile. The oil-rich kingdom has given
the guerrillas considerable support in their struggle.

   After lengthy negotiations failed to produce a
settlement with striking Machinists, a money-losing Texas Air
Corp.-owned airline shuts down and files for protection under
federal bankruptcy law.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is vilified by union members.
Pilots and flight attendants walk off their jobs. Stranded travelers
are irate.
   The scenario is not unlike the one that climaxed Thursday with
the reorganization filing by strikebound Eastern Airlines in
bankruptcy court in New York.
   But in an earlier series of tumultuous events, the bankruptcy
court was in Houston, the year was 1983, and the airline taken to
court was Continental.
   Continental, then the nation's eighth-largest carrier, filed for
protection Sept. 24, 1983, closed for three days and then re-opened
as a non-union discount carrier, generating public acceptance by
offering $49 fares anywhere it flew in the United States _ fares the
public found too good to pass up.
   Continental employees would bear the brunt of the changes. Some
salaries were cut in half. The workforce of 12,000 was cut by
two-thirds. And it would be two years before Continental unveiled a
plan to fully repay nearly $1 billion to creditors.
   Continental's labor strife could be tracked to 1981, when the
airline asked that its agreement with the Machinists be amended to
change pay rates and work rules and conditions. By 1983, a federal
mediator in the talks threw up his hands.
   A month later, on Aug. 13, 550 Machinists were laid off, their
jobs abolished. The next day, the union struck.
   The bankruptcy court filing came six weeks after that.
   On Sept. 29, 1983 _ two days after Continental returned to the
skies _ the airline told pilots they could not strike under the
Federal Railway Labor Act.
   Pilots and flight attendants called the airline's bluff, walking
off their jobs Oct. 1. Continental sued the pilots union for $50
million. The Air Line Pilots Association countersued, upping the
ante to $100 million.
   Continental kept flying.
   The pilots union threatened slowdowns at other carriers.
   Continental kept flying.
   Seven weeks after the filing, airline capacity reached 50
percent. By April 1984, Continental was up to 85 percent of the
capacity it had before the bankruptcy action.
   First to show cracks in solidarity were pilots. Only one month
after they walked off their jobs, 500 of them _ more than one-third
of the original pilot workforce _ were back in Continental cockpits.
   It would be two years before ALPA totally gave in. Picket lines
long gone, the union in September 1985 authorized members to return
to work.
   Six months earlier, the Machinists and the Association of Flight
Attendants had ended their walkouts. By then, 50 percent of the
2,000 Machinists and 60 percent of the 2,600 flight attendants
already had returned to work.
   The costs of filing for bankruptcy accounted for $25 million of
the airline's $77.2 million third-quarter 1983 loss.
   But Continental, which lost $260 million in 1982 and 1983, showed
a $50.3 million profit in 1984. And in early 1986, parent company
Texas Air bought Eastern.

<HEAD>Soviets Seizing Upon Glasnost in Dispute over Nuclear-Powered Ship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When dockworkers refused to service a
nuclear-powered ship and residents demanded it stay away, they were
putting glasnost to work to express the kind of grassroots concern
over the environment that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
welcomed.
   Just a few years ago, such open defiance of Moscow would have
been unthinkable, and authorities would have moved in immediately to
arrest any protesters who surfaced.
   But now, on certain issues like the environment, glasnost _ or
greater openness _ is welcomed. Authorities are taking a more
tolerant attitude toward protests, and in some cases are even going
along with the public's demands.
   In the Soviet Far East, at least three ports have refused to
allow the nuclear-powered barge carrier Sevmorput to dock because of
concern for possible radioactive contamination.
   Soviet press reports have said tens of thousands of residents
protested to a Pacific radio station, and city officials and
dockworkers declared the ship unwelcome out of fear over nuclear
power that grew after the Chernobyl disaster. The public also
apparently was upset that although it was newly built, the Sevmorput
had already developed cracks.
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News said this week that Moscow
ministries are to blame for trying to maintain a ship that is
uneconomical and failing to tell the public that experts had
certified it is safe.
   The daily Izvestia on Thursday told of yet another protest
against a ship. It said residents in the Ukraine on the western
shore of the Black Sea are protesting plans to transfer onto barges
what they believe is hazardous cargo from the West German ship
Petersberg. Dockworkers are also refusing to carry out the
operation, the newspaper said.
   The April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, which
killed at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation worldwide,
turned much of Soviet public opinion against nuclear power and
brought the issue to the top of the country's environmental agenda.
   In December, government officials announced that six nuclear
power projects have been scrapped because of earthquake danger or
tougher standards imposed after Chernobyl. Added to the list after
the devastating earthquake in Armenia on Dec. 7 was the nuclear
power plant near the republic's capital, Yerevan. Armenian activists
had been demanding closure of the plant for years, but it was only
after the eartquake that authorities agreed.
   Lithuanians particularly have been vocal about their opposition
to a nuclear power plant in their republic. In September, thousands
of people formed a human chain at the Ignalina Atomic Electric
Station to protest its threat to the environment. Authorities had
already responded to earlier protests by ordering an end to
construction of a third reactor at the plant.
   In his travels, Gorbachev himself has been confronted with
complaints from Soviets about the safety of nuclear power plants in
their backyards.
   Last month, in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev _ not far from
Chernobyl _ residents confronted the Kremlin chief with concern
about the safety of a nuclear power plant under construction on the
Crimean Peninsula. Gorbachev was sympathetic, saying foreign experts
have been called in to review the plant's design and that it would
not be finished if the specialists determine it to be unsafe.
   In a Feb. 23 speech in Kiev, Gorbachev said his democratization
of society has spawned a grassroots environmental movement that the
Kremlin must ``in all ways welcome.'' He noted millions of tons of
harmful chemicals are spewed into the air yearly, destroying arable
land, vegetation and animals, and promised to ``completely overcome
the underestimation of the importance of ecology.''
   Scientists must review every project to determine their expected
impact on the environment, Gorbachev said, and a popular referendum
must be held on each proposal.
   The government is even welcoming help from the outside, sometimes
from unexpected sources. The international environmental group
Greenpeace, which has organized protests against Soviet whaling,
announced Monday it is negotiating the opening of a branch office in
Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Here is the statement of Eastern Airlines
President Phil Bakes at a news conference Thursday announcing that
the strikebound airline had filed for Chapter 11 protection under
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We have petitioned the Federal Court in New York for protection
under the bankruptcy laws.
   Turning to what we have always viewed as the last resort of
bankruptcy has been brought about by the airline pilots union
grounding, or virtual grounding, of our airline. It has not only
paralyzed our operation and severely inconvenienced customers, but
has precipitated a potential cash crisis at the company that can
only be averted and stabilized by seeking protection under the
bankruptcy laws.
   I want to emphasize and re-emphasize what Frank said. We intend
to operate our airline. And make no mistake about that. We intend to
continue our immediate emphasis on the shuttle and South America,
and then prudently, but unmistakeably, put back into the sky more
airplanes and go back into service in many of the markets that we
have served up until last week. And we'll do that as pilots become
available, and the bankruptcy process itself will substantially
assist our ability to build back the airline.
   The steps we've been forced to take because of the virtual
shutdown of the company will also require that we entertain
transactions that, like the proposed sale of the Eastern Airlines
shuttle to Donald Trump, will provide liquidity and cash resources _
the lifeblood, if you will _ to allow us to resuscitate a smaller,
but certainly a revitalized, and certainly viable Eastern Airlines.
   We fully intend to meet _ and we intend to ... and we have
confidence in saying that _ all of our obligations to our creditors
and we are confident there will be substantial value for our
shareholders.
   Despite the fact that the reorganization should be a successful
one, I have to echo Frank's comment that the last five days have
been the saddest five days of my life. This is the last course of...
the last resort that we ever thought we'd have to pursue. To see the
tens of thousands of men and women who have been inconvenienced is
tough. To go from last week 30,000 employees of Eastern Airlines to
1,500 employees today is something that will be with me for the rest
of my life. But we're going to go on and we're going to build.
   Although the immediate precipitating crisis has been the pilot
union decision to shut down most of our airplanes, the larger story
of Eastern Airlines is a story that goes back many years. Most of
the problems at Eastern have preceded the acquisiton by Texas Air.
   In the post decade of deregulation in the 1980s, Eastern has lost
$1.5 billion on airline operations. During that same period of time
the competition had earned $2 billion. And much of that $2 billion
was reinvested in airplanes that ended up in our market. In the last
five years we have seen approximately 1,600 new daily competitive
flights by our competitors in the market areas that we serve east of
the Mississippi.
   The causes of Eastern's losses go back many many years. They
start, acutally, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Eastern was slow
to convert and stayed with props a little too long.
   The problems date to the 1970s when Eastern's labor costs were
among the highest _ if not the highest _ in the entire airline
industry. And they continue through the 1980s when Easterns unions,
most particularly the International Association of Machinists,
resisted agreeing to productive and affordable labor settlements
that could have provided the company the strength to not only meet
the competition but to grow substantially as many other airlines did.
   And labor strife, not just high labor costs, at Eastern Airlines
over the last 10 years has taken its toll. It's diverted the
attention of all of us _ management and non-management alike _ and
yes, it's diverted a lot of customers from Eastern Airlines.
   Eastern today, as a result of that, has a weakened revenue
structure much too dependent on discretionary, lower-priced,
non-business travelers.
   The losses and high labor costs had to be paid from somewhere.
And they were. Over the years, in the '70s and early 1980s and up
until very recently, Eastern borrowed, very heavily, to meet the
high labor cost bill, to make up for the depressed revenue
structure, to cover operating losses.
   And more recently, when debt was not really available to us,
nobody really wanted to loan money to Eastern Airlines, we had to
sell some assets, to raise cash, to meet payroll, and to continue in
operation.
   In fact, if we had not sold the assets we have sold over the last
couple of years, this news conference would have been held about a
year and a half ago, and we wouldn't be talking about rehabilitating
the company _ the company would never fly again if we had not done
that.

<HEAD>Activists Told Trend Can Only Be Reversed By Pressure on Regulators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists were told Thursday that they must
oppose a trend of regulated industries forcing bigger price
increases on individual consumers than on business customers.
   The trend can only be reversed by pressure on state and federal
regulators, said Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer
Federation of America, at his group's annual convention.
   Charges for electricity, natural gas, and telephone service
increased more rapidly in the 1980s for residential customers than
others, and checking account charges rose most rapidly for
low-balance accounts, Cooper said.
   ``I think there's a lot at stake here,'' although ``these kinds
of issues don't grab the lapels of ... consumer advocates. This is
esoteric stuff that can put most regulators to sleep,'' he said.
   The rates are important because the increases reduce the buying
power of the incomes of the poor, he said.
   He said that electricity, gas, telephones and checking accounts
take up 6 percent of the average household's spending, but in the
poorest fifth of households these items eat up 26 percent of the
budget.
   Though industrial and residential rates for electricity and gas
rose together in the 1970s, in the 1980s ``rates for industrial
users became uncoupled,'' he said.
   For example, he said:
   _From 1981 through 1988, average residential electric rates rose
20 percent but industrial rates did not change.
   _In those years residential gas rates rose 5 percent, while
industrial gas rates fell 25 percent.
   _In that period local residential telephone rates rose 75
percent, private lines rose 55 percent and WATS lines rose only 5
percent.
   Though long-distance rates declined, ``unfortunately the average
consumer does not make enough (long-distance) calls to break even on
the deal,'' Cooper said.
   _The annual cost of a checking account almost doubled from 1977
to 1985 for people earning $10,000 or less per year, while those
earning more than $50,000 kept balances large enough to stop paying
fees and earn interest.
   In the three utility areas, ``industrial users assaulted the
regulatory commissions,'' Cooper said.
   ``They extracted the freedom to shop around, when residential
consumers can't. They threatened to leave town, when residential
consumers can't. They threatened to build their own systems, when
residential consumers can't,'' he said. ``None of these threats,
almost none of them, were ever backed up.''
   In banking, he said, ``The regulators essentially left the
field.''
   ``The solution is obvious: to beat the regulators about the head
until they get the pricing schemes fixed ... you have to do it
politically.''
   Edward Byers, vice president of Cambridge Reports Inc., a polling
firm, told the convention ``generally there's a lot of confusion''
about natural gas and electricity issues. ``We get very high rates
of `no opinion,' `don't know' or contradictory results.''
   Where there are clear currents of opinion, people are concerned
``that any deregulatory effort is going to raise their prices. They
are not concerned about impacts on service reliability or quality,''
Byers said.

   UMM EL-FAHM, Israel (AP) _ Election victories last week gave
Moslem fundamentalists control of this Arab town and some villages,
inspiring fear among Israeli Jews that an Islamic revolution is
growing in their midst.
   Politicians of the new Islamic Movement in this northern town of
27,000 people say they won because of government neglect, not
revolution.
   Government officials, scholars and editorial writers have warned
of a fundamentalist trend and some even suggest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the Iranian patriarch, has become a revolutionary model
for Israeli Moslems.
   Israel has 810,000 Arab citizens, 18 percent of the population,
and 80 percent of them are Moslems.
   Sheik Raed Salah Mahajneh, a Moslem preacher and new mayor of Umm
el-Fahm, said his party won because the town is in disrepair and has
a debt of $3.9 million. He blamed that on skimpy government funding
and a poor job by the previous local administration, which the
communists supported.
   ``We are short of drainage, roads and schoolrooms,'' said the
30-year-old mayor, a policeman's son. ``Anywhere you put your
finger, there is something to be done. We are not in Iran, we are
here. We have been here since before the Iranian revolution.''
   Alex Bligh, a government adviser on Arab affairs, said complaints
of discrimination against Israeli Arabs were ``not totally
baseless.'' Despite improvements, he said, the ratio of government
funds devoted to Jewish and Arab towns is 4-1.
   Mahajneh has the full beard of a Moslem fundamentalist but he
greeted reporters this week in a stylish sweater, slacks and loafers.
   The Islamic Movement's use of mosque donations to build roads and
kindergartens in Arab areas is cited by many observers as a major
reason for its election success.
   A combination mosque, clinic and social center now being built in
Umm el-Fahm was financed with local donations and $45,000 from Cat
Stevens _ the American folk singer who changed his name to Yusef
Islam after becoming a Moslem, Mahajneh said.
   The five-story complex sits on a hill overlooking the town 35
miles northeast of Tel Aviv.
   Such efforts by the party have not arrested decades of neglect,
however. Open sewage drains and rutted, dirt roads are common in
Arab towns and villages.
   The Islamic Movement, which is challenging Communist domination
among Israeli Arabs, won leadership in Umm el-Fahm and two large
villages, and could win three more villages in run-off elections.
Six of the 19 council posts in the biblical city of Nazareth went to
Islamic candidates.
   Bligh, who spoke at a government forum on the elections, called
the victories ``a very disturbing development'' that could have
national implications if the Islamic Movement runs for parliament,
where Arabs occupy a half-dozen of the 120 seats.
   Rafi Israel, an expert on Islamic affairs at Hebrew University,
tied growing fundamentalism among Israel's Moslems to the Islamic
fervor of Khomeini and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. ``I can see
very alarming signs that things might get out of hand,'' he said.
   He noted that the concept of Islam as a system of government and
society as well as a religion were incompatible with the idea of a
Jewish state, and declared it ``nonsense'' to believe Arabs were
loyal citizens of Israel.
   Leaders of the Islamic Movement and newly elected Moslem
officials insist such fears are unfounded.
   ``We will not do anything outside the law,'' Mahajneh said. ``The
law will be here as it is in Tel Aviv.''
   Sheik Abdullah Nimer Darwish, spriritual leader of the Islamic
Movement, said Jews had no reason to fear Islam but made clear his
mission was larger than local government.
   Darwish, 41, was jailed for anti-Israeli activities in the early
1980s and advocates a Palestinian state alongside Israel, rejecting
the call of some fundamentalists for destruction of the Jewish state.
   ``Let's agree on the two states and a cease-fire for 10, 15
years,'' he said. ``If they cannot co-exist, let them restore the
situation to what it was.''

<HEAD>Education Secretary Visits South Bronx Catholic School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos visited a
Roman Catholic elementary school in one of the nation's most
depressed urban communities Thursday, praising its unusual blend of
art and academics.
   ``I think that any school that is well run, that is orderly, that
is free of drugs, all schools should be like that,'' Cavazos said.
   St. Augustine School of The Arts, for kindergartners through
eighth graders, nearly all of whom are black, was profiled in
December on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' as an educational oasis in
slum-ridden section of the South Bronx.
   Despite his praise for the school, Cavazos indicated to reporters
he was not interested in renewing the debate over whether parents of
Catholic and other private school students should get tuition tax
credits or vouchers.
   ``I'm not really pushing for tuition tax credits or vouchers,''
Cavazos said.
   Yet Principal Thomas Pilecki said he remained optimistic.
   ``I'm hopeful his (Cavazos') visit here will help him see the
strength of Catholic schools,'' he said. ``We don't have any money
at all. We don't have a cent.''
   From the 1970s through 1984, the school's enrollment dropped from
about 500 to less than 200 and the New York Archdiocese was
threatening to close it. But St. Augustine began an unusual
curriculum built around a fine arts program in the 1984, and
enrollment now stands at 320. Tuition is $1,100 a year.
   The curriculum combines the usual academic subjects with
instruction in art, dance and especially music, taught by
professionals. Piano is mandatory through fourth grade. Each student
must also learn at least one other instrument.
   St. Augustine is the only parochial school in the archdiocese
specializing in fine arts. Unlike most fine arts schools, it admits
all comers, regardless of talent.
   Youngsters showed Cavazos their musical prowess with a more than
respectable rendition of the national anthem during an assembly in
his honor.
   ``It takes a lot of practice,'' said 10-year-old Sharene
Lindquist, who has studied piano and clarinet. ``You don't have to
be an expert. If you've got problems, you can always go to the
teacher.''
   The arts program is supported by about $350,000 a year in
foundation and corporate grants.
   But finances are sometimes so tight that ``at times teachers have
been asked not to cash their paychecks,'' said the Rev. Robert
Jeffers, pastor of St. Augustine.
   The arts program has paid off, said Jeffers, because it ``gives
children a constant sense of accomplishment.''
   During a tour of the school, Cavazos stopped in on Yvonne
Rhem-Tittle's eighth-grade science class and quizzed youngsters
about their assignments.
   They in turn presented him with a maroon and white T-shirt with
the school emblem.

   A Harvard professor has disputed the contention
of two leading surgeons that replacing intestines and other organs
is a justifiable, last-ditch remedy for dying children even though
it has never saved a child.
   ``There must be some likelihood of success before the desperate
remedy becomes more than a desperate search for an opportunity to
try a new procedure awaiting trial,'' Dr. Francis D. Moore of
Harvard University wrote in an editorial in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The heads of two surgical teams that have performed the nation's
only four- and five-organ abdominal transplants defended their
efforts in separate articles, saying they found no evidence of organ
rejection in their first four child patients even though they all
died.
   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr.
James W. Williams of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago said they also found no indication of a potentially fatal
reaction in which immune cells transplanted from the organ donor
attack the recipient's cells.
   While lauding the leadership of Starzl and Williams, Moore
questioned their assertion that severely ill children ``tolerate the
operative procedure very well.''
   He noted that two of the four children died soon after the
operation and said the other two had many complications.
   ``If this is tolerating the operative procedure very well, one
wonders what it would look like if the procedures were not well
tolerated,'' Moore said. He called for further study with animals
before more transplants are tried on children.
   Starzl's first patient, a 6-year-old girl, died a few hours after
her 1983 transplant at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Most of
her small intestine had been sucked out by a swimming pool pump, and
she later developed liver failure. She received those organs, along
with a new spleen and pancreas.
   His second patient survived longer than any of the three others.
Tabatha Foster, 3, of Madisonville, Ky., died of cancer of the lymph
system in May, six months after receiving a new liver, pancreas,
stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine.
   ``The most important conclusion from our longest surviving
patient was that she came tantalizingly close to truly long-term
survival with a functioning gastrointestinal tract,'' Starzl said.
   ``It seems inevitable that further cautious trials'' of
multi-organ transplants will be made, he said.
   Like Tabatha, both of Williams' patients were born with short gut
syndrome, a deformity that leads to liver failure.
   Williams' first patient, a 17-month-old boy, lived three days
after surgery in 1986. He died of sudden internal bleeding. His
other patient, a 10-month-old boy, died of cancer 3{ months after
receiving a new liver, pancreas, small bowel and part of the stomach
in 1988.
   Doctors believe the cancer that killed Tabatha and the other
child last year resulted from too much anti-rejection medication,
which suppresses the body's immune system.
   Williams said he performed his two multi-organ transplants
because of the hopelessness of the children's condition.
   ``The forbidding problem of short bowel syndrome and associated
(liver) failure is potentially manageable'' with multiorgan
transplants, he said.
   Williams has not performed any more multi-organ transplants,
although suitable patients would be accepted for consideration,
according to Dr. Howard Sankary, a member of Williams' surgical team.
   Since the articles were written, a fifth child died after
multiple transplant surgery, and Starzl has suspended such
operations until better anti-rejection medication is available.
   The child, five-organ recipient Rolandrea Dodge, 3, of Fruitland,
N.M., survived six weeks. She died in January; doctors believe she,
too, died of cancer.
   Starzl's team has had better luck with multiple organ abdominal
transplants on adult patients with terminal cancer. Eleven of the
first 13 have survived and are believed to be free of malignancy.
   Unlike the young multi-organ recipients, the adults kept most of
their own small intestines, which the Pittsburgh researchers said
might explain the older patients' success.

   The man elected to succeed Bernie Sanders,
the city's socialist mayor, ran on the same left-wing platform and
says his job is to ``tilt the scales'' toward those not rich enough
to protect their interests.
   But Peter Clavelle shies away from the socialist label.
   ``Very few people understand socialism. I don't have a great
understanding of it myself,'' said Sanders' community development
director, who was elected mayor Tuesday. ``I was not schooled in the
Lenin-Marxist analysis.''
   The 39-year-old Clavelle, who has taken a magazine's description
of him _ ``bald, paunchy, colorless'' _ as a badge of honor, was
chosen by the city's third-party Progressive Coalition to run after
Sanders decided against a fifth two-year term.
   He drew 5,626 votes, or 53 percent, to 4,400 or 42 percent for
Nancy Chioffi, a Democrat. A tax revolt candidate and one from the
environmentalist Greens party split the rest of the vote.
   Burlington, Vermont's largest city with a population of 38,000,
drew widespread attention eight years ago when Sanders, a rumpled,
tieless radical educated at the University of Chicago, was elected
by 10 votes.
   Clavelle and Sanders joined forces shortly afterward, when
Clavelle went to work first as personnel director and then as chief
of development.
   Clavelle has won high marks for his efforts to preserve low-cost
housing, to get more women into jobs and help stem domestic abuse,
and to create amenities such as a boathouse and bike path on Lake
Champlain.
   He and others describe his approach as low-key, not as
confrontational as Sanders.'
   Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political scientist,
said Clavelle has been a key behind-the-scenes player in the city's
many tussles with developers over whether they will build or
renovate affordable housing in exchange for permission to build
higher-priced properties.
   ``When Bernie Sanders makes his outburst against the rapacious
developers and stomps out of the room, Peter's the guy who will then
shut the door and say, `OK, let's sign the contract,''' Nelson said.
``He's sort of been the good cop to Bernie Sanders' bad cop.''
   Of his style of governance, Clavelle said, ``The mayor ought to
be open to perspectives from the entire community. But those who
have the money, those who have the power do a pretty good job
representing themselves. So the mayor's role is to attempt to tilt
the scales just a little bit.''
   Clavelle grew up in the blue-collar suburb of Winooski and
remembers being called a ``river rat'' by affluent high school
classmates.
   He became the first in his family to graduate from college and
pursued a career in city management because ``it seemed like
something where you could make a difference.''
   He was hired at 23 as town manager in the town of Castleton then
moved to the same job in Winooski four years later.
   When a proposed budget there was voted down, Clavelle drained the
municipal swimming pool during a heat wave, saying the city couldn't
afford it. He resigned in disgust at what he called a lack of
support for city services.

but failed to resolve a potential power struggle.
   Botha, reportedly defying the wishes of his own party, announced
he would return to work next week after a two-month convalesence
from a stroke.
   The party leader, Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, indicated an
impasse remained, saying his talks with Botha would continue at an
unspecified later date. State-run television said the meeting ``was
apparently a very tough session'' which ended with ``no clear
agreement on working relations'' between Botha and de Klerk, the
heir apparent for the presidency.
   Botha said he would resume his duties at a Cabinet meeting on
Wednesday, when the government presents its annual budget. Last
week, Botha had said he would not return to office until April, and
indicated he was irked at suggestions that he retire.
   The independent South African Press Association reported that the
caucus of National Party members of Parliament was dissatisified
with Botha's stance and wanted a firm pledge from him to retire as
soon as feasible to make way for de Klerk.
   Botha's statement gave no indication how long he planned to
continue in office and made no mention of his meeting with de Klerk.
   Before the meeting, there were unconfirmed press reports that a
compromise would be proposed, with Botha remaining as president
temporarily but agreeing to let de Klerk succeed him in a general
election held within the next few months.
   The Star of Johannesburg, the country's largest daily newspaper,
quoted National Party sources as saying Botha might reject the
compromise and thus provoke a confrontation.
   De Klerk described his talks with Botha as ``comprehensive and
penetrating,'' but no further details were disclosed about the
meeting, held at Botha's official residence in Cape Town.
   Botha, 73, suffered a stroke Jan. 18 and resigned as National
Party leader on Feb. 2. He was replaced by de Klerk, marking the
first time that the party leader was not also the head of government.
   Among South Africa's 5 million whites, there has been a largely
favorable reaction to the prospect of a de Klerk presidency. Even
staunchly pro-government newspapers have suggested the time has come
for Botha to step aside after holding power since 1978.
   When Botha said in an interview last week that he intended to
return to office in April, there were widespread predictions of a
bitter power struggle between him and de Klerk, whose party post
gives him no formal role in government policy-making. Botha said he
had a duty to continue in office despite ``derision and attacks''
aimed at him.
   While Botha flew Thursday from his holiday coastal home to Cape
Town, De Klerk and other National Party members of Parliament met in
private to discuss the situation.
   After the meeting, the caucus released a statement saying its
members had reached unanimous agreement on the issue of political
power. It did not elaborate.
   De Klerk, who also holds the post of National Party leader for
Transvaal Province, then went to Botha's office accompanied by
leaders of the party branches in the other three provinces. The Cape
Province leader, Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis,
is serving as acting president during Botha's convalesence.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg financial newspaper, said only Botha
himself could arrange a dignified departure from office.
   ``If he engages in further power struggles and manipulations ...
he will leave office a pathetic figure,'' an editorial said. ``The
fact is that de Klerk has a chance of making a political
breakthrough; President Botha has none.''
   De Klerk has not repudiated any of Botha's major policies, but he
is depicted as more pragmatic and flexible. However, he has
reaffirmed the government's commitment to segregated neighborhoods
and schools for whites who want them, and he has given no indication
he would consider full voting rights for the country's 28 million
blacks.

   A Soviet military attache was ordered home
today by the State Department after being caught receiving
classified documents from an American employee of a U.S. firm with
government contracts, a spokesman said.
   Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, who arrived here last
June, received documents dealing with how the U.S. government
protects classified and other sensitive information in computer
systems, State Department press officer Dennis Harter said.
   The FBI said Pakhtusov was arrested Wednesday evening. It was not
disclosed how long he is being given to leave the United States. But
one government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was expected Pakhtusov would be given 24 to 48 hours to return to
his homeland.
   Harter said the Soviet Embassy was informed that Pakhtusov was
being expelled for ``engaging in activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status.''
   The name of the company whose documents Pakhtusov sought was not
disclosed.
   Harter said Pakhtusov approached the American last August and
asked about the possibility of acquiring the secret documents. The
American, whose identity was not disclosed, reported the contact to
the FBI, which began monitoring contacts between the two.
   Pakhtusov, 35, was identified by the government source as a
member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. He was described by
the source as a significant catch because of his rank in the GRU.

<HEAD>Ratzinger Tells US Bishops to Reassert Their Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican's chief theologian urged American
bishops to be ``martyrs'' in defending Roman Catholic teaching and
to impose their authority on dissenters, officials said Thursday.
   Several of the 35 U.S. bishops attending a special conference
responded that compromise and dialogue are necessary in the American
church in areas other than major matters of faith.
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said some bishops had let dissident
theologians usurp their authority, ``leading to a growing insecurity
and disorientation'' among the faithful.
   On some issues, ``it's necessary to risk being unpopular, because
of the truth,'' said Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, in remarks released Thursday. ``Those who
announce the Gospel must also be martyrs, in the most profound sense
of the word.''
   His address Wednesday night was seen as the keynote of the
four-day closed meeting between the Vatican and the bishops Pope
John Paul II summoned to discuss the state of American church, which
has 52 million members.
   John Paul, who is attending the conference, has criticized the
tendency of many U.S. Catholics to disregard church teaching on
birth control, divorce and some other matters.
   Ratzinger spoke of theological experts who, ``through the mass
media, bring into the public arena their often dissonant
contributions, to the point where their voices drown out those of
the bishops.''
   In recent years, he said, many bishops have felt pressure to be
managers rather than preachers.
   ``The bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative
model, little defending their magisterial authority'' over that of
theologians, he said.
   He criticized those who think the spirit of free inquiry, not
church teaching, should prevail on theological issues.
   Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis-St. Paul and other American
prelates responded with a defense of compromise and debate on church
teaching.
   ``Archbishop Roach made it very clear that U.S. bishops will not
compromise on major matters of the faith,'' the Rev. John Lynch,
secretary of the U.S. National Conference of Bishops, said at a
briefing for journalists Thursday.
   ``In other matters,'' he added, ``sometimes the discussion and
the dialogue take more time than perhaps other people would like it
to take.''
   Lynch said the bishops told Vatican officials continuing the
dialogue with dissenters, ``which can sometimes be read as weakness,
but which in our American experience often leads to a good end,
should not be seen as weakness.''
   Not all the U.S. bishops disagreed with Ratzinger.
   Addressing problems faced by the American hierarchy, Cardinal
John O'Connor of New York mentioned ``leadership in certain colleges
and universities'' and said ``some bishops in the last 20 years have
seemed to lose faith, first in themselves as people, afterward in
their magisterial authority.''
   O'Connor, considered a doctrinal conservative, said other
problems stemmed from the effect of mass media on family and sexual
attitudes, ``the `abortion' mentality, racism, radical feminism,
loss in numbers of the teaching religious, dissident theologies and
ecclesiologies, materialism, etcetera.''
   The cardinal chided the Vatican for failing to prepare its clergy
and faithful for modern reforms, however, and said it had been too
slow in clarifying its policy on artificial birth control.
   A summary of his speech also was released Thursday.
   Other American bishops asked the Vatican for greater
``theological precision,'' possibly in the form of periodic letters
on moral issues.
   Ratzinger had some praise for the bishops, commending them for
pastoral letters that shed ``the light of faith'' on social issues.
The American prelates have produced controversial letters on the
U.S. economy and nuclear weapons.
   He also said, however, that bishops must resist a society in
which individual liberties were considered paramount and moral
values consigned to the private sphere.
   Those ideas were echoed in meetings Thursday between the Vatican
and the Americans on the role of priests and on the church's
pastoral mission.
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said American priests were
``extraordinarily faithful'' but faced special challenges in U.S.
society. He mentioned individualism, moral relativism, the
``isolation of sexual pleasure as an end in itself'' and failure to
recognize differences between the sexes.

   An international conference on
Indochinese refugees ruled out repatriating asylum-seekers who are
deemed not to be fleeing political persecution, officials said
Thursday.
   Delegates from 30 nations ended their three-day meeting endorsing
a draft action plan for consideration at the International
Conference on Indochinese Refugees in Geneva in June.
   Chairman Majid Mohamed told a news conference the plan would help
``provide durable solutions to the Indochinese refugee problem.''
   The draft plan suggests Vietnam launch a campaign stressing the
risks and hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegal
departures by ``boat people.'' It also calls on Vietnam to make
legal departures easier.
   Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and other
countries in the region have agreed to provide only temporary asylum
for refugees. Western nations were urged to take in refugees left in
camps in Southeast Asia.
   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the conference
voted not to recommend a deadline by which asylum-seekers would be
screened to decide whether they qualified for resettlement in the
West.
   Officials said some Southeast Asian countries had asked the
conference to recommend forcible repatriation of boat people and
others fleeing their countries for reasons other than political
persecution.
   ``The rules are very clear ... whenever refugees are repatriated,
it has to be on a voluntary basis,'' said Jean Pierre Hocke, the
United Nations high commissioner for refugees.
   The officials said the Vietnamese delegation, led by Deputy
Foreign Minister Vu Khoan, had agreed at the conference to take back
anyone who wanted to return voluntarily.
   Western delegations present said they might take in additional
refugees, and step up financial aid to help implement the plan.
   So far, 150,000 people have emigrated legally from Vietnam under
the Orderly Departure Program.
   There are about 300,000 Indochinese refugees in Southeast Asia.
About 1.5 million have been resettled since the outflow began 10
years ago, more than 800,000 of them in the United States, officials
said.
   Majid said the plan would be sent to U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York for the Geneva conference June
13-14.

   A Palestinian teen-ager who threatened to slash
an Israeli soldier with a broken bottle was shot and killed in the
occupied Gaza Strip on Thursday, the army said.
   At least 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied lands, Arab hospital
officials said. An army spokesman confirmed four wounded and said he
was checking other reports.
   The violence erupted as Palestinians shuttered their shops and
businesses in the second day of a general strike to mark 15 months
of rebellion against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel captured the lands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The death of Atef Jundieh, 16, of Gaza City raised to at least
393 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began.
Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died.
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified under military
regulations, said Jundieh threatened a soldier with a broken bottle.
   ``The soldier fired into the air and ordered the man to stop, but
he didn't,'' said the spokesman. ``The soldier then fired toward the
man, wounding him. He died several hours later.''
   On Wednesday night, Ibrahim Haled Hubal was electrocuted in the
West Bank village of Kharbat Al-Masbah, Arab reporters said. They
said Hubal was killed after troops ordered him to climb an
electricity pole to remove an outlawed Palestinian flag.
   An army official said no troops were in the village at the time
and that Hubal, 27, may have climbed the pole to hang a flag.
   Soldiers on Thursday began leaving their base in the Shati
refugee camp in Gaza City as part of the army's plans to rely less
on stationary units and more on mobile forces, army radio reported.
   Observers have seen fewer troops in the occupied lands in recent
days. The army declined to comment on whether it was reducing its
forces in the territories.
   The head of Israel's military government in the West Bank, Brig.
Gen. Shaike Erez, has begun a series of meetings with prominent
Palestinians to discuss ``political developments ... and problems of
everyday life,'' the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot reported Thursday.
   The reports of troop reductions and Erez' meetings came on the
eve of Foreign Minister Moshe Arens' departure Friday for a 10-day
visit to the United States, where he is to meet with President Bush.
   Arens is expected to seek U.S. support for peace efforts that
focus on a temporary solution for the occupied territories. U.S.
officials are expected to urge Israel to stop the violence caused by
its efforts to end the uprising, known as the intefadeh.
   Dr. Hatem Abu-Ghazaleh, a physician who met with Erez on
Thursday, told The Associated Press: ``I told him this is the
generation of the occupation who rose up against Israel, and the
intefadeh will never be ended until an international peace
conference is convened in which the PLO is a partner on equal
footing.''
   Israel says the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist
group and refuses to negotiate with it.
   In other violence Thursday, a 33-year-old Palestinian man was
admitted to a Nablus hospital with head wounds his family said he
suffered in a beating by settlers from a nearby Jewish community.
   Arab reports said the incident led to a clash between Palestinian
villagers and settlers and that the army was called in to restore
order. The army spokesman said he was checking the report.
   Israel radio said 15 youths were arrested in Arab east Jerusalem
on suspicion of anti-Israeli activities.
   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said military police were
investigating allegations that 15 soldiers from the elite Givati
brigade killed a 20-year-old Gaza Palestinian, Iyad Akal, who died
in custody in February 1988.
   The newspaper said Akal was handcuffed, beaten with a weapon and
kicked. Four other soldiers from the brigade are on trial for the
beating death in August of a Palestinian in the Gaza's Jabaliya
refugee camp.

   Members of a House subcommittee gave a scathing
appraisal Thursday of a proposed presidential order that would
tighten the government's security clearance process but do away with
employee protections against arbitrary penalties.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., shot a series of questions at Mary
Lawton, a Justice Department official who led an interagency group
that developed the proposal over the last five years. But Lawton
offered no justification for eliminating employees' due process
rights in the order.
   ``I don't understand why we're hurting these people,'' said
Sikorsky, chairman of the House civil service subcommittee. ``What's
wrong with these minimal due process rights? Why did you obliterate
them?''
   Lawton explained that her task force, which included
representatives from the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency and
the departments of State, Defense, Energy and Treasury, was charged
by then-President Reagan to bring government-wide consistency to
background investigations of workers whose jobs require secret
security clearances.
   The federal Office of Personnel Management estimated in 1986 that
5 million military, civilian and federal contractor employees held
various levels of security clearances; numerous government studies
have found that number too high to be manageable. That overabundance
makes periodic re-reviews of security status impossible to keep
current and increases the likelihood that secret information will be
compromised.
   When the task force completed its draft presidential order,
however, it dropped from the regulations a series of due process
guarantees that had been in place since President Eisenhower
instituted them three decades ago.
   The proposed rule would do away with a worker's right to be
notified that he or she was being denied a security clearance, to be
told the reasons for the denial in writing, to be granted a chance
to reply and to be represented by a lawyer.
   ``What's wrong with the current process of giving a reason in
writing?'' Sikorski asked Lawton.
   ``Nothing's wrong,'' Lawton answered, adding, ``There is no
liberty or property interest in (security) clearance.''
   Denial of security clearance does not always mean a person's job
will be endangered, she said. ``Access (to classified information)
is not a right, it's a privilege.''
   ``I think it's indefensible,'' Sikorski replied, adding later:
   ``What you're saying is we want to flex our muscles. We don't
want any more court cases on access denial.''
   Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., asked Lawton, ``What public interest is
preserved by not explaining the reasons for denial?''
   ``Ninety-nine times out of 100, none,'' said Lawton. In the
remaining case, she said, the government must protect the secrecy of
the source of information on which the denial is based. But she
conceded that such information is protected even under the current
system.
   Following the hearing, Lawton told a reporter she was unable to
fully discuss or defend the draft order because it is still an
internal Executive Branch document and is being reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget, with no decision yet made on its
final form.

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa opened
the first session of the newly elected Parliament on Thursday, and
he called for warring rebel groups to put down arms and restore
peace on the island.
   But Sinhalese rebels, who called a strike to protest the session,
hurled bombs at state-run buses in southern and central Sri Lanka,
police said. The attacks killed one bus driver and injured two
passengers.
   The Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students, a Tamil rebel
group that won 13 seats in the northeastern province, has vowed to
boycott the session until the government takes steps toward helping
the Tamil minority.
   Premadasa asked lawmakers to narrow their differences and unite
to help eliminate poverty.
   ``You are here because our people have convincingly and
effectively defeated the bullet and enthroned the ballot,'' said
Premadasa, referring to the bloody Feb. 15 general election. At
least 56 people died in balloting and another 1,000, including
several candidates, were killed in the five-week campaign.
   Premadasa's United National Party won 125 of the 225 seats in
Parliament.
   ``I would prefer to call the opposition an alternative party and
not the opposition,'' the president said.
   People's Liberation Front, the radical Sinhalese group trying to
topple the government, had called for a nationwide strike Thursday.
   But most shops and offices were open, government and business
leaders said.
   The Front opposes the government's efforts to end a rebellion by
radical Tamils, who are demanding a separate homeland in the north
and east provinces.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They say they are denied jobs, education and
money for development projects by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75
percent of the population.
   More than 10,000 people have been killed since the fighting began
in 1983.
   In his address to Parliament, Premadasa said he had invited
militant Sinhalese and Tamils to put down their weapons, join the
democratic process and help negotiate a settlement.
   ``The patience of the people is not unlimited,'' said Premadasa,
who was elected to a six-year term in December.
   He has promised to eliminate poverty by giving 1.4 million poor
families $75 a month for two years, beginning next month. The
average annual income in Sri Lanka is $360.

   The federal government on Thursday announced a
$75 million grant program to expand drug treatment services to help
get addicts off the streets faster and reduce the spread of AIDS.
   The funds are designed to help drug treatment centers reduce and
eliminate waiting lists, which in some cities are six months and
longer, said Frederick K. Goodwin, head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration.
   ``Given the fact that approximately one-third of all new AIDS
cases are contracted through use of contaminated intravenous
needles, it is especially critical that the nation's ability to
provide treatment to drug abusers be expanded,'' he said.
   The money will go to public and private nonprofit organizations
that are providing out-patient or residential drug treatment
services where applicants have been waiting more than a month to be
admitted to the program.
   States as well as federally recognized Indian tribes can also
apply for several local drug treatment service providers, Frederick
said.
   The grants are intended to expand treatment services for abuse of
all types of drugs, including those injected intravenously.
   In addition to the new grant program, Frederick's agency, part of
the Department of Health and Human Services, is providing $518
million this fiscal year in block grants to states for substance
abuse treatment and prevention programs, a spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Thursday ratified an
eight-year U.S.-Spanish agreement that calls for withdrawing 72 U.S.
F-16 fighter bombers by 1992 but permits continued use of three
military bases and nine communications posts by the Americans.
   Because the agreement is not a treaty, it does not have to be
ratified by the U.S. Senate.
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez defended the new
agreement against opposition claims it would undermine Spanish
sovereignty and permit entry of U.S. nuclear arms into Spain.
   ``It will guarantee full sovereignty,'' including the ability to
authorize or prohibit entry of U.S. warships in Spanish ports if it
is deemed necessary, he said.
   ``The agreement clears the way for a new relation based on mutual
trust and permits us to view with optimism the future of our
relations with our allied nation,'' Fernandez Ordonez told the 314
deputies in the Cortes, or parliament.
   Spain and the United States first signed a military cooperation
treaty establishing four U.S. bases in Spain in 1953, during the
height of the cold war under the authoritarian rule of Gen.
Francisco Franco.
   After Franco's death in 1975, King Juan Carlos led the country
through a peaceful transition to democracy.
   Of the 314 deputies present at the 4{-hour debate, 279 voted in
favor, 11 voted against it and 24 abstained.
   Spain renounced all economic and military aid in exchange for the
continued U.S. military use of two air bases and a key southern
naval station as well as nine communication posts.
   Chief negotiators Maximo Cajal of Spain and U.S. Ambassador
Reginald Bartholomew signed the agreement on Dec. 1, 1988, ending
the long and sometimes tense negotiations begun in July 1986.

<HEAD>U.S. Inspector: Cruise Ships Cover Up Illnesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many cruise ships fail to report serious outbreaks
of illness at sea, an assistant U.S. surgeon general says.
   One ship in particular is ``consistently misstating'' its
incidence of illness, said Dr. Vernon N. Houk, director of the
Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control, a part of the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   The information has been turned over to a federal attorney for
action, he added.
   A check of records found that ship officers have been reporting
no illnesses to federal sanitation inspectors when in fact they have
had as many as 240 people aboard suffering from diarrhea, Houk said
Wednesday.
   ``This has public health significance. We don't intend to
tolerate it,'' he said. Houk would not reveal the names of the ships
except to say they regularly sail from South Florida.
   Ships are supposed to report diarrheal illnesses among passengers
and crew by radio at least 24 hours before arriving in a U.S. port
in order to help inspectors trace the source of a disease before
passengers fan out across the country.
   The vast majority of the nation's cruise ships adhere to CDC
standards, Houk said.
   Houk, whose charges were made at a public meeting held by the CDC
to discuss health aboard cruise ships, said the problem was
uncovered when inspectors checked the logs of some ships against
their radio reports.
   Another speaker, John Reurs of the International Committee of
Passenger Lines, representing 19 cruise cd would cooperate with any
enforcement.
   Several other cruise officials at the meeting said they did not
know what ships had been falsifying health reports. ``We cooperate
fully with the CDC on all public health questions,'' said Tim
Gallagher of Carnival Cruise Lines.
   In the past, federal officials have publicized the names of ships
that have not cooperated with CDC requirements under the assumption
that bad publicity was more effective and cheaper than a drawn-out
court case.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.4 Billion in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $4.4 billion more in credit
than they paid off in January as consumer debt grew at an annual
rate of 7.9 percent, the government reported Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the January increase followed a
revised increase of $4.3 billion in December and a gain of $4.7
billion in November.
   January's rise in the seasonally adjusted rate of credit growth
was up slightly from a 7.8 percent pace in December but below the
8.5 percent rate in November.
   The increase was held back by slower growth in auto loans and the
category of debt that includes credit cards, while loans for mobile
homes increased after falling sharply in December.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic
health since it accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity.
   In January, auto loans rose by $2.2 billion, a 9.2 percent annual
rate, following a slightly larger $2.4 billion increase during
December.
   Growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards also
was weaker in January, rising by $823 million or at a 5.3 percent
annual rate. That followed a December increase of $1.3 billion that
represented an 8.4 percent rate of growth.
   Mobile home debts, which had declined by $278 million in
December, rose by $82 million in January, a 3.8 percent pace of
growth.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$1.2 billion in January, a 9 percent annual rate of growth, after
having risen $944 million or at a 6.9 percent pace in December.
   Overall, total consumer debt reached a seasonally adjusted $670.6
billion in January, up 8.4 percent from a year earlier.

   The government on Thursday restored
some civil liberties suspended last week during riots over price
increases but said the military would continue patrolling major
cities to prevent new violence.
   The move gives back freedom of the press, the right to gather and
protest in public, and the right to travel inside and out of the
country. It also ends the right of the military to enter homes and
detain suspects without warrants.
   The rights were suspended Feb. 28, one day after rioting broke
out over sharp increases in public transportation fares. The riots
evolved into nationwide demonstrations against a government
austerity program.
   A dust-to-dawn curfew was imposed Feb. 28 but was lifted Monday.
   The government said 256 people died in the violence, the worst in
Venezuela's 30 years of democracy. Unofficial reports put the toll
much higher, and human rights committees in Caracas say at least 30
people are missing.
   The director of the Central Information Office, Pastor Heydra,
said military personnel will continue to control major streets in
Caracas and other cities until ``the situation is totally
normalized.''
   President Carlos Andres Perez vowed to go ahead with his economic
program to meet loan conditions set by international financial
institutions. The country has a $33 billion foreign debt and needs
to obtain loans.
   Price controls were lifted in Venezuela this week, but most shops
were hesitant in implementing new prices.
   ``Maybe next week we'll set new prices,'' said Ernesto Rangel,
owner of a pizza shop. ``We don't want to shock people all at once.''
   Roman Catholic Church leaders urged the government to ensure the
poor alone don't shoulder the ``terrible burden of sacrifices'' of
the foreign debt.
   In a document published Thursday in newspapers, Caracas
Archbishop Jose Ali Lebrun and 20 other priests criticized ``the
widening gap between poor and rich'' in Venezuela and said ``the
luxury of the few has become an insult against the misery of the
masses.''
   ``We remind economic and political leaders that they have a duty
to give examples of austerity and honesty ... so that the terrible
burden of sacrifices the country must make because of its foreign
debt will not be borne by weak and poor sectors alone,'' they said.
   The daily newspaper El Nacional reported that Planning Minister
Miguel Rodriguez said the country plans to buy back a portion of its
foreign debt on secondary markets _ meaning from creditor banks _ at
a discount of up to 75 percent.
   Venezuela's debt, the fourth-largest in Latin America, is being
offered at 25 percent of its value by the banks, said El Nacional.
   Rodriguez did not specify the amount of debt Venezuela planned to
buy back but said the acquisition would be made with reserves of the
Venezuelan central bank, according to El Nacional.
   The effect of the purchase would be to reduce the amount of money
Venezuela would owe, but the amount it could purchase would depend
on how much is available in the central bank's operative reserves.
   The government said the operative reserves were $1.5 billion in
late February, but independent estimates have put the figure at $400
million.

   The number of older women getting mammograms
increased noticeably after Nancy Reagan's breast cancer diagnosis,
researchers said Thursday.
   A survey taken in 33 states by the Centers for Disease Control
found that 38 percent of women age 50 and up questioned in November
and December 1987 said they had received a screening mammogram for
breast cancer within the previous year.
   That was up nearly half again from the 26 percent the survey
found in the first two months of that year.
   Mrs. Reagan's diagnosis for breast cancer occurred in October
1987 when she was first lady. It was one of two events that directed
public attention to the disease that year. In March, April and May
the American Cancer Society conducted a media campaign to promote
screening for breast cancer.
   ``The percentage of women who reported being screened increased
coincident with the ACS ... campaign and again after the diagnosis
of Mrs. Reagan's breast cancer,'' the CDC said.
   Data from the CDC survey ``suggest that the media events and
educational activities were accompanied by increases in screening
mammograms,'' the agency said. It acknowledged there was no
statistical proof of cause and effect.
   The survey did not include women who had mammograms because of a
specific health problem or history, or those who hadn't seen a
doctor for a routine examination at all.
   Medical centers in the United States reported after Mrs. Reagan's
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up. She later was
honored with an American Cancer Society Courage Award for
encouraging women to check for breast cancer.
   The ACS recommends that all women 50 or older have a mammogram
each year, but studies have found that most women in that group have
never had a mammogram.
   Cancer specialists at the CDC and elsewhere say increased use of
mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer, raising
survival rates for patients.
   The cancer society recommends that women between 35 and 40 have
one initial mammogram, and that women 40-49 have one each year or
two.
   Breast cancer, second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths
among women, kills about 40,000 U.S. women each year.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat arrived Thursday
for a two-day visit and was accorded a 21-gun salute as part of
India's acknowledgment of the PLO's declaration of an independent
Palestinian nation.
   The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization warmly
embraced Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and, as part of his treatment
as a head of state, reviewed a military honor guard as a band played
the Palestinian and Indian anthems.
   In a brief conversation with reporters, Arafat said he
anticipated ``fruitful and friendly talks with my old friend,'' a
reference to Gandhi.
   Indian and Palestinian officials would not elaborate on the
nature of talks.
   Arafat came to India after a two-day visit to Pakistan, which
also accorded him head-of-state treatment. He is to leave for
Bangladesh on Friday.
   India was one of the first non-Arab nations to recognize the
PLO's declaration of an independent state last November.
   The declaration was primarily symbolic, since the PLO cannot
operate openly in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where nearly 400 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in a
15-month uprising against Israeli rule.
   The PLO has sought peace negotiations with Israel, but the Jewish
state has maintained its position that Arafat's group is a terrorist
organization and has rebuffed the overtures.
   It was Arafat's fifth official visit to India but the first since
the PLO declaration.
   Although treated warmly on previous trips, this was the first
time he was given head-of-state treatment such as a 21-gun salute.
   Speaking to reporters as Arafat and his 15-man delegation headed
for their cars, Gandhi denied recent Indian newspaper reports that
India was preparing to upgrade its relations with Israel.
   ``We haven't done anything yet. There's nothing in the
pipeline,'' Gandhi said.
   India, which has long expressed solidarity with the Palestinian
cause, does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. The Israelis,
however, maintain a consulate in Bombay.

<HEAD>Hungary Backs Effort on Human Rights Probe in Romania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hungary on Thursday backed a Western effort to
launch a United Nations inquiry into alleged human rights violations
in Warsaw Pact ally Romania.
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission voted 21-7 to adopt a
Swedish-led resolution backed by Hungary and six Western nations.
   The measure expresses concern at ``allegations of serious
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Romania'' and
calls for the appointment of a special U.N. investigator.
   Six Third World nations and communist Cuba voted against the
resolution. Ten other Third World countries abstained, while the
Soviet Union and the three other Soviet Bloc countries in the
43-nation panel did not participate in the vote.
   Hungary and Romania have only observer status in the Human Rights
Commission and thus have no voting rights.
   It was the first time a Soviet Bloc country joined Western
nations in seeking such a move against a Warsaw Pact ally.
   Romania's chief delegate Gheorghe Dolgu called the resolution a
``brutal interference'' in his country's internal affairs and said
Romania regarded the measure as ``null and void.''
   ``We will never accept that models be imposed on us from
outside,'' Dolgu said.
   The resolution specifically refers to growing restrictions on
Romania's ethnic minorities, which include about 1.7 million
Hungarians.
   About 15,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled
to Hungary in the past 12 months. The outflow increased after
authorities disclosed plans for ``rural consolidation'' that would
mean razing thousands of villages.
   Dolgu said Hungary masterminded the resolution and charged its
Warsaw Pact ally with pursuing revisionist intentions aimed at
``changing frontiers established by peace treaties.''
   Romanians, he said, are familiar with such intentions. It was a
reference to a wartime deal between Nazi Germany and Hungary under
which Transylvania, the Romanian region that includes most of the
Hungarian minority, became part of Hungary. Romania, also an ally of
the Nazis' until 1944, recovered Transylvania after the war.
   ``It is under the pretext of the alleged right to protect certain
minorities that we had to go through direct aggression and
dismemberment,'' Dolgu said. ``The resolution aims once again at
arousing nationalistic and chauvinist expressions and to destabilize
Romania.''

<HEAD>Japan Tells U.S. That Aid to Metal Plant in Libya Stopped Last Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
the State Department joined Thursday in asserting there was no
evidence that Japanese firms were directly involved in a chemical
weapons plant in Libya.
   ``Not that I know,'' Carlucci told reporters. ``When I was in the
government we had no indication whatsoever of any such diversion.''
   A State Department official said, meanwhile: ``We have no
information indicating Japanese firms were directly involved in the
Libyan chemical weapons plant itself.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japanese
firms were involved in a nearby metal fabrications facility, and
that Japan Steel Works was the prime contractor.
   However, the official said, ``the Japanese government has
informed us that as of last summer Japanese firms ceased all
involvement with that facility.''
   Denials were also issued in Tokyo by the Japanese government and
by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which according to a published
report had a team of 50 technicians and engineers at the plant
complex in the desert south of Libya.
   The company is involved in a proposed joint venture with the
United States to build a jet fighter, the FSX. The deal was
negotiated during the Reagan administration, in which Carlucci was
defense secretary, and is now under review by the Bush
administration.
   Carlucci said the ``memorandum of understanding'' that would
govern the program would be signed with the Japanese government.
   ``We have absolutely no instance of any compromise of technology
by the Japanese government,'' he said. ``And the Japanese government
will be accountable.''
   Still, the report on alleged involvement by Mitsubishi in Libya
raised new concerns in Congress about the proposed joint airplane
venture. A report by the defense and commerce departments to
President Bush was due on Friday.
   The State Department official said an investigation by the
Japanese government disclosed several Japanese firms had supplied
equipment to Japan Steel Works as subcontractors and that Japanese
firms exported equipment to the metal fabrication facility through
third countries.
   But, the official said, the Japanese government said all such
involvement with the facility ended last summer.
   ``Our consultation with the Japanese government concerning the
Libyan chemical weapons program has been positive and
constructive,'' the official said.
   Libya, meanwhile, has denied it was trying to develop chemical
weapons and said the plant was engaged in the manufacture of
pharmaceuticals.
   On Capitol Hill, there were calls for Congress to ban from
American markets products made by foreign firms found to have helped
build the suspected chemical weapons plant, and for Bush to abandon
the proposed joint airplane venture.
   In Japan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Thursday
that ``I can now confirm that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has never
been engaged in the export of equipment or dispatch of engineers as
reported in The Detroit News.'' Mitsubishi also denied the reports.
   The Detroit newspaper on Wednesday had quoted unidentified
congressional and Defense Department sources as saying they were
told of Mitsubishi's alleged participation in the Libyan project by
intelligence sources in Washington.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ``we continue to
investigate this matter.'' He added that ``the Japanese government
has given us assurances that there is no intention of any Japanese
involvement with the Libyan project and has denied emphatically any
involvement by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' technicians or engineers
in the Libyan chemical project.''
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, among those seeking action by Congress
and the president, said that the nation ``must awaken to the fact
that we are naive to expect the Japanese to do anything other than
what is in their economic interests.''
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said companies involved in the
Libyan plant have ``deliberately sold out the interests of the West
in helping (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi and they deserve a
corporate life sentence.
   ``My bill would require the CIA to supply the names of the
companies that have participated in the construction of the Libyan
gas and bomb facilities. ... They should not have access to our
markets if they work to make chemical weapons that may one day be
used by terrorists to gas American or Israeli citizens,'' Hunter
said.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: done that.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In early 1986 Eastern's former CEO Frank Borman said the company
had to be ``fixed, sold or tanked.'' With the IAM at that time in
1986 refusing to join all other employees in the effort to fix the
company, by agreeing like all other employees did to 20 percent pay
cuts at that time, Eastern only narrowly avoided extinction by Texas
Air's purchase of it.
   Later that year I joined Eastern and we put forward a six-point
plan to ``fix'' Eastern, if you will, to turn it around and only one
of those points involved changes in labor costs.
   The other points involved making Eastern an on-time airline for
the first time in its history, for expanding its consumer
reservations' reach into travel agencies and we were clearly
successful in both of those objectives.
   But the labor problem obviously took front stage. And one of the
reasons for that is a federal agency called the National Mediation
Board, that literally threw all pretense of neutrality to the wind,
kept Eastern locked up in a fruitless, destructive mediation process
for 17 months while our losses grew alarmingly.
   Meanwhile, some of our critics, some of the union leaders engaged
in what can only be described as a vicious, vicious attack on the
company and its management. An organized litigation and
disinformation campaign to smear the reputation of Texas Air, of
Eastern and its management _ particularly Frank Lorenzo _ and to
thwart our very efforts to provide working capital for the company
through some liquidity programs.
   You know, if you step back, the last several weeks have really
seen the real issues at Eastern Airlines in my view unfortunately
pushed to the background of the public debate. Instead, some have
framed the issues in large global terms, almost defying rational
boundaries.
   They have tried to paint Frank Lorenzo _ who happens to be, by
the way, the longest sitting CEO in the airline business today with
16 continuous years in that role _ as some kind of corporate
villain, ignoring the fact that his efforts over the last 26 years
in this business have created more aviation jobs than any other
individual.
   Texas International in the early 1970's had 2,500 employees, and
up until last week, 60,000 employees were under the Texas Air
umbrella, for those many years of building, not destroying.
   There has not been an honest debate of the issues that face
Eastern Airlines. For example, the company's offer to the IAM to
guarantee all jobs for five years, all jobs for five years, to pay
unskilled workers in a retraining program, full pay while they get
retrained to learn how to be technicians and mechanics so they could
earn twice what they're earning under the training program. That
hasn't been debated.
   While trying to make this appear to be some kind of a national
labor struggle between good and evil, no one is even seriously
debating the fact that the pilots' union leadership decision to
cripple the company defies rationality.
   Consider that their members average nearly $100,000 a year in
wages and benefits, and the company proposed no reductions in base
pay. We proposed job guarantees for five years, guarantees that
there would be no sale of additional aircraft at Eastern Airlines.
That there would be protection on their pay in the event the company
was not successful and had to seek reorganization under the
bankruptcy laws.
   This proposal from a company that in the last 10 years has lost
one billion, five hundred million dollars, and that last year lost
$460 million.
   The pilot union decision to ground Eastern's planes has been
described, I think accurately, as professional suicide. It almost
defies explanation, even in the context of a hard fought labor
battle.
   ALPA's leaders and financial adviser, however, have said publicly
for some time that they are prepared for bankruptcy, and, in fact,
welcome, actually welcome a bankruptcy process so that they could
achieve their stated goal of seeking control of the airline.
   The pilot's union action has forced the bankruptcy filing they
say they are prepared for. But however prepared the financial
adviser and the coterie of lawyers may be, and the pilot union
leaders whose salaries will continue, how ever prepared they are for
bankruptcy, I wonder, I wonder, how prepared the Eastern pilots and
their families are for that process. How prepared can those whose
livelihood and standards of living and family security depend on
flying Eastern's 200 plus airplanes, most of which sit idle today?
How prepared can they be?
   When the giddiness and emotional solidarity wears off and the
picket line is no longer the self-deluded battle between good and
evil, how will the real issues be resolved?
   As a management not only with a personal stake in the outcome,
and I'm not ashamed to say, a strong emotional attachment to this
company, but also with clear fiduciary obligations to the
constituencies of the corporation including our investors, including
our creditors, we tried mightily to keep Eastern from bankruptcy.
But we also feel very strongly that we will be able to protect those
interests of the creditors and those interests of investors and
shareholders in the process that we have been driven to.
   We expect and intend that all creditors will be fully safe, that
investors will realize a value and a fair return, and that a
restructured and revitalized, although somewhat smaller Eastern
Airlines will be flying and will be serving the traveling public for
many years to come. And most importantly, to me at least, is
providing many more jobs to the Eastern professional men and women
who have had the cloud of failure hanging over their heads for many
years and who have brought the airline in recent months to the
number one position in on-time performance. And I think they'll be
able to do it again.

   Federal prosecutors urged the jury in the Fawaz
Younis sky piracy trial to find the defendant guilty and to reject
his claim that he led the hijacking of a plane from Beirut in 1985
on orders from the Lebanese militia to which he belonged.
   Hijacking, said prosecutor Karen Morrissette, ``is a violation of
international law.''
   ``The defendant cannot hijack an airplane, then come into a
courtroom in this country and say, `Well, someone told me to do it.'
And it's alright,'' she said.
   The hijackers were trying to deliver a political message, the
prosecutor told the jury.
   ``You can send a message to that hijacker,'' she said.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent in the case, considered a test
of a 1984 statute asserting ``long-arm'' jurisdiction for the United
States over the taking of American hostages abroad.
   The prosecution suffered a blow earlier in the day as U.S.
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. blocked testimony from a
government lawyer seeking to rebut the defendant's claim he was just
following military orders in hijacking a plane from Beirut in 1985.
   With the jury out of the room, W. Hays Parks, chief of the
International Affairs Division for the U.S. Army's advocate general,
argued that Younis' defense did not meet the standards of
international or military law.
   Unable to introduce Parks' testimony as evidence, federal
prosecutors gave the Robinson proposed instructions for the jury,
and Morrissette indicated in her closing argument that the judge had
accepted the major points that Parks sought to present.
   Seeking to appear for the government as an expert witness, Parks
said that Lebanon's Amal militia, to which Younis belonged, was not
a legitimate military organization because its combatants did not
wear uniforms and attacked civilians.
   Parks, who heard Younis testify earlier this week, said that the
defendant ought to have known that hijacking a plane with civilians
aboard was a violation of international law.
   ``If a soldier receives an illegal order, he has not only a right
but a duty to disobey that order,'' said Parks, who is a colonel in
the Marine Corps Reserves.
   After listening to Parks, Robinson said ``I respect the expertise
of Colonel Parks, but he will not testify before the jury.''
   Robinson said that he, not Parks, would instruct the jury on the
law in the case, and anticipated an appeal from government lawyers
if Younis is acquitted on the defense of following a superior's
order.
   ``I may well be wrong,'' he said. ``I have been wrong before.''
   ``If it gets to the Supreme Court, it will get there,'' said
Robinson.
   Government attorneys said that the ruling was not unexpected, and
gave Robinson a proposed written jury instruction containing Park's
arguments.
   The path taken by the defense, arguing that Younis was just
following orders, appeared to cause consternation among officials
from the justice and defense departments and intelligence agencies
who have been attending the trial.
   Defense counsel Francis D. Carter put his client on the stand for
two days.
   Younis testified Wednesday that the Lebanese Amal militia was in
a ``state of war'' when its military commander, Aqil Hamiyya,
ordered him to hijack the plane.
   ``Hijacking a plane is a wartime operation,'' said Younis.
   Younis said he was ``not proud'' of his actions. ``But I was
carrying out an order given to me by my military commander. I was
trying to serve my country in the best way I knew how,'' he said.
``I believe in actions that serve my people and my country.''
   Prosecutors have produced five witnesses who identified Younis as
the man who led four other heavily armed men aboard Royal Jordanian
Airlines Flight 402 in Beirut on June 11, 1985.
   Younis was arrested on Sept. 13, 1987, by FBI agents who lured
him aboard a yacht in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The defense counsel has argued that FBI agents coerced a
confession out of Younis during four days aboard a Navy munitions
ship while he was suffering from seasickness and two broken wrists.
The hairline fractures were discovered after Younis was flown to the
United States and arraigned, and an appeals court has ruled that the
confession was valid.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
predicted Thursday that in new budget talks the Bush administration
would agree to only ``a minimalist approach'' to deficit reduction
this year _ but would later open the door for tax increases.
   Sen. James Sasser, at a press breakfast hours before the start of
talks on the fiscal 1990 budget, reasserted his position that tax
increases were needed to reduce the deficit.
   And he said that President Bush's budget director, Richard
Darman, privately agreed _ an assertion that Darman said was untrue.
   ``Privately, Darman believes we're going to have to have revenues
to run this government,'' said Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Darman is ``a very bright guy; he knows the score ... that if
you're going to have any meaningful reduction in the deficit in the
short term, you're going to need some additional revenues,'' Sasser
said.
   Darman had told him privately, he said, ``at some juncture, he
wouldn't be averse to taking new revenues to the president, but not
this year.''
   In the meantime, Sasser predicted the administration would insist
on ``a minimalist approach'' to the fiscal 1990 budget, which under
the Gramm-Rudman law is supposed to reduce the deficit to $100
billion or less.
   ``They're going to try to meet these targets at the front end,
with overly optimistic economic assumptions and pray that the
markets will swallow it,'' he said.
   Meeting the more stringent future targets of the law, which calls
for a balanced budget by fiscal 1993, would be left for next year,
he said. And Congress would in the end go along with putting things
off, he predicted.
   ``What else can we do? If we pass new revenues, the president
will veto them and give us a lot of political heat.''
   At a session with reporters later in the day, Darman disagreed
with how Sasser characterized his position.
   ``I can't imagine he would have said that,'' Darman said. Asked
whether he was more favorable to a tax increase than his public
statements have indicated, Darman said, ``Maybe that's what he would
like to believe.''
   He said the White House and congressional leaders have already
discussed sharing the blame if stringent and unpopular actions
become necessary in the deficit-reduction package.
   Darman said that he and Bush continued to oppose any new taxes,
although he conceded that when talks got down to fine detail _
probably not in the two-week round of discussions beginning Thursday
_ there might be some small flexibility.
   As an example of what the administration might accept, he said a
Customs Service fee was scheduled to decline, and Congress might
want to keep it instead of losing $200 million in revenue.
   But in terms of accepting a major tax boost, he said, ``I do not
foresee the circumstance where we will be in that position.''
   Darman also said he found good news in a Congressional Budget
Office report released Thursday, which projected the deficit next
year at $131 billion, or $40 billion higher than White House
estimates.
   Most of the difference was because of a $22 billion disagreement
over how to account in the budget for Bush's plan to bail out the
savings and loan system. If that dispute were put aside, the deficit
would still be below the threshold at which the Gramm-Rudman law
would require automatic spending cuts.

   The Bush administration, spurred by the bloody
riots in Venezuela, is putting together a new approach to the heavy
debt burden being carried by Third World countries, a problem that
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has called ``perhaps the most
difficult'' facing the new administration.
   The new plan, or at least some details of what it will contain,
could be revealed as early as Friday, when Brady is scheduled to
address a private conference on Third World debt at the State
Department.
   After winning the election, President Bush said he favored taking
a ``whole new look'' at U.S. policy on Third World debt and he
ordered Brady to launch a review at the Treasury Department.
   Bush's comments have raised hopes that the new administration
will respond favorably to pleas from debtor countries that they face
economic and political chaos without major debt relief.
   Those pleas gained new urgency last week when more than 300
people died in riots in Venezuela sparked by government imposition
of tough austerity measures to please creditors.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that a
White House review of proposals being generated by the Treasury
Department had been underway for several days and was continuing.
   Other officials indicated that Brady would likely begin outlining
the new approach at Friday's conference and would follow the speech
with a more detailed report to Congress in the coming weeks.
   According to sources who have been involved in discussions with
Treasury Department officials, the administration plan will
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the
Third World debt they hold.
   To encourage this debt reduction, the administration is
considering a variety of enticements, including some type of loan
guarantees on the reduced level of debt that would still be held by
the banks.
   Also under consideration are a proposal to increase the size of
tax deductions banks could take for losses on Latin loans and a
proposal to lower the amount of money banks are forced to hold in
reserve to cover loan losses.
   But it is the loan guarantees that are attracting the most
attention. These guarantees might take the form of assurances that
the 151-nation World Bank or its sister institution, the
International Monetary Fund, would make debt or interest payments if
a debtor country defaulted.
   A Bush administration strategy emphasizing debt forgiveness, even
on a limited and voluntary basis, would mark a major change from the
Reagan administration's approach, which became known as the Baker
plan after then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   Baker's strategy emphasized new lending on the part of banks, the
IMF and the World Bank to countries that agreed to adopt economic
reforms. The idea was that the new money would spur the debtor
countries' economies, making them more creditworthy.
   In reality under the Baker plan, commercial banks lent relatively
little in new funds and the debtor countries wound up paying out far
more in interest and principal than they were receiving in new
financing.
   The Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. estimates that the foreign debt of
the 15 principal borrowers, including 10 Latin American countries,
rose to $505 billion last year, with interest the countries had to
pay totalling $42 billion.
   Baker, who is now secretary of state, did lend support to some
limited debt-reduction measures, but he rejected a variety of more
ambitious plans offered by such people as Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
and James Robinson III, the chairman of the American Express Co.
   The proposals under review by the Bush administration were
praised Thursday by economists as a more realistic approach to the
debt problem.
   ``The reality of the situation is that something different has to
be done. The idea of throwing good money after bad just hasn't
worked,'' said Cynthia Latta, a financial economist with Data
Resources Inc. ``It has just left them deeper in debt and is leading
to great political instability in the debtor countries.''
   Brady, referring to the administration review last week, said
that the urgency of the problem had not been lost on the new
administration.
   ``Perhaps the most difficult of the major issues facing us at the
outset of the Bush administration is the problem of Third World
debt,'' Brady said in a speech to the American Bankers Association.
``Unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loan
industry crisis, this is not a problem that we in the U.S. have the
power or the resources to solve by ourselves.''
   The debt owed by all Third World countries totaled $1.32 trillion
at the end of 1988, up from $800 billion in 1982, the year the debt
crisis first erupted with the announcement by Mexico that it could
not meet its obligations.
   The largest debtor country is Brazil, with $110 billion owed,
followed by Mexico with $107 billion owed. Other big debtors are
Argentina, $50 billion, and Venezuela, $33 billion.

   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who once
said he would not accept government money for his Republican
presidential campaign, has received more than $10.1 million, setting
a new record, the Federal Election Commission said.
   The commission gave Robertson $243,296 this week, boosting him
over the $10.1 million record set in 1984 by then-President Reagan's
re-election campaign, said Scott Moxley, a spokesman for the
commission.
   Reagan's 1984 allotment later was reduced to about $9.75 million,
Moxley said.
   Candidates who meet certain fund-raising and vote-gathering
thresholds are eligible to get matching money from the federal
Treasury to help pay for their campaigns in the presidential
primaries.
   The major parties' presidential nominees then have their entire
campaigns paid for by the taxpayers, with the candidates receiving
equal funding. Last year Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis received $46.1 million each for their general election
campaigns. That money is separate from the money provided during the
primaries.
   Dukakis received $9 million in matching funds for his campaign in
the primaries and Bush received nearly $8.4 million.
   Among the other 1988 candidates, Democrat Jesse Jackson got
almost $8 million, Republican Bob Dole received $7.6 million, and
Republican Jack Kemp received almost $6 million.
   In all, the federal government paid nearly $66.7 million in
matching funds to 15 candidates in last year's primary campaigns.
   Early in the campaign Robertson had said that he was
philosophically opposed to government funding for presidential
campaigns and that he would not accept it.
   However, after a string of losses, Robertson's campaign got into
a financial pinch, and he took the government money.
   In year-end papers filed with the Federal Election Commission,
Robertson's campaign reported that it was nearly half a million
dollars in debt.
   In another presidential funding matter, the commission on
Thursday ordered the campaign of former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. du
Pont IV, a Republican, to repay $23,254 to the Treasury. The
commission ruled that costs of a central telephone bank caused the
du Pont campaign to exceed the spending limits set for the campaigns
during the Iowa caucuses.

<TEXT>
   Three army officers have been
arrested in the massacre of 10 peasants, and at least one will be
indicted, judiciary and government sources said Thursday.
   An indictment would mark an unprecedented effort to apply
civilian rule to the military, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Another officer _ a colonel and commander of an army brigade _
has been removed from his command because of his alleged link to the
killings, they said.
   The arrests followed strong pressure from the United States to
investigate civilian killings, including the peasant massacre Sept.
21 in the hamlet of San Francisco, four miles south of San Sebastian.
   ``What we all want to avoid is punishing only the scapegoats,''
Judge Alcides Guandique said in an interview. Guandique will
announce this month who will be tried by a jury in the case.
   Sources said at least one of the three officers arrested will be
among those indicted.
   The United Nations, local and international human rights groups
and churches have blamed government security forces for the torture
and murder of thousands of leftists during the 9-year-old war
guerrillas have waged against the government.
   Eight soldiers have been convicted, six for killing U.S.
citizens. No officer has ever been tried, and the army has denied
any involvement in death squad killings.
   According to witnesses and relatives, the peasant massacre
occurred when soldiers from the Jiboa battalion marched into San
Francisco, home to about 15 families. They detained most of the
residents in a one-room school and accused them of collaborating
with guerrillas, witnesses and relatives said.
   Working from a list, the troops selected seven men and three
women, took them to a nearby ravine and killed them with explosives
and rifle fire, according to documents and witness accounts.
   The army at first said the dead were guerrillas killed in an army
ambush. It later said the victims were detainees killed in a
guerrilla ambush while being marched away.
   Vice President Dan Quayle visited El Salvador last month and told
the high command that El Salvador's tradition of military immunity
for human rights abuses must end, and that the San Francisco killers
must be punished.
   The United States provides El Salvador, a country of about 5
million, with about $1.5 million a day in economic and military aid.
   ``What do we have to say? No convicted officer, no more aid?
That's too blunt. But Quayle was unambiguously talking about
continued aid,'' said a high U.S. official on condition of anonymity.
   The army version of the peasant killings is about to change,
according to government and judiciary officials with access to
preliminary conclusions of an army tribunal investigating the
slayings simultaneously with Guandique's inquiry.
   ``Remove from your head any doubt that they might have been
killed by anyone but the soldiers,'' said a government official.
   Four Jiboa soldiers _ a corporal and three privates _ were
charged with murder by Guandique's predecessor, but Guandique said
there is no indication the four did the killing.
   ``They are kind of scapegoats, unlucky enough to have been
recognized,'' the judge said. He said he has taken sworn testimony
from about 20 soldiers present the day of the killings.
   The three arrested officers were in San Francisco on Sept. 21,
according to military sources and Carlos Castellon, a lawyer for one
of the officers, Lt. Arnoldo Vasquez.
   Castellon and the sources identified the other officers as
Intelligence Maj. Mauricio Beltran and Lt. Manuel Galvez.
   Col. Jose Chavez Caceres, commander of the 5th Army Brigade and
the Jiboa battalion, has been removed from his post but is not
directly implicated in the massacre, military sources said.
   ``His responsibility appears to be limited to believing his
subordinates,'' said one source.
   1988 was the first year in five that number of civilian killings
rose from the previous year. The Roman Catholic Church's legal aid
office says 261 people were killed last year, 67 percent more than
in 1987.
   The church blamed security forces for 92 of the killings and
death squads for 60. Guerrillas fighting the government were blamed
for 44 summary executions.

<HEAD>Walter Reed Chief Dies After Parachute Accident</HEAD>

   A two-star Army general who commanded the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington died earlier this week
after sustaining injuries in a parachute accident in Honduras, the
Pentagon said Thursday.
   Maj. Gen. James H. Rumbaugh, 49, was being evacuated by airplane
from the Soto Cano Air Base outside Comayugua, Honduras, on
Wednesday night when he suffered an apparent heart attack, the
Pentagon said in a prepared statement.
   A day earlier, on Tuesday, Rambaugh suffered apparent abdominal
injuries while making a parachute jump from a helicopter, officials
said. The general was in Honduras participating in the annual Ahuas
Tara 89 exercise with a forward surgical deployment team, the
Pentagon added.
   ``Maj. Gen. Rumbaugh, an experienced parachutist, had
participated in a parachute jump with members of the 44th Medical
Brigade at about 7:30 a.m. on March 7,'' the Pentagon said in a
prepared statement.
   ``He went about his normal duties immediately after the jump.
Several hours later he sought medical attention for abdominal
pains.''
   According to defense sources, who insisted on anonymity,
physicians in Honduras discovered bleeding around Rumbaugh's
abdominal wall and recommended he be flown to the Brooke Army
Medical Center.
   ``Preliminary information indicates that the general suffered
cardiac arrest on the airplane and physicians were unable to
resuscitate him,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.
   ``An autopsy will be performed at Walter Reed to determine the
cause of death.''
   One source said the plane carrying Rumbaugh was diverted to
Cancun, Mexico, when the two-star general failed to respond to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The plane landed in Cancun around 8
p.m. Wednesday, but Rumbaugh was pronounced dead a few minutes
later, the official said.
   His body was then flown on to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio
Wednesday night.
   ``Gen. Rumbaugh ... was a 24-year Army veteran whose assignments
included one as surgeon for the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg,
N.C., the home of the 82nd Airborne Division,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``The general was jumping (in Honduras) as part of his regional
oversight responsibilities as commander of Walter Reed.''
   The Pentagon declined to elaborate. But several Pentagon
officials said it was unusual for a two-star general to participate
in parachute jumps and that Rumbaugh would have been under no
requirement to perform such jumps.
   Rumbaugh took command of the Army's most prestigious hospital
center last August. A native of Washington, Pa., Rumbaugh earned a
degree in history from Thiel College and then earned his medical
degree from the Thomas Jefferson University School of Medicine in
Philadelphia.
   He joined the Army in June 1963 while completing his studies at
Thomas Jefferson and then served his internship and a residency in
psychiatry at Walter Reed.
   Rumbaugh spent his first decade in the Army working in a variety
of psychiatry posts, including a tour in Vietnam with the 1st
Cavalry Division. He later worked as an alcohol and drug control
officer before taking command of the medical organization serving
the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg.
   Rumbaugh served from June 1985 to July 1986 as the deputy
commander at Walter Reed, then two years as the director of
professional services for the Army surgeon general before assuming
command of Walter Reed.
   Rumbaugh earned his first star as a brigadier general in
September 1986 and his second last October. His decorations included
the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal
with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army Commendation Medal and the Expert
Field Medical Badge.
   He is survived by his wife, Norma Jean, and four children _ John,
Kate, Nell and James. The Pentagon said funeral arrangements had not
been completed.

   The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected
the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary,
delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his
term.
   The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate
focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his
business dealings with defense contractors.
   It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted
to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done
so early in a new administration.
   Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the
roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate
galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats
as the roll was called.
   ``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not
confirmed,'' Quayle intoned after the vote.
   Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of
the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to
declare her opposition. She said her ``most serious concerns'' were
over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an
arms control negotiator. She also expressed doubts that he would pay
enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military.
   Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past
tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before
the roll was called.
   ``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower,'' said Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   ``His head is high, his voice is strong,'' Warner said. ``He
asked me to convey thanks _ in his words _ to the troops who rallied
to his support.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair
damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate
and President Bush.
   ``I know what's in my heart and in my mind,'' he told reporters.
``I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this
doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president.''
   Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after
acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an
extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove
he could abstain from drinking.
   There was no doubt about the outcome as the Senate went through
the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours
before the roll call.
   The last few undecided senators declared their positions. Sen.
John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower. Sen. James
M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination.
   Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the
decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
   ``When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in
behind him,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If necessary, we'll come up
with a (new) candidate very rapidly.''
   Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a
replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a
former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Scowcroft replied ``No'' when asked this morning if he was in
line for the Pentagon job.
   ``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and
the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on
the tip of their tongue,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``But the time has not come,'' he added. ``The time will come as
soon as the vote is completed. We will wait until then.''
   The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and
one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly
in that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats
declared for Tower or leaning his way.
   Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the
nomination go all the way to a vote.
   Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and
his three daughters had coffee together. He then continued a review
of various administration proposals.
   ``I hope and believe we can work together on important matters,''
Mitchell said. ``The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting
effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my
heart that I hope this will be the case.''
   The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a
crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided
Democratic senators announced they would vote ``no.''
   Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote ``yes,''
joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision.
   Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
all said they would vote against Tower.
   Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him
with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he
drinks heavily, leading to ``a recklessness in the social sense''
entirely different from his behavior when sober.

<HEAD>Zenith Welcomes Government Plan to Monitor TV Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. on Thursday welcomed
the government's decision to monitor television imports from Mexico
and Malaysia, saying the action could help curb the dumping of
imported TVs at less than fair-market value.
   Acting at Zenith's request, the Commerce Department last week
agreed to monitor imports of complete and incomplete color
televisions from the two countries.
   Zenith President and Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said the
monitoring program should help reduce schemes in which manufacturers
in the Far East who have been found guilty of dumping then evade
anti-dumping penalties by establishing assembly operations in other
countries, such as Mexico and Malaysia.
   The monitoring program, which will last up to a year, will
determine whether there has been evidence of dumping from the two
countries sufficient to warrant a full-scale anti-dumping
investigation.
   Pearlman said color TV imports from Mexico and Malaysia are
almost as large as those from Japan, Korea and Taiwan combined.
   ``Mexico has become the principal source of color TVs in the U.S.
and imports from Malaysia have now surpassed those from Japan,'' he
said.
   Zenith in December had asked the government to monitor imports
from Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the
Philippines.
   The department said it decided to monitor imports from Mexico and
Malaysia ``because it has reason to believe or suspect that an
extraordinary pattern of persistent, injurious dumping exists and is
causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic TV industry.''
   The agency said the request to monitor imports from the other
countries did not ``meet the statutory threshold for establishing a
monitoring program.''
   Anti-dumping orders now in place cover TVs from Japan, Korea and
Taiwan, and color picture tubes from Japan, Korea, Canada and
Singapore, Zenith said.

   Declaring ``I am an alcoholic,'' Kitty Dukakis said
Thursday she is eager to go through the Alcoholics Anonymous program
along with her family and hopes others will follow her example in
seeking help.
   The wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis also said she had a drinking
problem long before encountering the stresses of her husband's
public life, and she added, ``I don't blame the (presidential)
campaign for my being an alcoholic.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, spoke at a news conference two days after
completing a month-long rehabilitation program at Edgehill Newport
in Rhode Island.
   She said her drinking became a serious problem in the three
``terribly painful and lonely'' months after her husband's defeat.
   ``Any crisis could have led to the drinking,'' she said. ``The
campaign was a very positive experience. The only problem is that we
lost.''
   Her husband said, ``I will do whatever is most helpful to her.''
   Accompanying Mrs. Dukakis were her husband and her father, Harry
Ellis Dickson, retired associate conductor of the Boston Pops.
   Trembling slightly and wearing a smile that appeared forced at
first, Mrs. Dukakis read a statement thanking the thousands of
people from around the world, many of them recovering alcoholics,
who wrote with encouraging words.
   She said she would have preferred to keep her crisis private, but
added: ``My hope is that by being public, I might encourage others
to seek help through programs like the one I entered at Edgehill
Newport and the extraordinary fellowship of AA.''
   Offshoots of AA, such as Al-Anon, are also available for family
and friends of alcoholics. Asked if the family would get such help,
she said, ``We're (all) going to be part of the program.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said she was ready to resume her speaking career and
noted she would continue working on a book.
   Mrs. Dukakis conquered a 26-year addiction to diet pills in 1982.
But friends said they knew her only as a social drinker who took an
occasional glass of wine.
   Earlier, Mrs. Dukakis responded to letters from well-wishers with
a letter of her own on the front page of Thursday's USA Today.
   ``I have always believed that every experience we have in life
provides an opportunity for growth and learning,'' she wrote. ``The
thousands of letters I received from you contributed to my growth
and I have drawn strength from all that you have shared with me.''

   A House-Senate committee exploring rest home

heard gripping testimony from a ``survivor'' of a California home in
which seven bodies were found buried in the yard.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., released a report attributing
problems at the homes in part to neglect by states and the decision
about 25 years ago to move away from putting mentally ill persons
into institutions.
   Pepper and the joint panel of the House and Senate aging
committees focused their attention on so-called ``board and care
homes.''
   In different states, the homes are called everything from rest
homes, group or personal care homes, to domiciliaries. They provide
rooms, meals and help with daily routines _ but not regular medical
care such as provided by nursing homes.
   John Sharp, 64, testified that he was a ``survivor'' of the
unlicensed Sacramento, Calif., home run by Dorothy Puente. Seven
bodies were found buried in Puente's yard, and she was charged last
November with murder.
   ``I often wonder why I was spared a terrible fate at the Puente
home,'' Sharp said.
   He recalled seeing her going through residents' mail and
wondering why residents seemed to be disappearing from the home.
   He said a pivotal moment came when he refused to allow her to
begin receiving and cashing his government checks.
   ``I told her that those checks were my lifeline and I couldn't
trust them to anyone but myself. I didn't turn over my Social
Security checks to her and, looking back, that's probably what saved
my life,'' he said.
   The report released by Pepper was prepared by the House Select
Committee on Aging's health subcommittee, of which he is chairman.
Many of the report's conclusions echoed those of a similar study
released Wednesday night by the General Accounting Office.
   Pepper's report termed board and care homes ``a national
tragedy.''
   ``We found that most of the one million elderly, disabled and
mentally ill persons who reside in board and care homes are being
warehoused in understaffed, underegulated, shoddy and unsafe
facilities,'' Pepper said.
   The report identified many board and care residents as former
state mental hospital inhabitants who were released in the 1960s as
part of a push to place such patients in community settings.
   The panel also heard a scratchy, secretly-recorded tape of an
Alabama board and care operator slapping a resident, and describing
how she had shot a woman for pulling her wig off.
   The unidentified operator was described by Jefferson County,
Ala., ombudsman Julie Oetting at the hearing as a ``convicted
murderer.''
   Earlier, Pepper, 88, narrated slides of residents bound to
wheelchairs and lying on floors, and homes without proper fire
safety equipment. In Maryland, he said, an owner continued to house
11 residents in a burnt-out home without adequate fire safety
equipment.
   Board and care homes typically serve many residents who rely on
Supplemental Security Income to pay the bills.
   New Jersey attorney David Lazarus and Rep. James Florio, D-N.J.,
used the analogy of a dog in a kennel to describe the lack of public
commitment to rest home residents.
   ``On average, it costs $11 per day to board a 70-pound dog in New
Jersey. Astonishingly, New Jersey board and care residents dependent
upon SSI receive a low of $11.30 to a high of just under $16 for
their lodging, meals, and care in a board and care home,'' Florio
said.
   ``And in states that do not supplement the federal SSI amount,
the daily rates are even lower,'' he said.
   Barbara Jameson of the National Association of Residential Care
Facilities said in an interview that she hoped the hearing would not
convey the impression that the mistreatment was widespread.
   ``I really don't believe there is widespread abuse,'' she said.
``I think there is far more abuse in biological families,
unfortunately, than in licensed care homes.''

<HEAD>Bush Vows Quick Start On Long-Term Cleanup Of Nuclear Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday vowed to ``waste no
time'' starting a massive cleanup of tons of radioactive waste and
widespread soil contamination from the Energy Department's 12-state
nuclear weapons complex.
   At a swearing-in ceremony for Energy Secretary James D. Watkins,
the president said the department's top priority is modernizing the
weapons plants, which have badly deteriorated and, in some cases,
been forced to shut down.
   ``This task is critical,'' Bush told an audience of several
hundred Energy Department employees. He added that the environmental
cleanup also was important.
   ``These problems developed over time and they'll be fully solved
only over time, but we'll waste no time getting started on fixing
these problems,'' Bush said.
   The weapons complex _ including nuclear reactors, processing,
manufacturing and assembly plants and laboratories _ build and test
the Pentagon's nuclear arsenal, which is a vital element in the
nation's defense strategy.
   The department in the waning days of the Reagan administration
issued a broad-brush plan for spending $81 billion over the next 21
years to modernize and begin cleaning up the weapons complex. Bush
has not explicitly endorsed the plan.
   Watkins said his main goal was to instill a new, more responsible
attitude in Energy Department workers that would lead to sounder
practices in the nuclear field.
   ``Nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who
control it,'' he said. ``This, then, is exactly what I ask of my
department: a commitment to excellence.
   ``So I ask you to help me forge in the workplace a culture that
rejects the mediocre and substandard.''
   Watkins was confirmed by the Senate last week and has moved
quickly to begin developing a comprehensive strategy for dealing
with the nuclear weapons problem. His department, however, is still
lacking Bush appointees to key positions.
   The White House announced Thursday that Bush intends to nominate
John C. Tuck to be under secretary of energy, the No. 3 job,
replacing Donna R. Fitzpatrick. Tuck served in several posts in the
Reagan administration, including director of the chief of staff's
office during the administration's final six months.
   Bush last month said he planned to nominate former Rep. Henson
Moore of Louisiana as deputy energy secretary, the No. 2 position,
but no confirmation hearing has been set because the nomination has
not been forwarded to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, committee staffer Nancy Blush said Thursday.
   Watkins has circulated a memo to department employees around the
country spelling out some of his priorities, including developing
five-year objectives for waste cleanup at each of the nuclear
weapons sites, department spokeswoman Christina Sankey said.
   Other priorities mentioned in the memo include legislation to
remove the remaining price controls on natural gas; moving ahead
with the $5.9 billion superconducting super collider project to
study the nature of matter and energy; pushing legislation to allow
oil exploration on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska, and developing an integrated national energy
policy.
   Watkins also stressed a need to restart the reactors at Savannah
River, near Aiken, S.C., that produce a perishable gas needed to
manufacture nuclear warheads. The three reactors there have been
shut down since last spring for safety.
   Watkins said in the memo that he intended to have a more
``all-inclusive set of objectives'' within three months.

<HEAD>Administration Doesn't Want Buyers' Tax Breaks Continued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Thursday it
opposes the continuation of preferential tax breaks that federal
regulators have been using to attract buyers for insolvent savings
and loan associations.
   ``Unequivably, we do not favor the continuation of favorable tax
treatment,'' White House Budget Director Richard Darman told the
Senate Finance Committee.
   Darman said the administration assumes that the scheduled January
elimination will proceed of a tax break allowing purchasers of
insolvent S&amp;Ls to exclude from taxable income 50 percent of whatever
aid they get from federal insurors for paying off depositors in the
acquired institutions.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Thursday took
control of an additional 45 failed savings and loans, with $13.6
billion in assets, in eight states.
   That brings to 118 in 24 states the total number of institutions
the agency has taken control of since Bush announced his S&amp;L rescue
package in early February.
   Until this year, purchasers of insolvent S&amp;Ls could avoid paying
taxes on 100 percent of whatever they received from the FSLIC, the
agency that insured S&amp;L depositors against losses up to $100,000 in
each account, much as the FDIC insures commercial bank depositors
against losses.
   Before the 100 percent FSLIC aid exclusion was cut in half Jan.
1, 1989, S&amp;L regulators used it in December it as a lure in
attracting buyers for 75 insolvent thrift institutions.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which until February also ran
the insurance fund as well as regulating S&amp;Ls, estimated the tax
revenue losses to the Treasury from the December action at $4
billion.
   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. and chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, said Thursday that the tax benefits in the
December resolutions could be more than $7 billion.
   Another tax incentive for S&amp;Ls scheduled to expire at the end of
1989 allows net operating losses of an insolvent S&amp;L to be
transferred to its new owner, who can use them to reduce taxes that
would otherwise be owed.
   Both the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget
Office have recommended against continuing the tax breaks.
   FDIC Chairman William Seidman in his new role in the S&amp;L crisis
has called for continuing the tax breaks beyond this year.
   He told Congress last month that the tax breaks would reduce the
impact of the S&amp;L bailout to the federal budget and promised to use
them ``to minimize the government's total cost.''
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,
introduced bills Wednesday to repeal the tax breaks immediately upon
passage of Bush's S&amp;L bailout proposal instead of waiting until
January.
   In other developments:
   _Congressional Budget Office Director Robert D. Reischauer told
the Senate Appropriations Committee that Bush's fiscal 1990 deficit
will total $131 billion rather than the administration's projected
$91.1 billion. About $22 billion of the $40 billion difference is
attributable to different accounting treatment of the S&amp;L rescue, he
said.
   _Rep. Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., said he and other members of the
House Banking Committee are looking into whether the stock of the
regional Federal Home Loan Banks should be opened up to public
ownership. The stock is currently owned only by S&amp;Ls, which could
benefit if the price of the stock rose after public trading was
allowed.

<HEAD>Report Calls for Innovative Education Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School districts would have a freer hand with
federal dollars and the president would lead an offensive to improve
math and science performance under a restructuring plan proposed
Thursday by an influential education group.
   The blueprint from the National Center on Education and the
Economy also proposes extensive day care and early childhood
education and recommends second chances for adult workers who are
functionally illiterate or lack adequate job skills.
   ``To Secure Our Future: The Federal Role in Education'' comes
three years after the group, then known as the Carnegie Forum on
Education and the Economy, released ``A Nation Prepared: Teachers
for the 21st Century,'' a well-received plan to upgrade the teaching
profession.
   Apple Computer president John Sculley chairs the center board and
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is the honorary chairman. Other board
members include former North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, former Labor
Secretary Ray Marshall and pollster Lou Harris.
   Sculley, speaking to a news conference by telephone hookup, said
the report has been presented to President Bush, White House chief
of staff John Sununu and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   He said he did not know whether any of the proposals would be
included in an education bill now being drafted at the White House,
but said Bush was ``extremely interested in what we had to say'' and
``we do believe we have the president's ear in terms of how
important it is for him to come out early in his term for massive
education reform.''
   Center president Marc Tucker said at a news conference that the
latest report envisions ``a whole new intergovernmental
partnership'' that doesn't necessarily involve more money.
   ``First, go for quality,'' the report says. ``Second, reward
success in producing quality. Third ... let the people on the firing
line figure out how to get the job done and get rid of as much of
the bureaucracy ... as possible.''
   The report's major proposal is patterned on the process that
produced the nation's new welfare law. That law reflects many of the
solutions developed by states during several years of
experimentation when they were allowed to transfer federal money
from existing programs to their own innovative projects,
unencumbered by many rules, regulations and red tape.
   The center recommends ``a very large experiment that would
provide the information needed for a general redrafting of the basic
federal programs later.''
   School districts could design initiatives to improve student
performance, ease the transition from school to work for potential
dropouts, or coordinate social services for disadvantaged students,
the report says. The money would come from existing programs in the
labor, education, justice and health and human services departments.
   Local communities, if their proposals were approved by state and
federal governments, ``would be free to combine the available state
and federal funds as they wish. ... They would continue to be free
of the prevailing rules and regulations as long as they were meeting
the (performance) targets they had set.''
   In other areas, the center said:
   _Bush should push the nation toward lofty math and science
performance goals in an all-out effort reminiscent of President
Kennedy's space exploration program. Tucker said Bush should
``identify the best performance anywhere in the world and resolve as
a nation to meet it or beat it.'' The report suggests several
strategies, including a revamped curriculum and a national center to
teach teachers technology.
   _State, federal and local agencies need to combine resources for
high-quality fulltime day care, preschool child development centers
and before and after school care programs so kids don't ``enter
kindergarten as damaged goods, already marked for failure.''
   _The country must stop treating adult illiteracy as a personal
misfortune ``rather than the threat to the nation's standard of
living that it really is.'' The problem can't be solved by
volunteers, nor can employers be expected to foot the whole bill.

   The government news agency on Thursday detailed a
dramatic escape attempt in a hot air balloon that ended in the death
of an East German man.
   The ADN news agency said Winfried Freudenberg fell to his death
Wednesday after flying over the Berlin Wall in a homemade balloon.
   East Germany's state-run media rarely comment on escapes to West
Germany.
   The ADN report came after West Berlin police said they found the
balloon snared in a tree and Freudenberg's passport and other
belongings scattered over several hundred yards in the Zehlendorf
district of the city. Police said they also found a bank deposit
book bearing the name of his wife, Sabine.
   The news agency quoted Mrs. Freudenberg as saying she had not
accompanied her husband in the ill-fated escape attempt.
   According to official West German figures, at least 78 people
have died while trying to escape to West Berlin since East Germany
built the Berlin Wall in 1961.

<TEXT>
   With John Tower's defeat in the Senate on
Thursday, his name joins the likes of Roger B. Taney, Caleb Cushing
and Lewis L. Strauss on history's short list of failed Cabinet
nominees.
   Eight times before in its 200 years, the Senate voted to deny
confirmation to a president's choice for members of his Cabinet.
   Tower, President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense, became
the ninth, rejected by a vote of 53-47.
   Tower's defeat carries other distinctions, too: the first nominee
to be voted down in nearly 30 years, the first nominee of a
just-elected president to be defeated as the chief executive was
shaping his first Cabinet, and the first former senator to be beaten
in a Senate floor vote.
   Still more presidential nominees have run afoul of the Senate and
failed to win confirmation, according to a Library of Congress
study. In four cases the nominations were withdrawn rather than
pressed to a vote, as some had suggested Tower might have done. In
two other cases, nominations died in Senate committees and thus
weren't put to a vote on the floor.
   Before Tower, the last rejection had been on June 19, 1959, when
Strauss, President Dwight Eisenhower's choice for secretary of
commerce, was beaten by 49-46.
   Strauss had been on the job since the previous November, having
been appointed during a congressional recess, but his earlier
performance as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission he had made
too many Senate enemies.
   The first Senate reject was Taney, who was President Andrew
Jackson's nominee for secretary of the treasury.
   The Senate voted 28-18 to reject his nomination on June 24, 1834,
although Taney had been serving since the previous September.
Jackson later appointed him chief justice, and he won a Senate
confirmation vote.
   President John Tyler, facing opposition in Congress from his own
Whig Party because of legislation he vetoed, saw four Cabinet
nominees rejected.
   He nominated Cushing to be secretary of the treasury, and on
March 3, 1843, the Senate voted three times to reject. Tyler tried
and failed again with a treasury nominee: James S. Green was
rejected on June 15, 1844, although the vote was not recorded.
   In January 1844, Tyler's nomination of David Henshaw to be
secretary of the navy and James Madison Porter to be secretary of
war were both rejected. Porter got just three votes in his favor.
   President Andrew Johnson's nomination of Henry Stanbery to be
attorney general was rejected in 1868. He had held the job
previously and stepped down to help Johnson's fight against
impeachment.
   President Calvin Coolidge's nomination of Charles B. Warren as
attorney general was rejected twice in one week in 1925.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., speaking against Tower's nomination on
Wednesday, recalled much of that history and said the Constitution's
requirement that nominations be made with ``the advice and consent
of the Senate'' does not specify that it vote.
   ``The Constitution does not say that we senators even have to
vote on a nomination,'' Byrd said. ``There have been nominations
that have never been voted on and, therefore, never been confirmed.
There have been some that have been withdrawn.''

<HEAD>Powerful Laser Gun Taken During Burglary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A burglar who ransacked a medical office
stole a pistol-shaped laser gun capable of blinding or burning a
person up to 30 feet away with an invisible beam when plugged in,
authorities said.
   Investigators say the thief came across the gun during a break-in
at a doctor's office Wednesday and took the sophisticated $20,000
piece of medical hardware apparently without knowing what it was.
   ``They could just point it at somebody and blind them,'' said
Palm Beach County Sheriff's Sgt. Ken Deischer. ``We could have some
serious problems with this.''
   Dr. Martin Shank, the podiatrist from whose office the laser gun
was stolen, agreed the instrument ``is not a toy.''
   ``It can be disastrous in the wrong hands,'' he said. He said the
gun's light is ``invisible, and will burn a hole in the eye.'' The
device has no warnings printed on it, officials said.
   The laser, used to remove skin cancer, ingrown toenails and fungi
from feet, can burn a hole through a hand at its most powerful
setting.
   It can also blind a person up to 30 feet away and ignite most
non-metallic materials, flammable liquids and some explosive gases,
authorities said.
   The laser gun was made by Pfizer Laser Systems of Irvine, Calif.
It weighs 10 ounces and looks like a small pistol with a long handle.
   Its power charger, which was also taken, is about the size of a
business telephone. The device takes only three seconds to warm up.
   Shank said the fact the laser gun must be plugged is encouraging.
   ``The only consolation is knowing that these burglars aren't
going to be roaming the streets hurting people with it,'' he said.
   Lawrence Rutledge, Pfizer Laser Systems' Florida sales
representative, said from his Orlando office that the laser is ``not
like a flame thrower or anything.''
   But the manufacturer recommends several precautions, such as
wearing protective eyewear because the beam is easily reflected off
shiny metal.

   Joe Runyan clung to his narrow lead in the
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as he approached the halfway point
Thursday in the 1,168-mile Anchorage-to-Nome trek.
   Runyan led the field into McGrath late Tuesday but surrendered
his lead when he decided to take the 24-hour rest stop required of
all mushers somwehere along the trail.
   Most of the other top teams had stopped earlier, accounting in
part for Runyan's early lead. But storming out of McGrath on
Wednesday evening, the rested Runyan quickly regained the lead.
   He left Ophir at 4:45 a.m. with a nine-minute edge on four-time
winner Rick Swenson.
   Five minutes behind Swenson was DeeDee Jonrowe, who held the lead
briefly Wednesday. Defending champion Susan Butcher moved out 12
minutes later, and Martin Buser was about 20 minutes behind her.
   Behind the leaders was a pack of 14 mushers, including race
founder Joe Redington and Jacques Philip of France. Forty-nine
mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday in Anchorage. Four
have dropped out.
   The next checkpoint is Iditarod, the ghost town for which the
trail and race are named. The first musher to reach Iditarod will
get $3,000 in silver ingots. The race carries a $250,000 purse, with
the winner getting $50,000.
   Iditarod is 610 miles from Nome and 558 miles from Anchorage.

   To hear presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater tell it, one would almost have thought the White House had
won a great victory in the Senate defeat of John Tower's nomination
as defense secretary.
   Faced with putting a positive face on the first major defeat of
the Bush presidency, and one with few historical precedants,
Fitzwater decided on the old ``strength from adversity'' tact.
   Or, as it's known in political circles, ``spin control''
   Meeting with reporters shortly before the nomination was
rejected, Fitzwater said the battle had brought the Republican Party
together, toughened the Bush team and showcased presidential traits
of loyalty and decisiveness.
   The struggle, coming early in the administration, ``brought
everybody together ... and we all feel the better off for it, and
it's been helpful in putting together a strong, tough team that's
ready to move on,'' the spokesman claimed.
   He was clearly anticipating the looming loss.
   ``There is a certain strength that comes out of adversity,'' he
said. ``We've fought a long fight hard and, well, ... out of this
struggle has come good unity with the Republican Party.
   ``We brought the administration team together. And we feel that
it's been a tempering affair that should serve us well as we move
forward. ''
   What about all the bad feelings that developed between Senate
Democrats and the White House, enhanced by administration cries of
partisanship?
   Fitzwater concluded that ``we have fought a very hard battle, and
we've done it on the high road. ... And we think we have worked this
nomination diligently. But, at the same time, we have tried to do it
in a way that didn't make enemies,'' so that the White House can
still work with Capitol Hill.
   Furthermore, the press secretary contended, everyone now knows
that when Bush makes an appointment that ``he'll stick with it, that
he's willing to use the resources at his command, that he stands for
principle and what he believes in. And we think those are all
valuable traits to demonstrate early in a presidency.''
   Finally, Fitzwater said that the fight enabled Bush to solidify a
working relationship with the Republican leadership in the Senate to
help in future battles. That, he said, is ``healthy and beneficial.''
   With losses like this, one could almost ask, who needs victories?

   Government and opposition negotiators
agreed Thursday on free elections to a newly created senate in what
could be the first democratic national elections in the communist
bloc.
   In addition, the sides agreed to two-stage elections to the
existing Sejm, or parliament, in which opposition candidates would
be free to run for at least 35 percent of the seats.
   Politburo member Janusz Reykowski, leader of the
government-Communist Party side at the talks, said anyone could run
for the senate who is nominated by an existing political or social
group, or who gathered 5,000 signatures.
   Reykowski said that those elected and the resulting balance of
power in the chamber will depend entirely on the voters.
   ``There are no plans of any kind to arrange the composition
before the elections are held,'' he said.
   Opposition negotiator Jacek Kuron said later on state television:
``We must admit that it is a step toward democracy, such as has
never been made anywhere else in this system.
   ``It creates conditions in which citizens will be able to elect
their real representatives to the top state authorities. But there
is a very important question whether it will be only the first
step.''
   Kuron is on the negotiations' working group on political reform.
   The talks have brought together Poland's powerful independent
forces _ including the Solidarity independent union movement _ and
Communist leaders to reshape the nation's economic and political
future.
   The new senate and the Sejm would form a new two-chamber
parliament called the National Assembly, negotiators said.
   In addition, the two sides agreed in principle to establish the
post of president, who would be elected by a majority of both
chambers of parliament.
   The powers of the president must still be discussed, but in
general the idea is to combine in one person all those powers now
held by the Council of State _ including appointing the head of the
army and ambassadors. In addition, he would be given the right to
dissolve parliament and call new elections.
   There has been wide speculation that if a presidency is
established, the post would be filled by Communist Party First
Secretary Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Opposition negotiators said obtaining agreement on completely
free elections to the senate was part of a trade-off for conceding
that Poland would have a strong presidency, which likely would
remain in Communist Party control.
   Elections to the senate and elections to the Sejm would be held
at the same time, said Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onszkiewicz. The
primary election date is tentatively set for June 4, and candidates
who failed to win a 50 percent majority would compete in a runoff
election June 18, he said.
   Rejkowski said the proposed new election law would be submitted
to the Sejm for approval as early as next week. The Communist Party
now has an absolute majority in the Sejm, and any laws proposed by
the party are assured passage.
   The senate would likely handle economic and social issues and
civil rights, said Reykowski. But the powers must still be
negotiated by a panel of experts appointed by each side.
   Other negotiators have described the senate as a chamber that
could exercise a right of veto over decisions of the Sejm. In such a
system, laws not approved by the senate would have to go back to the
Sejm and win a two-thirds majority to be enacted.
   ``There may be considerable disagreement and differences over the
powers of the second chamber by the two sides,'' Reykowski said.
   Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the opposition team on political
issues, said entering into free elections poses risks for both sides.
   He said the Communist authorities for the first time will face
``a test of the basis of the ruling coalition,'' but the opposition
is at risk because it is ``completely unprepared'' for competition
at the polls.
   ``After 45 years in a political desert we suddenly find ourselves
in an absolutely new situation,'' he told a news conference.
   Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa, had refused to
come to the negotiating table until the Communist Party agreed in
principle to restore its legal status, stripped away after the
December 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   After meeting with top government officials Tuesday, Walesa said
the two sides hope to complete work and sign a new national accord
on April 3.

   A long-lived storm finally moved off the East Coast on Thursday
with a parting shot of cold, wet weather.
   During the night, sleet, snow and freezing rain lashed parts of
Virginia and North Carolina, and light rain and drizzle fell along
the coast of Georgia and Florida.
   By noon, there was only a scattering of rain along the central
Atlantic Coast and east-central Florida. However, advisories for
gale-force wind remained in effect along the coast of the Carolinas,
Georgia and northeastern Florida.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered from western Montana across the
northern half of the Pacific Coast.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, no measurable snowfall or
significant rain were reported, the National Weather Service said.
   In the aftermath of the storm, Oklahoma National Guardsmen and
inmates pitched in Thursday to help dispose of an estimated 3
million chickens killed when the storm collapsed dozens of farm
buildings in under ice and up to 16 inches of snow.
   State Agriculture Commissioner Jack Craig said poultry losses are
estimated at more than $3 million. Some rural Oklahoma roads were
still snow-covered.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 86 at Gila Bend, Ariz. Thursday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 23 degrees below zero at Fort Kent,
Maine.
   For Friday, rain was forecast from central and northern
California across the northern Pacific Coast and over the northern
half of the Plateau. Snow was forecast over higher elevations of the
Northwest.
   Highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted from New England across
the Virginias, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley,
northern North Dakota and northeastern Montana; in the 50s and 60s
from the Carolinas across central Florida, from the central Gulf of
Mexico coast into the upper Ohio Valley, much of the remainder of
the Mississippi Valley, the remainder of the Dakotas, the central
Missouri Valley, the Rockies, the northern Plateau, the Great Basin,
the northern and central Pacific Coast, and southwestern California;
in the 90s over the desert Southwest, and in the 70s and 80s over
the remainder of the nation.

   Former Education Secretary William J. Bennett
won Senate confirmation Thursday as head of the war on drugs, with
lawmakers urging him to waste no time in fashioning a strategy for
fighting the invasion of illegal narcotics.
   ``Mr. Bennett is in for the fight of his life, but more important
he is in for the fight of our children's lives,'' Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said before the Senate voted 97-2 for confirmation.
   The opposition votes were cast by Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.,
and Paul Simon, D-Ill. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., didn't vote.
   The full Senate acted hours after the Judiciary Committee voted
13-1 to send Bennett's nomination to the floor with a favorable
recommendation.
   Following the tumultuous floor fight over President Bush's
nomination of former Sen. John Tower as secretary of defense,
approval of Bennett came easily despite controversy that swirled
around his brash style and outspoken views as education secretary.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., told the Senate that congressional
oversight of the so-called drug czar must be streamlined or Bennett
will be forced to squander his time on ``seven-camera hearings'' on
Capitol Hill instead of battling the tide of narcotics.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a longtime ally of teacher groups,
expressed concern on the Senate floor that Bennett would produce ``a
blizzard of press releases but not much action.''
   He had told the Judiciary Committee earlier that Bennett had
sought a cut in the Education Department's drug education budget
and, as an administrator, ``was not strong.''
   As head of the new Office of National Drug Control Policy,
Bennett will be in charge of drawing up plans to attack the nation's
drug problems.
   The ``drug czar'' is required to study the spending plans of
Cabinet officers and prod them to increase what they have designated
for the war on drugs if he deems that is necessary. Disputes
ultimately would be settled by the president.
   ``I've been struck these last few weeks, as I've met with people
inside government and out, by the pessimism many have about our
mission in the war on drugs,'' Bennett told lawmakers last week.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told the Judiciary Committee on
Thursday that Bennett ``has a difficult job (but) it shouldn't be
considered mission impossible.''
   Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., told lawmakers that the
real issue was ``not about whether Dr. Bennett is going to put
together a strategy.''
   ``This is about whether President Bush has a strategy, whether he
is going to enunciate that strategy and whether he is going to put
that strategy into effect,'' Biden said.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the top Republican on the
committee, replied there was no question that Bush was focusing hard
on the drug problem.
   ``I have been in the White House several times recently and I
assure you that he is vitally interested,'' Thurmond said.
   Biden said he had no doubt that Bush was interested but it
remained to be seen if the interest would be ``matched by
overwhelming commitment of resources and action.''

   Four senior Scottish police officers have arrived
in the United States and plan to visit families of the 259 victims
of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing to clear up complaints about the
crash investigation.
   The officers said they will visit several cities to talk to
relatives who complained that police have been too slow in releasing
personal possessions of those who died in the terrorist bombing over
Scotland in December.
   ``I lost a 16-year-old daughter and she had four suitcases with
her, almost everything she owned,'' said Paul Hudson, a lawyer in
Albany, N.Y., who formed the 300-member relatives support group
Victims of Pan Am 103 in February. ``She had her Christmas presents
with her. Many of our memories of her were with her on that plane.''
   So far, only five or six relatives of the victims have received
any returned possessions, Hudson said.
   ``It's the last thing they have to remember their sons and
daughters,'' said North Adams Mayor Jim Barrett, who represented
several Massachusetts families after the crash. ``Rings, bracelets,
it would mean so much to them to get them back.''
   The British officers arrived in Boston on Wednesday night and
flew to Washington on Thursday to meet with State Department
officials.
   ``There has been some misinformation. There has been some rumor''
about the release of possessions, Assistant Chief Constable Paul
Newell told British television before he left for the United States.
   ``We feel that to try to ease the frustrations of the relatives
here we should come personally and explain to various groups of
relatives exactly what the position is.''
   A letter from the families to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
last month may have resulted in the visit, said Hudson.
   ``It's a very emotional time,'' said Joe Horgan of West Point,
Pa., whose brother-in-law was on Flight 103. ``The additional trauma
of not having things returned means that the healing process cannot
hit full stride.''
   Horgan said the families understand that Scottish law differs
from American and authorities there do not want to release what they
consider evidence in a criminal investigation.
   But he said the families became upset after receiving a letter
from a State Department official last month that hinted that some
victims' luggage and clothing might be destrztat'' but it was found
later to be false. He said the families are not angry at Scottish
authorities, who ``have been very sensitive to our needs.''
   State Department officials did not return telephone calls
Thursday.
   Scottish police recovered more than 11,000 items of property
scattered over 845 square miles.
   As ownership was established and the items were eliminated from
the criminal inquiry, the property started to be returned via the
U.S. consulate in mid-February, a police spokesman said.
   The Scottish police are scheduled to meet with families in New
York on Saturday and in Boston on Sunday, travel to Canton, Ohio, on
Monday and see families in Detroit on Tuesday.

   Federal mediators on Thursday denied an
accusation by Eastern Airlines management that they had not been
neutral in dealing with the company and its Machinists union.
   Eastern President Phil Bates, in a New York news conference after
the company filed for protection from its creditors under bankruptcy
laws, accused the National Mediation Board of throwing ``all
pretense of neutrality to the wind'' in trying to mediate the
17-month dispute.
   After more than a year of talks with the airline and its
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local,
the two-member board said it couldn't resolve the dispute and asked
President Bush to create an emergency panel that would have delayed
a strike by up to 60 days. Bush refused and the machinists went on
strike Saturday.
   Bates accused the board of keeping the company locked up in ``a
fruitless, destructive mediation process'' while the airline's
losses grew.
   ``It is regrettable that Eastern's management made adverse
comments about the board,'' said Charles R. Barnes, the executive
director of the board, which mediates transportation industry labor
disputes. ``But I'm sure in hindsight that the parties will conclude
that the board acted professionally, impartially and in full
accordance with the legal responsibilities.''
   In a statement, the board said the dispute, in which Eastern
originally asked for $200 million in salary cuts while the union
sought $50 million in raises, was one of the most complex the board
has had to mediate since the airline industry was deregulated in
1978.
   ``Eastern's bankruptcy filing is unfortunate for the carrier, its
employees, the traveling public and the nation's transportation
system,'' the board said.
   Board spokesman David Bushnell said mediators continued to talk
with both the union and the company but had not managed to bring the
two sides together since the walkout.

   A witness testified Thursday that Oliver North
was irritated about having to answer ``asinine questions'' from
Congress _ the first direct testimony that North drafted a letter
denying he helped the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The letter, dated Oct. 7, 1985, is at the heart of one of the
criminal charges against North. He is accused of having said falsely
that he did not use his influence to get supplies to the Nicaraguan
resistance.
   Also, during a day when three witnesses testified against North,
the former National Security Council aide's lawyer tried to show
that fund-raiser Carl Channell had changed his story on a damaging
conversation in which Channell quotes North as not caring about
lying to Congress or going to jail.
   Later in the day, Daniel L. Conrad testified that then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane had received a letter from
Congress with 20 to 30 questions about fund-raising activities.
   ``Colonel North said `I just got this and I'm supposed to develop
the answers,''' Conrad testified. ``His boss had to testify and he
(North) was supposed to draft the answers.
   ``He angrily went through the questions. He was irritated he had
to take the time to develop answers to `these asinine questions.'''
   Conrad, who was a go-between for Channell and North, said that in
the same conversation, North said he didn't want Conrad to visit him
so often in the White House complex because visitors' logs were kept.
   Conrad, who specialized in giving talks on fund-raising,
testified that briefings about Nicaragua by the State Department
failed to motivate people to help the Contras. He then heard North
and ``there were light years of difference. He was far superior,
exciting and motivated.''
   He said North told him that money raised by Channell was turned
over to a public relations firm, International Business
Communications. From there it was sent to an account in the Grand
Cayman Islands, then to a bank in Switzerland and finally went to
pay for supplies for the Contras.
   Richard Miller, who ran IBC, followed Conrad to the witness
stand. He called North ``the point man for Central American policy
in the White House,'' and said North once had him arrange to have
Contra leader Alphonso Robelo flown from Costa Rica to Washington to
be present at a fund-raising meeting.
   As Channell was winding up his testimony, North attorney Brendan
Sullivan said: ``Yesterday you were putting the words in Ollie's
mouth.'' On other occasions, he said, Channell either had left out
the quotes on North not caring about lying to Congress or going to
jail, or else attributed the words to Nelson Bunker Hunt, the other
person in the conversation.
   Even U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell signaled his skepticism,
saying at one point that Channell had offered ``three versions
already that Colonel North said what he did relating to these two
questions.''
   On Wednesday, Channell had testified at North's trial that on
Sept. 11, 1985, Hunt, a wealthy Texan, asked North if he were
worried about ``getting in trouble'' for his activities on behalf of
the rebels.
   North's reply, which Channell said ``stuck in my mind,'' was, ``I
don't care if I have to go to jail for this; I don't care if I have
to lie to Congress about this.''
   The judge asked, ``How do you explain to the jury it stuck in
your mind and that you had no doubt about it?''
   Sullivan, who had led Channell through gentle questioning for
more than an hour, said, ``It's hard to remember what was said ...
sometimes when you have such an urge to cooperate, there is a
tendency to want to put words in people's mouths.''
   He said Channell never mentioned the North comments in interviews
with government investigators in January and March 1987. And he
suggested Channell mentioned the conversation first a month later as
a bargaining chip when he himself was plea bargaining with
Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   But in later questioning, prosecution lawyer Michael Bromwich
brought out that records of those interviews were not stenographic
transcrips, but summaries _ and that Channell had never been asked
about either the ``go to jail'' or ``lie to Congress'' statements.
   ``Were you ever told in words or substance, `Give us Ollie
North,'?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``No,'' said Channell.
   ``Were you ever told your sentence depended whether North would
be convicted or acquitted?''
   ``No, I've been told just the opposite''
   The day after the Hunt meeting, the government charges in one of
12 counts, North drafted the letter signed by his boss, McFarlane,
in which he denied to a congressional committee that the National
Security Council had a hand in fund-raising for military aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras. Official aid was at that time forbidden by law.
   One man who contributed to the Contra cause, beer magnate Joseph
Coors, is to testify Friday.

   After watching the Senate vote to reject his
nomination, John Tower walked to the private Pentagon dining room
reserved for the secretary of defense and said goodbye.
   The former Texas senator, who by all accounts had longed to make
that room his own, had reported for work earlier in the day in a
transition office upstairs.
   Now, speaking in his clear, deep baritone, Tower said he might be
judged harshly by history but was returning to his home state ``at
peace with myself, knowing that I have given a full measure of
devotion to my country.''
   The debate over Tower's bid to become the nation's 17th defense
secretary was dominated by allegations of excessive drinking and
womanizing and concerns over Tower's lucrative defense consulting
work after leaving the Senate.
   ``No public figure in my memory has been subjected to such a
far-reaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny,'' Tower said.
   ``And yet, there is no finding that I have ever breached
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my
duty.''
   After undergoing weeks of personal scrutiny, Tower clearly had no
intention Thursday of subjecting himself to more.
   He watched the Senate vote on television and then appeared only
briefly in the secretary's dining room before a TV camera and two
reporters. He stayed just long enough to read his statement.
   Looking dapper in his trademark three-piece, pinstripe suit, he
declined to take any questions.
   ``I will be recorded as the first Cabinet nominee in the history
of the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency
and perhaps be harshly judged,'' Tower said.
   ``I am deeply grateful to our great president for his continuing
confidence in me and his unflagging support in the most difficult of
circumstances. He also thanked his ``old colleagues in the Senate
who rallied to me with fervor, zeal and eloquence in the face of
staggering political odds.''
   Referring to the rancorous six-day debate over his fate, Tower
said it was time for ``the bitterness, rancor and anger to fade, and
for those elements of government who have been involved in the
confirmation process to unite and to be about the people's
business.''
   Tower said he would return to private life in ``my beloved
Texas.''
   He then ignored a reporter's question, said ``Thank you'' and
walked from the room to the private elevator that would take him to
his car.

<HEAD>CFTC Chairman Says Current Powers Enough to Ensure Market Integrity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has
enough power to protect options and futures market integrity,
despite questions raised by a Chicago trading scandal, its chairman
told a Senate panel Thursday.
   Commission Chairman Wendy L. Gramm testified before the Senate
Agriculture Committee, which said an FBI investigation involving two
exchanges in Chicago ``raises fundamental questions about the
futures regulatory system.''
   Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the commission
through 1994, extending its authorty to enforce federal futures and
options trading laws.
   A future is a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a specified
price on a given date. An option is the right to buy or sell a
commodity for a specified price at some time in the future.
   The House and Senate agriculture committees have jurisdiction
over the CFTC. The committee chairmen say reauthorization was
expected to be a brief process but reports of an FBI investigation
into alleged fraud and illegal trading on Chicago futures markets
made a congressional inquiry necessary.
   The bureau's probe reportedly involves allegations that brokers
and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who heads the Senate committee, said
the panel wants to know how well the CFTC enforces the laws
regulating U.S. futures and options exchanges and how it can be sure
the 14 exchanges do an adequate job of self-policing.
   ``The results of the not-yet-complete Chicago investigation may
provide new information as to the effectiveness of existing programs
upon which changes can be based,'' Mrs. Gramm told the committee.
   However, she said no program can detect every instance of
wrongdoing, particularly when it occurs off the trading floor.
   ``The commission believes that its existing regulatory authority
should be sufficient to discharge its responsibilities to protect
the integrity of U.S. futures and options markets,'' Mrs. Gramm said.
   ``To the extent that any improprieties or abuses found in the
course of the ongoing investigation warrant changes in the existing
programs, systems, or rules, the commission has publicly stated that
it stands ready to take such actions as may be appropriate to
address those circumstances,'' she added.
   Leahy ordered the CFTC, within 30 days, to submit an analysis of
12 proposals made to tighten oversight of exchange floors.
   ``The committee has not yet judged the wisdom of any one of these
approaches, nor do we prejudge the outcome of the Chicago probe,''
he said. ``Our goal, rather, is to begin the focus of public debate
on tangible reforms aimed at maintaining confidence in the
marketplace.''
   Among the proposals were requiring exchanges to devote more
resources to floor surveillance, and increasing penalties for
trading abuses.

   Howard University President James E. Cheek
expressed regret Thursday over the student protests which led to the
resignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater
from the board of trustees of the predominantly black school
   ``We simply are hurt,'' Cheek said. ``We feel that the whole
episode has been a very sad episode.''
   A student demonstration ended Thursday when the university
granted the students' demands, which included Atwater's resignation
from the Howard board.
   Speaking after a Capitol Hill hearing on Howard's budget, Cheek
said he wished Atwater hadn't resigned.
   ``We're very disappointed that he found it necessary to do
that,'' he said. ``We understand, of course, the conclusion that he
finally reached.''
   He added that Atwater, who was unanimously elected by the board
of trustees which included two student representatives, had
expressed his willingness to still work on behalf of the university.
   Politics weren't the issue in the protest, Cheek said. ``The
efforts to make this a political issue were simply exploiting
(it),'' he said.
   Howard University officials, who reached a settlement with
student protestors early Thursday, appeared before a House education
subcommittee requesting $184.9 million for fiscal 1990, a 3.3
percent increase over last year.
   The students left the administration building around 4 a.m.,
following several hours of negotiations involving Jesse Jackson,
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry and Walter Fauntroy, the
district's non-voting delegate in Congress.
   ``You stood up and said `we have an insult level' and Howard has
established a watershed movement,'' Jackson told the students at the
predominatly black campus. He called it a ``great victory.''
   Student leader April Silver declared, ``We have done it. We have
made not a national statement, but an international statement to the
world.''
   University spokesman Alan Hermesch said the students left the
building Thursday morning and repairs to the doors and windows were
underway.
   The demonstration ended after university officials delivered a
letter promising that students will not be punished for
participating in the action.
   Atwater resigned Tuesday, saying he was worried the occupation
might lead to injuries.
   After learning they had succeeded in driving Atwater from the
board of trustees, the students turned to demands involving
curriculum, financial aid and improved security.
   The demonstration disrupted classes and the students Wednesday
blocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used for
temporary administrative offices.
   Atwater was appointed to the board in December. The protest began
Friday when the students disrupted a convocation ceremony for the
school's charter day that was to have included a speech by comedian
Bill Cosby.
   The students recommended Thursday that Cosby be named to replace
Atwater.
   Atwater complained he was the victim of an ``unfair portrayal''
of his civil rights positions by Howard students.
   Students contended that Atwater encouraged racism while managing
President Bush's 1988 campaign by using ads that focused on convict
Willie Horton Jr., who is black. Horton raped a Maryland woman while
on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.

<HEAD>Animal Hospital Launches Pet Blood Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital is seeking a new breed of blood donors _
dogs and cats _ to help set up a blood bank for pets.
   Special liquids will replace the usual orange juice chasers and
not all of the donors are expected to sit quietly as they give the
gift of life. But in many respects the blood drive beginning April 2
will resemble its human counterpart, Dr. Alicia Faggella, a
veterinarian with the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital, said Thursday.
   The blood drive, overseen by the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, will enable the creation of a
blood bank at the hospital, which gave more than 300 life-saving
transfusions to dogs and cats last year.
   ``I have not heard of any drives that have been conducted in any
part of the country. So they're plowing some new ground,'' said Dr.
John Albers, executive director of the American Animal Hospital
Association in Denver. ``It's a neat idea.''
   Currently, veterinarians keep a few animals in their clinics as
mascots and blood donors or rely on a network of former patients
that can be called in, he said.
   The Angell hospital currently has workers bring in their pets for
regular donations, Faggella said. Hospital officials hope to expand
that to a more formal blood-storage system that would operate like a
human blood bank.
   Plasma would be separated from the blood and frozen, making it
last longer, and more types of blood would be on hand, Faggella
said. Like humans, animals have different blood types, and cat blood
is different from dog blood.
   Accidents are the most common reason pets need blood, but it also
is used in treating such diseases as feline leukemia, she said.
   ``People really don't realize that our expertise is very similar
in many instances to human medicine,'' she said. ``We treat pets
with cancer; we do total hip replacements. We have animals who have
diabetes. We do cardiovascular heart surgery to repair different
defects in the heart. There's a specialist in every area.''
   Dogs usually are willing to cooperate in donating a pint, said
Faggella. Cats a extra persuasion to donate the usual amount of
about 3 tablespoons. ``We do tranquilize them so they don't get
stressed out,'' she said.
   So far, a few pet owners have registered for the drive.
   ``I think they will be interested in it,'' she said. ``I know we
have several clients who in the past, when blood was very scarce,
they've been very thankful that their animals have been saved by
it.''

<TEXT>
   Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the determined
gentlelady from Kansas, was the lone Republcian to vote against John
Tower for secretary of defense Thursday.
   It wasn't the first time the junior senator from Kansas had gone
against her party _ and her party's leader, Bob Dole, the senior
senator from Kansas and the leader of the losing fight to save the
nomination.
   Dole frequently charged that the fight was strictly partisan,
minority Republicans against majority Democrats. Kassebaum saw
things differently.
   ``This has not been an easy decision for me or for any of us,''
Kassebaum said in a statement entered into the Congressional Record
but not spoken on the Senate floor. ``Members I highly respect on
both sides of the aisle are diametrically and vehemently in
opposition.''
   If there was any irony in Kassebaum spliting with Dole on such a
key vote, there was also the matter of Kassebaum's concern about
Tower's attitudes toward women.
   Kassebaum, one of only two women in the Senate, noted that a
Pentagon study ``recently highlighted the seriousness of the
problems of harassment and promotion. ... I am not confident that
Senator Tower would give these issues the priority they demand or
would demonstrate the necessary sensitivity to their seriousness.''
   But her prime concern was not women. Nor was it Tower's past
drinking habits, which several sentors noted but she mentioned not
at all.
   ``Most importantly,'' Kassebaum said, ``the next secretary of
defense is going to have to counter the debilitating impact that the
defense procurement scandal has had on public confidence in our
defense establishment.''
   ``In meeting these challenges, the next secretary of defense must
have the confidence, trust and respect of the American people and
the Congress. ... I do not believe he can provide the leadership
that is necessary to forge a consensus on the critical national
security issues confronting us today.''
   ``My most serious concerns about the nomination of John Tower are
from the public record,'' Kassebaum said. ``Although Senator Tower
did not break any laws, his consulting activities over the past
couple of years, in my opinion, raise very serious concerns about
the nominee's judgment and his sensitivity to those major issues of
conflict of interest.''
   Later, Kassebaum told reporters she would have voted for Tower if
hers were the deciding vote.
   ``I had told the president I would have voted for him even though
I had serious misgivings,'' she said, ``because, at that point, I
wouldn't have wanted to be the vote to defeat.
   Her vote wasn't needed, and Kassabaum became the only senator on
the Republican side of the aisle to stand and say ``no'' when the
roll was called.
   Kassebaum, 56, went against Dole, her party and then-Sen. Dan
Quayle in the summer of 1986, when she opposed the nomination of
Daniel Manion as a federal judge in Indiana. Kassebaum voted no, but
was persuaded by Quayle to ``pair'' her vote with an absent senator
who reportedly would have voted yes. Pairing, in effect, cancels out
each vote. Manion was confirmed.
   Kassebaum also bolted from the party fold later that year, siding
with Democrats to override President Reagan's veto of limited
economic sanctions against South Africa.
   She was first elected to the Senate in 1978, with her only
previous public office that of a local school board. She is,
however, the daughter of the late Alf Landon, the Republican
presidential nominee who lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Thursday announced closer
scrutiny over its scandal-tainted bank with sweeping reforms to
abolish the post of president held by U.S. Archbishop Paul C.
Marcinkus and to hire more professionals.
   The changes were announced in a statement summing up three days
of meetings by a special commission of cardinals studying the
Vatican's financial problems. It forecast a record budget deficit of
more than $78 million this year.
   The statement said Marcinkus, a native of Cicero, Ill., will
assist the Vatican Bank during a ``transition phase.''
   The changes at the bank call for a new post of secretary to be
held by a non-bishop cleric, a special council of five financial
experts from various countries, and a director and a deputy director
named by that council.
   The Vatican also will set up a watchdog commission of five
cardinals named by the pope for the bank, which is formally called
the Institute for Religious Works.
   Pope John Paul II outlined the changes last June when he
overhauled the Curia, the church's central administration, but
Thursday's statement gave the first details.
   Marcinkus, 67, who has headed the bank since 1969, said he didn't
know exactly when he would leave.
   ``I will probably move on when it's all set up,'' Marcinkus said
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   He noted he holds another post, the equivalent of deputy governor
of the Vatican city-state, adding, ``They haven't taken that away
yet.''
   Warrants for the arrest of Marcinkus and two lay Vatican bank
officials were issued in 1987 after Italian prosecutors charged them
with being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco
Ambrosiano, a Milan-based bank that collapsed in 1982. It was
Italy's biggest postwar banking scandal.
   But the arrests were never made. Italy's Constitutional Court
ruled that a Vatican-Italian treaty precluded any interference by
Italian authorities into the affairs of Vatican, an independent
city-state.
   The Vatican Bank, which was the largest shareholder in Banco
Ambrosiano, denied any wrongdoing in the bank's collapse, but agreed
in 1984 to pay $250 million to its creditors.
   The bank went under after the default of $1.3 billion in Vatican
Bank-assured loans made to 10 dummy corporations set up in Latin
America. The body of Roberto Calvi, Banco Ambrosiano's former
chairman, was found hanging from a London bridge in June 1982. An
Italian civil court ruled in January that Calvi was murdered.
   Announcing its financial position, the Vatican said it expected
revenues of $56,145,384 in 1989 and expenses of $134,326,153,
leaving a deficit of $78.1 million.
   The Vatican was in the red by about $66 million in 1988. A press
statement said the big jump in expenses was ``more apparent than
real'' because of a change in accounting practices that now put
costs of running the Holy See's diplomatic missions in 118 countries
directly under the budget of the Holy See.
   This expense had previously been covered by a special Vatican
fund that had run out.
   To cover the deficit, the Vatican said it would count heavily on
Peter's Pence, contributions by Catholics to the pope, which it said
amounted to nearly $53 million last year. It said it was also
expecting help from a special fund called the Papal Foundation, set
up by Cardinal John Krol, retired archbishop of Philadelphia.
   The statement said that while the cardinals found the Vatican's
expenses justified it urged the Holy See to make every effort to
reduce them.

   Aid donors pledged Thursday to provide
money and end red tape in a joint effort to save 100,000 people in
the southern war zone from starvation, but success now depends on
rebels accepting a cease-fire.
   A U.N.-sponsored conference of Western donor nations, relief
agencies and Sudanese government officials produced pledges
estimated at $132 million.
   Western health officials said an outbreak of meningitis also has
spread into southern Sudan and estimated the dead at 400. They said
the disease began in Ethiopia and was following an annual route
through northeastern Africa.
   Julia Taft of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said
the United States had pledged two military C-130 transports to the
airlift.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government repeated its pledge to
observe a truce in April so food and medical supplies could be
stockpiled in the south before the rainy season begins in May.
   No word was received from the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
which has fought since 1983 for more autonomy and economic
advantages in the south, most of whose people are black Christians
or animists. Northern Sudan, which controls the government, is
predominantly Arab and Moslem.
   Mahdi said: ``I have nothing but smiles and handshakes for you
all. I thank you all and assure you that your recommendations will
find necessary and proper response from my government.''
   Relief workers want to move 165,000 tons of food, medicine and
other supplies south before the rainy season, which virtually
isolates the region for six months.
   The United Nations is trying to prevent a repeat of 1988, when up
to 500,000 southerners died of starvation, disease or the fighting.
Many of them died in summer, cut off in small towns when rain turned
roads into swamps and made airstrips unusable.
   U.N. experts say starvation and disease threaten 2.3 million
southerners this rainy season and up to 100,000 could die. Other
sources estimate the number at risk as high as 600,000.
   On Wednesday, Mahdi endorsed a cease-fire during April but said
the rebels also must accept it. Ms. Taft said she would visit Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday and ask the insurgents to agree.

<HEAD>Veep Says U.S. Must Accept Responsibility for Its Own Drug Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States must accept responsibility
for its own drug problem and not just ``blame other countries for
what's been happening to us,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said
Thursday.
   Quayle, in remarks prepared for a speech to the International
Mayors Conference in New York, said some of the nations where drugs
originate have met ``several critical milestones in narcotics
control.''
   A text of his speech was released by his Washington office.
   ``We can't just blame other countries for what's been happening
to us. We must recognize that substantial efforts are being made by
some nations to stem the drug supply problem,'' Quayle said.
   He cited Peru, Bolivia and Mexico as countries making such
strides.
   Peru, for example, eradicated more than 5,130 hectares of coca
plants, used to make cocaine, over a four-month period, Quayle said.
   He also said the Bush administration ``will look into a number of
policy options that would allow us to do more to reinforce the
anti-narcotics efforts'' in Peru and other Andean countries.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already has agents
stationed in South America to assist in anti-drug efforts. They
gather intelligence, assist local police and help in drug
eradication.
   ``At the same time that we work with other nations, we must also
recognize that we have become a drug-source nation ourselves. About
a quarter of the marijuana consumed in this country is domestically
grown. And a large number of drugs are illegally produced in
clandestine laboratories in this country,'' he said.
   The vice president said there is no reason for a ``feeling of
gloom that seems to envelop this issue like a thick, clammy fog,''
because although the situation is serious, the war against drugs is
winnable.
   He cited drug use surveys by the National High School Senior
Survey that show drug use among that group at its lowest level since
the survey began in 1975.
   ``In other words, the pessimists are being proven wrong once
again: the American demand for drugs is not insatiable; the American
people are not incapable of self-control.''

<HEAD>Radio Kabul: Pakistani and U.S. Advisers Killed; Fierce Fighting
Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio Kabul on Thursday said Afghan
government forces killed 20 Pakistani and U.S. advisers in eastern
Afghanistan, where fierce fighting was reported around a strategic
city east of the capital.
   U.S. officials denied the report of American casualties. Pakistan
has also denied sending personnel into Afghanistan despite repeated
charges to the contrary from the ruling Marxist government in Kabul.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported Afghan rebels fired
rockets at Kabul airport Wednesday, killing four people, including a
small child. Tass said 16 rockets exploded near Afghan commercial
airliners as one was preparing to take off, but it did not say
whether the planes were damaged.
   The Radio Kabul report monitored in Islamabad said that in
addition to the deaths of Pakistani and U.S. advisers, 500 Pakistani
military personnel were killed in Wednesday's fighting in Nangarhar
province.
   Maj. Robin Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, denied U.S. advisers
were killed and said, ``There are no Department of Defense advisers
inside Afghanistan.''
   She said in an interview in Washington that the only U.S.
soldiers in the region are in Pakistan, where they are training
guerrillas to neutralize lands mines in a program initiated by the
United Nations.
   A State Department spokesman also said no American officials are
in Afghanistan.
   Tass said rebels launched a ``major attack'' Monday on Jalalabad,
about 80 miles east of the capital and 45 miles west of the border
with Pakistan, where Afghan guerrillas are based. More fighting was
reported Thursday near the airport.
   The Soviet television evening news program Vremya on Thursday
showed dramatic tape of shelling at Jalalabad airport. A
correspondent standing at the control tower narrated as puffs of
smoke were shown on runways where shells exploded. Airport workers
were shown running for cover.
   Tass said ``irregular troops from Pakistani tribes'' and
Pakistani military advisers were helping the rebels. The rebels
tried to cut the Kabul-Jalalabad road, but a large convoy of arms
and reserve troops got through, it said.
   Radio Kabul also said ``hundreds of criminals'' were killed by
communist troops protecting Jalalabad. The radio regularly refers to
mujahedeen as criminals, terrorists or opposition extremists.
   Tass said 1,500 ``enemy soldiers were put out of action'' on
Wednesday and Thursday in fighting around Jalalabad.
   The report said Pakistani helicopters dropped ammunition for the
rebels. The Afghan Foreign Ministry protested to Pakistani diplomats
about their air assistance and irregular troop support to the rebels.
   Tass said the rebels fired heavy artillery at security outposts
and populated areas on a road between the Sorubi district and the
city of Jalalabad on Wednesday. Sorubi lies halfway between
Jalalabad and Kabul.
   Najibullah Mojaddidi, a guerrilla spokesman, confirmed the fall
of a key government garrison at Samarkhiel on the outskirts of
Jalalabad. Guerrillas said Samarkhiel's fall is a stepping stone to
capturing Jalalabad.
   Tass reported heavy fighting around Samarkhiel, about 5 miles
south of Jalalabad.
   But Mojaddidi said the fate of the airport is ``very difficult to
say, but the latest report is that fighting is continuing.''
   The airport, however, has been heavily damaged by guerrillas and
Mojaddidi questioned whether it could be used by government troops.
   Tass also said a group of 50 rebels ``laid down their arms'' and
joined forces with Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government in Baghlan
province.
   The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan last month after nine
years of supporting the government.
   The guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the Afghan government and
have formed a government-in-exile in Pakistan to take over.
   Saudi Arabia on Thursday became the first country to officially
recognize the government-in-exile. The oil-rich kingdom has given
the guerrillas considerable support in their struggle.

   A Czechoslovak court sent a popular rock
musician and another dissident to jail Thursday for demanding the
communist government explain the death of a jailed activist, emigre
sources and a rights group said.
   Ivan M. Jirous, a cultural activist and leader of the pop group
Plastic People, was convicted Thursday and sentenced to 16 months in
jail, and fellow defendant Jiri Tichy drew six months, said the
sources and the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation, a
group monitoring East bloc human rights.
   Emigre sources said activists Pavel Dudr and Jaromir Nemec
received suspended sentences of 12 months and 18 months,
respectively, on Thursday at Kromeriz, Czechoslovakia, on charges of
circulating anti-state literature.
   The trials were part of a communist government crackdown that
earlier jailed playwright Vaclav Havel for nine months and resulted
in prison terms, fines or suspended sentences for seven other
activists.
   Tichy and Jirous were convicted of inciting anti-state activity
and harming the state's interests abroad, said Jan Kavan of the
London-based Palach Press newsletter, which monitors events in
Czechoslovakia.
   Jirous already had spent nearly eight years in jail for human
rights activities before he was arrested again, with Tichy, on Oct.
20, 1988.
   Tichy and Jirous immediately appealed their sentences, passed in
a court in the Moravian town of Jihlava, Palach Press said.

<HEAD>Experts Say Soviet-Human Rights Test in World Court Unlikely</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7th graf `The Soviets...' to explain discrepancy between
number of treaties and subjects.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States welcomed Soviet
acceptance of World Court authority on human rights, but a
government legal expert said Thursday the justices probably never
will hear a case testing the Kremlin's commitment.
   On Wednesday, the Soviet Union said it would accept the court's
jurisdiction in six human rights treaties, reversing its policy of
resisting outside judgment of its practices.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev also has spoken recently in favor
of a larger U.N. role in such international areas as arms control
and space exploration, which traditionally have been dominated by
the Soviet Union and United States.
   U.N. and State Department legal officers said his acceptance of
jurisdiction by the World Court, a U.N. agency, will bring Gorbachev
international good will with little risk of embarrassment over
Soviet human rights practices.
   It also should help the Soviet effort to hold a human rights
conference in Moscow in 1991 as one of several follow-up meetings to
the 1975 Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation.
   In January, Washington changed its position and said it would
accept a Moscow conference, citing the Soviet release of political
prisoners, easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free
speech and freedom of religion.
   The six treaties on which the Soviets will recognize the court's
authority deal with five areas. They condemn genocide, ban slavery,
guarantee political rights for women, prohibit racism and outlaw
torture.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
welcomes ``any step in the submission of disputes of this kind to
binding decisions by neutral bodies such as the International Court
of Justice,'' the court's formal name.
   Pieter Kooijmans, U.N. special investigator on human rights, said
in Leiden, the Netherlands: ``It would be a real breakthrough for
human rights if the Soviet Union would recognize the right of
individuals'' to file complaints of rights abuses.
   Under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, individual citizens can complain of
rights abuses to an international body of legal experts with the
power to order compensation. Hungary ratified the protocol last year.
   A State Department legal expert said privately: ``The
International Court of Justice has never handled a human rights
dispute'' and the Soviet acceptance of jurisdiction ``may amount to
nothing more than a meaningless gesture.''
   ``It would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would ever
wind its way to the World Court,'' he said.
   Only governments can take cases before the court, which has 15
judges and sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. It has no authority
to deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations.
   The United States has ratified only one of the six human rights
treaties. The Soviets have accepted all six.
   Last year, the Senate finally ratified the 1948 Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, but rejected
World Court authority over its interpretation. The United States has
signed the five other treaties but the Senate has not ratified them.
   ``We have accepted (World Court) jurisdiction over many more
treaties than the Soviet Union has, bilateral and multilateral,''
the State Department legal expert said.
   Washington accepts World Court rulings under about 60 treaties
dealing with a range of diplomatic and commercial rights. The
Soviets have refused to recognize the court's authority.
   Last year, the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and
China began negotiations toward an agreement under which they would
submit to World Court rulings on all treaties that did not involve
sensitive national security issues or the use of force.
   They are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
and have veto power in the council.
   The United States rejects World Court's jurisdiction in national
security cases.
   In 1986, Nicaragua asked the court to rule on the mining of its
harbors and covert U.S. support for Contra rebels. The court ruled
in Nicaragua's favor but the United States, which did not
participate in the case, refused to accept the decision.

   A man with interests in bars and horses was
killed in a fusillade of bullets fired from ambush just after his

were unknown, said police Capt. Jim Oman, who said McKenna
apparently owned bars in the Los Angeles area and owned or trained
horses at the estate.
   At least 20 rounds of 9mm bullets were fired and, based on the
rapidity of fire, either a semiautomatic or fully automatic weapon
was used, Oman said. Investigators found no guns.
   Oman said the chauffeur, Robert Berg, told police they were
returning from bars McKenna owned near Los Angeles International
Airport. But he said he wasn't certain how much Berg really knew of
McKenna's business.
   State Alcohol Beverage Control Board deputy division chief Carl
Falletta said McKenna had never been licensed to own a bar.
   The limousine had just passed through the gate at least a mile
from the house when the shots were fired, Oman said. ``There was a
second blast of gunfire and he (Berg) accelerated up the hills,''
Oman said.
   The estate, a house on a ridge with stables down below, is in the
rural hills and canyons of northern Orange County, southeast of Los
Angeles.
   The Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments turned away
requests for any information on McKenna. Orange County sheriff's Lt.
Dick Olson said his department was not involved, except for possible
technical assistance.
   McKenna joined the California Highway Patrol in June 1968 and
served as a motorcycle patrolman in the West Los Angeles CHP office
until he resigned June 15, 1972, said CHP headquarters spokesman Sam
Haynes.
   Haynes did not know the circumstances of McKenna's resignation,
and did not know anything about his activities over the subsequent
17 years.

<HEAD>Text of Ratzinger Statement on Bishops</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Vatican-Bishops, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of a speech given by
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, president of the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, at an extraordinary meeting of U.S. bishops
and Vatican officials. The summary was made available by the Vatican
in Italian and translated into English by The Associated Press.
Phrases in parentheses were added by the AP.
   As the Second Vatican Council, Lumen Gentium, 25, teaches us,
repeating a formula established by the Council of Trent, the bishop
is above all an evangelizer and in that way the actual successor of
the apostles.
   The image of the post-conciliar (Second Vatican Council) bishop
has positive aspects. Today bishops preach more than in the past.
Many bishops and Episcopal Conferences take positions with pastoral
letters on great issues of the day, offering a response in the light
of faith.
   Less positive is the evolution of catechesis, which is consigned
in great measure to so-called experts.
   Even more thorny is the issue of the rapport between bishops and
theologians, who today have influence not only in the worlds of
scientific research and university teaching, but who also, through
the mass media, bring into the public arena their often dissonant
contributions, to the point where their voices drown out those of
the bishops who preach.
   In many parts of the world, theologians have taken the place of
the bishop as teacher, leading to a growing insecurity and
disorientation.
   After the (Second Vatican) Council, reflection on the primacy of
the bishop's mission of proclaiming the word has remained in
practice without commentary.
   Instead, one comes up against ideas aimed at limiting the bishop
to the role of ``spiritual administrator.''
   These theories, which come from the academic realm, have
transformed themselves into a kind of pressure on the bishop. His
role (according to these theories) would be to avoid polarization,
acting as a moderator in the plurality of different opinions.
   The bishops have fully adapted themselves to this regulative
model, little defending their magisterial authority over
theologians. The preached word becomes seen as something merely
``pastoral'' and is not presented with the authority of decision.
And it ends up not even being truly pastoral, because the pastoral
approach consists of making people face decisions and confronting
them with the authority of truth.
   In addition, according to (theories of) modern culture, it is not
possible to distinguish clearly between faith and theology, and even
if it could be done, it would be the task only of the specialist,
the theologian, but not of the shepherd (bishop).
   The most pressing question lies in the fact that the modern world
distinguishes two spheres of life: action and reflection. The former
(according to theories of the modern world) requires authority,
which is justified and useful at a functional level, the second does
not need authority because it follows solely the law of thought _
there is nothing definitive, but only hypotheses still to be
verified and tested.
   The church (according to these theories) can exercise a
functional authority in the sphere of its actions. Theology is not a
matter of authority, rather one of being professional. This notion
means that the church can certainly dispense pious advice, but not
proclaim the truth in a way that is binding and thereby call people
to a commitment.
   In addition, in today's hierarchy of values, individual liberties
and the consequent rights of freedom of the mass media take the
highest place, while objective moral values, on which there is
anyway no agreement, are banished to the private sphere, not
meriting any social and public protection.
   Bluntly, one can say: There is a right to immorality but morality
has no rights. The responsibility of witnessing to the truth of the
gospel leads inevitably to passion for the truth. Here one finds
also the positive conclusion of our reflection: the hallmark of
truth is that it is worth suffering for.
   Those who announce the gospel must also be martyrs, in the most
profound sense of the word.

<TEXT>
   The French government has expressed concern to
the State Department that French consular officials were temporarily
denied access to diplomatic pouches by U.S. Customs agents in Miami,
American officials said Thursday.
   Based on x-rays and an inspection by drug-sniffing dogs, the
pouches were thought to contain cocaine packages when they arrived
in Miami from Santo Domingo Wednesday night.
   But once the pouches were released to French custody and flown to
Paris, French officials notified U.S. diplomats the containers were
drug-free.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that under
international law, diplomatic pouches are inviolable even if they
are believed to be carrying illegal substances.
   Another official, who asked not to be identified, said Customs
turned over the pouches to French consular officials unopened but
not before the containers had been withheld for a period from the
envoys.
   A French foreign service courier who accompanied the pouches was
detained for nine hours until he was ordered released by the State
Department, according to officials.
   Michael Sheehan, a Customs spokesman in Miami, said, ``We are
completely confident that what our dogs alerted to and what our
x-rays saw was cocaine.''
   But Thierry Reynard, the French consul in Miami, said the pouches
contained paper work in boxes that were packaged in lager boxes.
   ``I'm very surprised they could mistake the two things,'' he
said. ``They have to do their homework on investigations.''

<HEAD>Rangel Opposes Sullivan on Needles for Addicts to Fight AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., issued a stinging
attack Thursday on Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan for supporting clean-needle programs for drug users in
communities trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
   Rangel said he found it shocking that Sullivan, who took over the
health agency last week, would advocate the idea of exchanging
needles with drug addicts instead of proposing programs to expand
drug treatment services.
   ``The first step he takes in drug abuse is to appear to give
support to addicts by giving them needles,'' Rangel said. ``It's an
immoral thing to distribute needles to addicts. The next thing you
know they'll be distributing drugs.''
   ``It sends a message to the minority community that we don't have
the time, the resources or the will to try to get you off drugs and
back into the mainstream, but we do have the time to give you
sterile needles,'' he said.
   Sullivan, in an interview Wednesday, said he does not believe
needle-exchange programs condone drug abuse, but rather could deal
with one way the deadly AIDS virus is spread _ among drug addicts
through the use of shared needles. Once infected, addicts also can
spread the disease to sex partners and their babies.
   While emphasizing that decisions on such programs should be made
locally, Sullivan said needle-exchange programs ``deserve a chance
for an appropriate trial'' in communities that want them.
   New York City Health Commissioner Stephen C. Joseph said
Sullivan's support was a ``tremendous boost'' to his program, one of
only a few in the country.
   The New York program has enrolled 92 addicts, 60 percent of whom
are infected with the AIDS virus _ ``and that's viruses taken off
the street,'' he said.
   However, Rangel called the New York program ``a complete flop.''
He also opposes a recent HHS proposal to make it easier for heroin
addicts to get methadone while waiting for comprehensive treatment,
saying the program would only ``substitute one addictive drug for
another.''
   In a related development Thursday, the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Association announced a $75 million grant program to
expand drug treatment services in cities that have waiting lists of
more than one month. A critical purpose of the grants, the agency
said, is to help get addicts off the streets faster to reduce the
spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Honolulu Newspaper Reporter Visits Marcos In Hospital Room</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos is
so sick he can barely lift his head or open his eyes, and he is
dying, his wife, Imelda, said in an interview.
   The 71-year-old Marcos, who was president of the Philippines for
20 years before being ousted in 1986, has been hospitalized since
Jan. 15 with various respiratory ailments. He was listed in guarded
condition Thursday.
   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported Thursday that one of its
reporters was allowed to see Marcos on Wednesday in his room at St.
Francis Medical Center, and to interview Mrs. Marcos.
   The newspaper reported that Marcos has lost so much weight that
his legs have little muscle mass and his hip bones protrude under
his sheet and blanket.
   ``Do you believe his condition now?'' asked Mrs. Marcos, 59.
``Can you see that the former president of the Philippines is dying,
that he is not a malingerer?''
   Marcos' lawyers have maintained he was too ill to fly to New York
for arraignment on criminal racketeering charges accusing them of
plundering the Philippine economy and stashing much of the money in
the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent Oct. 31 in New York and was freed on
$5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress Doris Duke.
   Marcos, unable to talk because of a breathing tube in his throat,
responded to his wife's greeting by turning his head slowly and
struggling to open his eyes, the newspaper said.
   ``You're better today,'' Mrs. Marcos told him. ``Your fever has
dissipated. You must get better because we are going home soon and I
am not going to carry you onto that plane. You must walk.''
   ``We will be at home, with peace and love and the beauty of
God,'' she told him. ``We will enjoy the first real quiet with our
family in years.''
   The former first lady is leading their fight to return to their
homeland, from which they were ousted in a popular revolt.
Philippine President Corazon Aquino opposes their return for any
purpose.
   Mrs. Marcos said it is wrong of Mrs. Aquino to prohibit Marcos's
return on the basis of national security.
   ``A man so sick he can hardly lift his head or open his eyes, who
needs a tube to drink water, a tube to breathe, a tube to eat,'' is
no threat, she said.
   Last week, Mrs. Marcos was invited by the Nacionalista Party _
the political faction to which Marcos belonged when he was first
elected president in 1965 _ to attend a reorganization meeting in
Manila this week.
   She declined, but in a three-page letter to party chief Jose B.
Laurel criticized U.S. meddling in Philippine affairs and the Aquino
government for exiling the couple ``to a living hell.''
   ``Now please don't misconstrue this,'' she told the
Star-Bulletin. ``But for me to run for the (Philippine) presidency
would be my last desperate option. My three years of painful ...
experience in the United States gives me a thousand and one options,
and the last desperate one would be running for the presidency.''
   She blamed their legal problems for her husband's decline.
   ``After I was arraigned he went downhill,'' she said. ``Can you
imagine the Philippines' top trial lawyer can't be there to defend
his wife; a man who is supposed to have so much hidden wealth he
cannot even bail out his wife. He is not afraid of being arraigned.
It's his cup of tea, the court is his playground. He is dying to
go.''
   She said the world is too concerned about money.
   ``Look at the songs today,'' she said. ``Madonna's `Material
Girl' and Michael Jackson's `Bad.' All this talk about Mrs. Marcos
eating in rich restaurants, going to nightclubs. What cheap thrills
we care about.''

   Frank Lorenzo, boss of Eastern's parent company,
said Thursday unions should quit picking on him and start picking up
the pieces of his airline.
   ``It's time the messenger stops getting shot because the
messenger is unpopular,'' a worn but stone-faced Lorenzo said.
``Eastern is a troubled company that has to change in order to
survive.''
   Lorenzo, who is known among employees as a union-buster and one
of the toughest bosses in America, is a lightning rod in the
6-day-old strike by Machinists. Pilots and flight attendants have
honored the picket lines.
   He is chief executive officer of Texas Air Corp., the largest
airline conglomerate in the United States. It absorbed Eastern three
years ago when the airline was on the brink of bankruptcy.
   Pickets have lambasted Lorenzo, 48, who announced Thursday that
Eastern filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy
law.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland called him the ``Typhoid Mary of
union busting.''
   Charles Bryan, leader of the striking Machinists, said of
Lorenzo: ``There's never been a more classic example of a robber
baron.'' He described the stand let the rest of it sink,''
said Blanchard, wearing his pilot's cap.
   Police in bulletproof vests stood outside the hotel where Lorenzo
spoke, and 21 motorcycle officers parked in formation outside. There
were no disruptions.
   A marathon runner, Lorenzo was raised by Spanish immigrants in
the New York City borough of Queens, within earshot of LaGuardia
Airport's jets. A one-time member of the Teamsters union, he drove a
Coca-Cola truck and had the schoolboy nickname ``Frankie Smooth
Talk.''
   A graduate of Columbia and Harvard Business School, he worked as
an analyst for Eastern before building his airline empire.
   The hard-driving Lorenzo apologized to Eastern employees, their
families and travelers affected by the strike. ``I'm very sorry to
see these people impacted,'' he said. ``The events of the last week
are very troubling.''
   He got the only laugh of an hour-long news conference when he was
asked if Eastern had been a bad buy.
   ``It sure hasn't done much for my leisure time,'' Lorenzo
answered, saying his golf and tennis time have suffered.

   An Army warrant officer who admitted receiving
more than $100,000 from 1983 to 1988 to provide classified military
information to East Germany and the Soviet Union was sentenced
Thursday to 40 years confinement and fined $50,000.
   Warrant Officer James W. Hall III, 30, of Sharon Springs, N.Y.,
showed no emotion as he was sentenced by Col. Howard C. Eggers, the
military judge who presided at the court-martial at Fort McNair here.
   Eggers also sentenced Hall to a dishonorable discharge from the
Army and ordered him to forfeit all future pay and allowances.
   Hall, who had pleaded guilty Monday to 10 counts of espionage,
attempted espionage and failing to obey Army regulations, will be
eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 10 years.
   Most of the government's case against Hall, including the details
of his espionage activities, was outlined for Eggers during closed
sessions of the court-martial.
   Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security
clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., and accused of
delivering exposed film and documents dealing with communications
intelligence and war plans to Warsaw Pact nations.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst at the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in 1976 and spent most of
his career in Europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and
telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Col. David Armitage, chief of the Army's forensic psychiatry
division at Walter Reed Army Hospital, testified Thursday that his
examinations of Hall suggested that Hall was motivated primarily by
money.
   Army prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed during the
court-martial that Hall had received payments totaling between
$100,000 and $200,000 during the five years that he worked as a spy
for East Germany and the Soviet Union. During part of that time, he
was on a $30,000 per year retainer from East Germany.
   Before leaving Europe to return to the United States in 1987,
according to testimony, Hall received a medal and a $5,000 bonus
from the East German government.
   After his arrest, Hall began cooperating with military
authorities. He entered into a pretrial agreement in which he
volunteered to submit to ``unlimited debriefings'' and polygraph
examinations about his spy activities.
   He also agreed to testify, if called, against Huseyin Yildirim, a
Turkish-born naturalized citizen to whom Hall allegedly passed the
intelligence information.
   Yildirim, 60, was arrested at his home is Belleair Beach, Fla.,
last December and charged with conspiracy to commit espionage by
giving agents of a foreign government national defense secrets. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   The pretrial agreement prohibited the Army from seeking the death
penalty against Hall. It also included an agreement, which Eggers
was not permitted to see until after sentencing, that set Hall's
maximum sentence at 45 years confinement.

   President Bush began talks Thursday about a
replacement for John Tower even before his nomination to run the
Pentagon was rejected, a senior official said, and the
administration promised a swift decision on a new candidate.
   A new nomination may come before week's end, said the official,
who refused to be identified other than as a senior administration
official. ``Obviously we're interested in moving rapidly.''
   Possible choices include Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, and former
Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., as well as onetime defense secretaries
Donald Rumsfeld and James Schlesinger, said sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
he was not in line to be defense secretary, but that did not dampen
speculation that he was being considered.
   Some members of Congress have suggested a job swap between
Scowcroft and Tower, since the national security adviser's job does
not require confirmation.
   Two hours before the Senate rejected Tower, 53-47, Bush left
Washington for a speech-making visit in New York. Before his
departure, Bush spoke briefly with Scowcroft about a replacement for
Tower, said the senior administration official.
   The official said a long list of candidates had been compiled.
``There's been a list for a long time,'' the official said, noting
that names had been compiled before Tower was finally selected last
December. ``We're not starting from scratch.''
   Other names being mentioned were Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a
former Navy secretary; former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis;
Frank Borman, onetime astronaut turned business executive; and
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser under President
Carter and a supporter of Bush in the presidential campaign.
   In a written statement, Bush said Tower had devoted his life to
public service. ``Instead of the recompense of a grateful nation,
John Tower's lot in the past weeks has been a cruel ordeal.''
   ``For this I am truly sorry for both him and his family,'' Bush
said.
   Bush also called Tower and said, ``I am with you. I'm sorry about
the outcome. You've done a great job. We care about you and the
family.'' His comments were relayed by White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   While saying he disagreed with the Senate vote, Bush made clear
he wants to move on from the divisive debate over Tower. ``We owe it
to the American people to come together and move forward,'' Bush
said.
   Bush was called by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the fight against Tower.
They expressed interest in working with Bush in a cooperative and
constructive fashion, Fitzwater said.
   Bush said he appreciated the call and the spirit in which it was
made, the press secretary said.
   Washington buzzed with the names of possible successors.
   ``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and
the national security adviser and any number of congressmen and
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on
the tip of their tongue,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``And they are more than willing and ready to provide those names
and to begin consideration of them when the time comes,'' he added.
   Fitzwater said there was no timetable for picking a new Pentagon
chief but said Bush would act ``very rapidly.''
   After a bitter debate, the Senate rejected Tower's nomination in
a late-afternoon vote. Tower had been dogged by allegations of
excessive drinking, womanizing and conflict of interest with defense
contractors.
   Cohen, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and the
vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, helped lead the
Senate fight for Tower's nomination. His nomination would not cost
Republican strength in the Senate since Maine has a Republican
governor, John McKernan, who would make sure the seat remains in GOP
hands.
   On the other hand, the selection of Warner would cost the GOP in
the Senate since Virginia's Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles would
surely fill the vacancy with a member of his own party.
   Edwards was the senior Republican on the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee for many years and was highly regarded for his
knowledge of the defense budget and defense issues. He most recently
was co-chairman of a presidential commission which recommended
closing obsolete military bases.
   Throughout the long fight over Tower's nomination, White House
officials were under orders from Bush not to talk about other
candidates. However, that prohibition dissolved Thursday when it
became certain that Tower's nomination was doomed.
   Putting the best face on the episode, Fitzwater said, ``We fought
a long fight, hard and well. Out of this struggle has come a good
unity with the Republican Party. We brought the administration team
together and we feel that it's been a tempering affair that should
serve us well as we move forward.''
   White House officials _ Scowcroft among them _ have complained
that the holdup on Tower's nomination has slowed the administration
down on matters of national security.
   The Pentagon has missed congressional deadlines for three reports
on important military issues and does not have a secretary
representing it during a special 90-day strategic military policy
review ordered by Bush.
   On a broader scale, the Tower battle dominated the White House
agenda, at times overshadowing other issues Bush wanted to highlight.
   Defense officials worry privately that even under the best of
circumstances, it will be weeks more before a new candidate can be
picked, undergo a background check and win confirmation.

<TEXT>
   Alexandra Zaharnovna, a granddaughter of
Soviet revolutionary Leon Trotsky, died Thursday in Moscow after a
long bout with cancer, her half brother said. She was 65.
   Esteban Volkow Bronstein, a Mexican citizen and Trotsky's
grandson, said a friend telephoned him the news of Zaharnovna's
death.
   Trotsky, born Lev Davidovitch Bronstein, was founder of the Red
Army and one of the revolutionaries who overthrew the czar and set
up a Communist regime in Russia. He was exiled by Josef Stalin after
a power struggle in the 1920s. In 1940 Stalin had Trotsky
assassinated in Mexico.
   Volkow, who was 14 at the time, found his grandfather lying on
the floor of his study, bleeding from ice ax wounds to the head.
   Volkow, now 62, and Zaharnovna had not seen each other for 57
years, but were reunited in Moscow last December when Soviet
authorities granted Volkow a visa.
   Volkow told The Associated Press he saw the gesture as part of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachov's policy of greater openness and
another step toward Trotsky's eventual rehabilitation.
   Alexandra Zaharnovna was born in Moscow in 1923, the daughter of
Zahar Mobline and Trotsky's daughter Zina.
   Volkow had last seen Zaharnovna in 1931, when he and their mother
were expelled from the Soviet Union. Zaharnovna remained behind.
Volkow came to live with Trotsky in Mexico after Zina Bronstein
killed herself in Paris.
   Both Volkow's father, Platon Volkow, and Zaharnovna's, Zahar
Mobline, died in Stalin's concentration camps, along with much of
the family.
   In the Soviet Union, Zaharnovna spent six months in jail and five
years in internal exile. She was reviled and isolated because of her
relationship to Trotsky, Volkow said.
   She returned to Moscow in 1954, after Stalin died, to become a
metallurgical engineer, marry, and bear a daughter. But she stayed
out of the limelight. Volkow did not even know she was alive until
late last year, when a French historian found out where she was
living.
   ``Alexandra had taken the decision to emerge from her anonymity,
to publicly acknowledge her relation and her heritage only a few
weeks earlier,'' Volkow said in an interview in January.
   ``She said she wasn't afraid of anything anymore. Not after all
that had happened to her _ and her illness.''
   Volkow said Zaharnovna's husband, Anatol, and her child, Olga,
survive her, but she did not live with them and Volkow does not know
where they are.
   He said Zaharnovna will be buried Saturday in Moscow.
   ``The cancer that sapped her body did not sap the spirit that had
already survived decades of persecution as a member of the Trotsky
family,'' Volkow said.

   The Senate on Thursday rejected the nomination
of John Tower as defense secretary, 53-47, handing President Bush a
major defeat in his first high-stakes showdown with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Bush said he would act swiftly to submit a replacement candidate
to the Senate, but had no timetable for making a decision. White
House officials began the process of reviewing other possible
nominees almost immediately.
   ``The Senate has made its determination,'' Bush said. ``I respect
its role in doing so but disagree with the outcome.''
   Bush said Tower should have received ``the recompense of a
grateful nation,'' but instead his ``lot in past weeks has been a
cruel ordeal. For this I am truly sorry for both him and his
family.''
   Tower's nomination was scuttled by concerns about his drinking
habits, coupled with senatorial unhappiness that he left his
government post as arms negotiator and quickly began earning
hundreds of thousands of dollars as a defense industry consultant.
   The vote was the culmination of a tumultuous six-day Senate
debate and closely followed party lines. Howell Heflin of Alabama;
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut were the
only Democrats to support the nomination, and one Republican _ Nancy
Kassebaum of Kansas _ voted against.
   At the Pentagon, Tower, who watched the Senate vote on
television, appeared briefly in a private dining room reserved for
the defense secretary and read a statement before a TV camera and
two reporters. He declined to take questions, simply saying ``thank
you'' before he left.
   ``I will be recorded as the first Cabinet nominee in the history
of the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency
and perhaps be harshly judged,'' he said.
   ``But I depart from this place at peace with myself, knowing that
I have given a full measure of devotion to my country.''
   He said no other public figure ``has been subjected to such a
far-reaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny.''
   ``And yet, there is no finding that I have ever breached
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my
duty,'' he said.
   Tower said he would return to private life in Texas but would
remain ``deeply grateful'' to Bush for his support and ``obliged to
my old colleagues in the Senate who rallied to me with fervor, zeal
and eloquence in the face of staggering political odds.''
   Tower also received a telephone call from Bush, who expressed his
disappointment with the outcome, Fitzwater said.
   Tower, according to Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., had been willing
to step aside to allow Bush to select another nominee. ``He offered
to withdraw more than once to the president and the president would
have none of it,'' Wilson said.
   The Senate rendered its verdict in an atmosphere of unusual
formality. Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the session,
practically all senators remained in their chairs during the roll
call and the gallery was packed with spectators.
   ``We ought to hang our heads after what we've done to this good
man,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said in a final
defiant speech. ``America has lost a good public servant. The
president has won because he stood by his man.''
   Majority Leader George Mitchell summed up for opponents, saying
Tower's experience and competence on defense issues weren't at
issue. But ``serious problems exist'' with conflict of interest and
``character integrity,'' he said.
   He said, ``I emphasize my strongly held belief that this should
not be interpreted as a vote to harm the president,'' but
acknowledged that others saw it that way.
   Senators of both parties condemned the bitter partisan debate
that consumed the Senate and Mitchell and Dole both said they hoped
there would be no lasting damage.
   After the vote, Mitchell and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, telephoned Bush and expressed their
hope that Congress and the administration ``can work together to
deal with the serious problems of the country in a postive and
cooperative spirit.''
   Bush responded positively, Mitchell said.
   But later, some senators, including Dole, said the rancorous
battle would not easily be forgotten.
   ``The Democrats decided this man had a mind of his own. Let's
find someone else,'' Dole said in an interview on CBS News. ``Some
said it was `Nunn'-partisan. This is going into the memory bank.''
   ``A lot of people are going to remembers this one for a long,
long time,'' said Wilson.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained that Tower got ``the rawest
of deals. Even the American Civil Liberties Union would object to
the way John Tower was treated.''
   The rejection of Tower marked only the ninth time in history the
Senate has turned down a president's Cabinet nominee, and the first
such decision since 1959, when the Senate voted against confirming
President Eisenhower's nominee for secretary of commerce, Lewis L.
Strauss.
   Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a
replacement candidate included Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking
GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former
secretary of the Navy; Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, a member of the
committee; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and former Rep.
Jack Edwards, R-Ala..
   Cohen, questioned after the vote, said he had not heard about the
speculation, and added: ``I'm interested in doing what I'm doing
right now.'' And Warner said he has ``indicated very clearly that
I'm going to finish my job as United States senator.''
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, also was
mentioned but told reporters ``no,'' he was not in line for the post.
   The debate drew to an end with the last handful of uncommitted
senators declaring their intentions.
   Kassebaum was the only Republican to break ranks with her party.
She cited Tower's consulting work for defense contractors shortly
after he served as an arms control negotiator, saying it raised
``very serious concerns'' about his judgment and ``sensitivity to
those major issues of conflict of interest, the role of consultants
and the revolving door.''
   Later, Kassebaum said she would have voted for Tower if hers was
the deciding vote.
   ``I had told the president I would have voted for him even though
I had serious misgivings,'' she said. ``Because at that point I
wouldn't have wanted to be the vote to defeat.''
   Another Republican who had indicated he would oppose the
nomination, Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, instead announced
he would vote for Tower.

   American space researcher James A. Van
Allen was named the winner Wednesday of the 1989 Crafoord Prize for
his discovery 31 years ago of the radiation belts surrounding the
Earth.
   The Royal Academy of Sciences also cited the professor emeritus
at the University of Iowa for providing the first instruments ever
carried to another planet, those taken on the 1963 mission to Venus
by Mariner II.
   His work with the Explorer I satellite led to the discovery in
1958 of the Earth's radiation belts, now called the Van Allen belts.
   The prize, which includes a $252,000 cash award, is given
annually by the Royal Academy, which also awards Nobel Prizes.
   The award was founded in 1980 for excellence in physical sciences
outside those stipulated by the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel:
chemistry, physics, and medicine.

<HEAD>Avant Garde Photographer Dies At 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avant garde photographer Robert Mapplethorpe,
considered among the most prominent young artists in his field, died
Thursday at a Boston hospital at the age of 42.
   Mapplethorpe, who lived in New York City and had suffered from
AIDS for three years, died at Deaconness Hospital, according to
friends. The hospital refused to release any information.
   Mapplethorpe, whose work focused heavily on homosexual themes,
was best known for his startling photography of sadomasochism and
his depiction of athletic male nudes. He also was known for
photographs of celebrities.
   His favorite medium was black and white photography but he also
experimented with color. Most of his work, whether of people or
objects, is presented as if they were pieces of sculpture.
   ``I want to get a picture that is the way I want to remember
someone. It's like a diary in the end,'' Mapplethorpe once said.
``My work is about order. I am a perfectionist.''
   A major retrospective of his work was recently shown in New York
at the Whitney Museum.
   At the time of his death, an exhibit of his works titled ``Robert
Mapplethrope: The Perfect Moment'' was in Chicago at the Museum of
Contemporary Art on the second leg of a five-city American tour that
began in Philadelphia.
   He emerged in the mid-1970s as part of an offbeat culture that
included longtime friend rock singer Patti Smith. He worked in
several media, including collage and film.
   At least four books on his works have been published.

   Here are some past instances this decade of expulsions of Soviet
personnel from the United States and of U.S. personnel from the
Soviet Union:
   March 7, 1983: Richard Osborne, U.S. economics attache in Moscow,
expelled.
   June 12, 1983: Louis Thomas, a civilian working in the U.S.
Embassy security division, expelled. Soviet media say he had been
caught during a ``pre-arranged conspiracy meeting.''
   August 17, 1983: Anatoly Yevgenyevich Skripko, an attache at the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, expelled.
   August 19, 1983: Yuri Petrovich Leonov, an assistant air attache
at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, expelled. Skripko and Leonov
are declared persona non grata.
   Sept. 12, 1983: Lon David Augustenborg, U.S. diplomat, expelled
from the Soviet Union. He and his wife had been detained outside
Leningrad and accused of trying to collect what Soviet newspapers
called a ``spy container.''
   Nov. 6, 1983: Norman J. Zabusky, University of Pittsburgh
Mathematics Professor on exchange in Moscow, expelled for ``conduct
unacceptable.'' Zabusky had spoken with a group of Refusenik
scientists.
   June 1984: Bruce Rosenberg, U.S. economics officer, is
``compelled'' to leave after being accused of speculating in Western
goods and distributing anti-Soviet materials, Soviet media say.
   May 13, 1985: Regina Sipple, American tourist from Salt Lake
City, expelled from Moscow for carrying biblical literature and
cassettes.
   June 1985: Paul Stombaugh, expert on Baltic States in the U.S.
Embassy's political section, expelled; Soviet media say he was
ordered out for ``conducting an espionage action.''
   March 14, 1986: Michael Sellers, second secretary at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, is accused of spying and of having a
``clandestine meeting'' with a Soviet citizen and expelled. The
action came a week after the United States angered the Kremlin by
ordering Soviet missions to the United Nations in New York to cut
from 279 personnel to 170.
   May 14, 1986: Erik Sites, attache of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow,

reductions in the Soviet UN staff.
   Oct. 19, 1986: The Kremlin expels for actions ``incompatible with
their official status'' First Secretary William Norville, Third
Secretary Charles Ehrenfried, attaches Gary Lonnquist and David
Harris from the embassy in Moscow. A consular staff employee in
Leningrad, Jack Roberts, also is expelled.
   Oct. 21, 1986: The U.S. expells 55 Soviet diplomats from
Washington and San Francisco. Fifty of these were ordered out to
bring the Soviet staffs to parity with the U.S. contingents in
Moscow and Leningrad. The remaining five are declared persona non
grata: Vasily Fedotov, Oleg Likeachev and Aleksandr Metelkin,
counselors; Nikolay Kokovin, attache, and Lev Zaytsev, consul.
   Oct. 22, 1986: The Kremlin expels Naval attache Capt. Thomas

   The government has targeted nine former Iranian
Embassy employees for deportation if they do not leave Britain
voluntarily within 10 days, an immigration official said Thursday.
   The U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said he has
issued appeals to protect the life of British author Salman Rushdie,
whose new novel led to the Britain-Iran dispute.
   Iran's official radio said Britain must bear responsibility for
``the sacred wrath of Moslems'' as a result of its stance on the
book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A conservative Roman Catholic bishop in the Netherlands joined
Moslems in denouncing the book, saying it ``defiled'' the figure of
Mohammed.
   Spain's national EFE news agency quoted intelligence sources as
saying an Iranian commando team recently was in that country trying
to obtain weapons, apparently to kill Rushdie and collect a $5.2
million bounty offered by Iranian clerics.
   An Interior Ministry official cast doubt on the report, which
also said the team had dispersed and infiltrated Britain, West
Germany and France. Officials in Britain said they had no
information to confirm the report.
   Critics of ``The Satanic Verses'' say it blasphemes Islam by
portraying Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and insinuating Mohammed
wrote the Koran himself rather than receiving it from God.
   The book led Iran to break relations with Britain on Tuesday.
Britain, in turn, announced Wednesday it plans to expel ``a number''
of Iranians because of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's refusal to
revoke his death sentence against Rushdie.
   The author, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family,
has been in hiding since the Feb. 14 execution order.
   ``I can confirm to you that the names of nine Iranian individuals
have been sent over to the FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office),''
a spokesman for the Home Office, the department responsible for
immigration, said Thursday.
   ``This would be to initiate the proceedings to secure their
removal,'' he said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. When asked if they were former embassy employees who no
longer have diplomatic status, he said, ``I can confirm that.''
   About 25,000 Iranians live in Britain, including 2,400 students.
   According to the Spanish news report, seven Iranians were tracked
in Spain more than 10 days ago. It quoted intelligence sources as
saying the group apparently tried but failed to obtain weapons in
Spain to kill Rushdie.
   Spain's Secretary of State for Security, Rafael Vera, told The
Associated Press, ``There has been an error in the way the
information has been given.'' He refused to elaborate.
   Perez de Cuellar, in Nepal as part of an Asian trip, told
reporters it is important not to dramatize the issue but to make
appeals to ensure the death order is not carried out.
   ``I have already made more than one appeal in order to protect
the life of this gentleman who authored the book. But, at the same
time, I was sad to see that expressions were written which were
offensive for millions of Moslem people all over the world,'' he
added.
   Tehran Radio, in a commentary monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp., declared that ``this is just the beginning of
the path for Iran, as well as for other world Moslems.''
   ``In the event that Britain does not want to abandon its improper
and anti-Islamic posture and does not make a retreat in this regard,
it must reciprocally bear liability for everything that is to follow
henceforth.
   ``The sacred wrath of Moslems will not subside through the
expulsion of some Iranian Moslems from Britain or by closing down
the Iranian consulate in Hong Kong,'' Tehran Radio said.
   Bishop H.J.A. Bomers of the Netherlands gave unexpected support
to Moslems in an interview with Dutch radio Thursday.
   Bomers, who conceded he had not read ``The Satanic Verses,'' said
Khomeini's threat was ``totally wrong'' but added, ``It is not the
Moslem protesters'' who are to blame for the furor over Rushdie's
book.
   ``You can't just go and defile a historic figure who is believed
and respected by millions of people today,'' Bomers said in a
reference to the prophet Mohammed.
   Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, made his first public statement
on the controversy, telling a newspaper Khomeini's death threat
``does more damage to Islam than Salman Rushdie's book.'' He was
quoted by the Saudi newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat.

<TEXT>
   President Bush served notice Thursday to
cop-killing drug traffickers that ``hunting season is over'' and
said he is determined to attack the nation's drug problem on both
the supply and demand fronts.
   Kicking off what the White House has billed as ``drug week,''
Bush flew to New York to pay tribute to Drug Enforcement
Administration agents killed in the line of duty.
   Bush, who headed a drug interdiction task force as vice
president, told his audience at the DEA's New York offices that ``it
used to be unthinkable to shoot a cop.''
   But heightened pressure against drug traffickers has raised the
level of violence, he said, citing the recent slaying of DEA agent
Everett Hatcher.
   Just before his speech, Bush met with Hatcher's widow, Mary Jane
Hatcher.
   Later, Bush used an address to the United Negro College Fund to
sound his anti-drug theme.
   ``My friends, drug abuse is America's 20th Century version of
human slavery,'' Bush said. ``It chains the spirit and imperils the
ability to learn.''
   He vowed to wage ``unconditional war'' against drug abuse and
said, ``We must fight on every front: education, treatment,
interdiction, enforcement.''
   Bush had been scheduled to kick off his anti-drug crusade Tuesday
with appearances in Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington, Del., but bad
weather forced the cancellation of that trip.
   In Thursday's speech to drug enforcement officers, the president
cited legislation passed by Congress last year providing the death
penalty for drug kingpins who commit murder while trafficking in
drugs.
   ``Just as the penalty for cop killers helps even the odds,
stripping our enemies of their ill-gotten gains turns the table in a
dramatic and highly effective way,'' he said, adding:
   ``I have some bad news for the bad guys: Hunting season is over.
The rules on our side have changed too. It's about time.''
   ``Here in New York City, as in other cities across the country,
the war on drugs is no metaphor,'' he said. ``Before we could bury
Everett Hatcher last week, another officer was gunned down, felled
by a single shot fired point-blank beneath his bullet-proof vest.''
   ``Today, narcotics agents are sometimes the first ones shot,
targeted by criminals armed with a staggering array of battlefield
weaponry,'' he said.
   Nine DEA agents have been killed in the line of duty since 1982.
   Bush, who has opposed strict gun controls and who has defended
the right of sportsmen and hunters to have semiautomatic rifles, did
say in his speech that he has asked William Bennett, his drug policy
coordinator, to ``look into what can be done to prevent fully
automatic assault weapons from falling into the hands of the
criminals you face.''
   In choosing New York to launch his drug campaign, Bush went to a
city with an estimated 260,000 heroin addicts and 600,000 people
believed addicted to cocaine.
   On Feb. 9, Bush asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the war on
drugs, with the bulk of that going to law enforcement efforts,
including intensified border interdiction.
   At the same time, he is trying to put pressure on law enforcement
officials and leaders in other countries to staunch the flow of
drugs to the United States. Bush noted that he will soon receive a
report from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on his just-completed
trip to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.
   In an apparent jab at Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, Bush noted
that ``it's been over 25 years since anyone has faced the death
penalty in this state.'' The state legislature is oving to enact a
death penalty statute, which Cuomo opposes.
   ``While there may not be light at the end of the tunnel, there
does seem to be some light coming in under the door,'' the president
said. ``At the Apollo Theater in Harlem one Wednesday last month,
the amateur night performances were interrupted by spontaneous
anti-drug messages from the stage and chants from the crowd.''
   In the text of his speech to the United Negro College Fund, Bush
also discussed the importance of education, telling his audience,
``Education can give minorities a greater voice _ and make sure that
voice is heard.''
   The president also quoted slain civil right leader Martin Luther
King Jr.'s words that ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere.''
   The president declared:
   ``Black and white, together _ we know that America will not be a
good place for any of us to live until it is a good place for all of
us to live.'' r, Insert,000

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 236 more Haitians
sailing to the United States on Wednesday, bringing to more than 550
the number of refugees stopped and sent back home since Sunday.
   The latest refugees were packed onto two Haitian sailboats
stopped by Coast Guard cutters about 30 miles north of Haiti, Coast
Guard spokesman Jerry Snyder said.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents interviewed
the refugees on board the cutters and ordered them returned to
Port-au-Prince after deciding they were trying to enter the United
States for economic reasons, Snyder said.
   Two separate Haitian refugee groups attacked the INS procedure
Wednesday, claiming many Haitians who fear political persecution are
unjustly returned to their country.
   ``There is an automatic assumption that Haitians are economic
refugees,'' said Haitian Refugee Center attorney Cheryl Little at a
news conference in Miami's Little Haiti community.
   The New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Refugees
released a report criticizing the INS for interviewing Haitians in
international waters rather than inside the United States.
   ``The boat people intercepted on the high seas, ignorant of their
rights and fearful of repercussions should they testify to political
repression, are denied this opportunity,'' the 12-page report said.
   ``Many of the passengers on those few boats that do reach the
United States safely, when informed of their rights and given
adequate private interviews, ask for political asylum.''
   Leon Jennings, chief interdiction officer for the INS in Miami,
said ``nobody is ever sent back without asking them if they're
afraid. ... We're there to find out if anybody is going to be
persecuted.''
   The Coast Guard intercepted 113 Haitians on two 30-foot wooden
sailboats in international waters Tuesday off Fort Lauderdale and
Miami. Then 202 migrants aboard the Coast Guard cutter Bear were
returned to Haiti late Tuesday.
   The latest wave of refugees was caused by false rumors
circulating throughout Haiti last weekend that U.S. interdiction and
immigration policies were being relaxed, INS and Coast Guard
officials said.
   The Coast Guard has intercepted 837 Haitian migrants since
January 1.

   A first-year ski instructor who
survived an avalanche that killed two friends while they were skiing
out-of-bounds must pay more than $3,000 in fines and costs and make
public safety announcements.
   U.S. Magistrate Jill Clifton sentenced Todd Richards, 23, after
he pleaded no contest Wednesday to a charge of skiing out-of-bounds.
   Richards survived the avalanche near the Telluride Ski Area on
Feb. 14 with minor injuries, but Anthony Shelley of New Zealand and
Paul Wolfort of Telluride were killed.
   Richards, who returned to Grand Junction from his home in
Chelmsford, Mass., to enter his plea, admitted he and his two
companions illegally entered an area known as ``Temptation Gulch.''
   ``I ducked a rope'' marking the area as out-of-bounds, Richards
said.
   ``I almost lost my life, I lost two friends, I lost my dignity, I
lost my job, skiing privileges, hundreds of dollars worth of ski
equipment, thousands of dollars in costs,'' Richards said. ``I just
want to go home.''
   His attorney, William Harmsen, said Richards will make a
safe-skiing public safety message for the U.S. Forest Service and
that he already has spoken to students at Telluride High School
about the dangers of skiing out-of-bounds.
   Richards said he also is writing letters to editors about safe
skiing.
   His sentence includes paying $3,090 to various agencies for the
costs of his rescue and the recovery of the bodies of his friends
and a $2 fine for skiing out-of-bounds, as well as a $10 victims'
fund fee.

<HEAD>Electoral Reform Would Leave Senate Composition in Voters' Hands</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish voters would be the first in the
communist bloc to nominate and elect candidates to a new senate
under the proposal approved Thursday by government and opposition
negotiators.
   The current Sejm, or parliament, has only one chamber, and in the
past only approved candidates were placed on the ballot by the
Communist Party or its two allied parties working through a
party-dominated electoral commission.
   The voter had the option of crossing out candidates on the
ballot, but write-in candidates were not allowed, and independent
groups could not field their own candidates for parliament.
   The newly created senate was agreed upon by government and
opposition negotiators of a working group on political reform that
forms part of larger ``round-table'' negotiations on Poland's future.
   Negotiators must still work out details of the electoral law. But
in general, anyone nominated by an existing social or political
group or who gathered an as yet undetermined number of signatures
could run on the ballot in the first round of two-stage elections,
negotiators said.
   The government side has proposed that 5,000 signatures be
required to nominate a candidate. The opposition is likely to press
for a smaller number.
   Before, voters theoretically had a choice among different
candidates. But a majority of the seats were contested only by
Communist candidates, guaranteeing that no matter which individuals
won the races, the Communists would gain the majority.
   A certain negotiated minority of seats would be given in the same
manner to the Communist-allied Peasants Party and Democratic Party,
plus a handful of seats to independents or members of certain
semi-independent organizations, such as the Polish Catholic Social
Union.
   Until last year's local elections, the party's preferred
candidate in any race was listed at the top of the ballot, and any
unmarked ballots were credited automatically to that candidate. A
party loyalist never needed even to look at the ballot before
voting, merely to drop it blank into the box.
   Unlike the current system in which each party receives a
pre-allocated number of seats, the balance of power in the new
senate would be determined solely by the voters. Party Politburo
member Janusz Reykowski said there would be no attempt to arrange
its composition beforehand.
   In addition, negotiators agreed that opposition would be free to
run for at least 35 percent of the seats to the Sejm, which will
remain the most powerful parliament chamber.
   Sixty-five percent of the Sejm seats would only be contested by
the Communist Party and its allies.
   Although the new senate elections will be free for the first
time, some opposition activists have cautioned that the Communist
Party will still have important advantages.
   For example, no opposition political parties exist legally in
Poland, independent groups here have no experience in mounting
electoral campaigns, and the amount of media exposure that the
state-controlled press and television will give opposition
candidates is still unresolved.
   Finally, authorities have insisted on elections in June, leaving
the independents little time to mount effective campaigns.

<HEAD>Two Rescued After 9 Hours In Rough Seas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYPORT, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two commercial fishermen whose boat sank
when pounded by a freak wave were rescued more than nine hours later
by a Navy helicopter after being spotted by a Coast Guard search
jet, officials said.
   The captain of the Patricia C., Don Rynn of St. Augustine, and
crewman Greg Oja of Jacksonville were treated at a hospital for
hypothermia suffered in the 58-degree Atlantic Ocean. They later
were released.
   The 42-foot fishing boat, laden with a catch of sharks, sank
about 4 a.m. Wednesday some 32 miles northeast of St. Augustine,
said Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Harmon at Mayport Coast Guard
Station.
   Finding the two in 10-foot seas was ``probably one of the best
rescues we have pulled off in a while. It was definitely a feat,''
Harmon said.
   Rynn said he was asleep in a bunk in the wheelhouse when the wave
broke through the port wheelhouse wall, throwing him onto the floor.
   ``The boat was nearly swamped by that one breaking wave,'' he
said. He quickly radioed for help and grabbed an emergency position
transmitter and fish box lid and headed toward the back deck to jump
into the water.
   Before he could jump, another wave hit the boat and he lost the
transmitter and fish box lid. Oja, meanwhile, had grabbed some life
jackets, and he gave one to Rynn as both men took to the dark water.
   The two men saw a Coast Guard jet fly over twice between 6 a.m.
and 7 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``After that, there was nothing and we began thinking that we
might not make it, although we were determined that we were going
to,'' Rynn said.
   About 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Coast Guard called some of Rynn's
friends in St. Augustine and told them they were afraid the two
fishermen might not be found.
   ``My friends told them where I was supposed to be shark fishing
and that's how they found us,'' Rynn said.
   ``At 1 p.m., a Coast Guard jet made a pass over us and dropped a
flare. Then he circled back and dropped another one,'' Rynn said.
``Right after that, the helicopter pulled us up. It was an excellent
rescue. A really super job.''
   Harmon said the hurried distress call was heard by the Florida
Marine Patrol and two fishing boats, but ``none of them got the same
location of the boat.''
   As soon as the call came in, a Coast Guard helicopter from
Savannah, Ga., a Coast Guard jet from Miami and a Navy helicopter
were dispatched to begin searching.
   The jet's crew spotted debris from the boat about 1 p.m.
Wednesday, and the men were nearby. A helicopter from Mayport Naval
Station pulled them out.
   Rynn said the Patricia C., with about 1,500 dead sharks aboard,
lies in about 120 feet of water. He is making plans to try to raise
the boat.

<HEAD>`Jerome Robbins' Broadway' Eligible for Best Musical Tony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' the biggest hit of
the theater season, can be nominated for best musical, but its
choreography, sets and costumes are ineligible for prizes, the Tony
Awards administration committee ruled Thursday.
   The 24-member committee also determined that Robbins' direction
of the show, a cavalcade of dances from 11 of his old musicals, is
eligible for a nomination as is the new lighting designed by
Jennifer Tipton.
   Tony Awards can help a show at the box office, particularly a
play. Last season's best-play winner, ``M. Butterfly,'' didn't start
to sell out until it had won the top award.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' an $8 million musical, includes
scenes from Robbins' productions from ``On the Town'' in 1944 to
``Fiddler on the Roof'' in 1964.
   In declining to allow nominations for the show's choreography,
sets and costumes, the committee said they ``substantially
duplicated those in other productions.''
   The administration committee consists of 10 members of the League
of American Theaters and Producers, 10 members of the American
Theater Wing and four members of the stage unions.
   Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the league, called the
meeting ``cordial and very measured. There was no hysteria.''
   Some members of the theater community had predicted a fierce
battle over eligibility for ``Jerome Robbins' Broaday'' between the
Shubert Organization, which co-produced the Robbins show, and the
Nederlander Organization, which runs the theater where another
potential musical nominee, ``Black and Blue,'' is playing.
   The Tony nominations will be announced May 8 and the awards given
on June 4.

   Police raided a kidnappers' hideout
Wednesday night, rescuing a Japanese business executive and killing
two of the men who abducted him a week ago in neighboring Laos,
authorities said Thursday.
   Yoshiaki Asao, 61, was abducted by four gunmen March 1 in the
Laotian capital of Vientiane, where he was branch manager of the
trading firm Mitsui and Co. The intruders seized him at his home
after tying up his wife, Michiko, and two maids.
   Asao was rescued in Thailand's Loei province, which is just to
the west of Nong Khai, a border town that is a main trading and
social link between Thailand and Communist-ruled Laos. Loei is about
270 miles northeast of Bangkok.
   It was not immediately known what happened to the other two
kidnappers.
   Mitsui and Co. Vice President Minoru Nakamura told a news
conference in Tokyo that there was no ransom demand and ``no contact
at all'' with the kidnappers. But Japan's Kyodo News Service,
quoting a source in Bangkok, said the kidnappers demanded $2.8
million.
   Japan established diplomatic relations with Laos in 1976, the
year after the Communists seized power in the landlocked Southeast
Asian nation.
   The kidnapping came at a time when Laos has been trying to
attract investment from the capitalist countries in a bid to develop
one of the world's poorest economies.

<HEAD>U.N. Protests To Israel Over Closing Of Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Nations has protested Israel's
temporary closing of the Lebanon-Israeli border to U.N. peacekeeping
troops, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   Israel closed the border for nearly 20 hours, from Tuesday
afternoon until Wednesday morning.
   ``This unacceptable action was stated to be in retaliation'' for
an incident Tuesday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops blocked
Israeli army vehicles from entering the village of Ebel es Saqi,
said Nadia Younes, spokeswoman for Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Ms. Younes said that under a longstanding informal agreement, the
Israeli army is barred from deploying vehicles in Ebel es Saqi,
where the headquarters of the Norwegian battalion of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon are located.
   The Israel Defense Forces ``challenged UNIFIL's action and a
tense situation ensued,'' during which an Israeli tank was used to
force U.N. vehicles off the road, said Ms. Younes.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said at a military base in
northern Israel on Wednesday: ``We have said time and again, when it
comes to UNIFIL, that we don't ask them to stay here, we don't ask
them to leave, but at the same time we will not allow any change in
their deployment and any interference by UNIFIL to the freedom of
movement of the IDF. This is the way that we see it.''
   The peacekeeping troops of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
patrol a narrow strip north of Israel's self-declared ``security
zone,'' which forms a buffer zone between northern Israeli
settlements and Shiite and Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.
   Last month, the commander of the Norwegian battalion compared
Israeli army actions in south Lebanon to Nazi tactics in World War
II. Israel demanded his removal because of the comment.
   Israel and a Christian-dominated militia it backs, the South
Lebanon Army, prevent UNIFIL from controlling much of the area in
southern Lebanon that it is supposed to watch over.
   UNIFIL deploys about 5,800 men from Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana,
Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Sweden.

   Foreign tourists were expelled from Lhasa on
Thursday, and Chinese troops began rounding up Tibetans in the city
and hauling them away in trucks, a Tibetan woman said.
   China said four more people had died after suffering injuries
earlier this week in the Tibetan capital during bloody protests of
Chinese communist rule in the remote mountain region.
   The report brought the official death toll to 16. Western
travelers have quoted Tibetans as saying that many more have died.
Most Tibetans reportedly put the figure at between 20 and 30.
   Some Western tourists accused Chinese troops of atrocities, a
charge denied by a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   ``They're grabbing everyone,'' said the Tibetan woman,
interviewed late Thursday by telephone from Beijing. ``Soldiers are
all over the place and they're grabbing everyone.''
   Another Tibetan woman said when contacted by telephone on Friday
that it was quiet with the army occupying ``all the roads. ... There
are new arrests. ... There are many, but we don't know how many.''
   A man came on the line and said: ``Don't talk a long time. There
are a lot of police. We can't talk long.''
   Several foreigners who work in Lhasa have been allowed to remain,
but foreign tourists, estimated at 140, were ordered to leave by
Thursday _ the eve of the 30th anniversary of a rebellion in Tibet.
   The first Tibetan woman, speaking from a hotel in the city, said
the last of them departed Thursday, some for the airport to wait for
a Friday flight to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Others
took a bus to neighboring Qinghai province or the Nepalese border,
she said.
   She said the soldiers then began rounding up Tibetans.
   ``Many people. It is many more than when the foreigners were
here. I can't speak to you, we are all afraid,'' she said.
   Tibetan women at two other hotels also said the foreigners had
left the city, and one seconded the report of detentions.
   Foreign reporters were barred from the city and there was no way
to confirm their observations independently.
   Western travelers who arrived in Chengdu on a flight from Lhasa
said Tibetans had feared mass arrests.
   ``People begged us repeatedly over the last few days _ `Tell the
world, help us, please,''' said an American from New Orleans, one of
40 foreigners on the flight.
   One group on the flight issued a statement they said would be
sent to the United Nations and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual
leader who fled China after the 1959 uprising.
   ``The world community should carefully and critically examine the
causes of this conflict and the methods and motives of the
authorities,'' said the statement, signed by 35 foreigners.
   ``Shootings by the authorities have been excessive,
unpredictable, indiscriminate and there have on occasion been
atrocities,'' it said.
   State-run radio reported the four additional riot-related deaths.
It said the people died in the hospital ``during emergency
life-saving procedures.'' The report did not say whether the dead
were Tibetans.
   During three days of riots that began Sunday, thousands of
Tibetans ransacked Chinese-owned shops and set fire to Chinese
property.
   China imposed martial law on the city of 70,000 at midnight
Tuesday, and thousands of troops moved in to set up checkpoints at
every block.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing on Thursday denied Chinese
authorities were violating human rights in Tibet. He blamed the
disturbances on a ``clique'' run by the Dalai Lama, who lives in
exile in India.
   The official Xinhua News Agency charged that members of ``a
separatist clique based abroad'' recently sneaked into Tibet with
weapons to instigate the riots, and said the protesters fired guns
``as they please.''
   Foreigners said demonstrators only threw rocks and used primitive
slingshots.
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said it recognized the
Chinese government's right to maintain order, but objected to the
``unwarranted use of lethal force'' against the protesters.
   Li said Thursday that China will not tolerate foreign meddling in
the situation.
   In a statement marking the anniversary of the 1959 uprising, the
Dalai Lama said from New Delhi that ``No amount of repression,
however brutal or violent, can silence the voice of freedom and
justice.''
   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of Chinese territory
for seven centuries. Most Tibetans maintain it was an independent
nation before the communists took over in 1949.
   The official media has given no figures on arrests, but the
Communist Party's official People's Daily reported from Lhasa how
police raided one home and pulled out a man screaming for leniency.
They then went next door and found a man hiding under a blanket,
according to the report.
   The man's wife was quoted as saying, ``Hurry up and dress and go
with them. I told you not to take part in the riots but you had to
anyway.''

<TEXT>
   An elderly World War II veteran on Thursday ended a
20-day hunger strike protesting Prince Philip's attendance at
Emperor Hirohito's funeral after a second appeal from Buckingham
Palace.
   Anthony Burgess, 70, recently received a letter on behalf of
Queen Elizabeth II saying she was ``personally concerned'' and
asking him to reconsider, said a palace spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Though Her Majesty fully appreciates the deep feelings which
have prompted you to take this course of action, she hopes that you
will reflect further and decide to end your fast,'' said the letter
written by the queen's private secretary, Sir William Heseltine.
   It said the queen decided to send her husband, Philip, to the
funeral for the Japanese emperor ``after receiving ministerial
advice that she should be represented by a senior member of her
family.''
   It added that she would be ``very sad'' if Burgess decided to
send back his war medals, as he had threatened to do.
   Burgess, who lives in Swansea, south Wales, stopped ingesting
anything but black tea last month to protest the visit of the
queen's husband to Hirohito's funeral Feb. 24.
   Veterans were angered that Philip, a veteran and patron of the
Burma Star veteran's association to which Burgess belongs, attended
the funeral of the man in whose name so many atrocities were
committed. He vowed to fast until Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and the prince apologized to soldiers.
   Burgess' condition was not known, but a friend and fellow
veteran, Ken Evans, said he was weak. He said the letter and the
concern of his relatives persuaded Burgess to stop his fast.

<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
has started deporting Central Americans, except for Nicaraguans,
under a tougher policy for political asylum cases, an INS
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``We have not deported any Nicaraguans,'' said INS spokeswoman
Virginia Kice. ``The Meese directive stands.''
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese in 1987 issued a
directive calling for special treatment of Nicaraguan political
asylum cases.
   Nine Central Americans were taken Thursday from the INS detention
center 20 miles northeast of Brownsville, and sent on buses to
Houston, Ms. Kice said. The two Hondurans, three El Salvadorans and
four Guatemalans will be flown to their countries Friday afternoon,
she added.
   ``We may not be deporting people every day, but this is the
second group we have deported under our new initiative,'' Ms. Kice
said.
   The INS on Feb. 21 began immediately detaining rejected political
asylum applicants and marking them for deportation in a one-day
adjudication process. Those detained are held under deportation
bonds of up to $4,000 here, and may resubmit their asylum cases
before an immigration judge.
   The first Central Americans deported under the new procedure left
the country Sunday, Ms. Kice said. On that day, 61 were flown out of
Houston, including 48 El Salvadorans, 10 Guatemalans and three
Hondurans, she said, adding the INS spent $16,553 to send them back.
   Ms. Kice said the Meese directive does not prohibit the INS from
deporting Nicaraguans, but ``it says we need to make a careful and
thorough review of cases involving Nicaraguans.''
   The INS spokeswoman said cases of Nicaraguans not granted asylum
would be referred to the Justice Department in Washington.
   Of 458 asylum applications submitted in southern Texas since Feb.
21, only 36 _ all Nicaraguans _ had been approved through Wednesday.
   Immigration officials held more than 2,700 undocumented aliens,
primarily Central Americans, in custody Thursday afternoon in
Cameron County, the state's southernmost.
   Political asylum is granted to those able to show they are
fleeing persecution. The INS contends that most Central Americans
seeking political asylum are actually applying for economic reasons,
and therefore do not qualify.
   Some INS critics blame the Meese directive for an influx of more
than 40,000 Nicaraguans and other Central Americans seeking asylum
after crossing the border illegally into southern Texas since last
spring.

   The pope, who summoned 35 American prelates to Rome for an

church teaching even if it is unpopular in today's world.
   But Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said the U.S. bishops face

fluctuating milieu composed of so many, many forces,'' he said in an

   He said he would need to look ``very carefully'' at whether the

in the meantime it could provide such support as trained health

Medicine their use of methyl tert-butyl ether, a substance that
until now has been used largely as a gasoline octane booster and as
an industrial solvent.
   Injecting it directly into the gallbladder, doctors found that it
quickly dissolved large stones, freeing patients from their painful
condition. A stone-crushing machine called a lithotriptor, already
widely used for kidney stones, is being tested against gallstones,
and a stone-dissolving drug was recently approved for routine use.

<HEAD>National Catholic Staff Getting New Leaders And New Headquarters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national staff of U.S. Roman Catholicism is moving into a new
home with a new chief and a newly consolidated crew to trumpet the
church's message to Americans.
   Structures on the grounds symbolize the accent on spreading the
Word: a tall statue of Jesus as ``light of the world,'' and the
great bulge of a satellite communications dish.
   They stand beside the new Washington office building that on
April 3 becomes headquarters of the U.S. Catholic Conference, the
church's national action agency.
   ``If Jesus were on Earth today, he would use all the contempoary
ways of explaining his message to the world,'' says the Rev. Kenneth
J. Doyle, director of the new Office for Media Relations.
   ``When he was here, he used the current methods, gathering crowds
on a hillside, an itinerant ministry. Today he would choose the most
modern advanced means of communicating, appearing on the Ted Koppel
show, giving interviews.''
   Doyle, 48, a priest-attorney-journalist from Albany, N.Y., was
named to his new post as a spokesman for U.S. Catholicism in a
reorganization in January of communications operations.
   As head of a key section, media relations, Doyle's job is to
channel information about the church's positions, activities and
personalities to secular news outlets.
   ``The church has a very positive story to tell, and we're trying
in every possible way to get that story out,'' he said in an
interview, adding that he intends full openness in doing it.
   Conceding that the church sometimes has been reluctant about that
in the past, he said, ``You don't ever have to shy away from the
truth. Any organization is going to have disagreements and at times
difficulties.''
   He noted that even in biblical times, the early church had its
conflicts and difficulties, which were thoroughly and openly
reported in the Book of Acts and the Epistles.
   He said that in the church's American cultural setting of
``freedom, openness and dealing with educated people,'' they
``expect reasonable explanations of church events and positions.''
   ``You never have to pretend that the church is without its human
elments,'' he said. ``My mission in this job is to tell the truth.
I'm utterly convinced that when the truth is known in its entirety,
the positive overshadows the negative.''
   The communications reorganization comes at the time of a
change-over in management of the conference and its preparation to
move into its new headquarters.
   Taking over as the new general secretary, the conference's chief
exeuctive, is the Rev. Robert Lynch, 47, who oversees the
conference's approximately 20 departments in various ecclesiastical
and social fields.
   Lynch succeeds Monsignor Daniel F. Hoye, 43, of Fall River,
Mass., who held the post seven years. Lynch, from Miami, has been
associate general secretary since 1984, and accompanied Pope John
Paul II on his two trips across America.
   The conference, with about 300 employes and an operating budget
of $10.7 million, has been housed at 1312 Massachusetts Avenue in
northwestern Washington for 42 years, but had far outgrown the space.
   ``There was incredible crowding, with about twice as many people
as could fit into the place,'' Doyle said.
   He said there is twice the space in the new $26.9 million,
five-story sandstone headquarters in northeast Washington, at 3211
Fourth St., on a five-acre tract adjoining the Catholic University
of America campus.
   The deputy director of the new media relations office, William A.
Ryan, previously was acting secretary for public affairs, and is a
veteran news specialist, highly knowledgeable about the church.
   Doyle, former bureau chief in Rome for National Catholic News
Service, has for the past three years been based in the New York
state capital of Albany as director of government relations for the
state Catholic conference.
   He said part of the reorganization stemmed from a ``conscious
decision to seek more coverage'' of religion in the media, and of
the church's ``activities, positions and values.''
   ``Religion is central to how people think and act,'' he said.
``What is more important to the life of individuals or nation than
what they think life means? Religion is pivotal.''
   He said religion never has received its ``just due'' in the
media, but added, ``I believe there is more and more turning of
attention to religion and its impact in this country.''
   In the new national setup, Richard W. Daw, 54, who for 12 years
has been editor in chief of National Catholic News Service and who
formerly was an Associated Press bureau chief, heads the new
Communications Department.
   It draws together three previously separate sections and assigns
functions to six offices _ film and broadcsting, fund campaign,
liaison with the Catholic Telecommunications Network, the news
service, publishing and media relations.

   Protestants gave a bigger percentage of their
income to churches back before World War I and in the Great
Depression of the l930's than they have in the last 20 years, a
study finds.
   It was submitted for a forum this weekend sponsored by the
Independent Sector and the United Way Insitute.
   The historical analysis by researchers John and Sylvia Ronsvalle
of Urbana, Ill., says that in 1933, when U.S. per capita income was
at a low, Protestants gave 3.3 percent of income to churches.
   While per capita income has ballooned 218 percent since then,
Protestant church members in the 1980's have given only around 2.5
percent of it to churches, the study says.

   A Duke Divinity School scholar, who thinks
the church needs to understand the ``theology of popular culture''
to attract youths, says that gyrating rock star Prince is a
``preacher'' of sorts.
   People tend to think of him as ``the personification of human
pornography,'' but his music also touches on important religious
matters, says Jon Michael Spencer, assistant professor of music and
black church studies.
   Prince sings ``about the necessity of loving God'' and ``issues
like war, nuclear arms, drugs, AIDS and poverty,'' Spencer says.
``Prince is clearly somebody who is ... religious and who embodies
the contradictions of being human. He highlights what it means to be
both spiritual and carnal.''

   He says such current issues as the shortage of priests, priestly

   Burkhart of Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan., said in an

<TEXT>
   American universities once publicized
themselves discreetly on pennants and T-shirts sold in local campus
stores. Now they're doing it for lucrative royalties on items
ranging from fishing lures to toilet seats, sold at some of the
nation's biggest retailers.
   The explosion in collegiate merchandise reflects a rising demand
for products bearing hawkeyes, buckeyes, lions, tigers, bears and
other school symbols, a partial consequence of the enormous
television exposure collegiate sports teams are getting nowadays.
   Estimated annual retail sales of such items exceeds $1 billion.
   ``It's not just in college bookstores anymore. It's in K mart,
Sears and Penney's,'' said Kim Allan, manager of university
licensing programs at Michigan State.
   Collegiate merchandise sales have doubled in the last five years
and now nearly equal combined sales of National Football League and
major league baseball products, said Bill Battle, president and
owner of Atlanta-based Collegiate Concepts Inc.
   Collegiate Concepts and International Collegiate Enterprises of
Los Angeles, through a joint venture handle the licensing
arrangement for 100 schools.
   Universities license products bearing their names or logos, known
as marks, and receive royalties in return.
   Battle said soft goods such as T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps
account for between 80 percent and 85 percent of the collegiate
merchandise, but novelty items have flourished.
   In 1981, the University of Georgia licensed a local discount
retail chain to sell a Bulldog tarantula. The spider had red and
black markings matching the school's colors and sported a tiny felt
Bulldog ``cap.''
   ``I don't know how they did with it,'' said Avery McLean,
director promotions and licensing at Georgia.
   Penn State University has licensed a Nittany Lion swimming pool
liner; Iowa has approved a Hawkeye fishing lure; Nebraska ``Go Big
Red'' boxer shorts; and Michigan State a Spartan toilet seat.
   The University of California at Los Angeles began the first major
licensing program, in 1974.
   Many other university followed suit in the early 1980s to get
marketing control over their names and logos, which had started
appearing on products that either were too embarrasing or posed a
liability threat.
   One company approached Penn State last year hoping to make a
Nittany Lion casket _ with the university's mascot embroidered
inside the lid.
   ``That was thought to be in bad taste,'' said O. Jean Barrett,
coordinator of Penn State's Office of Licensing Programs.
   University standards differ, but most refuse licenses to
companies making products relating to alcohol, tobacco and firearms.
   Besides gaining better control over their monikers, university
licensing programs have provided the schools with a large source of
income.
   Royalties now total more than $500,000 a year at several larger
universities with nationally known football or basketball teams.
   Penn State, which has one of the the largest licensing
operations, has earned $430,000 in the first 6 months of the current
fiscal year for use in scholarship funds, up 8 percent from the
previous year, said Roger Williams, a university spokesman.
   Collegiate merchandise also has been a boon to department stores.
   Three years ago, J.C. Penney Co. started ``Team Sports Shops'' in
500 branches, said Peter McGrath, division merchandise manager for
athletic apparel and footware for the department store.
   Business at the shops has grown 30 percent a year, reflecting an
increase demand for college and pro merchandise, McGrath said.
   A number of universities have started exploring markets in Japan,
Canada and Europe. UCLA, with the largest foreign program, already
sells about $9 million to $10 million worth of goods annually in
Japan.
   ``We have a tremendous appeal in Japan because we're West
Coast,'' said Jack Rovoyr, a UCLA product licensing official.
``We're California. We're sunshine. UCLA is more than a university.
It's a lifestyle.''

<TEXT>
   A judge's order that a cocaine-dependent
pregnant woman stop abusing drugs and seek prenatal care was simply
an effort to safeguard her fetus, the ``second victim,'' in the view
of a right-to-life advocate.
   But civil libertarians say the Ohio case and five similar ones
around the nation represent an intrusion by ``Big Brother'' on the
rights of women.
   ``It indicates a real trend to me,'' said Diana Traub, public
education officer for the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project in New York. ``There's a real danger of
setting bad precedent here.''
   She cited cases, mostly involving alleged drug abuse by expectant
mothers, in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Nevada,
Washington, D.C., and Ohio.
   In the Ohio case, Franklin County Juvenile Court Judge Charles
Petree II ruled last September that a fetus carried by a cocaine-and
morphine-dependent woman was a person and, therefore, subject to
court jurisdiction.
   He ordered that Janet Cox, 27, seek prenatal care and stop taking
drugs.
   Petree's ruling was overturned in December by the 10th Ohio
District Court of Appeals shortly after she gave birth to her fifth
child, Steven, who was drug-free.
   One of her four other sons was born drug-dependent, and she has
lost custody of all of them, including Steven. She has filed for
divorce from her husband of eight years, David, who underwent
emergency hospitalization for drug abuse in December.
   Some civil-rights advocates say the state has overstepped its
authority in Mrs. Cox's case.
   Elinor Alger, acting legal director of the ACLU in Columbus,
called the attempt to take jurisdiction over Mrs. Cox's fetus ``a
local manifestation of a national movement to take control of a
woman's right to decide for herself how she treats her own body.''
   ``The judge in this case was particularly anxious to take
jurisdiction over this fetus. I would not be at all surprised if
this issue comes up again and again,'' she said.
   Janet Folger, legislative director of Right To Life-Ohio, scoffed
at defending women who use illegal drugs while pregnant.
   ``This is something illegal the woman is doing, and the argument
by abortion proponents who defend a woman saying this is some kind
of constitutionally guaranteed right is ludicrous,'' she said.
   ``I think there is a small trend because it's evident that there
is a second victim here,'' she said. ``I think the public is finally
recognizing that a fetus is a person whose place of residence
happens to be the womb.''
   No Ohio law protects fetuses in such cases, and James Zorn, an
assistant Franklin County prosecutor, added: ``The court of appeals
said we did not have jurisdiction over a fetus. That means we can't
pursue a case based on a mother's prenatal drug use.
   ``But that doesn't mean we can't and won't monitor it after
birth.''
   Mrs. Cox is serving a one-year jail term for violating terms of
probation _ prosecutors contend she failed 40 drug-screening tests _
following her 1987 conviction in a prescription forgery case.
   Thomas Shanahan, the attorney for Mrs. Cox, said authorities
should spend their time and money helping low-income, jobless,
pregnant women such as Mrs. Cox overcome their drug dependency
rather than waging expensive legal battles.
   ``They were looking for a test case and they picked her. All they
have succeeded in doing in locking up a woman who has a drug
problem,'' he said.
   Shanahan also believes the trend is discriminatory.
   ``You don't see them regulating the conduct of fathers. What if
he smokes too close to his pregnant wife ... ? Do you see anyone
going after him?'' he said.
   ``It is the Big Brother scenario all over again,'' said Ms.
Traub. ``Nobody wants to see a baby born hooked on drugs, but
penalizing a woman who takes drugs because she has the audacity to
get pregnant is simply punitive.
   ``Could this also be extended to all women in their reproductive
years? Believe it. They could be prohibited from doing anything a
court determined to be bad for them, including drinking or smoking.''
   Zorn insists, ``Nobody's trying to play Big Brother.
   ``The sole concern here is the best interest of the child,'' he
said. ``Is it in the best interest of a child to allow its mother to
injure that child?
   ``Nobody's going to go after a woman because she drinks and
smokes. The main difference here is that Mrs. Cox was engaged in an
illegal activity _ taking drugs.''

<HEAD>Ph.D. Thesis Uncovers Widespread Nepotism in Brazil's Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For her Ph.D thesis in political science,
Maria Aparecida de Oliveira did some research into nepotism in the
Brazilian government. What she turned up became a front-page,
nationwide scandal.
   At a time when President Jose Sarney pledged to lay off 90,000
government functionaries, as part of a drastic plan to halt 1,000
percent-plus annual inflation, Ms. Oliveira said she discovered that
nearly half the 560 members of Brazil's two-house Congress have
relatives, lots of them, in soft, high-paying federal jobs.
   Senators and representatives, she said, employ wives, sons,
daughters, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces as ``advisers''
making the equivalent of $2,000 to $4,000 a month _ in a country
where the government-set minimum wage is equal to $64 a month.
   The 37-year-old graduate student at the National University of
Brasilia, who also works as a fact checker in Brasilia for the Rio
de Janeiro newspaper Jornal do Brasil, released her findings to the
press before submitting her thesis to her professors.
   Her revelations brought outcries for a cleanup. They also
resulted in angry warnings from some Congressional staffers to Ms.
Oliveira to keep her nose out of their affairs.
   ``This was not a cheap trick to sell newspapers or, as some
people have charged, to provoke a military takeover of Congress,''
Ms. Oliveira said in an interview. ``I did it in the interest of
Brazilian national sovereignty.''
   Civilian government returned to Brazil in 1985 after 21 years of
military rule, and new officials promised an idealistic ``New
Republic.''
   ``Unfortunately our new democracy is confined to paper,'' Ms.
Oliveira said. ``It has not reached people's consciences.''
   She said she gathered raw data for her study ``from the
congressional payroll, with help from senators and representatives
who do not practice nepotism.''
   She concluded that nepotism in Congress exists across the
political spectrum, from right to left.
   In the House of Representatives, Ms. Oliveira said, 197 of the
485 members employ 279 relatives. Rep. Pedro Ceolin Sobrinho, of the
conservative Liberal Front Party, is the leader with 10 family
members on his staff.
   Rep. Jose Mauricio Linhares Barreto, of the left-leaning
Democratic Labor Party, put his 14-year-old son in an advisory post,
at $1,176 a month, according to the study.
   It also counted 32 of the 75 senators as being nepotistic, with
the leader there being Sen. Humberto Lucena, a former Senate
president, from President Sarney's centrist Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party. He has four children, a brother, a son-in-law, a
niece and a sister-in-law on his payroll.
   ``My conscience is clear,'' Lucena commented. ``We are talking
about `confidential appointments,' permitted by law. My relatives
serving in these posts will work only as long as I am in office.
They will not become permanent congressional staff members. I hired
my son-in-law, now divorced from one of my daughters, as a technical
adviser, not because of our relationship but because of his high
competence. My brother Solon was hired by another senator, not by
me.''
   Another star of nepotism, according to the researcher, is the
president's daughter, Roseana Sarney, who joined the staff of
Congress when her father was a senator and who now makes the
equivalent of $4,000 a month, while living in in Rio de Janeiro, 750
miles from Brasilia.
   Senators and representatives may legally hire ``advisers.''
Congress members also are given, at taxpayer expense, cars and
drivers, apartments in Brasilia, free mail and telephone use, and
free plane tickets to and from their home states,
   ``What's immoral is the nepotism,'' said Ms. Oliveira, who has
degrees in economics, agronomy and journalism.
   Adilson Abreu Dallari, a judge and the author of the book ``The
Civil Servant,'' said in an interview that administrative corruption
has become ``part of Brazilian culture _ everybody wants
something.'' He said the roots of the problem go back nearly 500
years when Brazilian colonists received grants, favors and
hereditary titles from kings of Portugal.
   Villas-Boas Correa, a widely read political columnist, said the
nepotism scandal ``degrades Congress and political parties and is an
invitation for a military coup, justified on ground of morality.''
He added that, like Congress, state legislatures and city halls
throughout this nation of 144 million ``are full of `ghosts,' civil
servants who do no work and show up only to pick up their
paychecks.''
   The first secretary of the Senate, Antonio Mendes Canalle, said
that as a result of Ms. Oliveira's findings, the Senate now will
draw up a list to see who does what and works where.
   But the speaker of the House, Rep. Antonio Paes de Andrade, who
serves as acting president of Brazil when Sarney is out of the
country, told the AP that staff hiring is the ``exclusive
responsibility'' of each legislator.
   Soon afterward, Paes de Andrade made news when, while Sarney was
in Japan for Emperor Hirohito's funeral in February, he loaded two
presidential jets with friends, relatives, political cronies and
journalists and flew them to a welcoming ceremony in his humble home
town in Brazil's impoverished Northeast.

<HEAD>Churches, Target Of Child-Abuse Cases, Urged To Screen Employees</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious institutions are being hit with a tide
of child abuse lawsuits, and a leading church-state attorney says
churches should take steps to protect themselves and the children.
   Such action ``is long overdue,'' says Oliver S. Thomas, general
counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs in
Washington, D.C., noting the swelling number of such cases.
   ``It's going on across the country, for religious as well as
non-religious organizations,'' he added in a telephone interview.
``It's happening, and it's time to take it seriously.''
   Thomas advises churches to begin screening all child-care
workers, as well as other employees placed in regular contact with
children to verify they have not been convicted of child-related
crimes.
   ``This is not a burdensome thing and it's extremely important for
the children's sake,'' he said. ``Parents would be pleased. And
churches could breathe a sigh of relief that they've acted
responsibily.''
   Thomas said that more than 100 claims for sexual abuse of
children have been filed against churches nationwide and the number
is continually growing, involving various denominations.
   ``It's not a Baptist, Catholic or Methodist problem, but
everybody's concern,'' he said. ``It's pervasive.''
   He said damage settlements in such cases often are in the
millions. ``These are big-dollar lawsuits,'' he said. ``Churches
don't realize their potential liability, nor the greater need for
protecting the children.''
   He suggests a formal screening of prospective employees of church
child-care centers to determine if they have been convicted of sex
offenses or other crimes involving children or of committing acts of
abuse or neglect.
   Such information is a matter of public record available through
local criminal and civil court clerks, or in some localities,
circuit or district court clerks handling both criminal and civil
records.
   ``This would take little more than a telephone call or trip to
the courthouse,'' he said.
   ``The stakes are high for both the children and the churches. On
the human side, one incident of abuse can scar a child for life. On
the financial side, the potential costs to the church is
staggering.''
   While not suggesting formal screening of Sunday school teachers
and other lay volunteers, as he does for day-care workers, he
advises extreme care in selecting anyone who will have frequent,
direct contact with children.
   He said that traditionally, claims against churches for abusive
acts by employees have met with little success on grounds such acts
were aberrations disconnected from the employment, and the church
thus was not accountable.
   However, he said a different possibility has been raised by a
case against Victory Tabernacle Church in Norfolk, Va., sued by
parents of a young girl repeatedly raped by a church employe.
   They contended it should have known of the employe's past
child-abuse offenses. While a trial court dismissed the case on
grounds the church itself was not liable, the Virginia Supreme Court
reinstated the case.
   Thomas said the difference is that the parents, rather than
contending the church is responsibile for acts of an employe,
contend it is responsible for its own act in placing an unfit
employe in a job endangering others.
   ``It's a different issue,'' he said. ``The church is going to
have to face it. We need to take heed.''
   He noted that some states such as Florida already have acted to
make screening of day-care workers mandatory. Although churches were
exempt from the Florida law, the state Baptist convention has
advised compliance with it.
   Thomas sees the increase in child-abuse and sexual molestation
cases as resulting largely from the much larger proportion of
children being placed in day-care centers when both parents work.
   Churches operate more than half the day-care centers in the
country, studies have found.
   ``It's a whole new day,'' Thomas said. ``The time to act is now _
both to protect our children and to protect our churches from
excessive personal injury claims. It's an ethical obligation.
   ``If we don't police ourselves, the law is going to do it for
us.''

   Terming small-town and rural parishes the
``overlooked giant'' in U.S. Catholicism, sociologist Gary Burkhart
says: ``The rural parish is where the theological issues of today's
church will come to a head.''
   He says such current issues as the shortage of priests, priestly
ordination, the role of the laity and role of unordained pastoral
administrators are most acute in those areas.
   Burkhart of Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan., said in an
interview with the Catholic Key, weekly of the Kansas City-St.
Joseph, Mo., diocese, that a third of U.S. Catholics live in rural
areas or towns of less than 50,000 population.

   A Duke Divinity School scholar, who thinks
the church needs to understand the ``theology of popular culture''
to attract youths, says that gyrating rock star Prince is a
``preacher'' of sorts.
   People tend to think of him as ``the personification of human
pornography,'' but his music also touches on important religious
matters, says Jon Michael Spencer, assistant professor of music and
black church studies.
   Prince sings ``about the necessity of loving God'' and ``issues
like war, nuclear arms, drugs, AIDS and poverty,'' Spencer says.
``Prince is clearly somebody who is ... religious and who embodies
the contradictions of being human. He highlights what it means to be
both spiritual and carnal.''

   Protestants gave a bigger percentage of their
income to churches back before World War I and in the Great
Depression of the l930's than they have in the last 20 years, a
study finds.
   It was submitted for a forum this weekend sponsored by the
Independent Sector and the United Way Insitute.
   The historical analysis by researchers John and Sylvia Ronsvalle
of Urbana, Ill., says that in 1933, when U.S. per capita income was
at a low, Protestants gave 3.3 percent of income to churches.
   While per capita income has ballooned 218 percent since then,
Protestant church members in the 1980's have given only around 2.5
percent of it to churches, the study says.

<HEAD>Escort Still A World Beater</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford called its Escort the world car when it was introduced in
1980, heralding a new era in auto design and production because the
Escort was a novel collaboration of Ford's worldwide operations.
   Ford would have been correct to call the Escort the world beater,
too.
   In 1988, the Escort was as the best-selling subcompact car
nameplate in this country, outselling offerings from Honda, Toyota,
Nissan and other global competitors. It has been the best-seller in
five of the last seven years, said company analyst Ray Windecker.
   Look around the roads. It shouldn't take long to spot an Escort,
considering that more than 2.5 million have been sold.
   The wide-ranging variety of Escort models and price explain much
of the current popularity. The Escort seems to be able to be many
things to many people.
   The test car, a 1989 Escort GT in bright red, had sporty appeal,
aerodynamic styling and a number of options _ all for just under
$10,500.
   Then, there's the base two-door Escort that starts at $6,964,
something for general transportation. Or you could look for a
four-door model (starting at $7,679), an upscale version of the
four-door, or even a station wagon.
   There's no shortage of choices in the Escort line. Buyers, as
expected, are a more diverse lot than for some other cars.
   Windecker said 15 percent of Escort buyers are in professional
and technical jobs, 12 percent are office workers, 10 percent are
business managers and 9 percent are in skilled trades.
   Median income is nearly $28,000 a year, 46 percent are women, and
median age is 33.5 years. Fifty-four percent are married.
   The 1989 Escort GT test car showed the styling changes that Ford
had instituted in the middle of the 1988 model year. The car was
more rounded than the earlier, boxy models, and the rear hatchback
had been redesigned for a bigger, fuller look.
   Because it was a GT model, the test car also had some dandy
flared fender skirts near the tires.
   The 1.9-liter, fuel-injected, high-output four cylinder could put
out 110 horsepower at 5,400 rpm -- a good amount of pep for this
little car.
   Still, it felt unmistakably like an Escort and delivered a sane
ride. There was some sponginess in the suspension, but the trade-off
was a not-so-harsh ride over bumps as in some other subcompacts.
   Seats up front were adequate, though Ford had installed automatic
shoulder belts that took some getting used to. Seating for two in
back was fine but legroom was tight if the front seats were moved
back all the way.
   As in earlier Escorts, among the instruments was a large picture
of a car with lights that would go on to indicate trouble, such as
low fuel and low wiper fluid.
   Other dashboard instruments were the traditional type and easy to
read.
   The shifter could have been a bit longer for me. I had to reach
way over to put it in fifth gear, raising myself from an otherwise
comfortable position in the driver seat.
   And the front ashtray was a bit awkward to reach, at the base of
the shifter in the middle bottom of the dashboard.
   The Escort's record for trouble has been spotty, according to
Consumer Reports magazine. It ranked the 1982-84 Escorts as worse
than average in owner reports of trouble. For 1985-86 models, the
Escort was average and it was much worse than average for 1987
models.
   But company spokesman Paul Preuss said the Escort has a good
word-of-mouth reputation among owners. One of the the reasons it
sells so well is its reliability and durability, he said.
   That's what the general public sees in the car. The sales record
speaks for itself.

   Standing outside former Soviet leader
Andrei Gromyko's office while visiting the Kremlin last year,
Randall Teague listened to a sound he hadn't heard in so long he
nearly couldn't recognize it.
   It was the tap-tap-tapping of a manual typewriter.
   ``I knew exactly what it was when I heard another old sound _ the
sound someone makes when they're using six carbons in a typewriter
and they make a mistake,'' said Teague, a Washington attorney for
Smith Corona Corp., who specializes in international trade law.
   ``If that's what one of the most powerful men in the country had
in his offices, I wondered what everyone else was doing,'' Teague
said in recalling the moment that spawned an idea for his client:
peddling typewriters to Russia. In what company aides called an
unusual deal, Smith Corona will sell a range of typewriters and
portable word processors to Vneshtorgizdat, an official Soviet book
publishing concern, to be paid for in U.S. dollars.
   Vneshtorgizdat, also known as VTI, will then sell the machines
throughout the Soviet Union, initially to universities, professional
writers and for use in some offices, said Smith Corona President Lee
Thompson.
   The arrangement exploits a new Soviet economic liberalization
policy, under which some Soviet companies that routinely earn
foreign currency may keep part of the money to buy imports.
   The policy went into effect in 1987, but is only starting to have
some impact because it was deferred for all of 1988 in most cases,
said Ed Hewett, a Soviet economy expert at the Brookings Institution
in Washington.
   ``These are not the kind of deals that make headlines, so it's
hard to know how many there are,'' Hewett said. ``But I think we'll
be seeing a lot more of these deals in the first half of the year.''
   On April 1, the policy will be expanded to include any Soviet
company or even a region of the country that can earn foreign
currency and wants to spend it.
   ``Of course, the problem is most Russian companies don't have
products that they can sell to get foreign currency,'' said Hewett.
   In VTI's case, it sells Soviet books around the world and earns
dollars, yen, marks, pounds and other foreign money.
   In the past, Hewett said, companies like VTI would sell products
to an official Soviet foreign trade agency, which in turn would sell
the books and keep the foreign currency.
   Under the old arrangement, if VTI wanted to import something, it
had to make a request and go through the foreign trade agency, which
generally would select where the product would come from and what
model or style it would be.
   The Smith Corona deal was started when Teague, who specializes in
representing U.S. business interests in the Soviet Union, bumped
into an old Soviet friend Vladimir Prokopov during a visit there in
January 1988.
   In catching up on what was new in their lives, Prokopov told
Teague he headed VTI and wished to import typewriters and word
processors.
   That discussion triggered a flurry of telexes, telephone calls
and meetings over the course of the year, culminating with an
agreement signed in January, Teague said.
   ``It just happens to be one of those situations where two
companies had a great fit and were able to work things out,'' said
Thompson.
   The deal is part of an an explosion in foreign demand for Smith
Corona machines. Three months ago it signed an agreement with NV
Philips, a huge Netherlands-based electronics firm, to supply
typewriters throughout Europe.
   Both developments indicate the continued rebound of Smith Corona,
a subsidiary of the British conglomerate, Hanson Industries Ltd.
   The company lost more than $100 million during the first half of
the 1980s, consolidated from four plants to one and cut employment
from 5,000 to 850 at its low point in 1984.
   Today, the company employs 2,150 people and has regained
dominance in the portable typewriter and word processor market. The
company does not disclose sales or profit figures.
   The Soviet deal sent company engineers hurriedly to computers and
drawing boards to devise typewriters that use the Cyrillic alphabet,
which contains 33 letters, almost all of them different from the
26-letter Latin alphabet.
   To Americans, the Cyrillic keyboard looks like a jumble of
unusual symbols and backward letters. It's arranged nothing like the
standard typewriter keyboard in the United States.
   For instance, the Cyrllic ``A'' is located where the ``F'' would
be on a regular typewriter. The ``M'' is where the ``V'' is, and the
``P'' is where the ``H'' is. Only the ``C'' is in the same place on
both keyboards.
   ``That's just an extreme coincidence,'' said Ray Blanchard, Smith
Corona's director of advanced products. He showed off the first
prototype Cyrillic model at the company's central New York
manufacturing facility, noting the company's Smith Corona logo
translated into Russian in the upper lefthand corner.
   It looked roughly like ``CMNT KOPOHA.''

   ``It's not a particularly difficult challenge from a keyboard and
print wheel standpoint,'' said Thompson in a telephone interview
from the company's headquarters in New Caanan, Conn. ``The difficult
challenge is the development of a Russain language spellchecker,
dictionary and thesaurus.''
   All Smith Corona's machines, except the basic model XL1500, have
dictionary and spellchecker computerized memory devices built in,
Blanchard said.
   The company makes more than 200 models of typewriters and word
processors. Its most popular model is the XL1500, which costs about
$140.
   Thompson said the company expects to export Cyrillic typewriters
to the Soviet Union by the end of this year.
   Until then, however, the company will send typewriters and word
processors with Latin keyboards designed for use in Britain to VTI,
which has said there's a substanial demand for the English-language
machines.
   The first shipment of three different models, nearly 1,000
machines, is en route, said Blanchard, and the company is taking
orders for the Cyrillic machines.
   Thompson said there's a hodgepodge collection of old electric and
manual typewriters in the Soviet Union, including International
Business Machine Corp. models and some inexpensive East German
models.
   IBM created a Cyrillic typewriter ball for its Selectric
typewriters in the early 1970s, said company spokesman Tom Belz, but
the company does not conduct regular business in the Soviet Union.
   Thompson said it's unclear how many typewriters Smith Corona may
eventually sell in the Soviet Union, partly because there's no
market research about the country. The company is largely relying on
information from VTI. He said that agency solicited interest from
400 prospective Soviet customers last year.
   ``In the United States, if you get 1 to 2 percent back, you've
done a marvelous job. They got 50 percent back saying this is the
type of equipment they're interested in,'' Thompson said.

<HEAD>Bob Newhart and Don Rickles Take Friendship to TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even mild-mannered Bob Newhart could take only
so many slings and arrows from insult artist Don Rickles.
   Newhart, as Dick Loudon on CBS' ``Newhart,'' blew up and called
Rickles ``fat and bald.''
   ``He picks on me and picks on me, and I finally blow up,'' said
Newhart, after the cast broke for lunch. But the tiff was only in
the script, and he and Rickles headed for Newhart's dressing room
together.
   Off camera, the quiet, introspective Newhart and the loud,
explosive Rickles are a real ``odd couple'' as best friends. Their
wives are also best friends, and the two couples frequently vacation
together.
   Rickles' appearance on this Monday's episode of ``Newhart'' is
one of their rare times together on the same stage. He plays
out-of-work comic actor Don Prince who ends up as host of a talk
show on the same Vermont television station where Loudon works.
   Their last joint appearance was in 1972 on an episode of ``The
Don Rickles Show.'' Rickles said it was on the same soundstage at
the CBS-MTM Studios where ``Newhart'' is filmed.
   ``A guy who's a grip says it was the same stage,'' said Newhart.
``Painful things like that you can't recall.''
   ``We've always talked about appearing together on `Newhart' for
some time, but we wanted it to be something special,'' said Rickles.
   ``I said in TV Guide that we hadn't been able to come up with an
idea. We got hundreds of letters saying he should do this, he should
do that,'' said Newhart. ``The story our writers came up with is
that Don had his own show on CBS called `It's Always Moishe.' He did
a special called `A Very Moishe Christmas.' When he gets canceled he
comes to Vermont to do a talk show. I'm like his Ed McMahon. He
insults me, the band leader, the audience.''
   That's when Newhart has had enough to bark back. But he quickly
apologizes and Rickles confesses he's been insulting everybody to
get out of his contract, because CBS wants to put ``It's Always
Moishe'' back on the air.
   Newhart and Rickles have been friends for more than 21 years.
   ``Our wives were friends before he even knew his wife,'' said
Rickles, whose wife, Barbara, had been a secretary for his agent.
Newhart's wife, Ginny Quinn, had been an actress.
   ``We had completely different personalities but we have the same
values,'' Rickles said. ``We could travel and get along. We get
along great and have never had any troubles. It's all due to me.''
   Newhart said, ``Ginny and I were in Las Vegas and she had never
seen his act. She said Barbara, Don's wife, was there and suggested
we get together. She said Don was such a nice man. I warned her he
may not be the same nice man on stage.
   ``We went to the show and he said, `Bob Newhart is a stammering
idiot and his wife is a former hooker from Bayonne, N.J.' Ginny's
mouth was wide open the rest of the show.''
   Newhart and Rickles say they never talk about work or show
business. What do they talk about?
   Newhart: ``His career.''
   Rickles: ``My golf and my good shots.''
   ``He makes me laugh and I make him laugh,'' said Newhart.
   Said Rickles: ``We come from different backgrounds. He was a man
for the books. I'm trying to read them.''
   Newhart's wife has suggested they do Neil Simon's play ``The Odd
Couple.''
   ``Don is the neat one,'' Newhart said. ``It's the opposite of
what you would think.''
   ``It's been done so many times,'' said Rickles. ``I did it once
with Ernest Borgnine. We did it in the round with the audience all
around us.''
   Rickles works mostly in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and is an
occasional guest on ``The Tonight Show,'' ``Late Night With David
Letterman,'' or the Bob Hope specials.
   His first movie was ``Run Silent, Run Deep'' in 1958 and last
movie was ``Kelly's Heroes'' in 1970. In the 1970s, he starred in
the short-lived sitcom ``The Don Rickles Show'' and ``C.P.O.
Sharkey,'' which ran for two years.
   ``When I started doing my nightclub act I developed a very strong
image,'' Rickles said. ``Producers began to back off. It also became
very hard for me to do both. I'm not out there as a working actor.
I'm not looking for work.''

<HEAD>Writers Are Threatened Around the World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Writers beware. It's tough being an author these
days, especially if one's work reflects political or religious
beliefs.
   It seems that writers are under siege throughout the world:
Novelist Salman Rushdie hides in London faced with a death threat;
Czech playwright Vaclav Havel sits in a Prague jail for his
leadership in a dissident movement; and Nobel Prize-winner Wole
Soyinka's life is threatened in Nigeria.
   But while these authors have received worldwide attention, they
represent just a fraction of the writers who have recently been
jailed or harassed. The ``Writers in Prison'' committee of the
London-based P.E.N. International, lists 238 cases of writers
currently imprisoned, detained or forced into internal exile.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has called for the
death of Rushdie, a 41-year-old Bombay native of Islamic parents,
because of his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which offers a
scathing portrayal of the prophet Mohammed and the founding of the
Islamic religion, and has been banned in several countries. Khomeini
said that anyone performing the act will be granted passage to
heaven.
   ``The Rushdie thing is certainly unprecedented,'' said author
Susan Sontag, president of the P.E.N. American Center, a major
exponent of writers' freedom. ``Even when the Nazis burned books,
there was no call for the death of the writers.''
   But the threat to Rushdie has now drawn in Soyinka, a novelist
and poet awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. Soyinka's
outspoken defense of Rushdie and condemnation of Khomeini as a
``sick and dangerous man'' have infuriated Nigerian Moslems, who are
estimated to constitute nearly half of the country's population of
100 million.
   Moslems marched in the city of Lagos, some carrying placards that
read ``Wole Soyinka Must Die,'' and handed a letter of protest
against Rushdie to the British consul. In the late 1960s, Soyinka
was jailed during the civil war in Nigeria for attempting to
negotiate with the Ibo rebels.
   Havel, one of Czechoslovakia's most prominent playwrights and
whose works are banned there, was jailed for nine months in late
February for allegedly inciting a protest in January to commemorate
the death in 1968 of Jan Palach, a student who set fire to himself
in protest of the Soviet-led invasion.
   He was sentenced to four years in 1979 for sedition and has been
consistently harassed by government officials for his efforts to
form a political opposition.
   Also in Czechoslovakia, Ivan Jirous, an editor and publisher, has
been jailed four times since 1976 for anti-government activities.
His most recent arrest came in October 1988 for his role in
organizing an open letter to protest the death of a prisoner of
conscience, Pavel Wonka, while he was being held in detention.
   Jirous, who faces a prison term of up to five years, is charged
under the Czech penal code with ``assaulting state officials and
officials of a public organization'' and ``damaging the interests of
the state abroad.'' His trial began March 9.
   A more unusual case of a writer having trouble with the
authorities involves Joseph Wambaugh, author of such best sellers as
``The Onion Field'' and ``The New Centurions.''
   Wambaugh, a former Los Angeles police officer, based his new
book, ``The Blooding,'' on the rape and murder of two 15-year old
girls in Leicester, England. The killer was eventually tracked down
through the process of genetic fingerprinting, which means that an
individual's blood or semen has a distinctive genetic code such as a
fingerprint.
   Wambaugh conducted extensive interviews with police and the
victims' families and ``The Blooding'' gives a detailed account of
the case. But Leicester police, responding to protests against the
author's description of the crimes, have launched an investigation
into how information was obtained for the book. The police further
said the closely detailed descriptions of the rapes and murders
caused distress to the families involved.
   In South Africa, among the many people in jail for their
opposition to apartheid _ the government's policy of racial
separation and discrimination _ is Jaki Seroke, the editorial
director of Skotaville Publishers, a non-profit organization that
concentrates on the works of black writers.
   In September 1987, Seroke was arrested and confined under Section
29 of the Internal Security Act, which allows ``indefinite
incommunicado detention without charge or trial for the purposes of
security police interrogation.''
   He was eventually charged with ``possession of banned
literature'' and ``furthering the aims of a banned organization''
and recently was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Seroke is believed
to be at a police station in Soweto.
   Although released from prison in December 1988, Zwelakhe Sisulu,
who has written for several newspapers, is confined evenings to his
home in Johannesburg and is required to report twice a day to
authorities.
   He was first arrested in 1986 for ``anti-government activities,''
rearrested later that year and also confined under Section 29.
Officials later admitted that his detention was based on his
involvement with ``The New Nation,'' an anti-apartheid newspaper
which Sisulu founded.
   Ironically, these various arrests come at a time when other
writers have managed to win increased freedom in such countries as
the Soviet Union and South Korea that had long stifled artistic
expression.
   According to the ``Writers in Prison'' committee, under Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of liberalization or
``perestroika,'' the number of jailed writers and journalists in the
Soviet Union had dropped from 93 in 1983 to 20 in 1988. Improvements
in the treatment of writers were also noted in Chile and Argentina.
   South Korea released 281 political prisoners last Dec. 21 as part
of an overall amnesty program. Journalist Kim Hyon-jang and poet Kim
Nam-ju were among those granted freedom, although Hyon-jang has
since been rearrested for holding a sit-in to protest the continued
detention of other political prisoners
   Czechoslovakia has also loosened some restrictions, returning the
novels of Franz Kafka to the stores of his home country for the
first time since 1968 and allowing the films of director Milos
Forman (``Amadeus,'' ``Hair'') to be shown in theaters.
   ``The positive side is what's going on in the Soviet empire which
is, with some notable exceptions such as Romania, improving
vastly,'' Sontag said. ``The other positive thing is never has
consciousness been so alerted to the problem. There really is much
more awareness and greater ability to publicize these cases and
exert pressure on governments.''

<HEAD>Public Opinion Has Its Impact on Supreme Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The barrage of unsolicited advice being pressed
on the Supreme Court as it re-examines abortion rights illustrates
the complex role public opinion plays in the court's search for
justice.
   Dozens of partsans, including the Bush administration, are trying
to sway the court as it prepares to hear arguments next month over
Missouri abortion regulations. The lobbying has yielded 46
``friend-of-the-court'' legal briefs.
   The court, expected to rule by July, is being asked to use the
case to overturn or limit its landmark 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   Is the court influenced by such external pressure?
   ``Never for a very long period is the court out of touch with the
populace,'' said Thomas G. Krattenmaker, associate dean at the
Georgetown University law school. ``They're always sensitive to what
they perceive to be the shared values of Americans.''
   Although public opinion polls indicate that most Americans favor
a woman's right to abortion, the anti-abortion Bush administration
wants to leave the final word to state legislatures, not the high
court.
   Justice Department lawyers are asking the court to declare there
is no constitutional right to abortion _ leaving states free to
restrict or outlaw abortions.
   They said public opinion should be given more weight than the
court's 16 years' worth of decisions on abortion. ``Indeed, the fact
that this issue touches or can touch nearly everyone's life ...
means that it should be capable of resolution through the process of
political dialogue,'' the administration contended.
   Many constitutional experts agree that the nation's mood has an
impact on the outcome of the court's most significant rulings.
   ``In the sense what would happen if you took a Gallup poll, the
impact of public opinion is tiny,'' said Bruce Fein, a conservative
lawyer who watches court cases closely.
   ``But in a general sense of what is fair, what is just and what
is right, (public opinion) is not going to be always decisive but it
is always in the background,'' he said.
   Years ago the notion that the high court reflects popular
sentiment was expressed succinctly by Finley Peter Dunne, the author
who penned the phrase, ``No matter whether the Constitution follows
the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns.''
   The truth probably is more complicated.
   Georgetown's Krattenmaker said that in any given case the court
is more likely to be influenced by an elite group than by the man in
the street.
   ``Any political scientist will tell you this is the way any
policymaker acts,'' Krattenmaker said. ``He's sensitive to an elite
group of people.''
   For Supreme Court justices, he said the elite group usually
includes lower court judges, high-ranking government officials and,
to some extent, legal experts.
   Jerome Barron, a law professor at George Washington University,
said a recent decision striking down an affirmative action plan in
Richmond, Va., may be an example of the justices ``following the
election returns.''
   But Barron noted that the court today is a more conservative one.
``That's public opinion, too. A more conservative president appoints
more conservative justices,'' he said.
   Throughout the court's history, some have accused it of being
more interested in results than applying the law and interpreting
the Constitution impartially.
   But usually the charge is made by those who feel disadvantaged by
a court ruling.
   Many have noted that the court always confronts competing
pressures: that it be independent from rapidly shifting public
opinion but close enough to the mainstream that it not forfeit its
legitimacy as an institution of the democratic will.
   ``Never in its 200-year history has the court been out of
synchronization with the general public for more than five or 10
years,'' said court-watcher Fein.
   Before the Civil War, the court bucked public opinion in the
North when it ruled that Dred Scott remained a slave after he
traveled into free territory.
   The ruling is blamed for reducing the court's stature to its
all-time low and undermining its authority.
   When court decisions of the 1950s and 1960s dramatically expanded
civil and individual rights, some said the court was drifting far
from the American mainstream.
   The chief justice became a lightning rod for criticism by
conservatives, and ``Impeach Earl Warren'' billboards appeared.
   But two decades later, many of the Warren court's most
controversial rulings remain the law of the land _ and have become
generally accepted.
   Public opinion polls and even demonstrations outside its building
are not likely to sway the court, but the justices acknowledge that
expressions of popular sentiment can have an impact.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist reportedly once told a group
of newspaper reporters and editors that a cogent editorial could be
influential.
   He is said to have commented wryly that the court is interested
in solid, logical arguments ``no matter how unlikely the source.''

   Soviet doctors, overwhelmed by earthquake
casualties in devastated Armenia, did the best they could with
schoolboy Karen Kocharian's crushed hand. American doctors hoped to
finish the job with complex microsurgery. In this second story in an
intermittent series tracing Karen's progress, Associated Press
reporter Bruce Rule describes agonizing hours inside the operating
room and details the surgery's results.

   The boy had told everyone, ``I'm going to get
my hand back.''
   Now, far from his home in Armenia, where an earthquake three
months ago maimed his right hand, Karen Kocharian waited with his
father to be taken to the operating room for a transplant of toes
for missing fingers. The 9-year-old grew quiet and withdrawn.
   When doctors came to prepare Karen, his father, Sarkis, carried
the boy from the bed to the stretcher. The interpreter hadn't
arrived, so the doctors tried using hand signs to explain what was
happening. Karen and his father didn't understand.
   Sarkis Kocharian tried to keep the boy calm but Karen, who also
lost his left eye in the quake, kept remembering operations in the
Soviet Union. Every time he had gone into the operating room, he
came out with something missing.
   Normally a stoic man, the father turned away several times and
wiped tears from his eyes. Once or twice he sat and covered his head.
   Ahead was another long operation, Karen's first since Project
Hope brought him and 36 other young Armenians to U.S. hospitals for
special treatment.
   Dr. Lee Osterman, director of hand surgery at Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia, estimated an 8-hour operation.
   It was not to be.
   The first four hours were routine, the veins and arteries being
labelled and the second and third toes on the left foot amputated in
one piece. Osterman said the missing toes would not affect Karen's
ability to walk _ or to play his favorite game, soccer.
   After attaching the toe bones to the hand with pins, Osterman
wheeled a high-powered microscope over to begin microsurgery.
   He used a piece of vein from the foot to bridge the gap between a
major hand artery, which had been damaged in the quake, and one in
the transplanted toes. The attachment completed, Osterman waited for
the blood to flow into the new toe-fingers.
   It didn't.
   ``The pulse is there but it's dying somewhere north of the thumb.
Once it is hooked together it either flows or it doesn't,'' Osterman
said.
   He held up a closed fist to illustrate. ``We like it to boom _
hook it up and it goes boom,'' he said, quickly opening his fingers.
   The blockage could be simple spasms, causing the vessels to
contract because they're cold, Osterman said, or something inside in
the vessel.
   ``This is where the technique leaves and the luck begins,'' he
said.
   Estimating where the blockage might be in the artery, he cut the
vessel closer to the wrist. Blood spurted _ spitting two, three feet
onto the floor.
   A second vein was used to re-attach the arteries. Osterman said
he could ``feel a thrill'' _ a pulse _ to the toe-fingers, but ``not
enough. It's not providing sufficient flow.''
   The operating room telephone rang. A nurse said Karen's father
was asking why the operation was taking so long. It was 7:30 p.m.,
three hours after he thought it should have ended.
   Osterman went out to talk with Kocharian and George Ohanian, a
Soviet immigrant storekeeper whose family is acting as host to the
boy and his father.
   ``He's fine,'' the doctor said, showing on his own hand what had
been done inside. Ohanian translated. ``It will be three, maybe four
more hours.''
   Kocharian smiled slightly, politely, then nodded and looked down
to the floor. Ohanian had been walking him through the halls since
morning. ``If we sit he begins to ask why it's taking so long.''
   Other Armenian parents and Armenian-American helpers gathered
around Kocharian, offering silent support. Albert Zamanian, whose
17-year-old daughter Armenuhi was being treated for crushed arms,
gave him a set of Middle Eastern worry beads, called tesbik.
   Kocharian absently fondled the yellow beads, repeating over and
over, ``Peace, Love, God.''
   It was now 8:30 p.m. Back in the operating room, one of the
assistants leaned over to Osterman. The assistant's car was in a
garage that closes at midnight. Osterman did not turn from the
microscope.
   ``Better move it.''
   By 11:00 p.m., Osterman had almost completed attaching the toes'
vein to the hand when blood started flowing through the new
appendages.
   ``We're getting a little, but it's still too white. We want pink
toes.''
   As the vein was completely attached, the flow increased, but the
blood was not traveling through the toes properly.
   The doctors talked, and decided to close the wound and wait to
see if the circulation improved. They wrapped the hand, leaving the
toe-fingers sticking through the gauze.
   It was shortly after midnight, more than 16 hours after the
operation began, when Osterman went to find Karen's father.
   Kocharian watched as the surgeon explained to Ohanian what had
happened, throwing the best possible light on the operation's
chances.
   Leading the men down a hall near the recovery room, Osterman
stopped the doctors pushing Karen's stretcher. A doctor touched
Karen's face, and his eyes opened.
   His father looked down, smiled and nodded. The boy's eyes closed,
and Kocharian broke down and turned to the wall _ sobbing in relief.
   Within days of the March 3 surgery, Karen had recovered enough to
ask for his favorite American food, corned beef sandwiches. He also
ate an Armenian treat, strawberries, and watched monster movies on
television.
   Circulation in the transplanted toes, however, had not increased.
   Last Tuesday, Osterman operated again, stripping the skin from
the toe-fingers and inserting them into a flap of skin in the groin
area. Karen's hand will remain attached there for a month, as the
capillaries in the skin flap graft naturally to the hand.
   The flap will then be cut away, leaving only a scar, and will be
cut between the toes so the boy will have two fingers to work
against his thumb.
   His father shook his head after the second operation. ``I am not
convinced. I am not sure that this is all over now, ... that this
one will work.''

   The takeover strategist said Wednesday the striking Machinists
union had contacted him several times in the last week, asking him
to enter into talks with the union ``concerning the acquisition by
TWA of Eastern.''
   His emergence in the quickly deteriorating situation at Eastern
came on the fifth day of a strike at the subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp., run by an old Icahn adversary, Frank Lorenzo.

   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the
government intervened heavily to support the dollar against key
foreign currencies in the late fall _ particularly after the
presidential elections _ then reversed course by early this year as
market conditions changed.
   The intervention to influence the level of the dollar in the
three months ended Jan. 31 was the heaviest in a year, according to
the latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which carries out the operations.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said its board of directors has
approved its largest-ever spending plan, which was contingent on
union ratification of a five-year labor contract.
   The approval of a $90 million modernization of its Pittsburgh
factory came after Local 325 of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers
Union, representing 980 workers, last Friday ratified a five-year
labor contract. The pact provides moderate wage increases and
cost-of-living protection.
   ``We are now ready to move forward with the largest single
capital investment in Heinz U.S.A.'s 120-year history, a project
that will make us more competitive and also provide employees with
much greater job security in the future,'' David Sculley, president
of Heinz U.S.A., said Wednesday.
   The restructuring involves converting the existing warehouse
building at the company's North Side complex to a state-of-the-art
manufacturing facility for soups and baby food and constructing a
new warehouse and a separate cold storage facility.
   Heinz pushed for a contract long enough to ensure labor peace and
continued production during the estimated four-year construction
period.
   The factory employs about 1,000 workers. Heinz expects employment
to drop to about 700 to 750 workers, mostly through attrition, once
construction is completed.

<HEAD>Toyota Ready To Go With Lexus Advertising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. says it's ready to begin
nationwide advertising for its new luxury car division after a
federal appeals court cleared the way for the Japanese automaker to
use the Lexus name.
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
New York decided unanimously Wednesday to overturn a lower court's
ruling that barred Toyota from using the name. It also removed all
injunctions and stays.
   ``We won. It was a 3-0 vote,'' Toyota spokesman Kurt Von Zumwalt
said by telephone from the company's U.S. headquarters in California
shortly after learning of the court's ruling.
   Toyota was sued by Mead Data Central Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, last
year. Mead claimed Toyota's use of the Lexus name infringed on its
trademark for a computerized information retrieval service called
Lexis.
   Mead attorney Charles Faruki said Wednesday the next step
probably would be to take the case to the full appeals court.
   ``I am disappointed, but I never give in,'' he said.
   Faruki and Toyota attorney Bill Plourde said a written opinion
would be issued later.
   ``We, of course, are very pleased with the decision,'' Plourde
said. ``We will be interested to see what the opinion says. Now we
can go forward with direct mailing which we had planned.''
   Von Zumwalt said the company was prepared to market its new cars
with another name if it lost the case or if it dragged into next
month.
   ``We had plans for advertising in USA Today and the Wall Street
Journal,'' he said. ``We canceled those ads because of this lawsuit.
Those ads are ready to go.''
   Mead filed the suit in New York, citing that state's so-called
antidilution law governing trademarks. In late December, U.S.
District Judge David Edelstein ruled that Toyota would be unable to
use the Lexus name because it would dilute the effect of Mead's
Lexis name, even though he agreed that nobody would confuse Lexus
the car with Lexis the data-retrieval service.
   Later, Toyota was permitted to use the Lexus name at auto shows
in Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago, where it introduced the new
models, but it was barred from national advertising.
   Toyota challenged the orders and last week asked for an expedited
ruling, Von Zumwalt said.
   ``The court took this action because of certain time requirements
that we were facing,'' Plourde said. ``We know that was behind their
decision to issue their letter or decision today.''
   Toyota plans to introduce the Lexus luxury car line in September.
It will consist of two models ranging in price from about $20,000 to
about $35,000.
   Among Lexus' competitors will be Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti
line. The Japanese models also will be in showrooms this fall with a
similar price range.

   The company that lost a bitter trademark
dispute in a federal appeals court is a futuristic computerized
information retrieval service, with banks of computers in a
bunkered, earthquake-proof building.
   Mead Data Central Inc. of Dayton electronically stores general
news, business, legal, medical and other information. The data is
fed daily from newspapers, magazines, wire services, book publishers
and other sources.
   The information is collected through satellite transmissions,
telephone lines and even _ in the case of court documents _
transcribed from copies, then placed in Mead's electronic library in
a format that can be quickly located and retrieved.
   ``Everything that's happening today will be in our system _ or
most of it _ by tomorrow,'' said Jack Simpson, president of Mead
Data Central.
   The company has about 200,000 active users in 50 countries. Its
computer library is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and runs
between 50,000 and 75,000 active information searches every day.
   About 500 million characters of information are added to the
library weekly. The company employs about 3,000 workers, 1,500 of
them in Dayton. The workers manage the information coming into the
system and keep the computers operating.
   A customer seeking information calls Mead through a computer
hookup. The information is instantly researched and relayed back via
computer, with the customer billed for the amount of computer time
used.
   During the peak afternoon hours, the Mead computers can be
handling as many as 900 calls simultaneously.
   Discs and computers are kept in a bunkered building on 1.5 acres.
The building is fireproof and earthquake-proof, and has five huge
diesel generators _ ``enough to run a small city'' _ in case power
fails.
   ``It's a very sophisticated never-die kind of a computing
facility,'' Simpson said. ``The customers are not very sympathetic
if they need information and it's not there.''
   Mead Data Central is a unit of Mead Corp., the Dayton-based paper
maker. The subsidiary was formed about 15 years ago with the
creation of Lexus, the electronic information system designed for
law firms and corporations.
   Lexus is the focus of a trademark feud with Japan's Toyota Motor
Corp., which has introduced a new luxury car called Lexis. Mead Data
Central said the Lexis name infringed on its Lexus name.
   On Wednesday, a federal appeals court panel in New York turned
aside Mead Data Central's attempt to bar Toyota from using the Lexus
name. It was unclear whether Mead would appeal.
   The company turned in a record year in 1988, pulling in more than
$300 million in revenue. Simpson has said he believes the computer
information industry is still in the process of forming.
   ``Proving that you could put all of this in a computer and
managing all those words took a lot of doing,'' he said. ``Making it
economical for law firms and corporations to use has been a big
challenge.''
   Simpson said the company is also moving into information storage
for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which generates massive
amounts of data. The company is part of a consortium that recently
won a $52 million contract to computerize the SEC.
   Simpson said the amount of data held by the SEC is equivalent to
all of the information Mead has put into its computer over the past
15 years. It would be the first federal agency to place its data in
an electronic library in this form.

<HEAD>Feminist Causes Stir With Business Review Article About Woman Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A feminist who works to advance career
opportunities for women caused a stir by writing in the Harvard
Business Review that female managers cost corporations more than
male ones do.
   Felice N. Schwartz also urged employers to recognize two kinds of
woman managers: those who put their careers first and those who care
more about their children.
   ``The cost of employing women in management is greater than the
cost of employing men,'' Ms. Schwartz wrote in the review's
January-February issue in her article, ``Management Women and the
New Facts of Life.''
   ``This is a jarring statement, partly because it is true, but
mostly because it is something people are reluctant to talk about,''
she wrote.
   Published by Harvard Business School, the review has 210,000
subscribers, about 95 percent of them in business. Since the issue
was published, furious debate has ensued, said managing editor Alan
Webber. Woman managers are talking about it at business conferences
and the magazine has received a dozen letters. ``It struck a
nerve,'' he said.
   While many readers, men and women alike, applaud Ms. Schwartz
boldness, some protest that it is damaging to women.
   ``Everybody's very troubled by it,'' U.S. Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., said Wednesday in an interview from Washington.
   The article gives ammunition to those opposed to women's
advancement, Ms. Schroeder said.
   ``There's nothing they love more. If you can find a woman who can
say `We don't deserve equal pay' they love it,'' the congresswoman
said. ``Women have really felt in the '80s they were really going
backward anyway, and this gives the aura of the seal of approval of
the Harvard Business School. That's the tragedy.''
   Webber, however, said the reaction he has received generally
touches on two themes. ``A lot of people say it is a mistake to
categorize the issue as a women's issue, that it's a family issue.
... Younger men who are interested, as a generation, in raising
children are facing pressures not unlike those facing women,'' he
said.
   Other letter-writers said they were glad someone opened debate on
the subject. ``It's been kind of a dirty little secret,'' Webber
said.
   Richard Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports Inc., wrote
to the review that the article is ``a historical turning point in
the discussion of women in business.''
   Ms. Schwartz is founder and president of Catalyst, a non-profit
research and advisory group in New York that works with corporations
to foster career and leadership development of women.
   A self-described social advocate for 45 years, Ms. Schwartz said
she is the mother of three sons and has four grandchildren, all of
them in two-career families.
   In the article, Ms. Schwartz said heightened sensitivity to
charges of sexism, as well as fear of confrontation and lawsuits,
prevent people from discussing the matter.
   Only a minority of women put their careers first, but they must
be cultivated, the article asserts. At the same time, women serious
about both their careers and their families can provide corporations
with flexibility through job-sharing and part-time work, even if it
slows the women's progress up the ladder, it says.
   In an interview from New York, Ms. Schwartz said ruefully that
those who attack her ideas need to read her article more closely.
   Her point was that corporations need to adjust to demographic
facts: ``There are not enough good men to go around,'' she said
   She disagreed that corporate executives would use her article as
an excuse to keep women back. ``What they want is the best and the
brightest to come to their companies. They're not looking for
excuses,'' she said.
   ``We're trying to educate employers that it makes good business
sense to accommodate women who want to reach out'' _ women who want
to take a career break to bear and raise children, she said.
   ``I want corporate America to realize that women cost more ...
but it's a short-term cost.''

<HEAD>Central Bank Reveals Year-End Dollar Intervention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States spent more than $2 billion to
support the dollar's value in foreign-exchange trading during
November and December, but it reversed course by early this year as
market conditions changed, a Federal Reserve report shows.
   The latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasury
Department bought or sold $4.3 billion for the equivalent amount of
West German marks or Japanese yen between Nov. 1 and Jan. 31.
   Both agencies bought $2.4 billion against those two currencies in
November and early December and sold $1.88 billion against marks in
January as market sentiment turned more bullish.
   In the previous three-month period, from August to October, U.S.
intervention totaled $2.3 billion, with the government selling $2.14
billion for marks and buying $200 billion with yen.
   Sam Y. Cross, an executive vice president of the New York Fed,
said the latest operations were designed to maintain market
stability and generally were coordinated between the central banks
of the ``Group of Seven'' industrial nations. Besides the United
States, the G-7 includes Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy
and Canada.
   ``We don't have targets for the dollar,'' Cross explained at a
news briefing. ``We just try to bring about greater stability.''
   Cross said that some of the government's intervention operations
were done jointly with other central banks, but at other times the
United States acted alone after notifying its trading partners.
   Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of
central banks in the open markets, but the Fed's policy is to
comment only well after the fact. The Fed also does not provide any
data on intervention by foreign central banks.
   The dollar-buying operations by the Fed and Treasury in November
and early December came as the currency was coming under continuing
pressure in worldwide markets, especially against the mark and yen.
   The dollar had started to decline in late September and reached
its lows of the November-January period on Nov. 25, when it fell to
120.65 yen and 1.7085 marks, or about 11 percent below the highs of
the year reached in early fall. Lately it has been trading in the
markets at around 1.80 marks and 128 yen.
   The dollar's weakness had come as the market began to doubt that
the large improvement in the U.S. trade deficit experienced during
early 1988 would continue. Traders also expressed growing impatience
with the lack of progress in reducing the nation's huge budget
deficit.
   Those concerns came to a head after the Nov. 4 presidential
election, with currency traders questioning whether the Bush
administration could reduce the twin deficits and keep its promise
not to raise taxes.
   Intervention began Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, when the government bought
$350 million against the sale of yen, according to the Fed report.
The government also entered the market from Nov. 9 to Nov. 16, when
it bought $625 million with yen; and between Nov. 17 and Dec. 2,
when it bought $795 million with yen and $630 million against marks,
the report said.
   By the new year, the currency market had shed its negative view
of the dollar. The turnaround began after Soviet General Secretary
Gorbachev proposed Soviet arms cuts in a Dec. 7 speech before the
United Nations.
   The speech ``was temporarily seen as providing scope for the
United States to reduce its budget deficit through defense spending
cuts,'' the Fed report noted. But even after that, the dollar
continued to rise as interest rates continued to move higher, it
said.
   The government sold dollars against marks on the 12 days between
Jan. 6 and Jan. 27, the report said.
   The dollar reached its highest point of the decade in February
1985. It declined slightly until September 1985, when G-7 leaders
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the U.S. trade gap and
stave off protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   The dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988.

<HEAD>Major TV Networks Say Time Warner Deal Shows Importance of Deregulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major commercial television networks are
pointing to the merger pact between Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. to support their campaign for relaxed federal
regulation of program ownership.
   But independent television stations, who have become a much
stronger competitor for the ABC, CBS and NBC networks in recent
years, say deregulation would unfairly skew the competition for
programming in favor of the networks.
   One of the motivations cited for the Time-Warner combination was
an interest in keeping pace with what is quickly becoming a global
market for media and entertainment companies.
   Time, a leader in magazine publishing, cable networks and cable
system operations, has the potential to provide more outlets for
Warner's entertainment production units, including its movie and
television studios.
   The networks say they share the ambition to compete in the global
marketplace, but are hamstrung by a court decree limiting the amount
of prime-time programming they may produce and federal regulations
forbidding them from having a financial interest in the other shows
they run.
   ``The Time-Warner agreement is a vivid example of how greatly the
media world has changed,'' said Cory Dunham, general counsel for the
National Broadcasting Co. ``But by government regulation, the
networks can't participate in this evolution.''
   George Schweitzer, a spokesman for CBS Inc., said, ``Those we
compete with and are in the same business are free to think of any
competitive situation they want ... They are free to grow their
business and we are not.''
   Under terms of a 9-year-old court consent decree due to expire
next year, the television networks may produce no more than five
hours of their own prime-time entertainment programming.
   Even at that, the networks have shown little inclination to
produce their own shows. ABC's ``Moonlighting'' was recently placed
on hiatus, but the other two networks have none of their own shows
on their prime-time schedules.
   Separately, the networks are prohibited from having a financial
interest in other shows they run or sharing in the proceeds from the
syndication of network shows for reruns under terms of Federal
Communications Commission rules adopted nearly 20 years ago.
   In addition, there are rules that prohibit networks from
packaging their own programs with programs others produce and
selling them here or abroad.
   The networks and Hollywood studios have been negotiating
privately for months on reaching a compromise on the issue of
federal regulation of networks.
   The networks argue that their dominance of the television market
has slipped since the FCC rules were enacted.
   As of last November, the three networks' share of the prime-time
audience fell to 68 percent from 92 percent in the 1978-79 season,
according to Nielsen Media Research. Network executives say they
expect their combined share may fall even further.
   NBC's Dunham said the networks are not so much interested in
being able to buy a studio as they are in being able to invest in
new productions and to buy and package programs for distribution
abroad.
   ``To be a viable player in this business, you need to be a player
in the businesses that make it up,'' he said.
   But the movie studios and the independent television stations
argue that the networks simply want to strengthen an already strong
market position.
   Lawrence Laurent, a spokesman for the Association of Independent
Television Stations, said before the financial interest rules were
enacted the networks withheld their most popular shows from the
syndication market or sold them first to their own stations and
their own network affiliates.
   Enactment of the rules allowed independents to compete more
effectively for popular shows, a position they don't want to
relinquish. ``It's very difficult to depend on your competitor for
programming,'' he said.

<HEAD>Levi's Ad Pulled From Channel One Due To Objection From School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The creators of Channel One, the daily news show
launched this week in six schools, have agreed to pull a Levi's
jeans ads from the program because Detroit school officials found it
sexually suggestive.
   The decision to pull the ad comes as the project begins a 25-show
test amid complaints from some educators that it is inappropriate to
allow television advertisements in their classrooms.
   The 30-second Levi's ad, which has aired on commercial
television, shows a montage of scenes with young people, including a
boys' choir, several youngsters dancing and a romantic couple
walking away together.
   Robin Oden, principal at Mumford High School in Detroit, said
Wednesaday that four of the eight people he instructed to review the
program before it was aired in classrooms Monday felt the Levi's ad
was sexually suggestive.
   Oden said that although he had the choice of not running the
program, he ran it anyway because it was the first day of the test
and a big media contingent was on hand to write about it.
   But he said he told officials of Whittle Communications, the
Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern that developed Channel One, he
wouldn't air the ad any more.
   Bill Gubbins, a Whittle official who was in Detroit that day,
said he assured Oden the ad would not be repeated.
   ``This is a test and one of the things we are learning about is
how broad or how narrow the sensitivities are going to be in the
individual schools,'' he said. ``We wanted to make sure they felt
their concerns were being addressed.''
   Dan Chew, marketing manager at Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in San
Francisco, said Wednesday his company and its ad agency were
notified there was a problem with the ad. He said it is one of four
commercials the company planned to rotate through shows during the
test.
   ``We have made no changes to that plan. We've heard nothing from
anyone about it, and until that request comes in formally, we will
stick with our schedule,'' he said.
   Levi Strauss is one of eight advertisers signed up for the test.
Others are Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, Wrigley
Co.'s gum, Warner-Lambert Co.'s breath mints and Gillette Co.'s
shaving products.
   Sara Fortune, a spokesman for Whittle, said she was unaware of
any other complaints from test schools about the ads.
   Whittle has given each school $50,000 in televisions, video
recording equipment and a satellite dish to receive the 12-minute
news program each day. Each show will contain up to two minutes of
advertising.
   In exchange, the schools are asked to show the program once each
school day.
   Several education groups, including the National Parent-Teacher
Association and the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, denounced the commercials, calling them an unwarranted
intrusion by business into the schools.
   But students and teachers who have seen the program expressed few
reservations about the ads and said they liked a news show targeted
to teens. Oden himself said that even though he wasn't happy with
the Levi's commercial, he was pleased with the first three shows.
   ``The information they give to the kids is outstanding. The
students have told me, `This news show is not boring.' That's the
general feeling the youngsters have about watching the program,'' he
said.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today amid political uncertainties and economic rumors, while the
dollar gained against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 181.21 points, or 0.57
percent, closing at 31,656.45.
   The market's main barometer, a 100.28-point loser Wednesday, made
moderate gains in today's early trading following gains on overseas
markets overnight, but then turned downward.
   ``Trading was inactive as investors stepped off to the sidelines
in the absence of market-affecting incentives today,'' said a dealer
with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Uncertainties over how Japanese politics will be affected by a
major stock-profiteering scandal, in which prosecutors have arrested
12 people, also discouraged many investors, said the dealer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Two of the arrests came Wednesday, and opposition parties began
boycotting budget debates in Parliament, demanding that Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet resign or at least submit
documents to clarify the involvement of leading politicians in the
scandal.
   The Nomura dealer added that price declines in afternoon trading
followed a rumor that the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates.
   In thin trading, first section volume was estimated at 800
million shares.
   The dealer predicted that the inactive trend would continue at
least until February's U.S. employment figures are released Friday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 129.23 yen, up 0.50
yen from Wednesday's 128.73-yen finish. It opened at 129.32 yen and
ranged between 129.10 yen and 129.40 yen.
   Currency trading was also inactive before the U.S. employment
report, said a dealer with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Although the dollar-yen rate moved little, the market sentiment
was toward a stronger dollar, especially after the comment (by U.S.
Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Michael Boskin) that indicated
a possible tax raise in the United States,'' he added.
   Speaking before a congressional committee, Boskin said the
administration of President Bush has ``not ruled out a discussion''
of taxes as part of budget negotiations with Congress.
   ``The dollar-yen rate has been moving in `a box range' between
128.50 yen and 129.50 yen in recent dealings, but the market expects
central bank intervention if the dollar gets stronger,'' the dealer
said.

   The dollar was higher in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said they expected little movement
before Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures for February.
   ``The market is without direction and is waiting for some new
signals either to take it (the dollar) up or down,'' said one trader
in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.50 yen to a closing 129.23. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 129.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8623 West German marks, up from 1.8585; 1.5905
Swiss francs, up from 1.5865; 6.3145 French francs, up from 6.3080;
2.1015 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0930; 1,366.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,363.20; 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20155.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7165, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7200 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $392.40 a troy ounce,
down from $393.80 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $392.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $392.50, down from $394.75 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 55 cents to close at a bid
$393.51.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.87 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $5.91.

<HEAD>Apple Industry Strikes Back At Actress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Meryl Streep says her national
television appearances warning against eating chemically treated
apples doesn't mean she's ``beating up on farmers.''
   But the Washington apple industry blasted the movie star
Wednesday, saying her involvement in a nationwide controversy on the
chemical Alar is hurting growers.
   ``Three years ago movie actresses were spilling all over the
place trying to save the family farm,'' said Chris Schlect, an
industry lobbyist based in Yakima. ``Now we have actresses going out
trying to destroy agriculture.''
   Schlect, head of the Northwest Horticultural Council, said the
Academy Award-winning actress has credibility because of her movie
roles but, ``It doesn't make her a scientist or expert on
nutrition.''
   Ms. Streep, a founder of the group Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits, told The Associated Press her lack of scientific
training was not the issue.
   ``I'm not a scientist so I have to go with the best information
available,'' she said. ``I eat them and I feed them (to my three
children) so I am involved in the apple issue.''
   ``I'm not interested in beating up on farmers,'' Ms. Streep said.
``I'm interested in farmers being supported to grow in ways not
threatening to health.''
   Although the safety of Alar has been debated for years, the
latest controversy was stirred last month because of a report by the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   The council, a non-profit consumer group, projected that 5,500 to
6,200 preschoolers eventually would get cancer because of childhood
exposure to six to eight chemicals used in fruits and vegetables.
   It found the greatest risk from UDMH, a breakdown product of
Alar. The council estimated that the average preschooler's cancer
risk was approximately one case for every 4,000 preschoolers exposed
to UDMH.
   The report has been attacked by some scientists and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency as misleading and alarmist, although
the agency did announce plans to ban Alar by 1990.
   Fears of a consumer backlash have prompted the apple industry to
severely cut its use of Alar. The grower-financed Washington Apple
Commission says only about 5 percent of total apple acreage is
treated.
   Washington is the nation's largest apple producer, growing about
half of all supermarket apples.
   Ms. Streep, whose group is affiliated with the council, has
appeared on shows like ``Today'' and ``Donahue,'' denouncing the use
of Alar and calling on farmers to reduce chemical use.
   The controversy showed no signs of easing Wednesday as the New
York Board of Education said it has barred the sale of apples in
school cafeterias.
   To combat the negative publicity, the Apple Commission announced
it was spending $1 million on full-page advertisements that will
appear Friday in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles papers,
as well as USA Today, spokeswoman Vicky Scharlau said.
   The ads will say that Alar is used only sparingly, that its
health threat isn't proven and that the benefits of eating apples
far outweigh any risks.
   Alar is not a pesticide. It is a chemical growth regulator
sprayed on trees to improve the color and firmness of apples,
extending shelf life and the harvest period. Because it works
internally, Alar cannot be washed off like other chemicals.

<HEAD>Blacks, Hispanics Trail in Income Growth</HEAD>

   Blacks and Hispanics missed out on the rise in
median family income to $30,850 in 1987, the highest real level
since the string of recessions that began 14 years earlier, the
Census Bureau says.
   In a report released Wednesday, the bureau said the 1987 median
family income figure was 1 percent higher than the previous year's
and represented the fifth consecutive annual increase.
   Since 1982, the figure has grown nearly 12 percent, the report
said.
   ``These recent increases have brought real median family income
comparable to that of 1973, a year when median family income reached
an all-time high before a series of recessions resulted in
substantial declines in family income,'' the report said.
   Overall, white families increased their median income by 1.1
percent from 1986 to 1987, according to the report ``Money Income of
Households, Families and Persons in the United States: 1987.''
   The 1987 median income of white families was $32,274, up from
$31,935 a year earlier, the report said.
   By comparison, median income for black familes was $18,098, down
from $18,247, while for Hispanics the median fell to $20,306 from
$20,726, according to the study. The study is an expanded version of
an analysis released in August that found nearly one-third of all
black Americans living in poverty.
   While the earlier report detailed the poverty status of various
segments of society, the new edition contains extensive detail on
income for differing groups.
   Among family groups, the highest incomes were reported for white
married couples at $35,295, up from $34,647. Black married couples
saw their median income fall from $27,554 to $27,182, while for
Hispanic couples there was a drop from $24,786 to $24,677.
   White families maintained by a woman with no husband present had
an income increase from $16,290 to $17,018.
   Black female householders reported an increase from $9,640 to
$9,710. Among Hispanics the median for this group edged up from
$9,777 to $9,805.
   The biggest income gain by education was for people with one to
three years of college. Families headed by people in this category
saw their incomes rise from $35,455 to $36,392.
   Ranked by education, families headed by people with more than
five years of college still had the highest income at $54,491, but
that was down a bit, from $54,595. And for those with four years of
college, income fell from $47,269 to $46,533.
   High school grads saw a 0.6 percent increase from $29,765 to
$29,937, while income for families headed by those with some high
school education climbed from $20,854 to $21,265. Family income for
those with no high school education fell from $14,616 to $14,547.
   Regionally, Southerners led in income gains, with median family
income rising from $27,684 to $28,250, up 2.0 percent.
   Despite having the largest gain, Southerners continue to have the
nation's lowest median income.
   In the Northeast, the rise was 1.8 percent, from $33,335 to
$33,938, and in the Midwest, 1.1 percent, from $30,665 to $30,991.
In the West, median income slipped 0.2 percent from $32,096 to
$32,026.
   By residence, the greatest gain was 3.6 percent for families
living in the suburbs of cities with less than 1 million people.
Their income rose from $32,034 to $33,192.
   Rural residents were next, increasing their incomes 1.3 percent,
from $24,078 to $24,397. Large-city suburbanites had income growth
of 1.1 percent from $39,850 to $40,270.
   Inner-city residents of large cities had an income drop from
$27,654 to $27,458, while families in smaller inner cities saw their
income dip from $27,614 to $27,294.
   Median is the middle number in a series.

   Residents concerned about a financial
crisis that threatens mass layoffs of St. Francis County employees
have paid more than $100,000 in taxes in recent days, seven months
before they were due.
   ``I know it's unusual. I've never seen anybody come to the
collector's office without a (tax) statement to look me up and say,
`Here's the money,''' County Clerk Dick Krablin said Wednesday.
   ``It's great, although we are not out of the woods by any means.''
   The eastern Arkansas county, which has the state's highest
jobless rate, owes about $240,000 and has only about $20,000 in the
bank. Officials blamed the shortfall on the elimination of federal
revenue sharing and costs such as $106,000 in court-mandated jail
improvements.
   As a short-term solution to the crisis, county officials began
encouraging early tax payments on Friday, the day the Quorum Court
Budget Committee considered emergency spending cuts. The full court
is to vote Tuesday on other actions, including slashing payrolls by
50 percent.
   Without new money, the county can't meet a March 31 payroll.
   The county usually mails property tax statements from March to
June, and payments aren't due until Oct. 10. But to encourage early
payments, volunteers have crowded county offices each night to
stuff, sort and mail statements that include a letter pleading for
early remittance.
   About 9,000 out of 25,000 tax statements had been mailed by
Wednesday, and volunteers will work through the weekend, Krablin
said.
   ``But the money we've gotten so far _ gosh, $109,000 _ that's
from people who heard we had problems and just stepped right up to
help. We haven't advertised. It's just been media coverage and word
of mouth,'' Krablin said.
   The volunteers include two dozen county employees with a personal
stake in the fiscal crisis.
   Jerry Smith, chairman of the county office of the Cooperative
Extension Service, said he's faced with laying off about 10 of his
14 employees in a worst-case scenario.
   ``These courthouse employees are doing their dead-level best to
help,'' Smith said. ``They've been working hard, and we will keep
working.''
   If all of the taxes are paid promptly, about $4 million will be
generated, Krablin said.
   But the county general fund gets only 10 percent of the total,
with most obligated for schools. And Krablin said not everyone can
pay quickly because the county has been battered by industrial
layoffs, a slumping farm economy and the burden of Arkansas' highest
unemployment rate _ 23.4 percent in January.
   ``It's just going to be impossible for some people, and we don't
want to embarrass them,'' Krablin said. ``It is a voluntary
gesture.''

   Jerrell Sheppard has cleaned aircraft engines at
Eastern Airlines for the past five years and takes pride in a job
well done.
   Six months ago, he was in a car accident and was placed on
short-term disability at half pay. That stopped last month after a
company doctor said he could go back to work, but the letter from
the carrier authorizing his return never came.
   Now Sheppard, 43, is walking a Machinist picket line wearing a
neck brace. He has medical debts of about $6,000, has lost his
insurance benefits and faces the prospect he may lose his
$30,000-a-year job.
   ``You feel bad about not being at work, but you have to come out
here and support the union and what you believe in,'' Sheppard said
Wednesday.
   Similar sentiments came from other Eastern employees, including
pilots and flight attendants who joined the Machinists when they
struck the Miami-based carrier Saturday.
   ``I think people are still very pumped up,'' said Peggy Richards,
34, a flight attendant picketing in front of a virtually empty
Eastern terminal at Miami International Airport. ``We've all cried,
but the depression hasn't set in. We're still on a high.''
   Emotion was evident Wednesday night at a rally just outside the
Machinists union hall, which has turned into a sometimes chaotic
strike headquarters for pilots and flight attendants as well. Jesse
Jackson charged up about 3,000 workers with a message that in unity
they would prevail.
   The solidarity of the Machinists, pilots and flight attendants
has surprised some of the pickets.
   ``I'm encouraged mainly because of the support of all the
unions,'' said Dwight Bush, 43, a 22-year Eastern employee. ``If
it's not going to work out, we're better off looking for something
else.''
   Many workers say they have been contacting other airlines or
considering a career change if the company collapses. But finding
another job might prove difficult in the Miami area if thousands of
colleagues have to do the same, Bush acknowleged.
   The Machinists union has a $100 million strike fund and is paying
$100 a week to members who picket at least four hours a week. The
pilots union expects to pay its members 30 days after their last
paycheck, but no figure has been set.
   Flight attendants don't have a strike war chest, although the
Association of Flight Attendants and the AFL-CIO were expected to
provide some funds.
   Richards started full-time with Eastern 13 years ago and calls
the job ``addicting.'' But she said if she can't return to the
airline, she'll probably get a nursing job.
   Richards said she went back to school as labor turmoil escalated
at Eastern. If she sought employment at another airline, her
starting pay could be half her current salary.

   Share prices were slowly sinking in patchy midday
dealings Thursday, with a handful of sellers able to push the
overall market lower.
   ``In this low volume, it doesn't take much margin to pull things
down,'' one salesman said.
   Caution ahead of Tuesday's British budget kept many players
sidelined, while the approaching close of a very active two-week
trading account gave participants little reason to modify existing
positions, observers noted.
   Dealers also claimed that loose talk of rights issues in several
leaders were responsible for dragging the market lower. Some said
they were waiting for Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures
for February before committing fresh funds to the market.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
down 12.7 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,072.0, a shade above its
midmorning low of 2,069.2 but well off the opening high of 2,077.7.
   Turnover registered 272.9 million shares by midday compared with
324 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

   Pan Am flight 794 from Kennedy International Airport landed at

   A federal judge has allowed creditors to begin
claiming the assets of former automaker John DeLorean after an
extension ran out on a $9.4 million bankruptcy settlement.
   U.S. District Judge James Woods on Wednesday accepted an order
from creditors who seek DeLorean's first payment of $4.9 million.
The money was due Feb. 28.
   The 1987 settlement stems from claims against DeLorean, whose
sports car company went bankrupt in 1984 after his arrest on federal
cocaine smuggling charges. DeLorean was acquitted. He also was
acquitted of fraud in Detroit.
   Mayer Morganroth, an attorney representing DeLorean, said
Wednesday that a Utah bank and a New York mortgage banking company
are preparing a loan for DeLorean.
   The payment hasn't been made because DeLorean is fighting a $53
million judgment handed down on behalf of a British creditor,
Morganroth said.
   DeLorean's assets _ which could be claimed and sold if he fails
to produce the payment _ include a Utah manufacturing company, a New
York City apartment and a mansion and farm in New Jersey.

   Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn said
he is willing to meet with Eastern Airlines unions to discuss buying
the strike-paralyzed carrier if he is invited by Eastern's
management.
   But pressed to the limit, Eastern filed for protection from its
creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today, a move that could
make an Icahn takeover more cumbersome. The acquisition of a company
operating under Chapter 11 protection requires approval from both
creditors and the bankruptcy court.
   Icahn's emergence in the quickly deteriorating situation at
Eastern came Wednesday, the fifth day of a strike at the subsidiary
of Texas Air Corp., run by an old Icahn adversary, Frank Lorenzo.
Both battled for control of TWA in 1985, a fight Icahn eventually
won.
   Icahn said the striking Machinists union had contacted him
several times in the last week, asking him to enter into talks with
the union ``concerning the acquisition by TWA of Eastern.''
   ``I would be willing to speak to the unions only if Eastern
permits me to, because I do not want to be accused by Eastern of
interfering with the collective bargaining process,'' Icahn said in
a statement from his suburban New York office.
   He had mulled a possible bid for Eastern last fall, when Lorenzo
was considering selling the airline. But Icahn and the unions
couldn't agree on terms for a worker stake in a merger of TWA and
Eastern and talks broke off in October.
   The financier reportedly was seeking $250 million to $300 million
in labor concessions in exchange for an equity stake in Eastern for
the unions. Brian Freeman, financial adviser to the International
Association of Machinists, said he has asked Icahn to consider
restarting merger or takeover talks since the Eastern strike began
Saturday.
   Freeman, who also advises TWA employees, said he first suggested
acquiring Eastern to Icahn last year.
   ``Icahn seemed serious when we were discussing it with him a long
time ago,'' he said. ``I think to anyone who looks at this logically
... it makes a lot of sense. It's not a panacea. It's a way to
problem-solve lesser evils.''
   ``This is the most reasonable alternative if terms can be worked
out,'' he added.
   A secretary for Charles E. Bryan, president of the Machinists
local in Miami, said the union leader would not comment on Icahn's
statement.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the airline would not comment
on Icahn.
   Icahn, one of the decade's leading takeover investors, has chased
several large companies. Besides his takeover of TWA, he has
undertaken battles for steel-energy conglomerate USX Corp. and oil
giant Texaco Inc. He remains a major stockholder in both of those
companies.
   Wall Street considers a sale to TWA as one possible solution to
the financial woes at Eastern, which analysts estimate is worth
between $400 million plus debt assumption to $900 million if sold as
an entity.
   ``If Icahn _ and this is a big if _ is serious about keeping TWA
a major player well into the '90s, he has to make some capital moves
to acquire some other airlines or major equipment buys,'' said Louis
Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. ``It would seem Eastern would be cheapest way to do
both.''
   Icahn, who took TWA private last year, reportedly was interested
in Eastern's north-south routes, especially between New York and
Miami, as possible feeders into the airline's trans-Atlantic system.
   TWA is the nation's sixth-largest airline in terms of capacity
while Eastern is the seventh-largest.

<HEAD>Pillsbury to Benefit from Cost-cutting, Marketing, Management, Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co., acquired by Grand Metropolitan PLC
in January for $5.75 billion, will benefit from cost reductions,
marketing and management, the chairman of the British food and
liquor giant said Thursday.
   Allen Sheppard, addressing Grand Met's shareholders at their
annual meeting in London, said of Pillsbury: ``From the inside, it
looks as attractive as it did.''
   ``Pillsbury Foods is strong and well-branded, and should benefit
from cost reductions and sharp marketing.''
   Sheppard did not specify the reductions.
   The company also will benefit from ``the application of
consistent, high-quality management,'' Sheppard said. Pillsbury
``fits excellently in our worldwide strategic aims.''
   Grand Met's strategy is to focus on liquor, foods and retailing
and expand in North America and Asia, Sheppard has said repeatedly.
   In response to a question from a shareholder, Ian Martin, who is
chief executive of Grand Met's food sector and heads Pillsbury,
Sheppard said the company intends to market Pillsbury's Alpo pet
food brand in Asia, rather than in the already very competitive
European market.
   ``Our main thrust is to build up the business in Japan,'' Martin
said.
   Martin, who flew in for the meeting from Minneapolis, where
Pillsbury is headquartered, was re-elected by shareholders as a
member of Grand Met's board of directors.
   Also re-elected was George Bull, who serves as chief executive of
Grand Met's drinks sector.
   Shareholders also elected to the board included Sir Colin
Marshall, chief executive of British Airways PLC, and David Tagg,
chief executive of group services for Grand Met.
   ``With five months behind us, the year has started well and we
remain confident,'' Sheppard told shareholders.
   Grand Met's fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
   ``Grand Met is in excellent health and looks foreward to the
1990s with excitement, with health and with confidence,'' he said.

<HEAD>Palmer Puts Iowa's First TV Station Up For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa's first television station, KWQC of
Davenport, has been offered for sale by Palmer Communications Inc.,
the privately held company announced.
   William Ryan, president and chief executive officer of the Des
Moines-based communications company, said Wednesday that Palmer has
hired Howard Stark, a New York television broker, to sell the
station, which Palmer officials said is worth more than $45 million.
   Ryan said the decision to sell the station was made after Palmer
agreed Feb. 27 to buy KTVY-TV of Oklahoma City from Knight-Ridder
Inc. Terms of that sale were not disclosed.
   Ryan said that by selling its Davenport station and reinvesting
the capital gain in the Oklahoma City property, Palmer could defer
taxes on the gain from the sale. No other property could be sold in
order to get the tax deferment, he said.
   ``This was not an easy decision. KWQC-TV is a great television
station. It has performed exceedingly well and we're very proud of
it.'' Ryan said.
   ``While the potential sale of KWQC-TV is outside our normal
activities, these unique tax circumstances may allow Palmer, in
effect, to sell a station in the 79th largest market and buy one in
the 39th largest market for little money,'' he said.
   Ryan said the company hopes to find a buyer by late this year,
but it is possible that a transaction might not be completed until
1990. While KWQC-TV is an attractive property, he said the market
for television stations has softened lately because of rising
interest rates.
   Ryan announced the pending sale after flying to Davenport to tell
the station's staff. KWQC-TV employs 98 people.
   John Sloan, the station's general manager, said employees reacted
with cautious optimism. Because of the station's success, he said,
any knowledgeable buyer likely would carry on business as usual.
   KWQC-TV first went on the air in 1949 and used to have the call
letters WOC.
   Palmer also owns WHO-TV and radio stations WHO-AM and KLYF-FM in
Des Moines; radio stations in Tallahassee, Fort Myers and Naples,
Fla.; cable television systems in Palm Desert, Calif, and
Naples-Fort Myers, Fla.; and personal communication systems in Iowa,
New Mexico, Florida, Georgia and Alabama.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range today,
keeping a vigil for Friday's monthly report on the employment
situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .53 to 2,296.07
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 476 up, 401 down and
583 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.10 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market rose on Wednesday amid hopes that the employment
statistics for February would show a slowing of economic growth.
   Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the
inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on
interest rates.
   However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise,
analysts said, the market could suffer a letdown.
   In addition, the 2,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average
appears to have become something of a psychological barrier for
traders.
   The average climbed past that point in both Tuesday's and
Wednesday's sessions, but then retreated.
   Texas Air, traded on the American Stock Exchange, changed hands
at 13, down [. The company's Eastern Airlines subsidiary, faced with
a strike by machinists since last Saturady, filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.21 to 165.66. The Amex market value index was up .25 at 329.40.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.83 points
to 2,295.54.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 766 up, 621 down and 558 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 167.62 million shares, against 172.50

<HEAD>Emhart's Board of Directors Rejects Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emhart Corp.'s board of directors today
rejected an unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover offer from an
investment group, saying the bid was inadequate and possibly illegal.
   The board raised the question of possible insider trading,
pointing specifically to the ``unusual trading'' of Emhart stock
prior to disclosure of the takeover bid.
   Peter L. Scott, Emhart chairman and chief executive officer,
recommended in a letter that shareholders not tender any of their
shares to New York-based Topper Acquisition Corp.
   Topper, whose investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty and New
York developers Lawrence and Zachary Fisher, had made an offer of
$35 a share on Feb. 24 for Emhart, a multinational producer of
industrial and consumer products. Emhart also provides electronic
systems technology sevices for commercial markets and the government.
   ``The board was advised that the nature of the offer, the rumors
and the unusual trading activity that preceded the offer and
Topper's financing arrangements for the offer, raise serious legal
questions,'' Scott said in his letter to shareholders.
   Emhart's stock was at $32.75 a share when Topper tendered its
offer. The stock had risen almost $10 a share in the month prior to
the offer amid takeover rumors.
   Scott added in a prepared statement: ``I have grave concerns
about the abnormal trading activity that occurred in Emhart's stock
before the announcement of the Topper offer. This trading raises
disquieting questions as to whether the government's actions aimed
at curbing insider trading on non-public information have been
effective.''
   Charles Larson, a spokesman for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington, D.C., said it was the agency's policy not
to comment on what it may or may not be investigating.
   ``Enforcement investigations are private and non-public. ... We
do have a market surveillance section and it is that section's
responsibility to review imbalances in trading on various
exchanges,'' Larson said.
   Topper has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Richmond,
Va., to force the sale, contending that the company's shareholders
rights plan, commonly known as a ``poison pill'' or anti-takeover
measure, is discriminatory. Emhart filed a countersuit.
   Scott said the board is confident that Topper's lawsuit
challenging Emhart's shareholders rights plan will fail. But as a
precaution, the company said it would redeem the existing rights
effective March 20 for 2.5 cents a share and issue new rights to
shareholders on March 20.
   ``The new rights will be identical in all material respects to
the existing rights, except that the new rights will not contain the
provision about which Topper complains,'' Scott said.
   Scott said the Farmington-based company's board based its
rejection on advice from its financial advisers, Wasserstein,
Perella &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Scott said the
advisers determined the offer was ``inadequate from a financial
point of view.''
   In his letter, Scott said the board also took into consideration
the company's restructuring effort that began in 1986 and four
recent acquisitions. He noted these efforts resulted in record
earnings of $126.6 million in 1988, following earnings of $106.5
million in 1987.
   ``The board believes that the full benefits of the company's
strategies have yet to be realized and that Emhart is in a position
to continue to build on the favorable results achieved over the past
two years,'' Scott said in his letter. ``Accordingly, the board does
not believe that now is an opportune time to sell the company.''

White House Budget.</HEAD>

   Negotiations between Congress and the White
House on a fiscal 1990 budget ``should usher in a little more give
and take,'' an administration spokesman said today shortly before
the talks were to begin.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting
scheduled to begin this afternoon will build on informal sessions
between administration and congressional officials that laid the
groundwork.
   ``This formalization of the negotiating process should usher in a
little more give and take,'' said Fitzwater.
   He said Bush would also convene a larger meeting with staff and a
wider group of congressional leaders, possibly as soon as next week,
to work on budget compromises.
   ``If there's enough good will here on both sides, then we can
find an answer,'' said House budget chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
who announced the new talks along with Senate budget chairman Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn.
   White House Budget director Richard Darman, leading the Bush
administration negotiating team, has been pushing for the talks ever
since the president sent his $1.16 trillion spending plan to
Congress on Feb. 9.
   ``We're very pleased to see this development,'' said Barbara
Clay, Darman's spokeswoman.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has been cool to the idea
of early budget negotiations with the Republican White House,
downplayed expectations for the new round of discussions. Rather
than calling it a ``summit,'' he told reporters it was ``a budget
plateau.''
   Democrats wanted to ``start with a level playing field'' _ with
military programs subject to cuts, not just domestic programs as
President Bush proposed in his $1.16 trillion spending plan, he said.
   Darman has been meeting with congressional budget writers of both
parties for weeks, but lawmakers insisted that those talks be
limited to quizzing the administration on details of its plan.
   The new discussions were welcomed by the White House.
   Congessional budget writers have been meeting privately with
Darman for weeks, but Democrats insisted those discussions were
limited to finding out more detail about the budget Bush presented
last month.
   Many Democrats contend the Bush budget revealed mostly the
politically popular aspects of a spending plan that, in order to
reduce the federal deficit, will eventually require cuts in federal
programs.
   ``We propose that the budget task force discussions enter a new
phase: an exploration of areas of possible compromise between
Congress and the administration on a fiscal year 1990 budget,'' said
the letter released Wednesday by Sasser and Panetta.
   Panetta said he hoped the talks would be modeled after the 1987
agreement between the Reagan White House and Congress and produce
``a framework for a budget resolution,'' agreement on overall
spending limits for broad budget categories such as defense, foreign
aid and entitlements.
   Taxes also would be discussed, Panetta said, although Bush has
insisted he would agree to no increases.
   The talks were approved by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Wright. The Democratic leaders planned to
review the progress after two weeks to determine whether the talks
would continue, according to the letter.
   The Gramm-Rudman law calls for Congress and the president to
reduce the federal deficit to no more than $100 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush contends his plan accomplished that goal without tax
increases. Some leading Democrats contend taxes are needed along
with spending cuts, and a report by the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office, to be released Thursday, calculated the president
exceeded the deficit target.
   The CBO said that Bush's budget would leave a deficit of about
$109 billion, not including sell-offs of government assets which
don't count as deficit reduction under Gramm-Rudman. That's about
$14 billion higher than the Bush administration estimate.
   The CBO also estimates that another $25 billion would be added to
the deficit if Bush's bail-out ``off-budget'' plan for the savings
and loan industry were included in the deficit calculations.

   At a late afternoon press conference Wednesday,
Eastern Airlines said it would file for bankruptcy only as a last
resort. Just 17 hours later, the time arrived.
   Attorneys for the strike-hobbled airline filed for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws shortly
after 9 a.m. today.
   Analysts and lawyers say Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent, Texas Air Corp., will have a tougher time breaking union
contracts, imposing lower wages and keeping the airline alive than
he did when he reorganized Continental Airlines under federal
bankruptcy law.
   Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky said the company would seek to
reorganize under the bankruptcy laws. But he would not comment on
whether the plan would dissolve the carrier or attempt to keep it
flying.
   After Lorenzo put Continental into bankruptcy in September 1983
he reduced the number of employees to about 4,000 from 12,500.
   Partly because of that, Congress amended federal laws in 1984 to
require bankrupt companies to negotiate with unions and prove
economic necessity before abrogating their contracts.
   Lorenzo has been careful to operate Continental, Eastern and
Texas Air as independent concerns to eliminate the possiblity that a
bankruptcy judge might raid the parent company for money to pay
Eastern's creditors. For example, Continental paid above-market
prices recently to buy planes from Eastern, an analyst said.
   ``He has absolutely kept them separate and at arms length,'' said
one Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified. ``He's got
the best bankruptcy guys in the world going for him.''
   Analysts said a likely scenario would be the demise of the
60-year-old carrier and a fire sale of its assets to competitors.
   ``If the idea of Chapter 11 is the way Lorenzo sees to fly
through this thing, he still faces the problem of finding people to
fly the planes,'' said Henry Oechler, a New York aviation lawyer.
``But the bankruptcy laws do significantly reduce the financial
hemorrhaging he is now facing.''
   The possibility Eastern had re-emerged Wednesday when Trans World
Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn said Eastern unions asked him to resume
talks begun last year about acquiring the ailing carrier. Icahn said
he would be willing to do so if Eastern permitted the talks.
   Wall Street analysts estimate Eastern has been losing $2 million
to $7 million daily during the six-day-old walkout by Machinists,
pilots and flight attendants.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Wednesday the airline would
consider bankruptcy only as a last resort.
   Chapter 11 protection frees Eastern of its obligations to
creditors. But it also could hamstring Lorenzo in selling parts of
the airline to raise money. Every deal would require court approval
under a reorganization plan, which also would be subject to creditor
approval.
   Lorenzo could have sought creditor protection under Chapter 7,
which governs liquidation of a company. That would have meant an
auction of Eastern's assets, reportedly worth $3.8 billion last
September.
   Wall Street estimates Eastern is worth far more in a
piece-by-piece auction than the $400 million to $900 million it
could fetch as a unit. Its major assets include landing slots and
gates at major airports. Its South American operation is valued at
$150 million and its Miami maintenance facility at $300 million.
   ``They're better off opening the doors Monday morning and saying
that Friday at 2 o'clock we'll be accepting bids for any part of
Eastern Airlines,'' one analyst said.
   In a move to inject cash, USAir announced Wednesday that it had
reached agreement to buy all eight of Eastern's gates at
Philadelphia International Airport for $70 million and Eastern's
Philadelphia-Toronto and Philadelphia-Montreal routes for $15
million. The airlines said the deal had been in the works for some
time.
   Richard Lieb, a New York bankruptcy attorney, said large
companies with a debt as big as Eastern's normally file under
Chapter 11, leaving unions in a better position to receive pensions
and allowing the company to be broken up and sold if need be.
   Miami-based Eastern is rapidly spending the $402 million in cash
it had at the beginning of the year, most of which represented
prepaid tickets the airline now must refund to passengers or pay to
competitors who honor Eastern tickets.
   Eastern had a $70 million debt payment due at the end of March
and expenses for aircraft leases, airport gates, other overhead and
salaries for the 1,500 workers who remain on the job.
   It also owed payments of about $25 million a month on $2.5
billion in debt Texas Air inherited when it bought Eastern for about
$615 million in February 1986.

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co. is demanding in a lawsuit that
a California company withdraw from the market a product used to
prevent a disease in pigs.
   Upjohn said Wednesday that Syntro Corp. of San Diego infringed on
Upjohn's patent for a bioengineered virus used as a vaccine against
pseudorabies in swine.
   Upjohn obtained the patent Tuesday and filed suit the same day in
U.S. District Court in Delaware against Syntro, Upjohn spokeswoman
Maury Ewalt said.
   But Syntro has its own patent application pending and denies it
infringed on Upjohn's patent, Jack Fitzpatrick, Syntro's chief
financial officer, said today.
   Upjohn said Syntro's pseudorabies vaccine has characteristics
similar to the genetically engineered virus used to make Upjohn's
TOLVID vaccine.
   Ewalt said TOLVID was approved in 1987 by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and has been marketed since last year for protection of
pigs against pseudorabies.
   ``We are going to take all the necessary steps to vigorously
protect a very extensive research and development effort which led
to our product,'' Thomas Schalk, vice president of Upjohn's
agricultural division, said in a news release.
   ``The issues are not at all clear cut,'' Fitzpatrick said. He
said Syntro is preparing a response to Upjohn's suit. The Syntro
vaccine was introduced in April 1988 and is marketed in eight to 10
states where pseudorabies in swine is a major problem, he said.
   The viral infection causes symptoms including weight loss,
crippling and miscarriages in adult pigs and can be fatal to pigs
under 2 years old. It does not affect humans, Ewalt said.

<HEAD>Company Store Employees Accept Wage Deferral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of The Company Store have agreed
to a wage reduction plan designed to get the producer of down-filled
blankets, clothing and other items through what management calls a
temporary financial bind.
   Workers this week agreed to a deferral of 9 percent of their
wages, an arrangement that Terry Gillette, Company Store president,
described as being a loan from employees.
   Gillette said the money is needed to help the privately held
company through some difficult economic times.
   He indicated one of the company's main problems involved getting
raw materials for its down products from suppliers in Jamaica and
South Korea. A hurricane in Jamaica and the Olympics in Korea
interrupted supply lines, he said.
   The wage deferral was approved Tuesday by more than 80 percent of
employees, an action that Gillette said indicated strong faith in
the future of the business.
   A wage increase scheduled to take effect next fall also will be
deferred. The plan calls for the workers to get half of their
deferred wages back in December, and the other half is to be
returned next February.
   The business has faced, and survived, financial problems before.
   In 1973, when it was known as the La Crosse Garment Manufacturing
Co., it faced bankruptcy. Gillette, a La Crosse lawyer appointed by
a court to handle the company, bought the business.
   In 1982, it abandoned its tradition of producing sleeping bags
and down outerwear for military contracts. It converted to a
direct-mail business, and sales of its down products have increased
1,000 percent since 1982.
   The Company Store now mails about 25 million catalogs annually,
employs more than 1,000 workers in its busy season, and had 1988
income of about $100 million.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Urges Higher Standards For Nuclear Plants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins pledged at
his swearing-in ceremony today to weed out ``mediocre and
substandard'' practices in running the nation's problem-ridden
nuclear weapons complex.
   ``Nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who
control it,'' he told a ceremony attended by President Bush and
several hundred department employees.
   ``I ask you to help me'' promote a work attitude within the
department ``that rejects the mediocre and substandard,'' said
Watkins, 62, a retired admiral.
   Bush, in introductory remarks, highlighted problems at the
nuclear weapons plants, which are operated by private contracters
for the Energy Department. Safety, technical and environmental
problems at many of the 16 major plants in 12 states have virtually
crippled the nation's nuclear arms production.
   The department has estimated it will cost at least $52 billion
over the next 21 years to modernize the weapons plants, plus $65
billion or more to repair environmental damage caused by four
decades of nuclear bomb-making.
   ``The most pressing challenge is to manage the modernization of
America's nuclear weapons complex,'' Bush said, adding, ``We need to
clean up the pollution that's been created at these plants.''
   Bush told the Energy Department employees he rejected former
President Ronald Reagan's goal of trying to dismantle the
department, which was created in 1977.
   ``There's been talk in the past that this department was not
necessary ... but let me say you have important work to do. You are
on the cutting edge now, and this department is here to stay,'' Bush
said.
   The department has about 16,000 employees and a budget this year
of $14 billion.
   ``As I see it, the responsibilities before this department have
never been greater than today,'' Bush said, adding that he was
counting on Watkins, whose 41-year Navy career included work with
the service's nuclear reactor program, to restore the nation's
capability to produce nuclear arms without harming the environment.
   ``I selected a big man to do a big job so, Jim, we better swear
you in and let you get to work,'' Bush said.
   Watkins was confirmed by the Senate last week.

   The federal government must assure U.S.
electronic manufacturers they will be protected from marketing
policies in Japan before the next generation of television
technology can develop in this country, Congress was told today.
   U.S. manufacturers of TV receivers and VCRs were driven out of
business in the 1960s and 1970s primarily because of price-slashing,
collusion and so-called dumping of low-priced Japanese TV sets in
this country, said Clyde Prestowitz, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   Faced with the possibility of that kind of competition from the
Japanese again, U.S. manufacturers may be reluctant to enter the
burgeoning era of high-definition television, Prestowitz said.
   ``It was the marketing factors that were the most important ones
in the demise of the U.S. industry,'' Prestowitz told the second day
of a House subcommittee hearing on what government policy should be
regarding HDTV in the next century.
   At the same time, Prestowitz said, the U.S. government must tread
carefully in any effort to protect the U.S. electronics industry
because U.S. companies also are trying to enter foreign markets.
   ``We might consider some reciprocity requirement,'' conditioning
foreign participation in U.S. efforts to develop HDTV on the
possibility of U.S. participation overseas.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher testified Wednesday that the
private sector should determine what, if any, aid it needs before
the government becomes a partner with business to develop an HDTV
industry in the United States.
   ``In my view the private sector must take the lead,'' with the
government ``getting the hindrances out of the way,'' Mosbacher told
the subcommittee.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., asked the administration to
provide Congress with quarterly updates on progress towards an HDTV
manufacturing capacity _ a burgeoning technology that witnesses at
the House hearing said was crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the
next century.
   Markey asked witnesses before the subcommittee, which he chairs,
if a government-industry consortium would help the United States
overcome a big Japanese lead in technology that promises wall-sized
TV screens with motion-picture clarity.
   The Defense Department is offering $30 million to private
companies to develop HDTV technology. But Markey said ``What we
would clearly like to see is a civilian orientation.''
   Mosbacher said it was premature to seek such a government-private
sector link in the face of foreign competition until the private
sector decides what it needs.
   The government is considering tax incentives and possible
antitrust exemptions for U.S. companies that wish to band together
in the HDTV effort, he said.
   U.S. industry must remain ``pre-eminent'' in the drive to develop
HDTV, which he said could represent $140 billion in sales of TVs and
VCRs in the United States in next 20 years, he said.
   The impact of HDTV will go far beyond entertainment uses to areas
such as medicine, education, retailing and defense, he said.
   Establishing government policy in this area has the ``highest
priority'' at the Commerce Department, Mosbacher said, and he
expects to be able to make a recommendation to Congress on the
government role in the next two months.
   The Defense Department is offering $30 million to industry to
help develop HDTV, and many subcommittee members _ and Mosbacher _
said the money should go to U.S. companies.
   Some of America's largest electronics concerns, and some of their
biggest foreign competitors, have filed applications for the Defense
Department seed money.
   The Pentagon said Wednesday it had received 87 proposals by its
Feb. 27 deadline. At least two foreign electronic giants submitted
funding requests _ the Sony Corp. of America, a subsidiary of the
Japanese conglomerate, and North American Philips Corp., a
subsidiary of NV Philips of the Netherlands.
   Among the other large companies requesting federal research
grants were AT&amp;T Technologies Inc.; General Electric Co.; the Harris
Corp.; Honeywell Inc.; Hughes Aircraft Co.; International Business
Machines; ITT Semiconductors; the Norden Systems subsidiary of the
United Technologies Corp.; the Tandy Corp.; Texas Instruments Inc.;
Westinghouse; and the Zenith Electronics Corp.
   Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, noting Sony's proposal for Defense
Department research funds, said the government should consider
limiting the money to U.S. companies.
   ``I think this committee and the American taxpayers have to
question whether or not we want to provide U.S. taxpayers' dollars
to foreign competitors when this gentleman is not yet convinced
those foreign competitors are treating us fairly in other world
marketplaces,'' he said.
   ``It's one thing not to treat us fair,'' he said. ``It's another
thing for them to use American taxpayers' dollars to try to elbow
their way into the head of the line.''
   Another witness, State Department Ambassador Sonia Landau, said
the United States was urging adoption of one world standard for HDTV
transmission in order to protect the U.S. motion picture and TV
industries, which command 85 percent of that world market.

   The stock market held steady today as traders
kept a vigil for Friday's monthly report on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .72 to 2,294.82
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 620 up, 629 down and 549
unchanged.
   The market rose on Wednesday amid hopes that the employment
statistics for February would show a slowing of economic growth.
   Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the
inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on
interest rates.
   However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise,
analysts said, the market could suffer a letdown.
   In addition, the 2,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average
appears to have become something of a psychological barrier for
traders. The average climbed past that point in both Tuesday's and
Wednesday's sessions, but then retreated.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose \ to 45; American
Express gained [ to 30|; International Business Machines dropped |

   Texas Air, traded on the American Stock Exchange, changed hands

a strike by machinists since last Saturday, filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   At a news conference, Phil Bakes, president of Eastern, said he

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were slightly higher,
reflecting firmer cash prices, after a mixed opening today on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while grain futures were nearly unchanged in
early trading.
   The soybean market's modest rally defied expectations that
Wednesday's steep declines would be extended into today's session.
   Wednesday's losses were attributed to technical factors and to
nervousness about the looming Brazilian soybean harvest, which is
expected to be the most bountiful ever for the world's
second-largest soybean producer.
   But instead of follow-through selling, the soybean complex gained
support from higher cash markets and from ideas that Wednesday's
losses were overdone.
   Grain futures were very narrowly mixed, although some observers
expected forecasts for warm, dry weather in the nation's midsection
to give the wheat market a boost.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.31 a bushel; corn was {

   Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy filing threw
members of Congress into confusion today, just as they were set to
work on legislation that would force a reluctant President Bush to
temporarily halt the crippling strike against the carrier.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee had planned
to approve the legislation today and send it for a vote to the full
House next week, where passage with the overwhelming support of the
majority Democrats would be expected.
   But the panel postponed its meeting _ at least until midafternoon
_ when lawmakers received word that the ailing airline had filed for
protection from creditors in U.S. bankruptcy court in New York.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the Public Works and
Transportation aviation subcommittee, and other members of the panel
said there were concerns that legislation dealing with one specific
company involved in bankruptcy proceedings might be unconstitutional.
   They said they believed that under the law, bankruptcy
legislation must be applied uniformly, not just to one company. They
also said they believed the problem could be resolved.
   ``I think we can sort this out,'' Oberstar told reporters.
   But Oberstar and Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of the
full committee, offered no specifics when asked how the bankruptcy
proceedings might cause the legislation to be changed.
   ``There may be some amendments,'' Anderson said.
   The legislation, approved Tuesday along party lines by the
aviation subcommittee, would require Bush to appoint an emergency
board to review the differences between Eastern and the
International Association of Machinists, which represents 8,500
machinists, baggage handlers and other ground workers.
   The strikers would return to work for up to 60 days while the
board studied the dispute _ which is largely over wages and benefits
_ and recommended a solution.
   The carriers' pilots and flight attendants have honored the
machinists' picket lines, forcing Eastern to terminate most of its
1,040 daily flights.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Wednesday he would oppose the
legislation when it reaches the Senate, where determined procedural
maneuvering by one lawmaker can sometimes spell the end of a bill.
   ``I certainly am going to oppose any effort by Congress to force
the president to take any action that limits his prerogative,''
Gramm told a reporter.
   But even if the legislation makes it through Congress,
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has said he will urge
Bush to veto the bill. The administration has argued that appointing
a review board will do little to solve a fight that has been waged
for 17 months, or to move the ailing airline away from the
possibility of bankruptcy.
   Democrats concede they would not have the two-thirds majority in
both chambers needed to override the veto. They have pressed the
legislation anyway, arguing that to do so prods Eastern and its
unions to settle their disputes, pressures Bush to change his
position, and at the very least would embarrass him by placing him
in the spotlight.
   ``If we took every bill up on the premise that the president
wouldn't veto it, there would be few bills that we'd take to the
House floor,'' Oberstar said Wednesday.
   The administration has said it might submit legislation that
would ban secondary boycotts against other airlines and railroad
systems, as are allowed under current law. The Democratic-controlled
Congress would be expected to reject such a proposal.

   Eastern Airlines filed for protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court today, the sixth day of a bitter strike by
Machinists that virtually shut down the nation's seventh-largest
carrier and cost it up to $7 million a day.
   The filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York
is designed to give tottering Eastern a reprieve from bills and
debts while it tries to restructure and extricate itself from the
worst crisis in the history of the 60-year-old airline.
   At a news conference today, Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo said the
animosity many union leaders have expressed toward him have ``hurt
my family and me.''
   ``But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in
airline deregulation and, indeed, in our business climate today,''
he said.
   ``The issue is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick business
in a competitive marketplace should be allowed  which
expired in June. There was no immediate word what effect the court
filing would have on talks.
   Also today, the U.S. House Public Works Committee was expected to
approve a measure that would force a reluctant President Bush to
temporarily halt the strike. The bill has gloomy prospects in the
Senate and at the White House, and the committee's meeting was
postponed at least until afternoon after the court filing.
   In a desperate effort to help stem its losses, Eastern reduced
one-way fares on its Northeast shuttle to $12 on weekends, from
$69-$99, and to $49 on weekdays, down from $99.
   George Brennan, marketing vice president, denied the slashed
fares were a move to protect the pending $365 million sale of the
shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   ``We are confident the sale will go through,'' despite the
bankruptcy filing, Bakes said today.
   Pan Am Corp., a competitor, said it would not match the fares.
   USAir, meanwhile, announced that months of talks had produced a
$70 million deal with Eastern to acquire the airline's eight gates
at Philadelphia International Airport, third-largest of Miami-based
Eastern's four hubs.
   Eastern stood to gain $15 million more in a separate deal,
selling USAir its Philadelphia-Toronto and Philadelphia-Montreal
routes for $15 million.
   Both deals would require government approval that could take
months.
   Eastern's sister airline, Houston-based Continental, announced it
was assuming Eastern's lucrative New York-Miami route beginning
today with four daily daily round-trip flights.
   Among other developments:
   _ Pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safety
rules, but for a second day there was little evidence of flight
delays.
   _ In New York, a U.S. District judge scheduled a hearing today on
whether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathy strikes. On
Wednesday, a federal appeals court refused to lift the judge's order
preventing the Eastern strike from paralyzing New York's commuter
rail lines.
   _ Eastern lawyers have filed notice with a federal appeals court
in Atlanta on plans to continue efforts to force non-striking pilots
to cross picket lines. Bakes said the appeal would not be filed
today.
   _ In Philadelphia, a federal judge issued a preliminary
injunction extending a temporary restraining order that prohibited
local rail unions from honoring pickets set up by Machinists.

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network founder Ted Turner said Thursday
CNN's coverage, beamed worldwide, is U.S.-oriented because its
profits come from the United States, but added that television's
globalization has been a ``positive force.''
   Turner said his U.S.-based network plans to begin hiring local
nationals as reporters in overseas bureaus, but it would take time
because ``the vast bulk of our audience and profits come from the
United States, and we're convinced that Americans are used to seeing
Americans report the news.''
   CNN, the world's only 24-hour television news network, was
founded in 1980 and claims 150 million viewers in more than 75
countries.
   Turner said CNN has almost completed negotiations for the leasing
of satellite transponders that would make it the first television
network available to every country in the world 24 hours a day.
Actual local broadcasting would depend on contracts with local
television stations or cable systems.
   Responding to questions from journalists in Tokyo, Beijing, Hong
Kong and Jakarta during a satellite-transmitted WorldNet Dialogue
sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency, Turner acknowledged that
CNN was U.S.-oriented in its news coverage, but said ``that can't be
helped.''
   ``Even though we may be very U.S.-biased, when there is a major
story anywhere ... we do usually carry it,'' he said.
   A larger market in Europe allows CNN to tailor its programming
for the European audience, but for economic reasons it must supply
its regular domestic U.S. programming to Asia, Turner said.
   Asian viewers have complained about too many U.S.-oriented
features on the network such as local U.S. weather reports.
   In Japan, where CNN is broadcast late at night by TV Asahi, local
newscasters spend time after most reports, which are translated into
Japanese, commenting on the contents and explaining the differences
between U.S. and Japanese perspectives on the news.
   Kenji Koyama, co-director of CNN programs for TV Asahi, said the
Japanese station uses CNN to provide an alternative perspective on
world developments as well as for coverage of U.S. news.
   Turner said fears of a rapid globalization of television
broadcasting controlled by privately owned media based in a few
dominant nations were exaggerated.
   ``It will take a long time,'' he said. ``Very few companies are
interested in advertising all around the world. ... Satellites and
satellite television have brought the world closer together. I think
it's a positive force on balance.''

<TEXT>
   A House panel today approved legislation to
gradually add $1.30 an hour to the $3.35 minimum wage and Democratic
leaders said they are willing to compromise with the Bush
administration over a reduced ``training wage'' for some workers.
   The measure approved by the labor standards subcommittee was
virtually identical to legislation the Senate Labor and Human
Resources passed Wednesday and advanced Democratic plans to take the
first hike in the minimum since 1981 to the floors of both houses
within two weeks.
   Both bills would raise the minimum in increments over three
years, to $4.65 an hour by 1991.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the full House
Education and Labor Committee, scheduled a vote on the subcommittee
legislation for next Tuesday.
   Subcommittee Chairman Austin Murphy, D-Pa., said Democrats are
drafting their own version of a ``training wage'' and specific
requirements for education and be limited in duration.
   President Bush favors a more modest increase in the minimum wage
and wants to leave the minimum at $3.35 an hour for the first six
months' employment for all newly hired workers.
   The Democratic version of the training wage ``will be more
restrictive than the proposals we have heard from the president,''
Murphy said. ``However, our effort will show we are sincere and
prepared to address the components of this issue.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate labor
committee, said Wednesday that the bill is also on the ``fast
track'' in that chamber and there may be floor vote there next week.
   Hawkins backs raising the minimum to $4.65 by 1991 and last week
called the administration's more modest raise ``totally
unacceptable.''
   The minimum wage has stood at $3.35 an hour since 1981.
   The plan the Senate committee passed Wednesday would raise it 50
cents an hour when enacted and 40 cents an hour in each of the next
two years.
   President Bush said last week he wanted the minimum wage raised
to $4.25 by 1991, if a lower floor is established for the first six
months' employment at any job for workers covered by the minimum.
   Senate Democrats, after softening their opposition to a second
pay tier for new workers, called on Bush to compromise in the effort
to raise the minimum for the first time in eight years.
   ``I am hopeful that we can reach a compromise that is fairer to
the working poor and that President Bush will sign,'' Kennedy said,
later adding: ``My own hope is that the administration may still be
brought on board. But if it's the judgment that (Bush will) veto it,
we'll override it.''
   Bush has said he would veto legislation raising the minimum above
$4.25 an hour and told GOP leaders Wednesday that, as spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater put it, his proposal ``is fair and firm and his
last offer.''
   Kennedy predicted a full Senate vote on his bill next week and
said Congress may send an increase to Bush by the end of the month.
   ``One way or another, I'm convinced this is on a fast track
now,'' he said.
   The training wage, long opposed by Democrats and organized labor,
remains a key dispute.
   The administration would allow a $3.35-an-hour wage for all newly
hired workers for the first six months of their employment, saying
the lower minimum would leave employers an incentive to hire younger
and unskilled workers.
   Kennedy said Wednesday he is ``glad to listen'' to calls for a
reduced minimum for some workers, but said it would have to be
coupled with specific requirements for training and education.
   ``I'm open to listening, to having the educational components
outlined,'' he said. ``There was nothing in the administration
proposal that had an educational component.''
   He added that such a plan would also have to be limited to
first-time workers and be for a shorter duration than six months.

   While public concern focuses on how imports
affect U.S. jobs, nearly 4.6 million American workers owe their
livelihoods to exports, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   For example, one of every eight people working in manufacturing
is in an export-related job, the Bureau found.
   The analysis of employment in 1986 showed an increase of 163,400
export-related jobs from the year before.
   Manufacturing accounted for the bulk of the export-related jobs,
2,318,200 in 1986, the most recent year for which figures are
available, the report said.
   In addition, exports accounted for 994,500 jobs in trade, 298,400
in transportation, 247,900 in business services and 717,600 jobs in
such areas as mining and agriculture, the Census Bureau reported.
   On a national basis, exports accounted for 12.6 percent of all
manufacturing jobs, the report said.
   Alaska leads the pack with fully 40 percent of its manufacturing
jobs being export related. Alaska has a relatively small total of
manufacturing workers, so that 40 percent amounts to only 3,600 jobs.
   California has the most export-related manufacturing jobs at
289,600. That's 14.7 percent of the Golden State's workers in
manufacturing industries.
   Nationally, electronic equipment accounted for the largest number
of export-related jobs at 459,600, according to the new analysis.
   The next largest category was machinery other than electrical
equipment, providing 378,300 jobs for Americans.
   Making transportation equipment for export provided 224,000 jobs.
Next was fabricated metal products at 188,400 jobs, followed by
182,000 administrative and auxiliary jobs, primary metal industries
offering 159,500 positions, and 130,400 workers making chemicals and
related products.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of
manufacturing jobs related to export in 1986 as reported in the new
study, ``Exports from Manufacturing Establishments:''

<HEAD>London Shares Close Broadly Lower After Dull Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed broadly lower in dull trading
Thursday as players stepped back from the market, mostly to wait for
next Tuesday's budget speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson.
   ``People want to see the budget out of the way,'' one dealer said.
   In the meantime, ``There's no tendency for people to want to sell
and at the same time there's no reason to want to take the market
higher either,'' he added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 7.4
points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,075.9.
   Volume was 483.9 million shares, down from Wednesday's 548.1

<HEAD>K mart, Dayton Hudson Report Strong Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two large U.S. retailers Thursday reported sharply higher income
for the fourth quarter and 1988, due partly to vigilance in
controling inventories and a pickup in sales toward the end of the
year.
   K mart Corp., the Troy, Mich.-based discounter that does the most
retail business after Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its after-tax
income rose 22.4 percent in its fourth quarter and 16 percent for
the full year which ended Jan. 25, 1989.
   Separately, Dayton Hudson Corp. posted gains of 36.6 percent in
its fourth quarter net income and 26 percent for the entire year.
The company, based in Minneapolis and the operator of 618 stores in
37 states, said growth in its net earnings per share last year well
exceeded its target.
   Joseph E. Antonini, K mart chairman and chief executive, said
expense controls and inventory management were enhanced during the
year by linking more stores to point-of-sale systems, allowing K
mart to keep better track of companywide stock levels. At the end of
the year, 1,180 stores were hooked up to the computerized system, up
from 759 stores a year earlier.
   The company's net income came to $393.2 million, or $1.96 a
share, for the three months ended Jan. 25, up from $321.2 million,
or $1.58 a share, in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
   Sales for the quarter were up 8.5 percent to $8.42 billion, from
$7.75 billion in the year-earlier period.
   For the full year, K mart earned $802.9 million, or $4 a share,
after taxes, on sales of $27.30 billion, compared with $692.2
million, or $3.40 a share, on sales of $25.63 billion for fiscal
1987.
   The department store owner Dayton Hudson reported its net income
totaled $183 million, or $2.31 a share, in the fourth quarter ended
Jan. 28, on sales of $4.1 billion. That compared with earnings of
$134 million, or $1.54 a share, and sales of $3.68 billion a year
earlier.
   For Dayton Hudson's full financial year, after-tax income totaled
$287 million, or $3.45 a share, and sales were $12.20 billion vs.
the previous year's earnings of $228 million, or $2.41 a share, and
sales of $10.68 billion.
   ``We were committed to exceed our earnings-per-share growth
objecive of 15 percent in 1988 and we did,'' said Kenneth A. Macke,
Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief executive officer.

<HEAD>IBM Selling Tucson Building With Magnetic Tape Operation to 3M</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. will
sell 3M its magnetic tape manufacturing building and equipment at
IBM's Tucson complex, the companies said Thursday.
   3M will supply tape cartridges for IBM's 3480 magnetic tape
subsystem, to be sold both under IBM and 3M brand names. The product
is used for long-term storage of data on reels of tape.
   IBM invented and developed the 3480 tape cartridge, and the drive
system that the cartridge supports was developed in Tucson, where
the sole manufacturing plant is.
   Under the agreement, 3M, which manufactures a compatible tape in
Minnesota, will supply IBM with 3480 tape cartridges to IBM
specifications, and 3M and IBM both will market the tape cartridges
under their own brand names.
   3M _ formally known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. _
produces Scotch brand tape and numerous other products.
   Philip B. Hage, a spokesman at 3M headquarters in St. Paul,
Minn., said the company will employ about 120 people at
116,000-square-foot Building No. 10 on the IBM campus. IBM will not
reveal its employment at the building, Hage said.
   IBM is phasing out its manufacturing operation and developing the
site into a business park.
   Hage said 3M would not take actual possession of the plant or
start manufacturing for at least 30 days, because of the need for
government approval of the sale and the need for IBM to notify its
employees of the sale. The sale price was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Say SEC Will Vote on Settlement with Drexel Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission will vote
next week on a proposed settlement of civil fraud charges against
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported
Thursday.
   The civil settlement is a crucial condition for finalizing a much
broader settlement of criminal charges against the investment
banking firm, stemming largely from its past relationship with
now-imprisoned former financier Ivan F. Boesky.
   Quoting sources it didn't identify, the Journal said SEC
commissioners are expected to vote next Monday on the civil
settlement package, under negotiation for more than two months.
   The report quoted the sources as saying the package, if approved,
would allow Drexel to retain its high-yield, high-risk ``junk bond''
operation in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Previously, the SEC had proposed in settlement negotiations that
Drexel relocate the junk bond division to its New York headquarters
in order to more strictly supervise trading operations. Drexel had
contended such a move would destroy its lucrative business in the
high-yield securities.
   Other elements of the civil settlement will force Drexel to make
dozens of changes in management structure and proedures to enforce
compliance with federal and state securities laws, the Journal
report said.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the report
or speculate on when a settlement would be announced. SEC officials
in Washington also declined to comment in accordance with the
agency's policy concerning pending cases.
   The investment firm has been under investigation since late 1986,
when Boesky implicated Drexel, senior junk bond financier Michael
Milken and others in what federal officials have called wide-ranging
abuse of securities laws.
   The SEC formally accused Drexel and Milken in September of
engaging in a litany of fraud violations that ranged from insider
trading to stock manipulation to client cheating.
   The civil charges were overshadowed in December when the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which had been conducting its own
probe of Drexel, announced a criminal plea bargain agreement under
which the firm would plead guilty to six felonies and pay a $650
million fine. Federal prosecutors said that agreement could not be
finalized until Drexel settled the SEC litigation.
   Milken has continued to assert innocence of any wrongdoing and is
expected to be indicted soon on federal fraud and racketeering
charges.
   He also is challenging a provision of the criminal settlement
that would force Drexel to terminate his employment and deny his
1988 compensation, estimated at more than $100 million.

<TEXT>
   Diamond-Star Motors Corp., a joint venture
between Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., will begin a
second shift at its plant in May, six months ahead of schedule, the
company said Thursday.
   Diamond-Star said the second shift will boost plant employment to
about 2,900 by July from about 1,900 now. The plant makes Plymouth
Laser and Mitsubishi Eclipse two-door sports cars.
   This spring, the plant will add production of a two-door,
four-wheel-drive car to be marketed by Chrysler as the Eagle Talon
and by Mitsubishi as another version of the Eclipse. Fall plans call
for the factory to begin making the Mitsubishi Mirage and Eagle
Summit, both two-wheel-drive, four-door cars.
   The plant is making about 175 cars a day and will increase that
rate to about 1,000 at full production with the addition of the
second shift, Diamond-Star spokeswoman Christine Ziehmann said.

<HEAD>Talk Of Weather, Exports, Brazilian Strike Propel Grain Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices advanced strongly
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, erasing most of the previous
session's losses amid a variety of bullish factors.
   Forecasts for continued dryness in prime winter-wheat areas
supported the wheat market, as did talk that the Soviet Union was
seeking to buy more U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybean futures, which had fallen steeply Wednesday on jitters
linked to the impending Brazilian soybean harvest, surged back
Thursday on rumors that Brazilian dockworkers were planning to
strike next Wednesday, halting exports of newly harvested soybeans.
   ``Some of the people who sold the soybean market yesterday came
back and bought it today,'' said Steve Freed, grain-market analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures were boosted by higher cash prices and by concerns
about lack of adequate soil moisture in the Midwest.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents to 5} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.35} a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 3 cents higher with March at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents
to 3\ cents higher with March at $2.07 a bushel; soybeans were 6}
cents to 10} cents higher with March at $7.63 a bushel.

situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.86 to 2,292.68

   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 730 down and 542
unchanged.
   The market rose on Wednesday amid hopes that the employment
statistics for February would show a slowing of economic growth.
   Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the
inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on
interest rates.
   However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise,
analysts said, the market could suffer a letdown.
   In addition, the 2,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average
appears to have become something of a psychological barrier for
traders. The average climbed past that point in both Tuesday's and
Wednesday's sessions, but then retreated.

   Assets of the nation's 458 money market mutual
funds rose to $1.2 billion in the latest week to a record $295.24
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the ninth straight weekly all-time high for money-market
mutual fund assets reported by the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The institute said that in the week ended Wednesday, assets of
226 general purpose funds fell $19.9 million to $95.14 billion,
assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $1.26 billion to $127.41
billion, and assets of 138 institutional funds declined $39.6

   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.75 percent from 8.65 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.58 percent from 8.49 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 31 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield

Wednesday from 6.42 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.86
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.76 the
previous week. Yields were 9.03 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.93

<HEAD>Government Decides To Sell Telephone Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, The government ..., to CORRECT share price to
31 cents sted $313.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government has decided to sell its
controlling interest in the nation's problem-ridden telephone
company despite strong union opposition, government and union
sources said Thursday.
   Such a sale would be the most dramatic example to date of
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's efforts to privatize
government-owned companies and modernize the Mexican economy.
   ``The problem is to do it without making it sound like another
confrontation with a labor union,'' a government source told The
Associated Press. The timing of an announcement is uncertain.
   ``The government, specifically Salinas, has told us there is no
alternative,'' said a telephone workers union official. The union
strongly opposes the move, he said.
   Both officials said they could not allow their names to be used
because the two sides are now engaged in talks.
   ``There is a campaign against the union, against corruption,
against the union members. The end of this campaign is the
privatization of the company,'' the union official said. He said
government proposals would require changes in 51 union contracts,
one for each department of the company.
   Salinas, who jailed corrupt leaders of the oil workers' union in
January, does not want to get an image as a union buster, the
government source said.
   ``But if we are going to modernize the phone company, we need new
technology and more investments and some changes in union-management
relations,'' the source added.
   Telefonos de Mexico, as the company is called, has nearly 50,000
employees. Although the union is controlled by the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the government has had to
intervene at least twice in recent years to prevent strikes.
   The government owns 51 percent of the company, and another 10
percent is held in the so-called Mexico Fund, which is traded on the
New York Stock Exchange. Stockbroker Guillermina Ortiz said the
stock is fluctuating on the Mexico exchange because of sale rumors,
but that it would definitely go much higher if the company is sold.
It closed at 31 cents a share on Wednesday.
   Union head Francisco Hernandez Juarez has accused the government
of trying to sell out the telephone company and fears privatization
would lead to a reduction in union membership because of dismissals.
   This week Hernandez complained that telephone company proposals
were evidence of ``evil intentions toward the union.''
   Government officials admit the company has a bad image that
reflects on the government.
   It is known for poor service and high rates, and even before
Salinas was elected stories circulated of his disgust with the
system's inefficiencies and his admiration for the way Chile
improved its system _ privatization.
   In a government-sponsored 1987 poll, 13 percent of respondents
said Telmex was the worst-administered company in the public sector;
56 percent said they had found mysterious long-distance calls on
their bills without explanation.
   Getting a line repaired can take months, although one shortcut is
to locate and independently hire a telephone company crew that might
happen to be in the neighborhood. Employees often complain of low
salaries _ they earn an average of about $14 a day _ in spite of the
high rates charged by the company.
   Installing a telephone on unwired premises costs nearly $800 in
Mexico City, as against an average of $120 in New York; a heavily
taxed three-minute phone call to New York costs $7.50, while the
return phone call would cost $5.10.
   ``The union started when more people were needed than are needed
now,'' the government source said. The government says the company
is overstaffed and accuses the union of sabotage when it doesn't get
what it wants, but the union official denied that.
   ``The problem is outdated equipment and lack of financing.
Telefonos needs $14 billion to modernize and become competitive. We
think the government should get the money,'' the official said.
   The government source said Salinas hopes to turn the telephone
company around the way it did the state-run and money-losing airline
Aeromexico. When the union went on strike last year, the airline was
declared bankrupt and was eventually sold, with employee unions
buying a minority share.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The energy futures market headed lower Thursday,
with wholesale home heating oil losing about a penny a gallon in
volatile trading.
   Crude oil and gasoline contracts posted more moderate declines.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., attributed the heating-oil decline largely to
technical factors following a recent price runup.
   He said prices started out stronger, but met resistance at
certain levels and then steadily declined. That helped bring down
prices of other petroleum products, he said.
   ``I think that the underlying fundamentals seem to be bullish,
though, especially with the cold weather,'' Lebow said.
   The April contract for heating oil fell 0.99 cent to settle at
50.38 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after
rising as high as 51.75 cents earlier in the session. The contract
had gained 0.29 cent Wednesday.
   April unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.44 cent Wednesday, settled
down 0.25 cent to 51.60 cents.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $18.52 a barrel, down 2 cents.
The contract had risen 24 cents in the previous session.

<HEAD>Analysts: Eastern's Rivals Can Easily Absorb Spillover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Competitors of paralyzed Eastern Airlines could
easily absorb the surplus passenger traffic that would be created if
the carrier disappeared permanently from the nation's skies,
analysts believe.
   ``This is an industry that tends to be plagued by overcapacity,''
said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Eastern on Thursday filed for protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court, seeking a reprieve from bills and debts while it
tries to restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in
its 60-year history. The Chapter 11 filing would not necessarily
mean Eastern would stop flying.
   Eastern's rivals, most notably Delta Air Lines, Pan Am, United
Airlines, American Airlines and USAir, have been operating with 62
percent to 63 percent of their seats full, analysts estimate.
   That means that except for peak holiday travel times such as
Easter weekend, the other carriers should have plenty of room for
passengers who would have taken flights on Miami-based Eastern.
   Archrival Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, is widely
considered the hottest contender for the Eastern spoils. Like
Eastern, Delta has a major hub at Atlanta, its headquarters city.
   In the past five years, rivals have added about 1,600 new
competitive flights a day in Eastern's market area east of the
Mississippi River, Eastern President Phil Bakes told a news
conference Thursday announcing the bankruptcy filing.
   Eastern carried about 100,000 passengers a day on 1,040 flights
before it was hit Saturday by a bruising Machinists union strike
that was supported by pilots and flight attendants, leading to a
virtual shutdown late Monday. Eastern, the seventh-largest airline,
had 7 percent to 8 percent of the national market before the walkout.
   On Wednesday, USAir announced it had reached an agreement with
Eastern to buy all eight of the crippled carrier's airport gates at
Philadelphia as well as the two routes from Philadelphia to Toronto
and Montreal.
   The agreements, which will cost USAir about $85 million, have
been discussed for months as a way for Eastern to scrape up vitally
needed cash.
   More Eastern gates, routes and possibly planes could be sold in
coming months.
   Airlines should be able to handle most of the Eastern spillover
with their current schedules and by adding a few flights, said
Robert Joedicke, who follows the industry for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   ``That's why (the Eastern situation) is not, in most people's
eyes, a national emergency,'' he said.
   Continental Airlines, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air
Corp., announced Wednesday it will begin operating daily non-stop
flights from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Miami. Continental will
fly four daily round trips on the coveted route, Eastern's main
artery.
   If Eastern disappeared, competitors' air fares wouldn't
necessarily go up, analysts believe.
   Eastern, a dominant force in the lucrative Florida market, was
operating on some of the most competitive routes in the nation.
   ``They're still very competitive markets,'' Starkman said,
suggesting that an Eastern collapse could even spark some battles to
fill the void _ which could mean lower fares in those areas.
   In another competitive and profitable market, the Northeast
shuttle service, Pan Am quickly jumped into the Eastern breach
Monday by doubling its hourly shuttle flights to every half-hour at
peak times.
   Eastern continued to run its rival Boston-New York-Washington
shuttle flights even after it shut down nearly all of its operations
late Monday. But Eastern's flights have been running with few
passengers, and the air line on Wednesday was forced to slash its
one-way fares to $12 on weekends and $49 on weekdays to attract
business.
   Shuttle fares for Eastern and Pan Am, which didn't match the
Eastern price cuts, normally are $69 to $99 on weekends depending on
the time of day, and $99 on weekdays.

<HEAD>Emhart's Board of Directors Rejects Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK SEAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emhart Corp.'s board of directors rejected
an investment group's unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover offer
Thursday and the company said it had received rival buyout bids from
other parties.
   Peter L. Scott, Emhart's chairman and chief executive officer,
recommended shareholders not tender any of their stock to Topper
Acquisition Corp. and raised questions about unusual movements in
Emhart's stock price before the group's bid.
   ``This trading raises disquieting questions as to whether the
government's actions aimed at curbing insider trading on non-public
information have been effective,'' Scott said in a letter to
shareholders.
   Topper, whose investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty and New
York developers Lawrence and Zachary Fisher, offered $35 a share for
Emhart on Feb. 24.
   A spokesman for Topper, who asked that his name not be used, said
the investment group would have no immediate comment on Emhart's
action or the allegations of insider trading.
   Emhart stock rose 37{ cents to $42.37{ a share Thursday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The shares traded at $32.75 a share when Topper tendered its
offer. The stock had risen almost $10 a share in the month prior to
the offer amid takeover rumors.
   It was not known whether the federal government was looking into
the movement in Emhart's shares. Chiles Larson, a Securities and
Exchange Commission spokesman, said it was the agency's policy not
to comment on possible investigations.
   Meanwhile, Emhart, a Farmington-based manufacturer of a variety
of consumer and industrial products, said it had discussed with ``a
limited number of third parties'' a possible buyout of the firm. The
company did not identify the other parties.
   Spokesman Michael Claes said the board gave preliminary
consideration to the offers at meetings on Feb. 28 and Wednesday.
   Emhart said it was also exploring other alternatives to the
Topper bid, including a financial restructuring or recapitalization.
   In his letter to shareholders, Scott said Emhart's financial
advisers, Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., advised the company's board the Topper bid was ``inadequate
from a financial point of view.''
   Scott said the board also took into consideration the company's
restructuring effort, which began in 1986, and four recent
acquisitions.
   ``The board believes that the full benefits of the company's
strategies have yet to be realized and that Emhart is in a position
to continue to build on the favorable results achieved over the past
two years,'' Scott said.
   ``Accordingly, the board does not believe that now is an
opportune time to sell the company,'' he said.
   Emhart's products include lawn and garden equipment, hardware and
materials used to make footwear.
   Topper has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Richmond,
Va., to block the use of Emhart's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense. Emhart has countersued and Scott said the company would
amend the plan to eliminate a provision challenged by Topper.

   The stock market drifted to a small loss Thursday
while Wall Street kept a vigil for Friday's monthly report on the
employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.11 points to
2,291.43.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 675 up, 764
down and 541 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.16 million
shares, down from 167.62 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 170.25 million shares.
   The market rose on Wednesday amid hopes that the employment
statistics for February would show a slowing of economic growth.
   Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the
inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on
interest rates.
   However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise,
analysts said, the market could suffer a letdown.
   In addition, the 2,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average
appears to have become something of a psychological barrier for
traders. The average climbed past that point in both Tuesday's and
Wednesday's sessions, but then retreated.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 113[;
General Electric gained [ to 45{; International Business Machines
dropped 1 to 118], and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged
at 30{.
   Texas Air, traded on the American Stock Exchange, changed hands
at 13{, up ]. The company's Eastern Airlines subsidiary, faced with
a strike by machinists since last Saturday, filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   At a news conference, Phil Bakes, president of Eastern, said he
believed the bankruptcy proceedings would help the airline rebuild.
   Among other airline issues, UAL rose 1[ to 119{; AMR gained 1} to
59\; Delta Air Lines added ~ to 56~, and Pan Am dropped [ to 4].
   Upjohn was the volume leader, down 2\ at 29]. Responding to an
analyst's report, the company said it was too soon to gauge the
effect of new prescription procedures in New York State on sales of
two Upjohn tranquilizers.
   Novell, the most active issue in the over-the-counter market,
fell 2] to 31]. Late Wednesday the company reported earnings for its
latest fiscal quarter that fell short of Street expectations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $1.12 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.09 to 165.36.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .38 to 339.43, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .15 at 293.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .73 to 405.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 329.36, up .21.

<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
eclipsed Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole as the Bush administration's
lead spokesman in the Eastern Airlines strike because of tradition
and his prior experience in the industry, government officials say.
   Skinner was chosen for the role during a meeting that he and Mrs.
Dole had with President Bush in the Oval Office last Friday,
according to administration officials.
   These officials, discussing a somewhat sensitive issue on grounds
they not be identified publicly, said Bush wanted Skinner to take
the lead in defending administration policy to lawmakers on Capitol
Hill and in numerous interviews and news conferences.
   National strikes can present presidents with public relations
problems, for their decisions seldom are likely to please both labor
and business. And the general public often has strong views as well,
especially when inconvenienced as in the current strike that all but
shut down Eastern.
   The airline filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy
court on Thursday.
   In the strike by Eastern's Machinists union, Bush selected as his
chief spokesman a man who had built a reputation for dealing with
tough labor-management problems during his time as chairman of the
Regional Transportation Authority in Northeastern Illinois, the
nation's second largest transit authority.
   But Skinner is a Washington newcomer, notwithstanding his brash
statement on arrival here that ``I'm not going to take a back seat.''
   Mrs. Dole, in contrast, formerly was secretary of transportation
during the Reagan administration. And as head of the Labor
Department now, she would have seemed to have been in a unique
position to be the out-front Cabinet member in dealing with the
Eastern strike.
   ``He's been in the lead, but she's been along every step of the
way,'' said one administration official. He said that Skinner was a
natural choice for the front-line role because the strike involves
the airline industry, which is regulated in part by the Federal
Aviation Administration, which is a part of the Transportation
Department.
   ``It was a conscious decision'' that Mrs. Dole take a secondary
role, said her spokeswoman, Dale Tate. ``It was an issue that was
viewed much more as a transportation issue than a labor issue. As a
former secretary of transportation, Mrs. Dole understood that.''
   Said Skinner spokesman Bob Marks: ``The major concern was air
safety, and the economic impact of the potential secondary boycotts
by the unions _ an area that the Department of Transportation has
responsibility for.''
   Another theory is that Mrs. Dole was kept in the background to
insulate her from direct confrontation with the leaders of organized
labor _ people with whom she has pledged to seek harmonious
relations.''
   However, an AFL-CIO official, declining to be identified
publicly, dismissed any notion that the Bush administration has been
trying very hard to protect Mrs. Dole's credibility with organized
labor.
   He said that while she had promised to seek improved relations
with unions, top labor leaders were not consulted before the
administration's decision to seek to raise the minimum wage from
$3.35 to $4.25 an hour, and retain a $3.35-an-hour wage rate for
inexperienced youths.
   The choice of Skinner as the chief administration spokesman on
the Eastern strike is in keeping with the pattern that was set
during the strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
Organization against the FAA in 1981.
   But the two situations are not entirely alike. In the former
case, the government itself was being struck. And then-President
Reagan, the controllers' ultimate boss, fired all of them. At the
same time, he put Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis out front as
his main spokesman. Then-Labor Secretary Ray Donovan was nearly
invisible.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., a senior member of
the House Public Works Committee, said he found it ``very, very
surprising'' that Mrs. Dole had not entered the Eastern dispute.
   ``It's surprising that given this is the first major labor issue
to come before the new administration, and her former involvement as
secretary of transportation, she hasn't been visible in any way,''
he said in an interview.
   But Mineta also said he believed it was typical of her actions as
transportation secretary, which he described as ``pretty much a
non-involvement process for her.''

<HEAD>Gold Fields Bid Defense Seen Forcing Higher Minorco Bid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Huw in 7th graf is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Securities analysts expected Minorco SA to sweeten
its hostile $5.5 billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC
Thursday after Gold Fields sent shareholders a document detailing
the company's strengths and future plans.
   However, the analysts saw little in the document, which contained
numerous valuations and forecasts for Gold Fields' various
businesses, that would cause them to change their own estimates of
what the British mining company was worth.
   South African-controlled Minorco, which already owns 29.6 percent
of Gold Fields' shares, has offered 20.50 pounds, or $35.26, in cash
and one new Minorco share for every two Gold Fields shares.
   Minorco shares traded Thursday afternoon at 804 pench each, down
9 pence on the day, meaning the offer values each Gold Fields share
at 14.27 pounds. However, Gold Fields stock closed above that level,
rising 7 pence to 14.30 pounds.
   The deal is worth a total of 3.2 billion pounds, or $5.5 billion.
   Analysts in London said Minorco, a Luxembourg-based company,
would have to sweeten its offer to between 15 pounds and 16 pounds a
share.
   ``The real story today is that this document from Gold Fields
will force Minorco to come back with a higher offer price,'' said
Huw Williams, a mining analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities.
   In the document sent to shareholders, Gold Fields assigned a
value of between 8.44 pounds and 10.39 pounds per Gold Fields' share
to its U.S. gold interests. These include full ownership of Gold
Fields Mining Corp. and 49 percent of Newmont Mining Corp.
   At a later press conference, the company said its other mineral
investments worldwide are worth 5.23 pounds per Gold Fields' share.
Gold Fields owns 48 percent of Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd.
of Australia, 38 percent of Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. and
other assets.
   The Gold Fields' document also detailed the results of its past
mineral exploration, and predicted, ``Considerable value will be
added in the future if recent successes are repeated.''
   The document also questioned the management ability of Minorco
executives and the value of the company's stock. Gold Fields also
noted that if it were owned by the South African company, it might
lose business in the United States because of American opposition to
South Africa's policy of apartheid.
   It was not known what further steps Gold Fields planned to take
to counter the Minorco bid.
   Joseph Perella, chairman of Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Inc. and a
Gold Fields adviser, said in New York that at this point, the
company had little to do besides point out the discrepancies between
the value of the Minorco bid and the underlying value of its own
assets.
   Following the release of Gold Fields' figures, London analysts
said they saw little reason to alter significantly their earlier
estimates that valued the company's total assets at somewhere
between 15 pounds and just over 20 pounds a share.

   The dollar drifted lower against other major
currencies in dull U.S. trading Thursday as dealers marked time a
day before release of February's unemployment report.
   Gold prices rose in domestic dealing after declining overseas. At
4 p.m. EST, Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of
$393.80 for a troy ounce of gold, up $1.90 from Wednesday's late bid.
   ``Everybody's waiting for the unemployment report,'' said Fred
Barth, chief foreign exchange trader for Prudential Bache Securities
Inc. ``Trading was lackluster at best.''
   Currency dealers elsewhere around the world reported activity
slackened as market operators awaited Friday's release of the U.S.
unemployment report by the Labor Department in Washington.
   The report will provide one of the first indications of how the
economy has responded to rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve
Board has been pursuing a restrictive monetary policy to help slow
growth and relieve inflationary pressures on the economy.
   The dollar moved moderately higher against several key currencies
in some overseas foreign exchange markets before reversing course in
the United States.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.23 Japanese yen, up from
128.73.
   Later in London, the dollar traded at 129.10 yen. The decline
continued in U.S. trading and the dollar was quoted late in New York
at 128.80 yen, down from 129.225 late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7183 late Thursday from
Wednesday's $1.7200. Sterling strengthened in U.S. trading, rising
to $1.7220 from $1.7155 on Wednesday.
   Other later dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.85625 West German marks, down from 1.86325;
1.58555 Swiss francs, down from 1.5910; 1.19925 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.20145; 6.2975 French francs, down from 6.3230; and
1,363.00 Italian lire, down from 1,366.875.
   In European trading, late rates for the dollar, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.8600 West German marks, up from
1.8585; 1.5895 Swiss francs, up from 1.5865; 6.3125 French francs,
up from 6.3080; 2.1000 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0930; 1,366.00
Italian lire, up from 1,362.20, and 1.2000 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2015.
   Gold bullion prices rose in U.S. trading but fell on foreign
metal markets.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $395.10 a troy ounce, up from $393.10 Wednesday.
   Overseas, prices dropped by $2 to $3 an ounce but held above the
$390 level, which dealers described as the current benchmark in
light of some renewed interest in the metal.
   In London, the late bid for gold was $391.55 a troy ounce, down
from $393.80 late Wednesday. The late bid in Zurich was $391.75,
down from $394.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of
$393.51, up from $392.96.
   Late in London, silver was quoted at $5.88 a troy ounce, down
from $5.91.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $6.008 a troy ounce, up from $5.865 on Wednesday.

   William Clay Ford said Thursday he was retiring as
a vice chairman of Ford Motor Co., paving the way for a fourth
generation of family leadership of the automaker founded by his
grandfather, Henry Ford.
   The retirement of Ford, who will be 64 Tuesday, is effective at
the end of March and has been anticipated for months. He will remain
on the board of directors and as chairman of the board's finance and
executive committees.
   Ford's son, William Clay Ford Jr., 31, and nephew, Edsel B. Ford
II, 40, represent the fourth generation of the founding family. Both
are on the company's 21-member board of directors and the elder Ford
said in an afternoon news conference that he expects both to receive
key board assignments within a year.
   Ford said there always should be a member of the family on the
board and in leadership, but added the next generation should not be
rushed into such positions.
   ``Nature has got to take its course,'' he said.
   Ford's retirement came 40 years after he joined the company upon
graduating from Yale. He was elected to the company's board the year
before and worked on Ford's sales and advertising and industrial
relations staffs.
   In 1951, he became quality control manager for the
Lincoln-Mercury Division's jet engine defense project. Through the
decade, he stayed in the Lincoln-Mercury Division in a variety of
projects.
   Ford in 1957 was named chairman of the company's new design
committee of the policy and planning committee and still holds the
post.
   Ford was elected chairman of the board's executive committee and
became a member of the office of the chief executive in 1978. On
April 10, 1980, he was elected a vice chairman of the board. He
became chairman of its finance committee on Nov. 12, 1987.
   During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Ford took part in key
decisions that pulled the company from financial hard times to its
present profitability. As design chairman, Ford had a integral part
in developing such aerodynamic cars as the Ford Taurus that helped
turn around the company's balance sheet in the mid-1980s.
   Ford also is sole owner and president of the Detroit Lions
professional football team.
   He was the youngest of four children of Edsel B. Ford, who was
president of the automobile company from 1919 until his death in
1943.
   Ford's oldest brother, Henry Ford II, was the company's
president, chairman and chief executive officer before his death in
September 1987. His other brother, Benson Ford, was vice president
and chairman of the dealer policy board when he died in 1978.
   The roles of William Jr. and Edsel have been at the center of
speculation since Fortune magazine published a story about the
family in December.
   According to the magazine, William Jr. and Edsel have been
pushing for more power in the operations of the nation's
most-profitable automaker. But, Fortune said, Ford Chairman Donald
Petersen turned aside notions that they belonged in top management
positions simply because they were Fords.
   Early this year, Petersen said the cousins were ``now coming of
age.''
   Ford's other vice chairman, Harold Poling, also is chief
operating officer.

   Silver futures prices surged in the final minutes of trading
Thursday on New York's Commodity Exchange and settled with the

nearly six weeks.
   On other markets, gold futures also advanced; grains and soybeans
rebounded sharply; livestock and meat futures were lower; and energy
futures retreated.
   Silver settled 14.1 cents to 15.3 cents higher with the most
actively traded contract, for delivery in May, at $6.09 an ounce.
The spot contract for March delivery settled at the day's high of
$6.008 a troy ounce.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.90 higher with April at $397.30 a troy
ounce.
   Analysts said the rally was technically inspired, meaning the
buying was based on bullish interpretations of chart patterns rather
than on any change in market fundamentals.
   But the strength of silver relative to gold also suggests
speculators and investors are embracing silver and turning away from
gold, the traditional leader of the precious metals group.
   ``The white knight is finally performing,'' said Peter Cardillo,
commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York futures
brokerage firm. ``I think we're going to see silver emerge as the
leader in the next major rally.''
   Gold is often perceived as a safe haven for investment dollars in
inflationary times, but it has responded poorly to recent government
reports of sharp rises in wholesale and consumer prices.
   Gold's sluggish reaction to the inflation signals ``suggests to
some traders that silver may outperform gold,'' said analyst Bette
Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   She said the rally also reflected positioning by traders before
Friday's national unemployment report. A decline in the jobless rate
of more than 0.1 percentage point would be considered inflationary,
as would an increase in non-farm employment of 300,000 or more.
   Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly on the Chicago Board
of Trade, erasing most of the previous session's losses amid a
variety of bullish factors.
   Forecasts for continued dryness in prime winter-wheat areas
supported the wheat market, as did talk that the Soviet Union was
seeking to buy more U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybean futures, which had fallen steeply Wednesday on jitters
linked to the impending Brazilian soybean harvest, surged back
Thursday on rumors that Brazilian dockworkers were planning to
strike next Wednesday, halting exports of newly harvested soybeans.
   Corn futures were boosted by higher cash prices and by concerns
about a lack of adequate soil moisture in the Midwest.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 5} cents higher with March at $4.35} a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with March at $2.77} a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with March at $2.07 a
bushel; soybeans were 6} cents to 12 cents higher with March at
$7.63{ a bushel.
   Sluggish cash markets pressured livestock and meat futures on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Heavy marketings of hogs also weighed
on the pork complex.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .10 cent lower with April at
77.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .78 cent lower
with March at 80.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .40
cent lower with April at 43.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .65 cent lower to .12 cent higher with March at 38.20 cents a
pound.
   Energy futures retreated in technically motivated trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, reversing the previous session's sharp
gains in heating oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 4 cents
lower with April at $18.52 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent to .99
cent lower with April at 50.38 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.25 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 51.60 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Jet Engine Giant Making a Loud Roar</HEAD>

   Pratt &amp; Whitney customers once had
about as much chance of communicating with management as they had of
hearing a whisper over the roar of its jet engines.
   Not anymore, the company says.
   The result is that already this year, Pratt &amp; Whitney has
received $3.2 billion in commercial jet engine orders, compared with
$5 billion for all of last year when the company nearly tripled its
orders vs. the year before.
   ``We got our act together, but we're not satisfied,'' said Selwyn
D. Berson, head of the commercial division at Pratt &amp; Whitney, a
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
   ``We're going to be the best. That's our goal,'' Berson said
during an interview at his office in the company's sprawling East
Hartford headquarters.
   Sweetened customer relations is part of a general improvement at
Pratt &amp; Whitney's commercial division, historically one of the
pioneers in aircraft engine manufacturing and the biggest in the
business through the 1960s.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney also has started a quality improvement drive, put
new manufacturing technology in place and cut expenses by
eliminating 2,000 jobs.
   Just as important, these changes coincide with a broad move by
airlines worldwide to replace aging jets and expand their fleets for
a growing number of passengers, said Mark Bobbi, an analyst at
Forecast International, a consulting firm in Newtown, Conn.
   International air traffic has been increasing about 8 percent a
year, while traffic on North American routes has been increasing
about 4 percent a year, Bobbi said.
   ``In cumulative book orders, Pratt &amp; Whitney is behind General
Electric, but they're closing the gap,'' Bobbi said.
   Besides General Electric Co., Pratt &amp; Whitney's chief competitors
for commercial engine sales are Rolls-Royce Ltd. and CFM, a joint
venture of GE and Snecma of France.
   GE's commercial engine orders totaled about $2.3 billion last
year, while CFM's orders totaled $5 billion. This year, GE,
Rolls-Royce and CFM have combined sales of about $2.3 billion. But
Rolls-Royce accounts for only about $500 million of that total.
   On the military side, Pratt &amp; Whitney has bested GE in Air Force
engine competition. Pratt &amp; Whitney's latest victory was winning 60
percent of a contract announced in February, an order worth an
estimated $350 million.
   Orders aren't counted as sales until the engines are delivered, a
time lag that ranges from two to three years.
   The numbers for this year and 1988 markedly differ from 1987,
when Pratt &amp; Whitney's shrinking sales were widely publicized. The
low point of that year came when Japan Airlines announced it was
dropping Pratt &amp; Whitney in favor of GE. The airline's decision
stemmed partly from what it called Pratt &amp; Whitney's failure to
adequately back up sales with service.
   The criticism stung company officials, who began a $2 million,
two-year advertising campaign in 1988, aimed at publicizing
improvement efforts and promising higher responsiveness to customers.
   ``We always believed we were doing a great job out there, but
perception is what counts. There was a perception out there that we
weren't really providing the best customer service,'' Berson said.
   The effort has changed Pratt &amp; Whitney's corporate culture,
shifting away from the strictly technical side of building jet
engines, he said.
   For example, Berson said the company now has more than 200 field
representatives who work daily with airline maintenance crews and
are empowered to make quick decisions without consulting with
headquarters first.
   The company also established 40 computer centers to give the
field representatives direct access to corporate headquarters in
East Hartford.
   In related step, Pratt &amp; Whitney has set out to improve its
record for delivering spare parts, which can take up to two years to
manufacture. Customers had criticized parts delivery, even though
Pratt &amp; Whitney led the industry by delivering parts on schedule 93
percent of the time, Berson said.
   ``It didn't matter that it was 93 percent or 94 percent. What
mattered was were we causing the customer some grief. Work stoppage.
That's a grief. If a guy has to stop working on an engine while he's
waiting for a part that we're late on, then we're causing him
grief,'' Berson said.
   Bobbi said another key to Pratt &amp; Whitney's success is a
reduction of costs in building engines.
   Two years ago, GE's pretax profit margin on aircraft engine sales
totaled about 16 percent, double Pratt &amp; Whitney's. Bobbi said Pratt
&amp; Whitney has just about closed that gap, partly because of
cost-cutting.
   Company officials hope the changes will enable Pratt &amp; Whitney to
increase sales. The company had been the largest jet engine company
and had 100 percent of the market until 1970. GE is now regarded as
the biggest jet engine maker.
   Berson estimates there's a worldwide market of about $100 billion
for commercial jet engines and spare parts between now and the year
2000, with 60 percent of that market composed of wide-body airline
sales.
   Up to 700 new airliners will be ordered this year and possibly
the same number next year, Bobbi said. After that, anywhere between
500 to 600 will be ordered annually until 1995, Bobbi said.
   Since many will be wide-body jets, the future looks good for
Pratt &amp; Whitney. Wide-body engine orders have been a growing segment
of Pratt &amp; Whitney business since the early 1980s. The company
captured about 50 percent of the wide-body jet engine orders in
1988, just ahead of GE, industry figures indicate. But for Pratt &amp;
Whitney, that's no reason to gloat.
   ``By my own measure, I think we're about even up,'' Berson said.
``Number one, they are formidable. I never underestimate them. I
never think they're down and out or anything like that, even if I
have a good day. Tomorrow, they could come right back and rap me in
the nose.''

   A New York businessman whose testimony is
considered key to unraveling the Pentagon purchasing scandal pleaded
guilty Thursday to bribing a high-ranking Navy official and
channeling illegal contributions to congressional campaigns.
   Charles F. Gardner was joined in U.S. District Court by two
private consultants, James G. Neal and Kenneth F. Brooke, who
pleaded guilty to other charges.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson told reporters outside the federal
courthouse the pleas were a significant development in the
2{-year-old investigation into fraud in the Defense Department's
$150-billion-a-year procurement system.
   ``The cooperation we will receive from these three individuals
will move this investigation forward at a tremendous pace,'' Hudson
said.
   Gardner, the former general manager of Unisys Corp.'s
surveillance and fire control systems division in Great Neck, N.Y.,
pleaded guilty to charges of bribery, conspiracy to file false
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax
return. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 23 years in prison
and fines of up to $750,000. .
   ``Guilty. ... Guilty. ... Guilty,'' Gardner said in a strong
voice, in response to Judge Claude A. Hylton's questions on three
counts.
   Prosecutors said Gardner bribed Melvyn R. Paisley, a former
assistant secretary of the Navy and the highest-ranking official
publicly identified in the case so far.
   Gardner arranged to buy Paisley's condominium at the Sun Valley,
Idaho, ski resort in August 1986 for an inflated price, the
government said in court documents.
   ``Gardner instructed James G. Neal that the condominium was to be
purchased for $149,000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lower
the price were to be undertaken, even though the unit was
overpriced,'' Hudson said in a statement. ``The condominium was
subsequently sold for $100,000.''
   The suggestion that Gardner buy Paisley's condominium came from
William Galvin, another private consultant who is Brooke's
stepfather, the government said.
   U.S. Attorney Hudson said the condominium purchase was designed
to influence Paisley's actions on two Pentagon contracts sought by
Unisys, one on the Aegis automated radar firing system and the other
on the Marine air traffic and landing system. Unisys eventually
received a portion of the $9 billion Aegis contract.
   Paisley, now a private consultant, has not been charged with any
crime. But prosecutors said that between May 1986 and November 1986,
Paisley ``performed certain official acts to benefit'' Unisys with
regard to the two contracts.
   Another charge against Gardner stems from $1,000 corporate
contributions made in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of Rep. Roy
Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., both members of
a House committee that handled defense issues. Dyson and Chappell
have denied knowing that illegal contributions were funneled to
their campaigns.
   In January, Robert D. Barrett, a former Unisys executive, pleaded
guilty to charges stemming from the complicated scheme to make
illegal campaign contributions.
   Prosecutors said Gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring
``consultants'' to Unisys with the understanding that some of the
money would be placed ``in bank accounts, both domestic and foreign,
for purposes of bribery, illegal campaign contributions, and in part
for ... Gardner's personal use.''
   Hudson's investigation has been looking into the question of
whether defense companies hired private consultants who, in turn,
paid bribes to public officials to obtain inside information
valuable for obtaining Pentagon contracts.
   Unisys welcomed Gardner's plea, the company said in a statement
released from its headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa. ``The Unisys
Corp.'s board, management and employees have been outraged by Mr.
Gardner's illegal activities and the negative reflection cast on the
image of our new company,'' the statement said.
   As part of Gardner's arrangement with Neal, the private
consultant set up a web of seven companies in order to receive money
from Unisys and its predecessor, Sperry Corp., the government said.
Unisys is a giant computer corporation.
   Most of the companies were located in Northern Virginia, but one
was in the United Kingdom and another in the Cayman Islands.
   The government also said Gardner caused Unisys to ``make and
present to the departments of the Navy and Air Force false,
fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the United
States.''
   Neal, 63, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe Garland Tomlin
Jr., who was a Navy engineer with the Naval Electronics Systems
Command until his retirement in October 1985.
   On instructions from Gardner, Neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 a
total of $400,000 to Longwood International, a company owned by
Tomlin, in order to influence Tomlin's official decisions,
prosecutors said. Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.
   Neal pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government and
conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true taxable
income. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of $750,000.
   Brooke, 40, pleaded guilty to evading about $66,000 in taxes in
1985, prosecutors said. He faces a possible sentence of five years
in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
   The judge set sentencing for July 14.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broad measure of the nation's money supply fell
while a narrower measure rose in late February, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M3 fell $1.9 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,942.6 billion in the week ended Feb. 27 from
a revised $3,944.5 billion the previous week. The previous week's
figure had originally been reported as $3,945.9 billion.
   A narrower measure, M2, rose $4 billion to a seasonally adjusted
$3,077.5 billion from $3,073.5 billion the previous week, revised
from $3,076.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, held steady at a
seasonally adjusted $789.2 billion. The previous week's figure was
revised from an original report of $789.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates in addition
to the two broader money supply measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,068.9 billion, a 3.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,925.2 billion, up 4.7 percent, while M1 rose
1.5 percent to an average of $788.0 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $793 million a day,
up from $308 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $365 million
in the latest two weeks, down from $649 million in the previous two
weeks.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $287.5 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$287.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo, singled out
by strikers as viciously anti-union, said Thursday he is the wrong
target and the real issue in the emotion-charged walkout is the
impact of deregulation.
   Lorenzo also rejected criticism about his silence since the
strike began, saying he was too busy.
   ``We do have limited amounts of time,'' Lorenzo said in a
telephone interview following his announcement that strike-torn
Eastern had filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy court.
``I'm not the type that travels from talk show to talk show.''
   There has been criticism in recent days of Lorenzo for not making
a public appearance since the start of the Machinists union strike
last Saturday. Pilots and flight attendants have joined the strikers
in sympathy.
   Lorenzo, who controls Miami-based Eastern through his Texas Air
Corp. holding company, earlier had told a news conference that the
animosity union leaders have expressed toward him had ``hurt my
family and me.''
   ``But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in
airline deregulation and, indeed, in our business climate today,''
he said.
   For labor leaders, Lorenzo symbolizes union-busting and
antagonistic management. He is vilified by some as an archenemy of
working America.
   Union leaders lashed out at him Thursday as a ``robber baron.''
   ``The personalization of this has hurt me, has hurt my family a
lot,'' Lorenzo said in the interview. He added that it's difficult
when his four children, aged five to 15, ask him, ```Dad, what's
going on?'''
   But, Lorenzo said, he is ``far more troubled by the thousands of
employees whose lives have been very severely affected'' by the
Eastern strike.
   Eastern announced Monday that it was shutting down virtually all
its operations and laying off around 9,500 non-union employees. The
airline had 31,200 employees before the strike.
   ``I know the emotions; I know how difficult it is for them to
make individual decisions,'' Lorenzo said.

   Delta Air Lines refused to say Thursday if it was
considering buying gates or other properties from strikebound
Eastern Airlines but acknowledged an interest in ``any new
opportunities.''
   There has been industry speculation that Delta would be among
those seeking to snap up Eastern's assets if the Miami-based airline
starts selling some or all of its property as part of its bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Eastern, virtually grounded since its Machinists union went on
strike Saturday, filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy
court on Thursday.
   Among the company's assets are 48 domestic gates at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport, where Eastern has its largest hub.
   Archrival Delta has 55 of the airport's 132 domestic gates,
according to airport spokesman John Braden.
   Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate said company and federal regulatory
policies prevented any comment on possible mergers, acquisitions or
major investments.
   Asked if the company generally would be interested in acquiring
more gates at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, where Delta
is the dominant carrier, Ms. Pate said, ``In the past we have
expressed interest in acquiring new gates and would be interested in
any new opportunities.''
   Systemwide, Delta has 389 jets and handles 2,265 flights a day,
Ms. Pate said. The company had earnings of $185.1 million during its
last quarter ended Dec. 31.
   Delta's major acquisition of recent years was its $860 million
merger with Western Air Lines in 1987. Western 102 airplanes to the
Delta fleet and increased the number of cities served by Delta to
153.
   Braden said Eastern's lease on its Hartsfield space runs through
2010.
   ``Those gates are valuable,'' Braden said. ``They have a
proprietary interest in them.''
   Last year, Braden said, Eastern paid a total of $23 million to
Hartsfield for gate rental, landing fees, security fees, cargo space
and other facilities.
   Delta and some of the smaller airlines operating at Hartsfield
have absorbed much of the traffic that Eastern would be handling
from Atlanta. But Ms. Pate said Delta flights are not full and
passengers should have little trouble getting tickets.
   ``We still have a lot of empty seats,'' she said. ``There are
even still some discount seats available if the passengers are
flexible (about schedules).''
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said the airline will be increasing
its daily flights out of Atlanta from 400 to 406 next week, but he
said that increase has been planned for several months.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Yugo Effort To Halt Sale Of Liquidator's Cars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yugo America Inc. on Thursday won an early
victory in the company's effort to reorganize its finances as a
bankruptcy judge barred a liquidator from selling 4,800 automobiles
below wholesale.
   Such a sale would erode consumer confidence in Yugo and would
destroy any effort by the company to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, which it sought in papers filed Jan. 30, the
judge and the company said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Vincent J. Commisa told the liquidator,
Norauto Ltd. of Columbus, Ohio, it could not sell the cars.
   ``If the sales were allowed, most dealers would lose money and
never carry the Yugo car again,'' Commisa said in his ruling. ``It
in effect could completely destroy all efforts of reorganization.''
   Impex Car Corp., the U.S. agent for the car's Yugoslav maker, has
battled for control of the cars.
   Norauto insists it bought the cars last fall and should be
allowed to sell them at whatever price it wants.
   But Yugo, of Upper Saddle River, and Impex, of New York, argued
that the financial pact with Norauto was meant only to pump some
much needed cash into the financially ailing company.
   Jeremy Golton, an attorney for Norauto, declined comment on the
judge's decision, but said an appeal is likely.
   The 4,800 autos in question are among 6,000 sitting at U.S.
ports. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. has liens on the balance.
   Along with Yugo, parent company Global Motors Inc. and sister
company Proton America filed for bankruptcy protection. They said
more than 300 companies and individuals, led by Manufacturers
Hanover, may hold claims against them.
   Yugo touted its boxy subcompact cars as the cheapest new auto in
the United States when they went on sale in August 1985 at $3,995.
   Sales topped 39,100 in the first 10 months of 1987, but dropped
to 26,000 in the same period of 1988, according to figures released
by the company.

   Striking Eastern workers, initially stunned by
Thursday's announcement that the airline would seek bankruptcy
protection, quickly became angry and vowed to keep picketing and
fighting ``robber baron'' Frank Lorenzo.
   ``Hang in there! It's not over!'' Local Vice President Frank
Ortis shouted to hundreds of Eastern employees who gathered at a
Machinists union hall as news of the Chapter 11 filing began
circulating in the morning.
   The Machinists union called for a boycott of Eastern's sister
airline, Continental, and Eastern's unions said they would devise
their own plan for reorganizing the airline.
   ``Chapter 11 means there's still a patient and it's undergoing
surgery and it's coming back,'' said John Bavis, head of the Eastern
pilots. ``That's better than the continued slow dismantling of
Eastern under Texas Air.''
   Workers at the union hall temporarily put aside worries about
their futures, including the immediate problem of trying to get
paychecks due this week, to await news of the company action at the
hall across the street from corporate headquarters.
   Jammed around TV sets, workers booed and shouted epithets at
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., and Eastern
President Phil Bakes as they told reporters about the bankruptcy
filing in New York.
   There were cheers for Machinists District 100 President Charles
E. Bryan's televised news conference at the nearby district
headquarters.
   ``It certainly is a sad day for Eastern,'' said Bryan, the
combative union leader who leads 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground workers who went on strike Saturday after talks
broke down in their 17-month contract dispute. The strike virtually
shut down Eastern when pilots and flight attendants refused to cross
Machinists picket lines.
   The pilots union, blamed by Eastern management for forcing the
bankruptcy reorganization, planned a news conference later.
   ``We will prevail,'' said Bryan, his voice rising and his eyes
flashing. ``This is Frank Lorenzo's conspiracy. This is Frank
Lorenzo's strike.''
   Bavis said management continued calling pilots at home in hopes
some would return to work. He said the effort would fail.
   Bryan said poor management, not unions, were to blame, and he
repeated charges he has made for three years that Lorenzo intended
from the start to try to break the unions and carve up Eastern.
   Bryan said his union will fight Lorenzo in bankruptcy court and
in Washington and will picket everything touched by Texas Air,
ranging from Eastern to a fuel tanker in Corpus Christi, Texas, to
sister carrier Continental, where Lorenzo had labor contracts
abrogated during bankruptcy reorganization in 1983. The union is
urging a nationwide boycott of Continental, which Bryan says is
Lorenzo's ``war machine'' to take advantage of Eastern's shutdown by
expanding its low-cost services on Eastern routes.
   ``There's never been a more classic example of a robber baron,''
Bryan said. ``Anytime anyone buys a ticket on Continental, they're
making a contribution to treachery ... to atrocity ... to evil.''
   ``The entire labor movement learned something from the
Continental experience, and this time Lorenzo and his flunkies are
learning something about the power of union solidarity,'' United
Auto Workers President Owen Bieber said in a statement.
   Bryan urged workers not to panic. A mechanic who started at
Eastern 33 years ago and was involved in Eastern's previous strikes,
in 1958 and 1966, Bryan predicted that community businesses and
mortgage-holders would be lenient.
   His union urged workers to file for unemployment compensation,
although it was doubtful strikers would qualify. Wally Haber, a
Machinists district general chairman, said strikers were urged to
seek financial counseling and loans from the Eastern employees
credit union, which Haber said was in good shape.
   However, the company indicated that this week's paychecks for
Eastern employees, whose pay for a given work week arrives the
following week, were frozen at Thursday's announcement. Union
attorneys are likely to ask bankruptcy court to order the checks
released.
   Haber said under union rules, $100 weekly strike-fund payments
won't begin for two more weeks.
   While workers promised to keep picketing, many said they couldn't
wait for the outcome of reorganization or a possible buyout by Trans
World Airways Chairman Carl Icahn, which Bryan continued to think
was possible.
   ``Starting tomorrow, I'll be looking for another job after 12
years here,'' said Cynthia Carrasco, an officer service worker and
single mother of two.
   ``But I'll still be right out here picketing and protesting. I
want my paycheck. I've got rent, food, clothing to buy.''
   Yurbano Mayorquin, 21-year electronics technician, said he'll be
looking for a new job at age 55 but had no second thoughts about the
strike.
   ``We're all grown-up people. We knew we were taking risks,''
Mayorquin. ``But the end was coming. They were dismantling the
airline. The end was coming now or it was going to be later.''
   Company spokesman James Ashlock, a 22-year Eastern employee, said
the 1,500 remaining workers who had not joined the strike or been
laid off this week were working ``until we are told otherwise.''

<HEAD>Texaco President Says Icahn Stimulated Company; Announces Compensation
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. President James W. Kinnear
reluctantly admitted Thursday that its restructuring was at least
partly due to an old adversary and the oil giant's biggest
shareholder, takeover investor Carl Icahn.
   ``You'd like to say no,'' Kinnear told a meeting of business
executives. ``But if you say that (what Icahn did) galvanized and
got the attention of the rest of the organization, I'd have to say
that's possible. I think you have to ask yourself at what cost. But
I think there's an element of that.''
   At a meeting sponsored by the Conference Board, a New York-based
business research organization, Kinnear also announced a new
incentive program for Texaco's top management.
   Kinnear said compensation would be based on several criteria,
including how well executives improve company earnings and return on
investments.
   ``In my case, about three-quarters of my compensation will vary
with how well we do ... Clearly, it's to the benefit of
shareholders,'' he said.
   Texaco in January announced the completion of a restructuring
plan which involved the sale of more than $7 billion in assets,
streamlining of management and decentralization of decision-making.
   The restructuring followed the company's emergence from Chapter
11 bankruptcy last year and was completed only after Texaco made a
deal with Icahn, a takeover speculator who acquired a big chunk of
the company's stock during and after the bankruptcy period.
   He made an unsuccessful offer for Texaco last year, an effort
that the company's management dismissed as an insincere attempt to
blackmail Texaco into buying his shares.
   The nation's third-largest oil company originally sought refuge
in bankruptcy court in April 1987, to avoid having to post a
potentially ruinous security bond of more than $10 billion as part
of a court battle with Pennzoil Co. over Texaco's acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. four years earlier.
   Since the restructuring, many industry analysts have credited
Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, with igniting Texaco management
into making changes that they believe it otherwise would not have
made.
   In late January, Texaco announced it had struck a deal with Icahn
under which the financier agreed not to boost his 17 percent stake
in the company for seven years or to make another takeover bid.
   Texaco in turn agreed to spend $2.4 billion in special dividend
payments to shareholders and to repurchase some of its stock in
order to boost the value of the shares. Analysts estimate that Icahn
stands to gain $300 million if the plan is approved by shareholders
at the annual meeting in May.
   On Thursday, Kinnear called for changes in public policy and tax
laws that encourage takeovers and attention to short-term gains
instead of long-term growth. One law that should be changed, he
said, allows a tax deduction for interest on loans for takeovers.
   ``Such tax reforms would encourage shareholders to view holdings
as long-term investments not simply the local roulette table,'' he
said.

   In its first international real estate auction, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Thursday it sold $40.6 million
worth of property in Texas, Florida and Illinois that it acquired
from failed banks.
   The 14 parcels sold came from a real estate portfolio that the
FDIC estimates is worth $400 million. Seven parcels that were
offered went unsold because bids were too low.
   The auction was conducted by Christie's and the real estate firm
Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The identity of purchasers were not made public.
   A few of the properties had been owned directly by the problem
banks while others were turned over as a result of loan defaults,

<HEAD>Taiwan Company Cancels Orders, Reflecting Industry Trouble From Controversy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, `That is ...,' to fix garble.</HEAD>

   A Taiwanese exporter said Thursday it had
canceled a large order for Washington apples because of concerns
over the health effects of the chemical Alar, the latest sign of
slowing sales due to the controversy.
   W.L.H. Group, of Seattle, this week cancelled an order for 5,000
boxes of Washington apples and may not order any more U.S. apples
the rest of the season, said Sue Lin, an employee in the Seattle
office.
   Taiwanese consumers have stopped buying U.S. apples after hearing
alarming news accounts about Alar, Ms. Lin said.
   ``Everybody is scared about that (Alar),'' Ms. Lin said in a
telephone interview. ``The market has become real bad.''
   Taiwan is the largest off-shore importer of Washington apples,
buying about 50,000 42-pound boxes per week, according to the
Northwest Horticultural Council.
   Ms. Lin said her company's weekly orders are worth about $70,000.
The current selling season extends into August, so the loss to
Washington growers could top $1.5 million.
   That is a fairly small amount compared to the $312 million the
5,000 growers in Washington state earned last year. But it is also
the most disturbing sign that the Alar controversy is hurting the
industry.
   Alar, made by Uniroyal Chemical Co., is a growth regulator that
is sprayed on trees to make the apples hang longer. That gives them
better color and firmness and allows growers extra harvest time.
   The controversy erupted last week when the private Natural
Resources Defense Council issued a report that claimed preschoolers
exposed to Alar-treated apples ran a cancer risk of about one case
for every 4,000 children exposed.
   Growers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have
denounced the report as misleading and alarmist.
   Growers contend they voluntarily have cut back on Alar _ the
trade name for daminozide _ since concerns about the chemical first
were raised three years ago.
   Only about 5 percent of the total U.S. apple acreage is treated
with the chemical and it is used within allowable federal limits,
the industry contends.
   The EPA has proposed banning Alar by 1990, but its health effects
are still in dispute and the chemical is legal to use.
   The first accurate indication of how much the NRDC report has
hurt apple sales was expected Friday, when major apple-marketing
organizations in Washington state release their weekly shipping
reports.
   ``We have had a few isolated reports of sales dropping,'' said
Maureen Miklavic, spokeswoman for the International Apple Institute
in McLean, Va.
   She said the decision by the Taiwanese company was the only
international cancellation she had heard about.
   Ms. Lin said her company intends to purchase apples from Chile to
send to Taiwan.
   The 5,000-box cancellation was with the Northern Fruit Co. of
Wenatchee. Export sales manager Greg Clevenger said his impression
was that domestic sales are down, but he said ``it will turn around
once the public gets more informed.''

<HEAD>N.H. Governor To Ask Judge To Block Seabrook Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Seabrook reax, recasting to move
up why Gregg opposes testing. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Judd Gregg announced Wednesday that the
state will ask a federal bankruptcy judge to block low-power testing
of the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   The move is a stunning reversal of policy for the state of New
Hampshire, which has officially supported the project for 17 years.
   Lead Seabrook owner Public Service Company of New Hampshire
sought bankruptcy protection in January 1988 because of licensing
delays. The $5.9 billion project was completed in July 1986 but
remains idle because of evacuation-planning and financial obstacles.
   In a statement, Gregg said the state will argue to the bankruptcy
judge that letting Seabrook conduct atomic tests is not sound
business judgment ``unless it has first obtained the clearances
necessary to begin full-power operation, including final evacuation
plans.''
   ``If Seabrook never goes on-line (commercially), then low-power
testing will have been a wasted exercise, the resultant
contamination will have been avoidable and the expense will have
been unnecessary,'' the Republican governor said.
   ``Consistent with this position I have elected to petition the
federal bankruptcy court to prevent Seabrook from conducting such
tests. A motion to this effect will be filed within the next two
weeks,'' Gregg said.
   A Seabrook spokesman, Rob Williams, said Gregg ``must be
misinformed'' and that prompt testing of the reactor is prudent.
Project officials hope to start the tests within weeks.
   Nicholas Ashooh, a spokesman for lead Seabrook owner Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, said company officials ``have
concerns that this may lead to additional unnecessary delays and
cost increases for Seabrook and may further delay our getting
Seabrook's power, which we need.''
   In December, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Seabrook may
start low-power tests when the plant's owners prove they can come up
with $72.1 million to decommission the reactor if it conducts the
tests but never operates commercially.
   Seabrook owners initially hoped to give that assurance in
January, in the form of a surety bond, but they have yet to do so.
   Public Service owns 36 percent of Seabrook, and Gregg said the
state opposes letting the company take on what he estimated as an
additional $25 million liability for low-power decommissioning.
   ``A company in bankruptcy should not voluntarily accept
additional liabilities,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg also said that contaminating Seabrook with atomic testing
``will needlessly render the facility useless for alternate
applications.

   A House panel on Thursday approved legislation
to gradually add $1.30 an hour to the $3.35 minimum wage as
Democratic leaders said they're willing to compromise with the Bush
administration by adding a reduced ``training wage'' for new workers.
   The move to raise the minimum for the first time in eight years
was approved on a party-line vote by the House labor standards
subcommittee. The bill, nearly identical to one approved by the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Wednesday, would raise
the minimum over three years to $4.65 by 1991.
   The administration wants to increase the minimum wage to $4.25 an
hour over three years and insists on the training wage provision
allowing the minimum to stay at $3.35 an hour for all newly hired
workers' first six months on the job.
   A spokeswoman for Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Thursday
the administration is sticking by its ``last offer'' and is prepared
to veto a more ambitious plan.
   ``Nothing that happened in the Congress was unexpected,'' said
spokeswoman Dale Tate. ``The entire package is the bottom line, both
the $4.25 figure and the six-month training wage at $3.35. ... We've
come more than halfway towards meeting the goal in terms of meeting
the minimum wage (increase proponents).''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, said he expects negotiations over the
sub-minimum despite the strong Bush administration stance.
   Hawkins was asked whether he takes the veto threat seriously and
replied:
   ``No, I don't. It's the nature of a president's position to say
such things. We're not going to be threatened by a veto. We still
have to legislate.''
   House Democrats said they are prepared to include a sub-minimum
wage if strict education and training requirements are included and
committee staffers said they are considering a duration of 30 to 90
days.
   ``I can see justification in a short training period for some
minimum-wage employees,'' said subcommittee Chairman Rep. Austin
Murphy, D-Pa.
   Hawkins said the full House Education and Labor Committee will
take up the increase next Tuesday and he predicted a vote by the
full chamber the following week. A spokeswoman for Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell said late Thursday that a vote in the Senate
is not expected until April, after the Easter recess.
   The minimum wage has stood at $3.35 an hour since 1981.
   Democrats would make the minimum $3.85 an hour this year and add
40 cents an hour in each of the next two years. Republicans want to
add 30 cents an hour annually for three years.
   Democrats and organized labor have long opposed a training wage,
but gave qualified acceptance to the idea this week, sparking hopes
that Congress would pass an increase in the minimum wage agreeable
to Bush, who has said he would veto legislation raising the minimum
above $4.25.
   ``If they want to have a training wage, we will discuss it with
them,'' Hawkins said Thursday. He said such a provision, along with
specific training, would have to be limited to first-time workers
and would have to be for a shorter duration than six months.
   ``Recent White House proposals ... are both constructive and
encouraging,'' said Murphy. ``On the question of a training wage, we
are working hard to put together a proposal to be introduced, either
in full committee or on the House floor.''
   ``Our amendment will be more restrictive than the proposals we
have heard from the president. However, our effort will show we are
sincere and prepared to address all the components of this issue,''
he said.

   Filing for bankruptcy protection gives Eastern
Airlines a chance to fly again without worrying about more than $3
billion in liabilities, but doesn't stop the strike-torn carrier
from selling assets or shutting down for good.
   Industry analysts and bankruptcy lawyers said Thursday's filing
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
law does not guarantee the airline's survival.
   ``They don't have much left. I think they're a dead duck,'' said
Paul Gibson Jr., a New York attorney who was an American Airlines
vice president in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Eastern said it had $4.5 billion in assets, $3.39 billion in
liabilities, and 15,696 creditors. It filed its petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
   The filing does not specify how Miami-based Eastern plans to
resurrect its crippled operations, but analysts said the sale of the
carrier _ possibly to Trans World Airlines owner Carl C. Icahn _ or
a piece-by-piece dismantling were possibilities.
   Eastern must prove to Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland that any
asset sale is crucial for raising money to stay airborne, or that
the airline can't survive at all and must be sold.
   ``If they have to raise cash to operate week-to-week or
month-to-month they can get by with the sale of a couple planes,''
said Richard Lieb, a New York bankruptcy lawyer. ``But if it's a
very significant transaction there is some real doubt whether it
could happen.''
   As such, Eastern filing throws the pending $365 million sale of
its Northeast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump
into the judge's hands.
   It also delays a proposed $85 million sale to USAir of Eastern
gates in Philadelphia and routes from that city to Toronto and
Montreal.
   Chapter 11 is designed to allow companies to operate normally
during reoganization, but assures nothing.
   Eastern, for instance, must find pilots to fly its planes. In
1982, Braniff Airways tried to reorganize and keep flying under
Chapter 11 but had to suspend operations before it was sold and
brought out of bankruptcy.
   Any reorganization plan must be approved by the judge and by
creditors.
   Secured creditors, who have collateral from the airline, would be
the first to get paid. Unsecured creditors, including passengers
with unused Eastern tickets, have no security in case of default and
cannot get reimbursed until the end of the case _ if at all.
   Eastern reported secured debt of $1.49 billion, while its largest
unsecured creditor, the Bank of New York, is owed $150 million.
   Some industry analysts believe bankruptcy court was a better
option for Eastern than a total sale of assets, where buyers
probably would have bid rock-bottom prices.
   ``Now because bankruptcy court is protecting the company and the
creditors, Eastern will only accept an offer that is a fair offer,''
said James Carey, vice president for research for Airline Economics
Inc.
   Eastern's major individual assets include airport gates and
landing slots, its South American routes and its Miami maintenance
facility. Wall Street estimates Eastern is worth $400 million to
$900 million as a unit.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said in court papers the airline had
$200 million in cash left from more than $400 million on hand at the
outset of 1989. That money, needed to run daily operations, would
have run out in about 45 days and Eastern would have been forced out
of business, he said.
   Eastern has lost $1.02 billion this decade compared to industry
earnings of $2.89 billion, the papers said. The airline said it was
losing $4 million a day during the walkout by mechanics, pilots and
flight attendants, which began last Saturday.
   ``While other airlines have been able to apply revenue to
expansion projects ... Eastern has been required to apply its
revenue to primarily servicing debt obligations and meeting labor
costs,'' Bakes said.
   Eastern said its payments on total debt of $2.5 billion were
about $575 million last year. The airline says it needs more than
$200 million in labor cost savings to remain in business.
   Bakes blamed unions for forcing Eastern to seek bankruptcy
protection, saying they want to wrest control of the airline from
parent Texas Air Corp. and avenge the 1983 takeover of Continental
Airlines by Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Lorenzo took Continental into bankruptcy in 1983, broke union
contracts, fired two-thirds of its workers and emerged with a
non-union airline. That led Congress to amend bankruptcy laws that
now require Lorenzo to negotiate with Eastern unions and get the
judge's approval before abrogating any pacts.
   Experts believe Lorenzo miscalculated that Eastern's 3,600 pilots
would support the Machinists walkout and probably did not envision
bankruptcy. But some also said Lorenzo's long-term intentions after
acquiring Eastern in 1986 may have been less than innocent.
   ``I think he wanted to walk along the edge and continue his
stripping down of the operations. As a wheeler-dealer, he doesn't
want a court looking over his head,'' said Gibson, the former
American executive.
