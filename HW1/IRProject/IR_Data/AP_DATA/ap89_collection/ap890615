   A tornado cut a 10-mile path through
southeastern Pennsylvania on Thursday, destroying five homes,
damaging five six others and injuring at least seven people,
authorities said.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Curll said the funnel
cloud was reported touching ground near Wrightsville _ about 75
miles west of Philadelphia and 50 miles north of Baltimore _ about
6:30 p.m.
   A ham radio operator reported seeing the tornado cross the
Susquehanna River. It then destroyed four homes and inflicted minor
damage on four others on state Route 999 south of Mountville, said
police Officer James Alexander.
   About a mile from there, the tornado leveled one home and
severely damaged another, said James Eshleman, Millersville fire
chief.
   Local radio reports also described numerous trees uprooted. Curl
said about an inch of rain fell within 20 minutes in the tornado
area.
   Three people were admitted to York Hospital with minor injuries,
three people were treated at Lancaster General Hospital for cuts,
and a fourth person was treated at St. Joseph's Hospital, hospital
officials reported.
   Authorities reported numerous downed power lines. About 7,100
Metropolitan Edison customers in York and Lancaster counties lost
power _ about 5,000 within York city limits, said division manager
Fred Wentzel.
   Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light spokesman Jack Brinker spokesman said
only about 1,900 customers in the East Petersburg area, north of
Lancaster, were without power.

   Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck look-alikes
met their end as police set fire to thousands of fake Walt Disney
products in Bangkok.
   About 15,000 comic books as well as children's clothes and
souvenirs produced in Thailand using the famous cartoon characters
without permission were burned Wednesday in a bonfire in a dump
truck in the city center.
   The products were seized from outlets in Bangkok after lawyers
for the Walt Disney Co. complained about the unlicensed reproduction
of their products in Thailand, said Tagorn Nampratan, lawyer for the
company in Thailand.
   Counterfeit products are openly sold in Bangkok, and authorities
are clamping down on the trade. Last month, police drove a
steamroller over 6,000 fake Cartier watches.

   A judge has ordered the Defense
Ministry to pay $47 million to an electrician tortured during
Uruguay's 1972-85 military dictatorship, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   A government spokesman said the Defense Ministry will appeal the
order.
   The victim, who was not identified by name, was held without
charge from January 1976 to May 1977, the weekly Busqueda reported.
   His injuries were not described, but the newspaper quoted Civil
Court Judge Carlos Berlangieri as saying in his ruling that they
prevent the man from returning to work. The report did not say what
day the ruling was made.
   A crackdown on leftist subversion was a major feature of the
military government which oversaw a return to civilian rule on March
1, 1985.
   Under military rule, about 150 suspected leftists were killed _
compared to at least 8,961 in neighboring Argentina during its junta
of 1976-83 _ and several thousand were arrested and tortured.
   Lawyers said they know of no precedent in Uruguay for the huge
award.
   In April 1988, the San Francisco District Court ordered fugitive
Argentine Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason to pay $21 million to Horacio
Martinez Baca, who was tortured on the general's orders during the
1976-83 dictatorship.
   That is believed to be the largest federal civil award for a
civil rights abuse.
   The cashiered general, however, never paid the sum. He was
extradited to Argentina, where he was convicted of murder and still
is jailed.

   Seaman Adolf Eich crawled through a
narrow tunnel inside the burning battleship Bismarck, scrambling for
his life as British forces bombarded the Third Reich's most dreaded
fighting vessel.
   Eich, a survivor of one of the most famous battles in naval
history, recounted his tale Wednesday after American explorers found
the sunken battleship under 2.8 miles of water 600 miles off the
coast of France.
   The Bismarck went down on May 27, 1941, ending a furious pursuit
by British warships and aircraft defending the Allies' crucial
supply lines with Europe.
   Of 2,200 Bismarck crewmembers, only about 100 survived.
   ``The water was red from blood, and I could see at least 500
people swimming in the sea. Most of them didn't make it,'' said
Eich, who was pulled from the cold North Atlantic by British naval
forces.
   The U.S. oceanographer who found the Bismarck on Monday, Robert
Ballard, said the ship would remain in its resting place as an
``undersea memorial.''
   Ballard, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts, said the wreckage of one of the epic naval battles of
World War II was ``still rather a beautiful ship.''
   British naval historians hailed it as a major discovery.
   The heavily armed, iron-clad vessel demonstrated its killing
power on May 24, 1941, when it sank the famed British battle cruiser
Hood off the coast of Greenland. Only three of the 1,425 sailors
aboard survived.
   British forces, ordered to sink the Bismarck at any cost, finally
caught up with it off France on May 26, launching a furious attack
with heavy naval guns and air-launched torpedoes that crippled the
largest ship in Adolf Hitler's navy.
   Eich, then 20, said he was in a below-decks fire-control room
when the order finally came to abandon ship on May 27.
   ``There was rubble all over the place, and there was no safe way
of getting out,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Duesseldorf.
   The retired telex operator said he and another sailor, Halke
Franz, managed to crawl out through a narrow, circular passage for
electrical cables.
   Eich said he was astonished by the carnage and destruction he
found on deck.
   ``When I came out I couldn't believe there was anyone still
alive,'' he said.
   Survivors Hermann Budich, 69, and Paul Rudek, 72, also have vivid
memories of the battle.
   ``I lost a lot of friends on that ship, some of whom I knew for
two years,'' said Budich, of the northern town of Bad Segeberg.
   Rudek said he was impressed by the ship's thick armored plates
when he was assigned to the vessel as a petty officer.
   ``At that time I thought nothing could ever happen to this
ship,'' said Rudek, of the northern port city Kiel.
   He said that on May 26 British aircraft began pounding the
Bismarck with torpedoes and knocked out one of the ship's rudders so
that it could only maneuver in circles.
   In the early hours of May 27, the Bismarck's commanders ordered
destroyed so that it would not be seized by the British.
   ``And then we knew the end was near,'' Rudek said.
   Explosives were set off near the ship's drainage ports and the
Bismarck flopped over.
   Rudek slid into the water from the starboard side. He tried
desperately to grab a rescue line thrown by crewmen from the British
warship Dorsetshire, but it was just out of reach. Then a wave
shoved him closer and he was able to grab the line.
   Rudek said it still horrifies him to think of his comrades who
drowned sealed inside the Bismarck.
   ``I was lucky that I went over the rail,'' said Rudek, who like
the other survivors spent the rest of the war in British prisoner of
war camps.
   The sinking of the Hood, the pride of the British nay, was a
tremendous blow to British morale.
   But Eich said many Bismarck crew members formed lasting
friendships with their former enemies and that they communicate
frequently.
   Ted Briggs, one of three Hood survivors, was asked by the AP
London bureau whether he felt any bitterness.
   ``At first, yes,'' said the retired real estate agent and former
Hood signalman.
   ``But when you come to think of it, they were doing their job
just as we were doing ours. But the memory is with me all the time.''

<HEAD>FAA Orders Grounding of Some 737-400s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday
ordered airlines to ground some Boeing 737-400 jetliners until
certain engines that have been operated at high thrust are modified
or replaced.
   The emergency airworthiness directive, distributed by telegram,
comes after Britain's Civil Aviation Authority ordered 12 of the new
twinjets grounded following two incidents of trouble with their
CFM56-3C engines.
   The same model of engine was on a British Midlands 737-400 that
crashed in January, killing 47 people. The cause of that crash has
not been determined.
   Boeing Co. and the engines' manufacturer, CFM International,
issued their own advisory Tuesday, urging airlines to ground the
jets until the engines are replaced or have their thrust capacities
reduced.
   The sole U.S. operator of 737-400s, Piedmont Airlines, already
has replaced engines on the affected planes, a spokesman said.
   The FAA's order requires airlines to immediately remove from
service all fan blades and disks on CFM56-series engines that have
been operated at 23,500 pounds of thrust. The agency also said, as
did Boeing and CFM International, that all CFM56-3C engines on
737-400s should be modified to operate at a maximum 22,000 pounds
thrust.
   The CFM56-3C was designed with higher thrust to provide more
power for the 737-400, a ``stretched'' version of the widely used
737-300. The 737-400, which carries 146 passengers, went into
service last year.
   The FAA said CFM56-3B engines, which are rated at up to 22,000
pounds thrust and used on both the 737-400 and smaller 737-300, have
had excellent reliability with no fan blade failures in a cumulative
6 million flight hours.
   Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said the FAA order affects 28
planes with the 3C engines, all outside the United States.
   In addition to the British order, West Germany on Tuesday ordered
engines checked in the four 737-400s used in that country.
   Last Friday, a Dan Air 737-400 with the 3C engines carrying 100
charter passengers to Minorca returned to London's Gatwick Airport
after developing severe vibration in one engine.
   On Sunday, a British Midlands 737-400 with the same engines
flying from London's Heathrow Airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland,
with 80 people aboard made an emergency landing at East Midlands
airport after a problem developed in one engine.
   In both cases, the airlines reported turbofan blades had been
damaged.
   In the January British Midlands crash, the pilot reported that
one engine had failed in flight, but investigators later found the
plane's remaining good engine had then been shut down before an
emergency landing was attempted.
   The investigation of that crash has not been completed.
   CFM International is a joint venture of General Electric Co. of
the United States and SNECMA of France.

<HEAD>Disgruntled Belly Dancer Says Her Art is Kosher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli belly dancer has gone to court to
defend her shimmies as kosher, claiming Orthodox rabbis are shaking
her financially by threatening to rescind the kosher certificates of
places where she dances.
   Philadelphia-born Ilana Raskin argued in a Supreme Court petition
that food _ not dance _ should be the only basis for issuing
``kashrut'' licenses certifying hotels and restaurants as kosher.
   Ms. Raskin, 35, said that even if dance was a criterion, her own
Middle Eastern variety meets standards of modesty set by Orthodox
Jewish rabbis.
   ``It's a very sensual dance, but it's not immodest,'' she told
The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``It's a proud and beautiful
dance. I'm living in the Middle East. It speaks to my living here.''
   Ms. Raskin, who has also worked as a counselor and has a master's
degree in education from Hebrew University, started dancing six
years ago.
   She said she was dancing regularly for parties, weddings and bar
mitzvahs, but found beginning in November that she was getting fewer
and fewer engagements.
   Neta Ziv-Goldman, a lawyer for the Israeli Association of Civil
Rights who is representing Ms. Raskin, said her petition submitted
to the court Monday maintains the drop in business followed threats
to hotels and restaurants from Jerusalem rabbis.
   Officials for the Jerusalem rabbinate were unavailable for
comment, but spokesman Eitan Aizman of the chief rabbinate of Israel
contended that ``belly dancing is not modest, it is erotic.''
   Rabbi Shlomo Goren, a former chief rabbi, was emphatic in
declaring that belly dancing was ``tref,'' a Yiddish word meaning
non-kosher.
   ``It's tref, tref ... so tref,'' he said. ``Belly-dancing is
against Judaism. It's against the Jewish ethic. Belly-dancing
inflames the feelings in your body. Belly-dancing exposes them.''
   He argued that not only food in restaurants should be considered
when issuing kosher certificates, but said he expected trouble from
the court on the issue.
   ``I think the Supreme Court ... wants to concentrate the powers
of the rabbinate in the kitchen,'' he said. ``Outside of the kitchen
they don't want us to do anything.''
   Amihud Bahat, the spokesman for the Ministry of Religion, said
kashrut certificates were not issued conditionally, but that the
ministry frowns on the idea of belly-dancing in kosher hotels.
   ``If you come from abroad looking for a kosher hotel in
Jerusalem, you'd expect a little Yiddishkite (Jewishness), not a
yeshiva, but certainly not belly-dancing either,'' Bahat said.
   ``It's very natural that public places in Jerusalem have a little
different atmosphere from New York. Jerusalem shouldn't look like
Times Square.''
   The belly-dancing issue is just another collision between
Orthodox rabbis and non-observant Israeli Jews. The rabbinate has
made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to halt movies and sports
event on the Sabbath.
   Ziv-Goldman said rabbinical authorities also have used the
kashrut certification in the past to pressure for compliance with
religious norms.
   ``The problem does not start or end with belly-dancing in
Jerusalem,'' she said.
   The court has not yet set a date for a hearing on the case.
   Ms. Raskin said she was pursing the case as a matter of principle
as well as to regain her main source of income.
   ``I love to dance and I love my work and when I can't do that, it
makes me sorry,'' she said.
   Next motion.

   Federal officials are investigating an
auditor's report that $1 million is missing from a rent-subsidy
account in the Denver regional office of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified HUD officials and other
sources, said in its Thursday editions that case had been turned
over to the Justice Department.
   Mary Brunette, an aide to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, told the
newspaper that auditors from HUD's Office of Finance and Accounting
will travel to Colorado next week to review cash accounts at the
office, one of about 80 branch offices nationwide that are being
audited.
   She was also quoted as saying that HUD has hired an outside
consultant _ Washington, D.C.-based Irving Burton Associates _ to
review accounts inside HUD headquarters.
   An accountant was suspended without pay from the office on June
4, she said.
   HUD had earlier disclosed that nationwide audits would begin
Thursday to reconcile property sales accounts at HUD's regional
offices.
   A HUD spokesman Wednesday night said he had no comment on the
Denver case report. But Jack Flynn said, ``The secretary has ordered
reviews of these offices across the country for that kind of thing.''

<TEXT>
   Leave it to the amorous French. Who else would take
a dilapidated 19th-century villa and turn it into a museum dedicated
to preserving and promoting the ``Romantic life of yesteryear?''
   Tourists take note. Not far from the hurly-burly of Pigalle and
the Moulin Rouge is a haven of peace and quiet tucked away at the
end of an unpaved, ivy-covered alley.
   The Museum of Romantic Life is a small, two-story house known as
the Renan-Scheffer, after its most famous inhabitants, the painter
Ary Scheffer and historian Ernest Renand, who later married
Scheffer's niece.
   Restored to its former grace and charm, the villa recreates the
life and times of the writers, artists and musicians who gathered
there for his fashionable Friday soirees.
   Among them were the 19th-century novelist George Sand, a feminist
before her time who flaunted her upper-class background by dressing
as a man and writing about her love affairs with the poet Alfred de
Musset and composer Frederic Chopin.
   They lived in what is known today as the Saint-Georges quarter, a
residential neighborhood bordered by Pigalle to the north and the
Saint-Lazare train station to the south, flooded with young artists
who shunned the opulence and snobbery of Saint Germain on the Left
Bank.
   Post-Impressionist painters Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard
shared a studio down the street; Victor Hugo met Juliette Drouet,
the love of his life, on the rue de Clichy nearby. Charles
Baudelaire, Alexandre Dumas and Edouard Manet were neighbors, too,
while Vincent Van Gogh later would work in his brother's art gallery
on the same street.
   Located at 16 rue Chaptal, the house was built in 1830 with the
accent on calm and quiet, in keeping with the Romantic belief in a
return to nature. It was classified as a historical monument in the
1950s to ensure it would survive a development boom that saw the
demise of many unprotected landmarks.
   The house is flanked by gardens, but also has its own glassed-in
winter garden, with a fountain gushing over jasmine and moss-covered
rocks.
   The museum opened to the public last weekend with a exhibit on
George Sand. Born Amandine Aurore Lucie Dupin, she created a scandal
by going around in male attire and wearing a dagger at her hip,
changing her name and carrying on love affairs about which she later
wrote.
   The ground floor features a re-creation of her living room,
decorated with family portraits and etchings and with magnificent
period furniture which has been in her family for generations. Also
displayed are dozens of knickknacks, jewelry, letters _ and even
snippets of her baby curls framed under glass.
   On show until Oct. 1 is a special exhibition of three versions of
``Le Larmoyeur,'' (The Weeper), one of Scheffer's best-known
paintings.
   Though he has fallen into near-total oblivion, Scheffer was one
of the 19th century's most successful artists. Scorned by the
critics but adored by the public, he even gave drawing lessons to
King Louis Philippe's children.
   ``Scheffer is very interesting to art historians because he is at
the crossroads of all the tendencies and influences of the 19th
century,'' said museum curator Anne-Marie Brem. ``But the critics
gave him a bad time when he began to paint like Delacroix or like
Ingres, and lost his own style.''
   Mrs. Brem said the museum can handle about 100 people
comfortably, but that every effort was made to keep it ``homey and
intimate, as if somebody still lived there.''

<HEAD>Inmates Serving Life Sentences Get College Diplomas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Quentin Prison issued the first
college diplomas in its 137-history, as three inmates serving life
sentences slipped black robes over their prison denims.
   In a short commencement Wednesday attended by some 40 relatives
and friends, degrees were awarded to prison inmates Elmo Chattman,
31, Dennis Jones, 45, and Lonnie Morris, 38.
   Chattman received a bachelor of arts degree in creative writing
and journalism, Jones earned a degree in business administration and
Morris got his in communications.
   ``These are the greatest students I've ever had in my life,''
said Roger Freeburg, a professor at Antioch University in San
Francisco, which began the special degree program for inmates in
1985. Antioch is closing at the end of June. ``They just did
something extraordinary, these three. I just can't believe they did
it.''
   For Chattman, his diploma represented the culmination of college
studies that began 14 years ago _ on the outside _ before his
conviction for murder in Vicente and arrival at San Quentin in 1979.
   A published poet, short story writer and editor of the San
Quentin News, Chattman wrote a 65-page thesis on capital punishment
while he was doing time in ``the hole'' because authorities
suspected him of drug trafficking inside the prison.
   He said his isolated incarceration may have improved the paper's
quality: ``There's a lot of solitude in there.''
   Jones, charged with conspiracy to commit murder in 1976, worked
on his degree on Saturdays inside his 4{-by-11-foot cell.
   ``It may take a month to do what you can in a day,'' he said. ``I
just believe your success in life is directly proportional to the
problems you have been able to overcome.''

   Two armed soldiers stand guard at the entrance to
a hotel in central Beijing, watching as soldiers come and go from
the lobby once bustling with travelers.
   ``Troops are staying here. You don't want to stay here,'' a man
whispers to a foreigner asking if Chongwenmen Hotel is open.
   At a nearby restaurant, employees in the darkened building
shrugged Wednesday when asked if the business will reopen.
   ``We don't have any foreigners,'' one man said as he and two
other employees sat idle at Maxim's restaurant. ``We need foreign
people to make money. Now, we have no work.''
   The violent crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement 11 days
ago has prompted an exodus of foreigners, bringing tourism to a near
standstill.
   While some city residents try to get on with their lives, workers
at shops, markets and hotels seek to overcome the potentially grave
economic prospects facing businesses that depend on tourism.
   A vendor of Mao Tse-tung memorabilia responds bitterly when asked
about business:
   ``Americans don't like us. They say China is bad. They don't like
(senior Chinese leader) Deng Xiaoping so they leave China and others
leave, too.
   ``Now, no one buys my things, so I sleep or listen to the radio.''
   Before the turmoil, the market near a foreign diplomatic compound
was filled with people browsing or trying to strike a deal. Now,
hopeful vendors carefully display silk items, hand-carved
knickknacks and Western-style clothing. But the market appears
abandoned.
   Another man responds to a question about business by spreading
his arms and making a noise to imitate a plane taking off.
   Managers at some tourist hotels gave dire reports.
   ``We could not go on like this for very long,'' said Rudolph
Staudinger, manager of the two-year-old Shangrila Hotel. ``We have
not paid back the bank loan.''
   He said staff members will be paid for staying home while
business is slow.
   But he added, ``Some of our regular customers, some who left
because of safety concerns, are planning to return. Those are good
signs.''
   He said 100 of the hotel's 780 rooms were occupied Tuesday, many
by businessmen who travel to China frequently.
   At Jianguo Hotel, now one of the journalist enclaves in the city,
manager Peter Hierzi said he may offer free breakfast, tea,
cocktails and newspapers to attract guests. For now, the hotel is
encouraging employees to take vacation time.
   When demonstrators flooded Tiananmen Square last month, the
landmark Beijing Hotel offered prime views of the square and the
Forbidden City, the former seat of emperors that is a prime tourist
attraction.
   Now the grand building is nearly deserted. Cafes and souvenir
shops are dark. From time to time the telephone rings, but goes
unanswered.
   The Friendship Store has reopened. But customers are scarce at
China's largest shopping center for overseas tourists.
   Store manager Li Hengmao told the official Xinhua news agency
that the store sold $28,000 worth of goods when it reopened Monday.
The store did a daily turnover of $405,000 this time last year, the
report said.
   Two tourists from Holland were buying a suitcase to carry things
they had bought. They planned to leave China today, cutting their
trip short on advice from the Dutch Embassy.
   ``There's so much we wanted to see, but it isn't comfortable here
so we're leaving,'' one said. They planned a quick trip to the
Forbidden City.
   China Daily newspaper reported 3,688 visitors _ one-tenth the
usual number _toured the Forbidden City when it opened Tuesday for
the first time since martial law was imposed May 20.
   Buses and subways also have started operating again in Beijing,
and the state tourist service is encouraging foreign travelers to
continue seeing China.
   But few offices of the China International Travel Service are
open. Previously, it offered tours to some of the most famous sites
around Beijing, including the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and the
Summer Palace. Now, travelers are given directions and told to take
a taxi.
   In some ways, the tourist drought could make travel in China
easier for those still interested in seeing the vast country.
   At Beijing railway station on Wednesday, a foreigner could buy a
ticket for a train leaving for Shanghai later in the day.
Previously, a three- to five-day wait was common.
   A China International Travel Service employee told an inquiring
foreigner:
   ``I think that if you were at the Great Wall today, you would
have it all to yourself. Anywhere you go there would be no crowds.
It is a good time to see China.''

<HEAD>Committee Head Now Backing Pentagon Weapons Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says he is now trying to push through the Pentagon's
reduced weapons-buying budget without change, according to an
interview report.
   In Thursday editions of The Washington Post, Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., was quoted as saying that members normally would re-arrange
the weapons requests to add or boost spending for weapons bought in
home districts.
   ``This time it's different,'' Aspin was quoted as saying.
   Some members have told him of plans to propose restoration of
$6.8 billion in weapons spending to the $10 billion in proposed cuts
announced by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in April, Aspin said.
   But he said he knew of only about $1 billion in possible cuts
that could be made to offset those additions without cutting other
weapons programs.
   ``Somebody else is going to have to lose what they already have
in the budget if these add-ons are approved,'' Aspin was quoted as
saying.
   In an atmosphere clouded by scandals among the Democratic
leadership, many committee members ``think a vote for the Cheney
budget will look like a good-government vote,'' Aspin was quoted as
saying.
   Among cuts proposed by Cheney are the dropping of the Marine
Corps' planned V-22 Osprey vertical take-off troop-carrying
aircraft, cancellation of an attack submarine, deferral of some
purchases of the Navy's F-A-18 fighter, cancellation of the F-15E
Air Force fighter and the F-14D Navy fighter.
   Next Tueday, a subcommittee of Aspin's committee is to start
consideration of the procurement section of the Pentagon's $300
billion authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Titan 4 Rocket Gives Pentagon Ability to Launch Heavy Military Payloads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the successful maiden launch of
the huge Titan 4, the Pentagon has an unmanned rocket that lessens
its reliance on the space shuttle for lifting heavy military
satellites into orbit.
   Nearly 40 of those satellites have languished in storage for lack
of a launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded more than
three years ago.
   The 20-story-tall Titan 4 made a spectacular debut Wednesday when
it thundered off its launch pad with a 2{-ton satellite designed to
provide instant alert of a missile attack on the United States.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, the $180 million
satellite, a $45 million payload booster stage and other costs
raising the total to close to $500 billion.
   The Air Force reported the big rocket had successfully passed its
maiden test and placed its military satellite in orbit.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because it's
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster which will give
us assured access to space for our critical heavy national security
payloads,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman.
   The Air Force reported only that the rocket launched Wednesday
carried a classified payload which it would not identify for
national security reasons.
   However, it has been widely reported by knowledgeable observers
and by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and other
publications that the rocket carried an advanced missile warning
satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   Defense Department officials decided after Challenger exploded in
1986 that they were relying too much on the manned shuttle for
critical military payloads. So they more than doubled the number of
Titan 4s on order and authorized development of two new smaller
rockets, the Delta 2 and Atlas 2, for medium-size payloads.
   The Delta 2 made its debut in February, carrying a navigation
satellite into orbit. It repeated with another navigation payload
Saturday.
   The shuttle flights resumed last September, and the second flight
in December deployed one of the backlogged heavy military
satellites. Two more are scheduled on shuttle flights later this
year, with at least one more Titan 4 launch planned.
   The Pentagon hopes eventually to shift most of the payloads to
the Titan 4, which can boost 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150
to 300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to so-called
stationary orbits 23,000 miles up.
   The U.S. once had a much more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5 that
launched Apollo astronauts to the moon. It could hoist 240,000
pounds into orbit. The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's
largest rocket, has nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   Both the Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are studying designs fpr a large advanced booster
capable of lifting between 150,000 and 200,000 pounds to orbit.
   The space shuttle can deliver 55,000 pounds.

<HEAD>This GOP Fund-Raising Letter Went to the Wrong Person</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even Ronald Reagan's personal check for $120
couldn't persuade Sen. Howard Metzenbaum to help the Republican
Party rid the Senate of ``ultra-liberal Democrats.''
   Metzenbaum, the junior senator from Ohio, is one of those
Democrats who doesn't think liberal is a dirty word.
   So when he received a GOP fund-raising letter urging him to match
Reagan's donation, his reply to Sen. Don Nickles, chairman of the
Republican National Senatorial Committee, was brief.
   ``Though I cannot send you any money for your efforts, I can send
you my heartfelt wish that you achieve the same success in 1990 that
the GOP earned in the 1988 Senate race in Ohio,'' he wrote.
   Metzenbaum also suggested he could teach the party's national
chairman a thing or two about campaigning.
   ``I could demonstrate to Lee Atwater that Republican smear
tactics end up tarring the GOP and irritating the voters,'' he
wrote. ``I have copies of some GOP commercials from 1988 that
perfectly illustrate my point.''
   Metzenbaum attributes part of his re-election landslide last year
to voter backlash after his Republican opponent, Cleveland Mayor
George Voinovich, accused him of being soft on child pornography.
   Metzenbaum, who was rated by Americans for Democratic Action at
80 percent for votes on liberal issues in 1988, was one of thousands
of people who were sent the solicitation, RNSC communications
director Wendy DeMocker said.
   The glossy fund-raising packet seeks charter members of a
``Republican Presidential Task Force'' whose mission is ``to elect a
Republican majority to the U.S. Senate in 1990.''
   It tells recipients they were chosen by a committee that included
President Bush and every Republican in the U.S. Senate, and urges
them to send donations because ``some of the most outspoken,
combative, extremist anti-Bush Senate Democrats are up for
re-election. And the more of these ultra-liberal Senate Democrats we
can replace in the 1990 elections, the better.''
   That the appeal was wasted on a Democrat who describes himself as
a proud liberal didn't seem to trouble DeMocker. ``I am sure it
happens when the Democrats do mailings, too,'' she said.
   She said the mass mailing went both to regular GOP targets and
names from other lists purchased commercially. ``The mailing list is
very, very large,'' she said. ``Thousands and thousands of people
got this particular mailing.''
   Meanwhile, a liberal Democratic congressman from Connecticut was
sent a fancy embossed card identifying him as a ``sustaining
member'' of the GOP and asking for a donation to the Republican
National Committee, headed by Atwater.
   The mailing read: ``Yes, Lee! You can count on me to work with
you to make the Bush administration a success for America through my
support of the Republican National Committee.''
   Rep. Bruce Morrison said he declined to make the suggested $25,
$50 or $100 donation, but may keep the card ``if it's true what they
say, `Membership has its privileges.'''

   With their new leadership team in place, House
Democrats are searching for a legislative agenda to unify their
party and provide a counterpoint to the policies of President Bush.
   ``This is our time to make a difference and move this House away
from the partisan wrangling and the rancor and the bitterness, and
to reassert an agenda for progress for this country,'' said Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, elected Wednesday as his party's new
No. 2 House leadership official.
   But despite Gephardt's campaign-style speech to his colleagues,
the new leadership team still has much work to do to assume the
reins of power in the House and convert stylistic ability into
substance.
   While Bush has made much of advocating bipartisan cooperation
with Congress, his political team has shown a heightened
aggressiveness in attacking Democrats. The House GOP minority,
meanwhile, has grown increasingly combative.
   ``I think you still are going to have tremendous problems between
the two parties here, for at least another year,'' said Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., the former whip who is leaving Congress after
today because of questions about his personal finances.
   The new speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, is an
acknowledged statesman and thinker, but some Democrats wonder
whether he will have the toughness to define and fight for the
party's agenda.
   And after a season of fighting ethics charges, Democrats remain
nervous about whether Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania _ the new
No. 3 party official as majority whip _ will ultimately be damaged
by an FBI probe into alleged payroll padding in his office.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said members of the new leadership
team ``are extremely adept at selling the message to the American
people _ our challenge now is to come up with the message.''
   The new leaders will work this summer on developing a party
legislative agenda, then announce sometime this fall ``where we're
going,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who lost the whip's race
to Gray but will remain in his post as chief deputy whip.
   Foley already has said ethics and campaign reform will be his top
priority. Democrats also are eager to pass a clean air bill and
complete work on a savings and loan rescue package, and are
promising to pass another bill raising the minimum wage after
President Bush's veto this week.
   Gephardt, in his acceptance speech before the House Democratic
caucus after defeating Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., for majority leader,
echoed some of the themes of his 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``America is beginning to be in a state of decline, and we as
Democrats have to lead,'' he said, ``even though there is not a
crisis, even though the presidency is held by a different party and
even though getting our consensus together on the Democratic side is
always difficult to do.''
   He acknowledged that with the White House and Congress in the
hands of different parties, ``we seem near to a political standoff.
Our country is in peril but few realize it. ... If (Bush) refuses to
lead, we must.''
   Gray, meeting with reporters after his first-ballot victory, held
up his fist and suggested he wanted to bring Democrats together into
that kind of solid, forceful block.
   The midterm leadership turnover came because of the resignation
of Jim Wright of Texas as speaker and of Coelho as whip. Foley moved
up last week to be speaker, leaving the No. 2 and No. 3 leadership
posts vacant.
   The election of Gray as whip opened up the post of caucus
chairman, which is to be filled at a caucus meeting next week. Rep.
Steny Hoyer, D-Md., currently the vice chairman, is considered the
front-runner for that post.

<TEXT>
   The civilian-led government has denied
charges by Amnesty International that it has allowed the army and
police to operate death squads.
   The London-based international human rights organization released
a report Wednesday that says 222 people have disappeared in
political violence since President Vinicio Cerezo took office in
1986.
   Cerezo, a centrist Christian Democrat who took over as the first
civilian leader in 20 years, took power with a pledge to end
political killings, intimidation, and other abuses of previous
military governments.
   The Foreign Ministry, responding to Amnesty's charges, said
Wednesday: ``There are no death squads as Amnesty International so
irresponsibly declares.''
   ``The government of Guatemala respects human rights,'' it said.
   However, the ministry added, ``The fact that isolated cases of
violence against human rights exist does not constitute a
governmental policy. They are occasional acts that still escape the
control of the state's reorganized security forces.''
   In its report, Amnesty said such violence had at first decreased
under Cerezo's government. However, it went on, ``Although the
number of abuses decreased initially, there has been a resurgence of
abductions, `disappearances' and extra-judicial executions in the
past 18 months.''
   Amnesty said people viewed by the government as left-wing _
peasants, union members, clergy, academics and students _ have been
singled out by death squads.
   Amnesty International spokeswoman Tracey Ulltveit-Moe said Cerezo
himself was apparently not directly involved in the death squads.
But she said his government had failed to investigate the killings.

   Capt. Jacquelyn S. Parker
is the Air Force's first woman test pilot, and the 28-year-old flier
has her eye on the space shuttle.
   ``The work and the flying was as hard and challenging as everyone
said it would be,'' Parker said. ``Now, I'm looking forward to
putting it to use testing airplanes and hopefully, someday, fly the
space shuttle.''
   Parker was one of 25 navigators, pilots and flight engineers who
graduated last weekend from the Air Force Test Pilot School, which
runs a rigorous program to train personnel to test experimental,
research and prototype aircraft.
   The test pilot school is located about 60 miles north of Los
Angeles at the Mojave Desert air base where the space shuttle lands
and where Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1
in 1947.
   Parker, of Wilmington, Del., goes to the 4950th Test Group,
Aeronautical Systems Division, based at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Ohio.
   ``You can erase my name, along with many others who were in the
class, and there's very little difference in our backgrounds,'' she
said. ``Women now are getting the experience and education they need
to get into the more exciting programs and I believe we have a lot
to offer these programs.''
   Parker served as a C-141 transport aircraft pilot with the 76th
Military Airlift Squadron based at Charleston Air Force Base, S.C.,
before entering the Test Pilot School in July 1988.
   She entered the Air Force in 1980 after working at NASA's Johnson

<TEXT>
   About 600 of the 770,000 active duty members of the
U.S. Army will become infected with the AIDS virus each year,
according to a study.
   The estimate was based on repeated AIDS testing of soldiers,
which found that 77 of every 100,000 acquires the AIDS virus
annually.
   When testing for AIDS infection became available in 1985, the
military checked recruits as well as all of its current personnel.
It found that 150 of every 100,000 soldiers already were infected.
   They said the rate of new infection was higher than expected. The
work suggests ``that the overall prevalence of infection in the Army
should approximately double in two to three years, even if infected
applicants are excluded from service in line with current policy.''
   The report was written by Dr. John G. McNeil and colleagues from
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study found 78 new infections per 100,000 soldiers among
white men, 122 among black men and 194 among Hispanic men. Among
women, there were 27 new infection for every 100,000 whites and 75
for blacks. No new infections were found among female Hispanic
soldiers.

<HEAD>Federal AIDS Spending Exceeds Heart Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is spending more to control
AIDS than to conquer heart disease, which kills 20 times more
Americans, but some critics contend it is still not enough.
   A report today, described as the first to sum up the entire
federal AIDS effort, found the government this year is spending $2.2
billion on the epidemic, with more than half going to research and
prevention. The figure will grow to $4.3 billion in 1992.
   ``We were surprised to learn the extent to which so many
different individuals and agencies were involved in AIDS efforts,''
said Dr. William Winkenwerder, who directed the analysis. ``The
breadth of the effort of the federal government was greater than we
thought it might be.''
   In an editorial published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Dr. David E. Rogers of Cornell Medical College
in New York said he believes the nation is still spending ``vastly
too little'' on AIDS.
   Rogers said he would like to see more spending on AIDS education
for people at high risk of the disease, especially teen-agers, as
well as disaster relief for cities most severely hit by the
epidemic. He also recommended even higher spending for basic
research on the AIDS virus and new treatments and vaccines.
   Dr. Sheldon Wolff of Tufts Medical School, co-chairman of a
National Academy of Sciences review of federal AIDS efforts three
years ago, agreed that the government should put more money into
AIDS.
   ``We are not doing enough,'' he said. ``Are we doing more? Hell
yes. The federal government has responded, but belatedly, to AIDS.''
   The analysis shows that AIDS spending now makes up nearly 10
percent of the total budget of the U.S. Public Health Service, which
oversees government medical research, and by 1992 it will account
for nearly 13 percent.
   Spending on AIDS research, education and prevention is comparable
to other diseases that ``will continue to have a far greater effect
on U.S. mortality,'' the report concluded.
   Winkenwerder, former AIDS coordinator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, is now a physician with the Southeast
Permanente Medical Group in Atlanta.
   His report found that between 1982, when the epidemic began, and
the end of this year, the federal government will have spent $5.5
million on illness caused by the AIDS virus.
   This year alone, federal AIDS spending will total $2.2 billion,
or about 1 percent of all federal health expenditures. Of this,
about $1.3 billion will be spent for research and prevention. The
disease will take about 35,000 lives.
   By comparison, the government will spend $1.5 billion on research
and prevention of cancer, which will kill 500,000 people this year,
and $1 billion for heart disease, which will kill 777,000 Americans.
   For diabetes, which will kill about as many people as AIDS, the
government will spend $267 million. Federal support for such major
afflictions as stroke, high blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease
will also be far behind AIDS spending.
   However, Winkenwerder noted that the number of AIDS deaths will
increase rapidly as people now infected get sick, while deaths from
other major diseases will remain stable.
   Among other findings:
   _AIDS programs funded this year by the AIDS budget of the Public
Health Service will require 1,700 full-time employees.
   _AIDS-related work now takes up about 40 percent of the budgets
of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute
on Drug Abuse.
   _Government-funded Medicaid programs cover about 40 percent of
all patients with AIDS.
   _Last year, federal, state and private sources spent $4.4 billion
on AIDS, and 35 percent, or $1.5 billion, came from the federal
government alone. This compares with 30 percent for health care in
general.

<TEXT>
   A list of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
assets show he owned a house and a plot of land in the religious
center of Qom, but no furniture.
   The list, compiled in 1981 and made public on Wednesday, was a
constitutional requirement for senior Iranian officials, their wives
and children, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The revolutionary patriarch said he and two brothers inherited
the plot of land in the village of Khomeini, 225 miles south of
Tehran, whose name he adopted.
   ``As I am informed by my brother, the rent for my share (of the
land) is 4,000 rials (about $54) per annum, which is not being
paid,'' he wrote, according to the official news agency report.
   Khomeini's daughter, Zahra Mostavi, said her father donated his
share of the land to the homeless, said the IRNA report, which was
monitored in Cyprus.
   ``I have no furniture. The few items of furniture in Qom and
Tehran belong to my wife,'' Khomeini wrote.
   Khomeini died June 3 of a heart attack at age 86, 11 days after
undergoing surgery to halt internal bleeding. His wife is in her
mid-70s.
   He lived and taught in Qom for years before he was exiled in 1964
for his opposition to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   After he was swept to power by the 1979 Islamic revolution,
Khomeini lived in a modest house in north Tehran's Jamaran suburb.
   He noted in the list of assets that ``there are two carpets which
do not belong to me or my heirs, which must be given to the needy.''
   Although most of Khomeini's books were confiscated when he was
sent into exile, he listed ``several books which have been given by
gifts by writers during the time I have been in Tehran ... I don't
know their approximate value, but it isn't much.''
   Khomeini said funds from religious endowments and taxes that were
kept at his house or in bank accounts under his name ``do not belong
to me and my heirs have no right to them.''

<TEXT>
   The federal judge who presided over the trial
of Oliver L. North cleared the way for the former National Security
Council aide to be sentenced next week for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   In his ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
refused to grant a defense request for either a new trial or
judgments of acquittal on all three counts against North.
   A U.S. District Court jury convicted North on May 4 of aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress, mutilation of official
documents and acceptance of an illegal gratuity from arms dealer
Richard V. Secord.
   The 45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel, scheduled for
sentencing June 23, faces a possible 10-year prison term and fines
up to $750,000.
   North was found guilty of aiding and abetting the obstruction of
Congress by helping prepare a false chronlogy of arms sales to Iran
in 1985 and by destroying documents sought by congressional
investigators.
   North was acquitted him of nine other charges, including
allegations that he lied to investigators about his involvement in
U.S.-Iran arms sales and providing secret aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Gesell ruled in his 13-page opinion there was sufficient proof
for the jury to reach its verdict. Gesell also rejected the notion
that North could not be found guilty of helping obstruct Congress
since the lawmakers' inquiry succeeded in unearthing facts about the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The criminality of legality of alleged obstructive conduct
cannot turn on its success, as the effort to obstruct an inquiry is
an evil the statute seeks to address,'' Gesell said.
   Gesell also rejected North's arguments prosecutors had failed to
prove that North's illegal acceptance of the installation of a
$13,800 security system outside his suburban Virginia home had
occurred in Washington, where the case was brought.
   Gesell said ``the agreement to accept the security system
developed in a continuous course of conduct, some of which took
place in Washington.''
   The judge rejected arguments that the jury should have been
instructed to consider that North accepted the security system under
duress because no government agency would offer his family
protection in the face of terrorist threats, including one from Abu
Nidal.
   ``Long after North heard of the threat by Abu Nidal, he backdated
letters indicating he was to pay for the system and he concealed the
fact that Secord had actually paid (security consultant Glenn)
Robinette for the system,'' the judge said.
   Gesell also said North could have paid for the fence with funds
``he admittedly had,'' a reference to North's testimony he kept
$15,000 in cash in a locked box in his closet.
   Gesell rejected North's request for a hearing to determine if the
verdict was tainted by an April 22 letter NBC News delivered to the
homes of jurors seeking interviews after they decided the case.
   He also denied another motion, which had been made under seal,
seeking a closed hearing on alleged conduct of a juror. The contents
of the motion were not released.

   A Canadian teacher has been unable to return home
from a remote Chinese town because her university employers have
refused to return her passport, a Department of External Affairs
spokesman says.
   Marilyn Eisenstat, an English teacher from Toronto, is the only
Canadian whose passport has been taken away to prevent her
departure, spokesman Robert Peck said Wednesday.
   Her relatives say they were told the South West China Teachers
University in the Sichuan province town of Beibei has refused to
return her passport because her contract with the university does
not expire for several more weeks.
   Canadian officials say they are trying to arrange her safe return
home.
   External Affairs Minister Joe Clark announced Monday that
Ambassador Earl Drake was being recalled temporarily from China to
protest the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in that
country.
   He said the decision was made after about 550 Canadians had
departed and officials believed that everyone who wanted to leave
had done so.
   ``We were shocked,'' Ernie Weinrib, Ms. Eisenstat's
brother-in-law, said Wednesday. ``It seemed to us irresponsible to
pull the ambassador out when there are still people who need help.''
   Peck said Ms. Eisenstat's problem has been given ``priority No.
1'' by the Canadian Embassy in Beijing.
   He said about 100 Canadians remain in China and not all want to
leave.

<HEAD>Congress `a Brick Wall' on Aid to Cambodian Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is pursuing covert aid
to the non-communist forces opposing the Vietnamese-backed
government in Cambodia despite unlikely odds on Capitol Hill of
receiving funds.
   A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday the State Department realized it was
engaged in ``more than an uphill battle.''
   ``It's doubtful we'll get the increased assistance,'' the
official said.
   Members of Congress say they fear military aid, covert or
otherwise, could wind up in the hands of the communist Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge, also fighting the Phnom Penh government, gained
notoriety for the brutality of its regime from 1975 to 1978 when
more than 1 million people died under Pol Pot.
   The Soviet-armed Vietnamese forces invaded in 1978 and ousted the
Khmer Rouge, setting up the current government.
   The administration is seeking the covert aid to strengthen the
hand of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, in
negotiations with the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, the
official said.
   The official said the administration's program to gain covert
assistance was dealt a setback after it was reported last month in
The New York Times. The Times reported the administration would seek
congressional backing for a covert program to supply rifles and
other weapons to the non-communist resistance.
   The administration had hoped to have more time to make its case,
the official said.
   Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
has been visiting with members from the various committees that
would have to approve such aid this past week, ``but he's been
running into a brick wall,'' the official said.
   The official said there were not very many ``open minds'' on the
subject.
   In any case, the department intends to continue to make its case.
   ``We still have to make the effort,'' the official said.
   On Monday, Kimmit testified before a Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee that the administration believes strengthening the
non-communist resistance will help achieve a peaceful political
solution and prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge.
   Kimmit did not mention the covert aid plan in his appearance, but
he said the administration would continue to make clear that
continued support for the non-communists would depend upon their
distancing themselves from the Khmer Rouge.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who is the author of a House bill to
authorize overt military aid, testified that U.S. aid should be
increased from the $7 million now planned to as much as $30 million.
   Solarz argued that the aid would strengthen the hand of the
non-communist resistance and help prevent another holocaust.
   In Geneva on Wednesday, two senior State Department officials met
with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to discuss the
refugee problem in Indochina, and the Cambodian situation was also
discussed.
   Robert Funseth, the senior deputy assistant secretary for refugee
affairs and deputy assistant secretary David Lambertson, ``stressed
that there must be a negotiated comprehensive settlement'' of the
conflict and that Sinahouk must play ``an essential role in any
transition government that is agreed upon,'' the State Department
said in a written statement.

<HEAD>Study: Switching to Low-Nicotine Cigarettes Doesn't Stop Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AIDS, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who smoke low-nicotine cigarettes face about
four times the usual risk of heart attacks, just like those who use
ordinary brands, a study released today concludes.
   ``For smokers who wish to reduce their risk, switching to
low-yield brands is a poor alternative to quitting,'' the
researchers wrote.
   Earlier studies have already reached similar conclusions in men.
   The latest work found that women who smoke cigarettes that are
low in nicotine and carbon monoxide face about four times the usual
risk of suffering first-time non-fatal heart attacks. This is the
same as the increased risk in those who use ordinary brands.
   The study was based on a comparison of 910 women with first heart
attacks and 2,375 other hospital patients. It was conducted by Dr.
Julie R. Palmer of Boston University Medical School's Sloan
Epidemiology Unit and published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The study notes that women are more likely than men to smoke
light cigarettes, and ads for these brands imply that that they are
safe _ or at least safer.
   ``The present large study offers substantial evidence against
this claim,'' they wrote.
   Nicotine and carbon monoxide increase the risk of heart attacks.
The researchers suggest that smokers who switch to low-yield brands
manage to take in just as much of these substances by taking more
puffs or inhaling more deeply.
   The low-yield cigarettes also contain less tar. Other studies
have shown that this makes them less likely to cause cancer,
although users' cancer risk is still considerably higher than
non-smokers'.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of San
Francisco General Hospital said the movement toward the low-tar and
nicotine cigarettes has been worthwhile.
   But he added, ``The benefits for any person of smoking low-yield
rather than high-yield cigarettes are small, and the benefits of
quitting are great.''

<HEAD>Panel Agrees To Fund Collider At $200 Million In Fiscal 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins expects a $1
billion contribution from Japan to help build the atom-smashing
superconducting super collider, according to a House subcommittee
chairman.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on energy and water development, says White House
officials assured him foreign countries would provide substantial
contributions toward the $4.4 billion particle accelerator to be
built in Texas.
   Bevill, D-Ala., earlier this year had insisted he would not agree
to fund the super collider in fiscal 1990 unless the Energy
Department secured firm commitments from foreign countries willing
to share the cost.
   But on Wednesday, Bevill agreed to legislation that has no
requirements for any level of foreign participation and sets aside
$200 million for the collider in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Under the bill, $110 would go to initial construction, which
could begin after Oct. 1, and $90 million would be for research and
development.
   Bevill's committee voted on the bill after he attended a meeting
at the White House with President Bush, Watkins, Rep. John Myers of
Indiana, the panel's ranking Republican, White House chief of staff
John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman.
   ``Watkins assured all of us that they're going to have a good bit
of participation,'' Bevill said late Wednesday.
   In addition to Japan, other potential contributors mentioned by
Watkins were Italy and India, Bevill said. India is the only foreign
nation to sign a commitment to share costs of the particle
accelerator and has promised to contribute $50 million.
   Although some Texas legislators want to press for spending $250
million, the level sought by Bush, Bevill warned that winning final
congressional approval of even $200 million may be tough.
   ``It's a good project, but the cost of it concerns me a great
deal,'' Bevill said. ``It will be up to Congress to make the final
decision.''
   The full committee could vote on the appropriation as early as
next week, said Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas. The Senate Appropriations
Committee, however, has yet to vote on the collider and ``we've got
a battle in the Senate to win,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gingrich Uses Ethics Case to Raise Money for State Republican Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich used the ethics
case against ex-Speaker Jim Wright as a Republican fund-raising
tool, concluding requests for popular pressure on the House ethics
committee with appeals for contributions.
   Gingrich made the fund-raising appeals as general chairman of
GOPAC, a tax-paying organization that tries to elect Republicans to
state legislatures and sometimes aids Republicans running for local
office.
   Wright's ethics were made a fund-raising theme because ``Wright
was hot and Newt was so tied to that,'' Kay Riddle, GOPAC's
executive director, said Wednesday.
   The first of four letters was mailed just days after the Georgia
Republican filed his formal complaint on May 26, 1988, and the last
was two weeks ago _ dated a day after Wright announced he would
resign as speaker rather than fight ethics committee charges of 69
rules violations.
   The last letter declared Wright was ``not the only corrupt
Democrat.''
   The first three Gingrich letters raised just short of $50,000,
GOPAC said, but no totals were available from the fourth appeal _
issued two weeks ago and sent to 45,000 recipients, more than twice
the total of previous mailings.
   GOPAC said it raised $1.9 million overall last year, up $500,000
from 1987.
   In his initial letter June 1, 1988, Gingrich informed 18,910
people on GOPAC's active contributor list he had just filed a
complaint against Wright, and he asked people to send enclosed post
cards to ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., demanding
an investigation.
   ``Second, will you make a contribution of $50 to GOPAC today?''
he said.
   By June 30, 1988, Gingrich was able to thank 1,500 respondents to
the earlier mailing for ``helping me force'' the ethics panel to
probe Wright.
   But Gingrich told the givers that a situation had arisen that
``could result in the investigation ... turning into a charade and a
whitewash.''
   A Democratic committee member, Vic Fazio of California, had
co-hosted a $500-a-plate luncheon in which the ``drawing card ...
was none other than Jim Wright,'' Gingrich wrote. ``In plain
political terms, Rep. Fazio now `owes' the speaker,'' Gingrich said,
and asked contributors to mail postcards urging Fazio to remove
himself from the investigation.
   ``And if you possibly can, would you make a special campaign
contribution to GOPAC today?'' Gingrich asked.
   Fazio, who did not bow out of the investigation, received 12
postcards from the mailing, according to spokeswoman Laura Nichols.
She said Wright was in Sacramento for a previously scheduled
appearance and added to his schedule the Democratic fund-raiser with
Fazio.
   On April 19, two days after the ethics committee publicly
released its report detailing 69 charges against Wright, Gingrich
thanked 19,822 on GOPAC's active donor list for their past help, but
said more money was needed.
   Some 45,000 prospective contributors received a letter from
Gingrich on June 1, just after Wright announced he would leave the
House.
   ``But he's not the only corrupt Democrat,'' Gingrich wrote.
   The letter also included a request for funds.
   None of the allegations Gingrich cited in his ethics complaint
were included in the ethics panel's statement of charges against
Wright.
   In April, Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed an ethics complaint
against Gingrich, alleging he may have violated a rule against
keeping gifts of $100 or more from anyone with a direct interest in
legislation. The allegation concerned a 22-investor partnership that
promoted a book of which Gingrich was coauthor.
   Gingrich has denied wrongdoing, and the ethics panel has made no
announcement about an investigation.

   A bill approved by a House Ways and Means
subcommittee would allow older Americans to earn more wages before
losing a portion of their Social Security pensions.
   The latest in a long series of efforts to reduce the Social
Security earnings limitation would permit those between the ages of
65 and 69 to make almost $1,100 more next year before they have to
give up part of their pensions.
   The increase was added to a package of amendments that includes
one to strip the Social Security Administration away from the
Department of Health and Human Services. The administration would be
set up as an independent agency governed by a three-member board
appointed by the president. The board would appoint an executive
director to operate the agency.
   The package now goes to the full Ways and Means Committee, where
there is considerable support for raising the earnings limitation.
The Senate went on record in favor of a higher limit earlier this
year.
   The limitation is as old as the Social Security system. When the
pension program was enacted in 1935, it included a prohibition
against paying benefits to any person still earning wages. Before
the first pension check was paid, that was modified to bar a benefit
in any month in which a person earned $15 or more in wages.
   The limit has been amended several times in recent years, as more
people declined to take themselves entirely out of the work force at
the traditional retirement age of 65.
   Under present law, a person aged 65 through 69 may earn up to
$8,880 without losing a part of the Social Security pension.
Beneficiaries under 65 may earn $6,480 without penalty. The limits
are increased each year to reflect inflation. For each $2 earned
above those limits, the pension is reduced by $1.
   Starting in 1990, the penalty will be $1 for each $3 above the
limit.
   Under the subcommittee's bill, the limitation for those between
65 and 69 would rise next year to about $9,720 and the following
year to about $10,440. The final figures would be determined by the
full Ways and Means Committee.
   The limitation for those under 65 is scheduled under present law
to rise next year to $6,840. It would be frozen at that level for
another year instead of being allowed to rise to adjust for
inflation, and the money saved would help finance the higher 65-69
limitation.
   The amendment raising the earnings limit was a joint effort of
Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind., chairman of the Ways and Means
subcommittee, and Rep. Hank Brown of Colorado, the senior Republican.

<HEAD>Korean Memorial Design Aims to Make Visitors Feel `at One' With Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The design for a $6 million Korean War
veterans' memorial unveiled at the White House contemplates visitors
walking among statues of 38 weary-looking soldiers and becoming ``at
one with the figures.''
   The memorial, to be erected on the stretch of parkland known as
the Washington Mall, will be built near the Lincoln and Vietnam
Veterans memorials when the $6 million it costs is raised.
   President Bush, guest of honor at a Flag Day ceremony Wednesday
in the White House Rose Garden to unveil a model of the planned
memorial, said: ``Until recently, the Korean War was not formally
remembered. ... It's time to remember.''
   Also on hand were a dozen celebrated Korean War veterans and
advice columnist Abigail Van Buren _ ``Dear Abby'' to her readers _
who has helped raise funds for the project.
   Bush credited the columnist with ``almost unbelievably'' raising
$330,000 from readers by writing about plans for the memorial.
   Some 5.7 million Americans served in Korea during the 1950-53
conflict. More than 54,000 were killed.
   Four Pennsylvania State University architects won a contest to
design the privately financed memorial, which they said combines
sculpture, architecture and landscape design.
   About half the money for the memorial has been raised thus far,
and it is uncertain when it will be constructed. Contributors
include the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American subsidiary of
Hyundai Motor Co.
   Statues in the memorial depict 38 soldiers heading unevenly down
a 120-yard, tree-lined path toward the American flag. Some of the
soldiers face in different directions, and two appear to help an
injured buddy. A red line is to be drawn down the middle of the
``platoon'' for visitors to follow.
   A statement released by the architects said: ``The visitor is an
observer, in the act of commemoration, and is simultaneously at one
with the figures, the 39th presence.''
   There will be 38 statues because the war began after the
Soviet-trained North Korean army crossed the 38th parallel into
South Korea. Fighting ended with a truce on July 27, 1953.
   The soldiers depicted will include blacks and members of various
ethnic groups. No women are included but female nurses and other
support personnel are to be featured on etchings on a wall that is
part of the memorial.
   Bush said the Korean War exemplified the American policy of
containing communist aggression. That policy, he said, ``created the
conditions for the tide toward democracy now changing and uplifting
our globe.''

   China's expulsion of two journalists mirrors similar actions by
the Chinese government in 1987 as well as moves by other countries
in the past three years.
   Associated Press correspondent John Pomfret and Voice of America
bureau chief Alan Pessin on Wednesday were given three days to leave
China for their coverage in the wake of the June 3-4 government
crackdown on student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   The Chinese government has said nearly 300 died, mostly soldiers.
But Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence have said the toll
could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   A reporter for Britain's Independent Television News was deported
from Shanghai last week for covering demonstrations while on a
tourist visa.
   And the VOA came under criticism for its broadcasts on
pro-democracy student demonstrations in December 1986 and January
1987 that reportedly led to the ouster of Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang.
   Beijing claimed the VOA was seeking to ``add fuel to the fire and
create chaos in China.'' In August, China refused to grant
accreditation to VOA reporter Max Ruston.
   Two reporters, American Lawrence MacDonald of the French news
agency Agence France-Presse and Shuitsu Henmi of Japan's Kyodo News
Service, were deported from China in early 1987 in connection with
their reporting.
   In October 1987, 14 foreign reporters from the United States,
Britain, Australia, West Germany and Italy were expelled while
covering pro-independence demonstrations in the Tibetan capital,
Lhasa.
   The government claimed they failed to obtain the necessary
permission to work there. China has controlled Tibet since its
troops moved into the remote Himalayan region in 1950.
   Beijing deported correspondent John Burns of The New York Times
in July 1986 after six days of questioning on suspicion of espionage
for a motorcycle trip he took through a restricted area of central
China.
   Some countries control the news by barring journalists entirely,
and China is far from the only one to deport reporters it considers
undesirable. Among the expulsions of journalists over the last three
years:
   _ In April 1988, NBC correspondent Rick Davis was ordered to
leave Jordan for reporting it has a ``tightly controlled and at
times even repressive society.'' The action came four days after
neighboring Israel suspended the press credentials of NBC
correspondent Martin Fletcher and reporter Glenn Frankel of The
Washington Post, claiming they violated censorship rules.
   _ Three journalists were among 11 Britons ordered out of the
Soviet Union last month on spying allegations in response to
Britain's expulsion of 11 Soviets also accused of espionage.
   _ In September 1986, the Soviets expelled U.S. News and World
Report correspondent Nicholas Daniloff after he had been arrested by
the KGB and accused of spying. Washington alleged he was seized in
retaliation for the FBI's arrest on spying charges of Gennadi
Zakharov, a Soviet working at the United Nations. Daniloff was
released one day before Zakharov was given probation and told to
leave the United States.
   _ After the first of two coups hit the South Pacific island
nation of Fiji in May 1987, Australian Broadcast Corp. reporter
Travor Watson was expelled. More than 20 other foreign reporters
were detained for several hours for their reports of the ethnic
unrest.
   _ In February 1987, reporter Gerald Seib of The Wall Street
Journal was expelled from Iran after being arrested on espionage
charges. He had been among a group of foreign reporters invited into
the country to file reports on ``Iranian victories'' in the war
against Iraq.
   _ Malaysia banned the Asian edition of The Wall Street Journal in
September 1986 and expelled two of its reporters _ Americans John
Berthelsen and Raphael Pura _ for the newspaper's reporting on a
government-owned bank that officials claimed could erode public
confidence in the government.
   _ Also in September 1986, Havana-based Robert Powell of Reuters
and Noel Lorthiosis of Agence France-Presse were expelled from Cuba
for violating the ``most elemental norms of professional ethics and
respect for the dignity of Cuba.'' The action apparently was because
of stories the reporters wrote based on interviews with an official
of an independent human rights group in Cuba.
   _ In July 1986, Washington Times reporter Glenn Garvin and
free-lance photographer Sue Mullin were expelled from Nicaragua,
which claimed they had CIA links.

   Until last year's failed presidential bid,
Richard Gephardt had not lost an election _ and even then he was
able to retain his House seat.
   Now he's the Democrats' majority leader, elected to the No. 2
leadership post Wednesday as a ``white knight'' for a party seeking
to leave behind a full year of controversy over ethics allegations.
   ``This man always lands on his feet,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., a friend and supporter. ``A lot of politicians don't wear
well. He wears better with every meeting.''
   From the time he cut his political teeth in the backroom ward
meetings of St. Louis politics, Gephardt has carried the reputation
as a rising political star.
   Now in his 12th year in Congress, Gephardt suddenly is second
only to Speaker Thomas S. Foley in the House.
   His presidential campaign, despite its lack of success, clearly
helped.
   ``He has weathered the scrutiny and investigation of the
presidential campaign and comes to this with very excellent
credentials in terms of honesty and integrity,'' said Rep. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill.
   ``We are anxious to put this whole firestorm of ethics
controversy to rest and we believe that Dick Gephardt as majority
leader will not raise any of those questions.''
   Colleagues say the job of majority leader fits Gephardt like a
hand-tailored suit. They praise his ability to forge legislative
compromises and to position himself at the leading edge of national
issues such as tax reform and trade.
   ``He is generationally attractive, popular and an issues man,''
says Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. ``Dick knows the House and cares
about issues, and I think that's what a majority leader has to do.''
   Says Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who for years rode to Capitol Hill
each morning with Gephardt:
   ``He can disagree and not be disagreeable.''
   Republicans aren't so sure.
   ``Gephardt is pretty well liked on the Republican side of the
aisle, but he is certainly more of a hardball player than Tom Foley
is,'' says Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., referring to the newly
elected House speaker.
   Edwards complains of Gephardt's attacks on Republicans during the
presidential campaign and his push in the House for a retaliatory
trade policy.
   ``He tends to be a polarizer rather than a conciliator between
the parties,'' says Edwards.
   During the presidential campaign, Gephardt also drew sharp
criticism from other Democratic candidates who questioned his
convictions and switches on social and defense issues.
   In his early House years, Gephardt had sponsored anti-abortion
constitutional amendments and supported legislation to ban busing of
school children to achieve desegreation. He no longer supports
either, saying the changes were a natural evolution of his views. He
continues to oppose abortion, but considers an amendment impractical.
   Indeed, Gephardt has advocated a practical rather than
ideological approach to legislating.
   ``I believe an idea is very important but it doesn't mean
anything unless you can make it happen and bring it into reality,''
he says. ``In order to do that, sometimes you have to be willing to
change where you started.''
   Gephardt won election to the House in 1976 after serving as a St.
Louis alderman. He seemed to move on the fast track almost from the
day he arrived on Capitol Hill.
   Taken under the wing of then-Rep. Richard Bolling of Missouri,
Gephardt won a seat as a freshman on the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee.
   He got there through a formula he has repeated throughout his
career: Eagerly volunteering for assignments, winning the respect of
his elders through hard work and eventually moving into the inner
circle and replacing the old guard.
   In 1981, Gephardt was tapped as the prime-time TV spokesman for a
Democratic alternative to President Reagan's tax cut plan. Starting
in 1985, Gephardt served as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
He retained the the No. 4 ranking leadership post through the end of
1988.
   ``I really tried to be a caucus chairman that brought all the
different parts of the party together, all of the different regions,
and that's the kind of leader I'll try to be,'' says Gephardt.
   ``We only have strength here if we're actually able to weld
together a consensus on some very difficult issues nd that means
you've got to have input from every corner and part of the party.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, chairman of the Budget Committee, says one of
Gephardt's finest accomplishments came in 1985 in negotiating a
compromise on the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting measure. It was
Gephardt, Panetta says, who helped Democrats fashion a way to soften
the blow of large cuts in social spending.
   Says Synar, ```He listens well. He is very cautious and doesn't
move in big strokes. And he tests little steps to see if everybody
is still on board. But I think the key to it is listening.''
   He says he was seriously considering another presidential run in
1992 but altered course when ethics controversies forced the
resignation of Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Majority Whip Tony
Coelho of California.
   Suddenly, Gephardt became an obvious choice.

   Tony Coelho says he's leaving the House today
at peace with the fact that his career as a rising star in the
Democratic Party is over, swallowed up by a furor over his personal
finances.
   He compares his fall from power to the time years ago, when he
lost his hope for the priesthood because of epilepsy. In both cases,
he says, he was misunderstood.
   Misunderstood as a child, he says, when his epilepsy was
considered the work of demons; misunderstood in the House, where he
was best known as a political strategist and the Democrats'
fund-raiser extraordinaire.
   ``I don't want the party just to win. I want the party to win for
certain reasons,'' he said in an interview, citing Democratic
policies including support for the handicapped.
   ``A lot of people dwell on the one side of me but don't pay
attention to the other side,'' he said in an interview. ``And a
couple of weeks ago, they found out about the other side.''
   Because he had improperly reported the financing of an investment
in junk bonds, he was about to become a prime Republican target in
their ethics attack.
   He quit, he said, because he couldn't stomach the possibility of
giving the Republicans that advantage.
   ``So my ultimate political trick was to take away from them the
very thing they wanted most, to use me,'' he said.
   Coelho said his resignation will permit him to continue his work
on behalf of fellow epileptics, without being an issue himself. He
said he already has raised money to open 14 job centers for
epileptics with hopes for 25 by the end of the year.
   He's sponsoring programs to educate school children about
epilepsy, and raising money for a center at UCLA to study the
treatment of afflicted children.
   When he was young, he was considered possessed by demons and his
family tried religious rituals to expunge them. Now, he feels much
has been done _ some with his help _ to get epileptics accepted as
people with handicaps who can contribute to society.
   ``I've gotten a lot of people to go public'' with their epilepsy,
he said. ``Why would they go public with some controversial figure
who's coming into town? Why would they want to meet with him? They
wouldn't.''
   Coelho said staying would have been unfair to his family, unfair
to the Democrats and unfair to those he has tried to help.
   So he's holding a bash to mark his departure today, which is his
47th birthday.
   Coelho says he hasn't yet chosen a new career, and will spend the
next three months making some speeches for money and mulling his
future. Perhaps business, perhaps at a university, but probably
never again running for office, he said.
   It's not the first time he's had to change careers.
   ``I was right on the verge of becoming a priest when that was
taken away from me. That's when I found out about my epilepsy. ...
All of a sudden at the last moment it was taken away.
   ``But the good lord took me from that narrow pursuit to a
different type of ministry.''
   In a 24-year career in the House, first as a staffer and then the
last decade as a congressman, Coelho had a missionary zeal that made
him a Democrat's Democrat and a politician's politician.
   The Californian was only a freshman when he was chosen to rebuild
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the wake of the
Reagan landslide of 1980. He led a strong rebound. Promoted to
majority whip in 1986, he was the chief Democratic vote-counter for
the 100th Congress, one of the most productive in history.
   When it became clear this spring that House Speaker Jim Wright
would fall and Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley would take his place,
Coelho was a sure bet to become leader.
   But then came the news reports about a junk bond deal. A
California savings and loan official carried him for a month while
he arranged the financing _ half from the official's own bank.
   Coelho defends the deal, but he says his failure to report the
$50,000 loan was something he couldn't defend, not without enduring
two years of press prodding and public inquiry like that which cost
Wright his career.
   ``Once I made the mistake, I couldn't stay here,'' he said. ``You
can't be front liner in the major leagues in politics with
mistakes.''

<HEAD>Ambassador to Germany Confirmed as Chief Arms Negotiator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rejecting ``security risk'' allegations, the
Senate gave Ambassador Richard R. Burt an 89-10 vote of confidence,
confirming him as the chief U.S. nuclear-arms negotiatior at renewed
talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva.
   By its action on Wednesday the Senate rejected allegations by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that Burt, currently the U.S. ambassador
to West Germany, cannot be trusted with classified information.
   Burt will preside over nuclear and space negotiations with the
Soviets will be chief negotiator at the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks.
   In an hour-long debate, Helms, who has delayed action on the
nomination for weeks, contended that Burt has established ``a
pattern of negligence and repeated violations raising serious
questions of whether Mr. Burt is fit to hold a security clearance.''
   But other senators, including Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, expressed confidence Burt would perform with distinction at
a time of promising but challenging arms control negotiations
Between Washington and Moscow.
   ``We have said in the past that it was wrong to pursue
allegations with no evidence to substantiate them,'' said Dole.
``Rick Burt has undergone three intensive background investigations
and has been confirmed twice by the Senate for other positions.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., said ``none, none of the
allegations, accusations, have risen to the level'' of being taken
seriously. Biden is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee which voted 16-2 to recommend Burt be confirmed.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said he voted in the past against
confirming Burt for other government positions but would support him
now because he has ``proven himself.''
   Burt, a national security correspondent for The New York Times in
the late 1970s, served as director of the State Department's Bureau
of Political Affairs from 1981 to 1983 and as assistant secretary of
state for European and Canadian Affairs from 1983 to 1985 when
President Reagan nomminated him to be U.S. ambassador to Bonn.
   Helms alleged that Burt had printed allegedly classified
information while working as a reporter; that he had, as an
unmarried government official, dated a reporter who allegedly
printed classified information; that he had once lost a briefcase
allegedly containing classified information; and that security
officers had discovered a film canister containing marijuana inside
the U.S. embassy in Bonn during Burt's ambassadorship.
   Helms said Burt has said the cannister must have been left by a
guest but said that was an excuse anyone found with drugs might use.
   Joining Helms in voting against the nomination were Sens. William
L. Armstrong, R-Colo.; David Boren, D-Okla; Quentin N. Burdick,
D-N.D.; Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Connie
Mack, R-Fla.; James A. McClure, R-Idaho; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; and
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

   People who say the Democrats focus on the
interests of liberals, blacks and Northeasterners can point to the
election Wednesday of Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania as
House whip. He is all three.
   But Gray, 47, also is a consensus-builder. When he chaired the
House Budget Committee he worked closely with Republicans and
conservative Democrats to develop a spending plan that attacked the
worrisome deficit and, as he put it, guaranteed ``long-term economic
growth and compassion.''
   When Gray was preparing to move into the Budget job, his
predecessor, conservative Rep. Jim Jones, D-Okla., praised his
intelligence, temperament and ability ``to say no to an awful lot of
special interests.''
   At the same time, Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., who regularly
battled Gray on budget issues, praised him as ``a first-rate guy''
and said ``everybody will be able to work with him.''
   The Budget Committee chairmanship gave Gray national visibility
and made him easily the most powerful black member of Congress.
After his term as chairman, which was marked by great success in
rounding up Democratic votes for the spending plans he developed,
Gray moved up the leadership ladder to chair the caucus of all House
Democrats.
   Gray's elevation to party whip, the No. 3 leadership job, was
made possible by the resignation of Rep. Tony Coelho of California.
At a closed caucus, Gray defeated Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan
and Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas.
   In winning election Wednesday, Gray had to overcome fears of some
members that he himself might be tainted by reports of an FBI
investigation of whether he had a no-work, no-show employee on his
payroll. Gray steadfastly denied anything improper, and the Justice
Department said Monday that he was not a target of the probe.
   Gray, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., has represented
Pennsylvania's 2nd District, a Philadelphia area that ``Politics in
America'' describes as black, poor and Democratic, since Jan. 3,
1979. Like his father and grandfather before him, he is chief
minister of Bright Hope Baptist Church. Gray is married and has
three children.
   He has had no trouble winning re-election every two years,
although his reputation as a consensus seeker prompted a 1982
Democratic primary challenge from a militant state senator, who
accused Gray of selling out. A third-party challenger in 1986
leveled similar charges in 1986 but Gray won with 98.6 percent of
the vote.
   Gray is the No. 2 Democrat on the House Appropriations
subcommittee on transportation, a prime assignment for one who is
always looking for increased funding for mass transit.
   An earlier assignment to the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
when he was a freshman congressman, opened the way for Gray to win
approval for an African development program. He uses his
Appropriations position to foster increased aid for Africa.
   Beyond his work on the Budget Committee, his biggest victory came
in 1986 when the House overrode then-President Reagan's veto and
approved legislation imposing sanctions against South Africa because
of that nation's racial policies. The final bill was a compromise
between Gray's position and a tougher version written by Rep. Ron
Dellums, D-Calif.
   Gray is not always predictable. In 1984, he faced no serious
re-election challenge and spent his time campaigning for colleagues.
One beneficiary: Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., who was on the verge of
losing her seat to a black challenger.

<HEAD>Trucking Industry Group Supports Random Drug Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national trucking industry group says it
wants to help develop a random drug testing program that will cover
the nation's 5 million truck drivers.
   The American Trucking Associations' executive committee voted
Wednesday to support random testing even though some of its members
have reservations about the federal program that takes effect at the
end of the year.
   Associations president Thomas J. Donohue said truck operators
would continue to work for improvements in the random testing rules
drawn up by the Transportation Department while supporting random
testing as a sound idea.
   ``We have always believed that the public has a right to expect
that the driver of an 80,000-pound truck is drug free,'' Donohue
told a news conference.
   The organization, which represents scores of trucking
organizations across the country, previously supported random
roadside drug testing demonstration projects set up by the
government in four states but had not endorsed the federal random
drug testing program announced last November.
   The federal program would require random checks of 4 million
transportation workers, including airline workers, railroaders and
interstate truckers.
   Donohue said the new position accepts industry-wide random drug
testing as long as it applies to all truckers. He said it should
include large trucking companies as well as small operators,
self-employed truckers and for-hire operators and should cover both
intrastate and interstate trucking.
   Random testing faces opposition from labor groups, and several
court challenges are pending. A federal judge in San Francisco last
December blocked the proposed random testing program for truckers
after a suit by truck drivers.
   The Supreme Court has yet to rule on random testing, although it
has rejected some challenges to other mandatory drug testing.
   Donohue said his group did plan to oppose the idea that truck
operators should have to check out laboratories that analyze the
tests. That, he said, is a government responsiblity.
   Donohue also said the industry should not be required to pay for
rehabilitation of all employees who test positive.
   ``We are thoughtful about our employees,'' he said, ``but we
cannot be saddled with mandatory rehabilitation programs that would
cost tens of billions of dollars a year.''

<HEAD>Legislation Aims at Curbing Physician Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overhaul of the Medicare system aimed at
curbing the cost of providing health care to the elderly by putting
an unprecedented ceiling on physician reimbursements has cleared a
House subcommittee.
   The proposal also would establish a national, uniform fee
structure for physicians in the $90 billion program and protect its
33 million beneficiaries by limiting the amount doctors can charge
beyond the Medicare-approved fees.
   The physician payment plan is being considered as part of the
fiscal 1990 Medicare budget, though it would not contribute to
savings until future years.
   ``This is a broad new program and it will take three to five
years to see it fully implemented,'' said Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, which
approved the bill by an 8-3 vote Wednesday.
   The action is being proposed in response to an alarming rate of
growth in Medicare payments to doctors.
   Last year, Medicare outlays to physicians totaled $24.5 billion.
This figure has been growing at more than 15 percent annually for
much of the decade, more than double the rate of inflation. Total
Medicare spending on doctors and hospitals is expected to be up
about 13 percent this year.
   The plan is being watched carefully for possible application by
private insurance companies, which are also trying to find a way to
cut health-care costs.
   Under the package, Congress would set an ``expenditure target''
beginning in fiscal 1991 that would limit payments for physician
services for Medicare beneficiaries based on total nationwide
spending the previous year. Adjustments would be made for inflation
and increases in the number of beneficiaries.
   If the target is exceeded one year, the Congress could order
cutbacks the next year. The initial target probably would be in the
range of 10 percent to 12 percent, Stark said.
   Limiting increases in physician fees paid by Medicare has not
controlled spending in the program because doctors have responded by
performing more services, according to subcommittee staff and health
officials.
   ``There's no way under the present system to control volume'' of
physician services, Stark said.
   The American Medical Association strongly opposes spending
targets as a form of health-care rationing. The group says the
government should instead spend money to evaluate procedures being
performed by physicians and develop practice guidelines they should
follow.
   The AMA, however, supports the proposed redistribution of
payments among physicians, though many within its ranks whose fees
now are reimbursed at a higher rate than other medical services
object to the plan.
   Payments to physicians would continue to increase overall, but
fees for primary care doctors _ including family practitioners and
internists _ would go up more. Fees reimbursed for medical
specialties like surgeons and ophthalmologists would go up less.
   The proposal, advanced by the Physician Payment Review Commission
set up by Congress to advise on Medicare spending for doctors, would
make the current reimbursement system more fair, but more
importantly for consumers the changes would encourage family
practice and internal physicians to continue taking Medicare
patients, said Lauren LeRoy, an official at the commission.
   The Bush administration has indicated its support for the
package, and the Senate Finance Committee has been looking at
similar reforms. The Medicare program has not seen any major changes
in the way physicians are reimbursed since it was enacted in 1965.

<TEXT>
   The drive to restore the death penalty in New
York may come down to a lawmaker's battle with cancer that caused
him to ``meditate on life.''
   This week, veteran state Sen. James Donovan, a Republican who
consistently has supported the death penalty, told his hometown
newspaper that he was ``personally opposed'' to capital punishment.
   ``I would like to see the state stop financing the killing of the
unborn as well as those convicted of capital crimes,'' Donovan, the
leader for more than a decade of the unsuccessful battle to block
New York's Medicaid financing of abortions, told the Utica
Observer-Dispatch.
   Noting that he once got to sit in New York's electric chair,
unused since 1963, the senator said it was ``barbaric, inhumane and
almost uncivilized.''
   What Donovan, 65, wouldn't tell the newspaper was how he might
vote on Gov. Mario Cuomo's latest veto of the death penalty
legislation.
   In the last four years, the Republican-controlled state Senate
has voted to override Cuomo's death penalty vetoes. But the the
Democratic-controlled Assembly has lacked the votes to override.
   This year, however, death penalty advocates in the 150-member
Assembly said they were within one vote of getting the 100 needed
for an override. And the political pressure began to build on a few
Democrats from New York City.
   Then, things began to unravel in the Senate.
   First, state Sen. Israel Ruiz, a death penalty supporter, was
convicted in February of a federal felony for lying on a bank loan
application and was thrown out of the Senate. He was considered the
42nd vote in a Senate where only 41 votes are needed for a veto
override.
   Then last month, Martin Markowitz, another death penalty
supporter in the Senate, said he wouldn't rule out a change of heart.
   ``The day we're dead is the day our positions are written in
stone,'' said Markowitz.
   Even so, Markowitz said he still expected to vote in favor of the
override.
   Now come Donovan's statements. He underwent surgery in early May
for colon cancer. His subsequent absence from the Senate has forced
a delay for weeks of an override attempt. He said he'll be back at
work Monday.
   Thirty-seven states have enacted capital punishment laws since a
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing executions to resume.
   Dale Volker, the chief Senate sponsor of the death penalty bill,
now says he's unsure when he'll schedule the override attempt.
   ``It's like a soap opera,'' said Volker.

<HEAD>Quayle Says Central American Presidents Solid on Nicaragua, Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle says he accomplished
his goal during his Central America trip of solidifying regional
opposition to Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega and the
electoral plans of Nicaragua's leftist government.
   ``We are together and it's a very strong unity that we have,''
Quayle said Wednesday as he flew back to Washington from Costa Rica.
   The vice president said he cemented a consensus among the
presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that
Noriega must step down from power in Panama and that the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua must change its plans for next year's
elections to ensure free and fair balloting.
   The Central American presidents, excluding Nicaragua, and the
United States are backing a mediating effort by the Organization of
American States to remove Noriega. But if that fails, Quayle said
there is a `clear understanding'' that ``other options'' will be
considered.
   Quayle was not specific, but an official traveling with him who
spoke on condition of anonymity said Quayle was told Costa Rica was
considering breaking diplomatic relations with Panama and imposing
trade sanctions if Noriega does not go.
   ``It was very important for them to see my deep convictions about
Nicaragua and Panama,'' Quayle said of his one-on-one meetings with
the four presidents. ``I was very emphatic, very direct and I left
no wiggle room about where the United States was coming from.''
   U.S. officials have learned that Cuba was willing to accept
Noriega should he leave Panama, and that Spain, Venezuela and the
Dominican Republic would also take him, said one official with the
Quayle party.
   One enticement for Noriega to step down might be the assurance of
going to a country that has no extradition treaty with the United
States, such as Cuba, so he could avoid having to face drug
trafficking charges brought by a federal grand jury in Florida.
President Bush has said he would not consider dropping the
indictment.
   On the question of Nicaragua, U.S. skepticism of the ruling
Sandinistas' commitment to fair and free elections was echoed
Wednesday by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   At a news conference with Quayle in San Jose, Arias, a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, said the rules developed for the election next
February have presented a situation in which ``having a fair and
open election ... is not possible.''
   The Sandinistas ``will have to meet at least a minimum standard
so as to be considered legitimate,'' in their election, he said,
noting especially that the media access rules are unfair to
opposition candidates.
   Quayle said that in his talks throughout the region he found
agreement that Nicaragua is violating terms of the regional
Esquipulas II peace accord signed in 1987 by the five Central
American presidents.

<HEAD>Northeast Democrats Offer Coastal Protection Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders on coastal environment
issues have introduced a legislative package to curb ocean pollution
and create a $200 million fund financed in part by polluters.
   ``The oceans are nature's greatest gift to humankind, but they
are not inexhaustible. If we treat them as a dump, they will, in
time, become a dump,'' said Rep. Gerry E. Studds, a Cape Cod
Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee on fisheries and the
environment.
   Lawmakers said Wednesday drifting medical waste that closed East
Coast beaches last summer, coupled with the Exxon oil tanker spill
earlier this year off the Alaskan coast, has made the time ripe for
congressional action.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, Sen. John F.
Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Studds introduced
four separate measures Wednesday designed to fight coastal
pollution. Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the top Republican
on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, joined the
Democrats at a news conference introducing the bills.

   The festive ``first strike'' ceremony in a flag-bedecked tent on

   Donna Pope, director of the Mint, said the plaza was a fitting

   A $300 million rural development program has
unanimously passed the Senate Agriculture Committee after Senate
leaders agreed to wait until next month to act on drought relief.
   Democrats had charged that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole's
insistence on passing drought aid for winter farmers before
approving a rural development bill could have scuttled both measures.
   But committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and the panel's
ranking Republican, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, said they had
agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act July
19 on drought relief.
   The rural development package would provide $100 million in
federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as $200 million
to improve education, health services, communications and utilities

<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee have reached a compromise to make it easier for
President Bush to keep military aid flowing to El Salvador.
   At the same time, the committee adopted a provision Wednesday
linking aid for El Salvador to ending civil rights abuses and a
demonstrated ``respect for democracy and the rule of law.''
   The legislation, part of a larger foreign aid bill, would make
available up to $85 million a year in foreign military financing to
the Salvadoran government over the next two years.
   The compromise ended one of the last roadblocks preventing action
on the bill authorizing $11.5 billion in foreign aid over the next
two fiscal years. If Congress approves the bill, the money still
would have to be appropriated by separate legislation.
   The committee was expected to approve the measure Thursday,
paving the way for action by the full House.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Southern Baptist conventioneers
marched down the heart of the nation's gambling capital, leaving
behind thousands of religious pamphlets with bewildered tourists and
gamblers.
   ``We need to show Las Vegas that we are not scared of them and we
do not condemn them and we need to show them the love of God,'' said
Ken Render of Lexington, Ky., as he handed out New Testaments on a
thoroughfare known simply as The Strip on Wednesday afternoon.
   But some tourists didn't know quite what to make of the sight of
more than 200 Baptist evangelists following a man carrying a 12-foot
wooden cross marching to Caesars Palace in 109-degree heat.
   ``I don't think they belong in Las Vegas,'' said Darlene Klemm of
Oconomowoc, Wis.
   The two-mile march came after an evangelism conference at the
midpoint of a three-day meeting of Southern Baptists, the nation's
largest Protestant denomination with 14.8 million members. The
convention ends today.
   Led by Arthur Blessitt, a Hollywood evangelist who has carried
his 80-pound cross in more than 100 countries in the past 20 years,
the evangelists left religious literature in casinos, in the place
of circulars advertising sex shows, and in the hands of tourists,
gamblers and casino workers.
   R.B. Chandler, pastor of Mount Airy Baptist Church in Mount Airy,
Md., said: ``The point-blank truth is that everybody in the world is
either born-again or not. The idea is hopefully we would catch some
people and tell them about Christ for the first time.''
   Chris Martin of Park Forest, Ill., got off a bus in an
unscheduled stop when he saw the Baptists in front of Caesars Palace.
   As they prayed, ``I accepted the Lord,'' he said. But he has no
plans to give up gambling.
   Other tourists viewed the evangelistic effort differently.
   Dwain Moore said he thought the Baptists were ``a little too
pushy'' in trying to evangelize people on the street.
   His wife, Thelma, said they were both Methodists and, ``The
Methodists don't do it.''
   Las Vegas residents took the evangelism in stride.
   ``These are nice, decent people, but I don't think they can do
much to change our image, or our thinking,'' said Don Capaldi, a cab
driver.
   Larry Williams, a bellman at the Stardust, said: ``What can it
hurt to give people the Bible? We need to go back to more of that.''
   Some Southern Baptists have already revised their opinion of the
city.
   ``Sodom and Gomorrah'' was how George Mitchell, the mayor of a
small town in western Colorado and a member of the Rifle Southern
Baptist Church, envisioned Las Vegas.
   But he said Wednesday he discovered average residents of the
gambling mecca ``seem to be all God-fearing people.''
   The decision to meet in Las Vegas evoked controversy within the
Protestant denomination, with some Southern Baptists deciding to
stay home rather than bring their families to a city built on vices
they condemn.
   Leaders of the denomination, which has pledged to evangelize the
world by the turn of the century, responded by emphasizing
evangelism at this year's convention.
   A series of revivals were held last week in Las Vegas churches,
and nearly 2,000 people participated in a door-to-door
evangelization effort that led to more than 350 confessions of
faith, church officials said.
   The denomination hopes to start 25 new churches in Nevada by
year's end. About 22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches are in
Nevada.
   Once one of the nation's fastest-growing churches, more than
doubling in size in the past quarter-century, the Southern Baptist
Convention has grown by barely more than half a percent each of the
last two years, the lowest growth rate since 1937.
   Blessitt said the community sometimes known as Sin City was not
being singled out: ``We're not picking on Las Vegas. We want it
known, `Look out world, we're going everywhere.'''

   A change that put teeth into the security
at the federal courthouse left one judge almost toothless.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. activated a metal
detector three times last week on his way to his courtroom and
chambers on the eighth floor of the courthouse.
   ``First I took everything from my pockets, and that didn't work.
Then I took my teeth out, and that didn't work,'' Wiseman said,
referring to his dental bridge. ``Finally, after taking my shoes
off, I made it through.''
   The judge said a metal arch support in his shoe apparently
triggered the device. He said the incident didn't bother him and
emphasized the importance of the tighter security.
   Indeed, Wiseman and other judges last month ordered that everyone
entering the sixth, seventh and eighth floors of the courthouse pass
through the metal detector. The order even applies to security and
law enforcement officers, who must leave any weapons at a security
post before entering the area.

   There were a few bugs in the preliminaries,
but officials at a local library deemed their first bug races a
success.
   About 35 preschoolers in the Loris Branch Library's summer
reading program were told to bring their own insects to compete in
the races Wednesday.
   Organizers had planned to put race numbers on the backs of the
bugs, but that idea didn't work out, what with the contestants
squirming so much.
   ``I'm not too favorable to spiders,'' race organizer and
children's service director Janet Barwick said as she tried to stick
a number on a tiny black spider brought in a baby food jar by a
small girl.
   ``Holding bugs is not my cup of tea,'' said librarian Frances
Prince, struggling to label a cricket while bugs hopped merrily
along the library checkout counter.
   Pandemonium continued when the youngsters moved outside, where
racing circles were drawn on the parking lot.
   ``Oh, sick,'' piped up one youngster when he saw that someone had
accidentally stepped on his cricket and smashed the creature flat.
   The insects that crossed a finish line first won ribbons for
their owners.
   ``I don't know,'' said Scott Sarvis, 4, when asked if he was
happy that his cricket won a blue ribbon. ``I thought I would get a
toy.''

   Folks in this Plains town say they're
nuttier than people in Georgia. And to prove the point, they plan to
bake the world's largest pecan pie.
   Rusty Milroy, co-chairman of the sixth annual Okmulgee Pecan
Festival today through Saturday, says the 40-foot diameter, 16{-ton
confection will eclipse a mark set last fall by Moultrie, Ga.
   Steel beams will support the huge pie pan north of the Council
House Square in downtown Okmulgee. Engineers were called in to make
sure the pie wouldn't crack the street.
   The gargantuan creation dwarfs Okmulgee's first giant-sized
effort, a 12-foot diameter, 3,200-pound pie in June 1986. That was
enough to gain entry in the Guinness Book of Records, but not for
long. Later that year, bakers in Albany, Ga., stirred up a pie that
weighed 600 pounds more.
   In June 1987, Okmulgee's pie pan was increased to 20.7 feet in
diameter and the pie weighed 6,300 pounds. Georgia bakers moved to
Moultrie and put together a 22-foot pie.
   Okmulgee's 24-foot, four-inch pie baked last June fell to a
Georgia pie that was 30 feet across.
   ``It is friendly competition and we are determined not to be
outdone,'' Milroy said.
   Bakers will use two new cement trucks, steam-cleaned for the
occasion, to mix ingredients for the pie before pouring it Friday
evening. The pie is expected to serve up to 22,000 people after
cooks finish the 10-hour baking process Saturday.

   A nuclear attack submarine used in filming
``The Hunt for Red October'' accidentally snagged a tugboat, sunk it
and left one crewman missing.
   The search for the night watchman aboard the tugboat Barcona was
suspended and no rescue effort was planned today after the sinking
10 miles from shore.
   The submarine, a San Diego-based vessel with a crew of 140,
wasn't damaged and it surfaced after the accident to assist in the
search for the missing sailor, the Navy said.
   Brian Bellanger, who was keeping watch at the time of the
accident early Wednesday, was missing Wednesday night at the end of
a search by four U.S. Coast Guard vessels, two helicopters and three
Navy craft, said Coast Guard Lt. Rick Button.
   There was no immediate word on how the accident occurred and
officials said both the tug and the sub apparently were in the
correct sea lanes.
   Dan Rodriguez and Mike Lynk escaped the tug and were rescued
unhurt after the 6,900-ton USS Houston snagged the Barcona's tow
line, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Elizabeth Neely.
   The two scrambled onto one of two empty barges being towed by the
Barcona, owned by Long Beach-based Connelly-Pacific Marine.
   Bellanger's brother, Glenn, said: ``The water just caved in the
boat, (which) just went straight down. Mike had the wires for the
microphone, the radio, all wrapped around his neck. He said he
didn't think Brian was going to make it.
   ``We're all hoping right now that he did, but there's 450 fathoms
of water out there and that's, that's pretty deep.''
   The sub was used this week in the Paramount film production ``The
Hunt for Red October,'' based on the best-selling novel about a
runaway Soviet sub by Tom Clancy. The film stars Sean Connery and
Sam Neill. No actors were on the submarine at the time of the 4:43
a.m. accident.
   A mock Soviet sub was tied near the Coast Guard headquarters on
Terminal Island where Rodriguez and Lynk were brought. The accident
was not related to the filming, said Navy Lt. Sonja Hedley.
   The missing sailor may have gone down with the 73-foot tug, which
sank southwest of Long Beach, officials said. Parsons said Rodriguez
and Lynk, the surviving crew members, were asleep when the submarine
struck the tow cable.
   ``The tug was pulled down very rapidly,'' said Cmdr. Don Parsons,
who was heading the Coast Guard investigation. ``Everything happened
so fast. It sank in less than a minute.
   ``The survivors didn't get out until the tug was already under
water. The last time anyone saw the missing man was when he was seen
going down to the engine room.''

<HEAD>Hot Dollar Prompts Stock Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
again today, triggering stock selling that sent the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index to its largest one-day loss this year.
   The dollar closed at 151.30 yen, up 3.25 yen from Wednesday's
148.05-yen close. It was the highest since Aug. 14, 1987, when the
dollar closed at 152.40.
   The dollar now has gained 10.65 yen since June 5, including a
4.90-yen jump on Monday.
   It opened today at 150.30 yen, its low for the day, and hit
151.35 yen at one point.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 489.90 points, or 1.47
percent, this year's largest one-day loss, and closed at 32,913.09.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told reporters the dollar's
surge resulted mainly from speculative buying by Japanese investors.
He said it had nothing to do with fundamental elements in the U.S.
and Japanese economies.
   ``We must stop (the dollar's further rise) by using every means
available,'' Murayama said, expressing concern that the higher
dollar could bring inflationary pressure in Japan.
   ``We'll take resolute measures under the established system of
cooperation with other countries,'' he said.
   But there is no immediate need to call a meeting of finance
chiefs of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries before the
group's scheduled summit in Paris in mid-July, Murayama said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly continued to sell dollars in efforts
to check the U.S. currency's rise, although the central bank does
not comment on its monetary activities.
   ``The BOJ intervention didn't work at all,'' said a Bank of Tokyo
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Everybody was just
buying as the dollar rose, trying to get on the bandwagon.''
   Traders said, however, there was some dollar-selling to take
profits.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank said, ``No matter how often the
Japanese side says the dollar should stay lower, it has small
influence because the United States ... doesn't make any moves.
Japanese market players have taken this as an indication that the
United States is allowing the dollar's surge for the moment.''
   He said investors were aggressively buying dollars, anticipating
improved U.S. trade figures for April, due to be announced later
today in Washington.
   On the stock exchange, Daiwa Securities dealer Kenji Ishizuka
said share prices were lower across the board, mainly because of the
dollar's surge against the yen.
   ``In addition to the major discouragement due to the yen's
plunge, many Japanese investors avoided buying while awaiting
release of the U.S. trade report later tonight,'' he said.
   Ishizuka said a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit would promote
a further rise by the dollar, which could further discourage stock
investment.
   Some investment trust companies intermittently bought cheaper
issues for profit-taking, but it could not stop the index's fall, he
said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, up from 450 million the previous day.

<HEAD>Genetic Evidence Can Be Flawed in Court, Standards Needed, Researcher
Says</HEAD>

   A powerful forensic tool called DNA
fingerprinting is unreliable in some court cases because no
standards exist for the technique, a genetics researcher says.
   ``There is an urgent need for the scientific community to agree
on clear guidelines for the procedures and standards needed to
ensure reliable DNA fingerprinting,'' said Eric Lander.
   DNA fingerprinting is used to determine whether biological
samples recovered from a crime, such as blood or semen, came from a
particular suspect. It also is used in paternity cases.
   Such evidence has been used in more than 80 criminal trials in
the United States, Lander said.
   The scientist said he did not know how common faulty conclusions
from DNA fingerprinting may be. He also had no recommendation on
whether to ban the evidence from courtrooms until scientists
establish standards for laboratory procedures and interpretation of
results.
   Lander said he is not questioning the inherent usefulness of DNA
fingerprinting, which he said ``offers tremendous potential as a
forensic tool.''
   Lander, of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Mass., is writing a report on forensic DNA testing for
the federal Office of Technology Assessment. He described his views
in today's issue of the British journal Nature, and in a telephone
interview.
   Spokesmen for DNA fingerprinting laboratories agreed with the
call for scientific standards, but said their labs already take
steps to ensure accuracy.
   ``We stand behind the results that we obtain,'' said Karen Wexler
of Lifecodes Corp., based in Valhalla, N.Y.
   DNA fingerprinting is based on the fact that no two people share
exactly the same genetic makeup, except for identical twins.
   To do an analysis, microscopic thread-like genetic material
called DNA is cut into segments, which then are made to arrange
themselves into characteristic patterns that resemble bar codes used
at supermarkets.
   The pattern from a blood or semen sample is compared to that of
DNA taken from a suspect. If the patterns match, the blood or semen
is considered to have come from the suspect.
   That conclusion includes an estimate of the likelihood that
matching patterns came from different people, a chance generally put
at one in many million.
   Lander testified for the defense in a recent New York case, in
which a commercial laboratory said a blood stain on the defendant's
watch matched the blood of a slain woman.
   But experts for the prosecution and defense later agreed that the
DNA evidence was not reliable enough to support that conclusion.
   The laboratory had not used its own announced standard for what
constitutes a match, Lander wrote. It also used an inappropriate
procedure for estimating the likelihood that the samples came from
two different people, he said.
   In a rape and slaying case, Lander said, a laboratory estimated
there was only a one-in-96-million chance that samples it matched
came from different people. But the calculation did not take into
account that the crime occurred in ``a small, inbred Texas town
founded by a handful of families,'' where the restricted genetic
variation would make it more likely that matching samples could come
from separate residents, Lander said.
   In another case, a laboratory said its analysis showed that a
woman was the mother of an abandoned baby. But the woman later gave
birth to a baby who had been conceived about one week before the
first baby was born.
   Lander said scientific standards should define what constitutes a
match and how to estimate the chance that matching samples came from
different people. They also should deal with other aspects of
laboratory procedure and analysis of results, he said.
   Establishing national standards ``would be very appropriate,''
said Wexler of Lifecodes.
   The DNA operation recently begun by the FBI probably will serve
as a model, she said.
   John Huss, vice president, marketing, of Cellmark Diagnostics in
Germantown, Md., said Cellmark subscribes to proficiency testing
services and spends ``an awful lot of resources'' to ensure quality
control.
   Cellmark already has called for national standards for DNA
fingerprinting, which would ``keep the schlock out of the field,''
he said.

<HEAD>Army Reported to Kill 300 Uganda Rebels in Surprise Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a surprise attack on a rebel camp,
government troops killed at least 300 insurgents and captured 500, a
newspaper reported.
   The reported assault would be one of the government's most
successful blows against the 2-year-old insurgency of the Uganda
People's Army.
   The army attacked the camp near Sorito, about 220 miles northeast
of Kampala, and battled about 1,500 defenders for almost two hours
Saturday, the Munno daily reported.
   It gave no figures for army casualties in Wednesday's report. An
unspecified number of rebels escaped into the jungle, said the
paper, which is partly owned by the Roman Catholic Church.
   Three rebel informers earlier Saturday told the army the location
of the camp, the paper said.
   The Uganda People's Army is led by Peter Otai, a defense minister
under former President Milton Obote.
   He was overthrown in a 1985 coup, and his supporters have been
fighting an insurgency against the government of President Yoweri
Museveni.

   Condemned killer William Paul Thompson remained
adamant that he would rather die for killing a Reno transient than
spend any more time on death row.
   Thompson appeared nervous and wiped away tears during a 10-minute
hearing Wednesday before District Court Judge Deborah Agosti. The
judge questioned him extensively before ruling that Thompson
understood his options and rejected them intentionally.
   ``Do you voluntarily submit to the execution of the death penalty
... at 2 a.m. June 19?'' Agosti asked.
   ``Yes ma'am,'' Thompson replied.
   When the judge reminded him he could appeal at any time before
his execution by lethal injection, he replied, ``I won't, but thank
you.''
   Deputy Washoe County District Attorney Gary Hatlestad added that
other parties could intervene on his behalf, particularly the
American Civil Liberties Union. Thompson replied, ``I don't want no
part of the ACLU.''
   At the conclusion of the hearing, Thompson struggled with his
shackles to shake hands with Hatlestad and whisper, ``God bless
you.''
   ACLU representative Richard Siegel, who did not attend the
hearing, said it was unlikely his group would try to intervene in
the case. ``We probably cannot succeed without some cooperation at
some stage from the person,'' he said.
   Assistant U.S. Public Defender Pat Flanagan also said he had no
standing to intervene unless directed by the court or requested by
Thompson.
   Thompson, 52, has spent more than half of his life behind bars
and was convicted of killing Randy Waldron in 1984 by shooting him
four times in the head. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the
murders of two brothers in Placer County, Calif.
   His attorney, Dave McElhinney, said Thompson told him in a letter
late last month that ``one way or the other he was going to spend
the rest of his life in prison ... and he feels enough is enough.''
   Also next week, Sean Patrick Flanagan is scheduled to die June 23
for the Las Vegas killings of two men he thought were homosexuals.
Flanagan also has said he wants no more appeals of his sentence.

   People came to cheer and jeer Oliver
North, and ended up shouting at each other, with American flags on
both sides and police in the middle.
   North's final speech before his sentencing next week for three
Iran-Contra convictions brought out the passion in the crowd outside
the Circle Star Theater, where about 150 protesters traded barbs
with about 70 supporters.
   Some called him a criminal, others a hero. Chants of ``Jail Ollie
North!'' competed with ``Ol-lie, Ol-lie!''
   Inside, the 45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel
insisted his actions were lawful and won hearty applause from a
crowd that half-filled the 3,700-seat auditorium Wednesday.
   He claimed his legal problems stemmed in part from ``an
increasingly imperial Congress'' that is preventing the executive
branch from carrying out foreign policy.
   North was found guilty on May 4 of aiding and abetting the
obstruction of Congress by helping prepare a false chronlogy of arms
sales to Iran in 1985 and by destroying documents. He also was
convicted of accepting a $13,800 home security system from arms
dealer Richard V. Secord.
   North faces a possible 10-year prison term and fines up to
$750,000.
   The former National Security Council aide was acquitted of nine
other charges, including allegations that he lied to investigators
about his involvement in U.S.-Iran arms sales and providing secret
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North received a standing ovation when he entered the theater and
was never booed or interrupted by the audience that paid $17.50 for
a ticket. He received $25,000 for his appearance.
   He spoke about the virtues of faithfulness and ideals, about God,
family and country. He attacked communism, warned against trusting
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev too much, and condemned ``the
butchers in Beijing.''
   ``The world we live in today looks more to me like 1939 than
1989,'' he said, comparing Gorbachev to Adolf Hitler.
   ``Neville Chamberlain and the leaders of Europe ... were swayed
by the mighty Wurlitzer coming out of Berlin. And my concern is that
we not be swayed by the mighty Wurlitzer in the Kremlin,'' North
said.
   North never expressed remorse over his actions in the Iran-Contra
affair and didn't blame former President Reagan or any other
executive branch officials for his troubles. Instead, he attacked
Congress.
   ``In an increasingly powerful Congress, we have a system of
special persecutors ... uh, prosecutors,'' he said, pausing to laugh
with the crowd at what he called a slip of the tongue.
   North spoke on schedule at 11 a.m. after police worked through
the night to remove 21 fake bombs planted in the theater 30 miles
south of San Francisco. The devices turned out to be small, harmless
circuit boards available in many electronics shops.
   ``We believe the idea was that these devices wouldn't be found
until 9 or 10 this morning and we'd have to call the show off,''
said Police Chief Owen McGuigan.

<HEAD>Stolen Baseball Card Turns Out to Be a Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURG, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare baseball card stolen from a
14-year-old boy and estimated to be worth about $100,000 has turned
out to be a fake.
   The stolen card, originally thought to be a 1910 Honus Wagner
tobacco card, lacked the tobacco stamp that would have indicated it
was an original, said Detective Phil White of the Contra Costa
County Sheriff's Department.
   Rene Montoya, who still hasn't recovered the card, was shown a
replica on Tuesday and identified it as ``exactly the same card
stolen from him,'' White said.
   ``Up until yesterday we had no way of determining if the card was
authentic or a replica,'' said White. ``We didn't even know a
replica existed, not being specialists in that field. We had nothing
to compare it with.''
   The boy's grandfather gave him the card six years ago. Rene put
it in the family Bible for safekeeping after seeing a television
program that discussed the value of authentic cards and hoped it
would finance his college education.
   His family never had the card appraised but assumed it was one of
only 10 to 20 authentic Wagner cards that experts believe exist
today.
   On May 24, an acquaintance of Montoya asked the boy whether he
could photograph the card and then he grabbed it and fled.
   Wagner, who played shortstop for Pittsburgh, joined Babe Ruth and
Ty Cobb as one of the first players inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Wagner bought up many of the cards himself because he did not
approve of youngsters having to buy cigarettes to obtain his picture.
   White said the boy's family was unaware the card was a replica
when they reported it stolen.
   ``They're still upset the card was stolen from the boy but are
somewhat relieved they hadn't lost so much money,'' White said.
   Police are still seeking the thief, even though its value is $10
at most.

   The dollar rose in early European trading today
after an overnight surge in Asia. Gold prices slipped.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was bid sharply higher
on expectations of a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit from
March's $8.9 billion.
   The U.S. Trade Department was scheduled to announce April's trade
figures later today.
   Dealers said banks scrambled to buy dollars early in the session
but that activity had calmed by late morning. No major movement was
expected until after the trade report.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen, closing up 3.25
yen at 151.30, its highest level since August 1987. The dollar now
has gained 10.65 yen since June 5.
   Later, it London, it was quoted at 151.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _2.0405 West German marks, up from 2.0290
   _1.7655 Swiss francs, up from 1.7525
   _6.9210 French francs, up from 6.8690
   _2.2973 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2805
   _1,475.75 Italian lire, up from 1,464.50
   _1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1993
   The dollar rose against the pound. It cost $1.5060 to buy one
pound, compared with $1.5143 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $360.15 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $361.75. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $360.40, from $361.25 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 83 cents to close at a bid of
$361.57.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.22 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $5.23.

   A couple accused of murdering their young
child by forcing him to drink sulfuric acid have pleaded innocent.
   Prosecutors contend Shelia Smith and Ricky Irby Sr. schemed to
claim their son was the victim of contaminated baby formula. The
child, Quinten Irby, died in August 1986, at age 2{ after lingering
near death for more than two years.
   In 1987, Irby filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the baby
formula manufacturer and the grocery store where the product was
purchased. He later withdrew the suit.
   The parents entered their innocent pleas Wednesday before Circuit
Judge Harry Hartel, who set a trial date for Aug. 7.
   Smith, 26, and Irby, 29, both of North Chicago, were returned to
the county jail, where they have been held on $1 million bond each
since being arrested May 31.

<HEAD>Three Boats Blown Up In Sidon, Syrians Shell Christian Enclave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three boats that police said smuggled food
to the besieged Christian sector were blown up in the port of Sidon
today as Syrian gunners pounded the Christian enclave with hundreds
of shells and rockets.
   Two people were killed and nine wounded as 300 howitzer shells
and rockets rained on the region late Wednesday and early today,
police said. A sailor was wounded in the Sidon explosions.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 372 killed and 1,450
wounded since the latest outbreak in the 14-year civil war began on
March 8.
   ``The shelling hadn't been as ferocious for quite a long time,''
said Bahjat Jaber, a reporter in east Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said Christian leader Michel Aoun's units did not return the
fire.
   He said the Syrians shelled the enclave, home to about 1 million
people, from batteries in Moslem west Beirut and mountains southeast
of the city.
   The attacks coincided with an Arab effort to defuse the crisis
between Syria and Gen. Aoun's 20,000-strong force.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the Arab League,
met Wednesday night in Damascus with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Sharaa after talks in Beirut with Aoun and acting Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem who heads a rival Moslem government in Lebanon.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, was sent to Beirut and Damascus to mediate
a settlement in Lebanon within six months.
   Police said the three motor boats exploded simultaneously at dawn
in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The spokesman said the boats had been braving the tight Syrian
blockade to smuggle food into the Christian enclave.
   Sidon is a mainly Sunni city. The Sunnis and Shiite Moslems have
stayed out of the latest confrontation. Only Druse fighters have
been actively fighting alongside the Syrians.
   The independent daily newspaper An-Nahar said Wednesday that the
three-month blockade has failed to starve the Christians. It said 94
vessels have unloaded about 15,017 tons of cargo at the Christian
port of Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut.
   Syria imposed the siege of east Beirut and the Christian region
on March 14, six days into the latest round of fighting.
   The confrontation was touched off by a blockade Aoun ordered on
militia-run ports south of Beirut, which have cost the ailing state
treasury $100 million in customs dues annually.
   Aoun has agreed to lift his blockade to assist the Arab League's
peace efforts. But the Syrians have maintained their siege and
shelling of Christian ports, claiming they want to prevent Iraqi
supplies from reaching Aoun by sea.
   Iraq is Syria's main Arab foe. It has openly supported Aoun's
pledge to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops out of Lebanon.

   Gary Johnson's first mistake was claiming
less than a nickel's worth of soap was $200 worth of cocaine, police
said. His second mistake was trying to sell it to an undercover
officer.
   Johnson, 37, of Leesville, allegedly tried to sell five soap
chips he said were cocaine to an undercover agent for $40 each, said
Sheriff Frankie Howard.
   The undercover officer said during the exchange Johnson leaned
inside his police car, which is unmarked but has a rack of police
radios.
   ``He asked me what I was looking for and I told him cocaine
rocks,'' the officer said.
   Johnson then produced the soap chips, the agent said.
   Johnson, who apparently realized the buyer was an undercover
officer when one of the radios broke the silence, tried to run, but
was caught by the officer.
   Johnson was being held Wednesday in the Vernon Parish Jail on
$5,500 bond. He was charged with distribution of a false controlled
substance.

   Foreign reporters covering the military crackdown
on dissent are finding their job increasingly more difficult. People
willing to talk are becoming more scarce and police and soldiers are
now to be feared.
   On American journalist said reporting under martial law
restrictions ``has us always wondering who is watching us.''
   A British reporter said reporters know the risks of going out
into the streets now, ``but the job we're doing is really too
important to worry about what might happen.''
   Chinese authorities expelled two American reporters on Wednesday,
and the Independent Television News in Britain said ITN reporter
Vernon Mann was under house arrest at his hotel in the city of
Chengdu.
   ``His passport and papers have been confiscated and he has been
ordered to stay in his hotel and `await punishment,''' said an ITN
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The network said Mann was arrested while filming buildings and
buses gutted in rioting that broke out just after troops killed
hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing in running protesters out
of the city center.
   ITN said Mann was told to return to police headquarters Friday
morning.
   A press officer at the British Embassy in Beijing said its
officers were seeking help from the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu on
reports of Mann's detention.
   Chinese authorities on Wednesday gave John Pomfret of The
Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S. government's Voice of
America three days to leave the country, saying they violated
martial law restrictions imposed on May 20.
   Both correspondents denied doing anything more than their jobs.
   Today, an organization representing 1,000 senior editors of daily
newspapers in the United States and Canada decried the expulsions,
saying they represented ``a serious blow to freedom of information
and the international reputation'' of China.
   ``We earnestly urge the Chinese government, in the interest of
press freedom and human rights, to lift all restrictions on foreign
and Chinese journalists,'' said the statement by the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   The martial law order bans foreign reporters from interviewing
student leaders, taking photos of troops or covering events around
Tiananmen Square, scene of the violent suppression on June 3-4.
Journalists generally have ignored the regulations.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said from Washington that
President Bush viewed the matter ``with great concern.''
   In New York, Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and general manager,
said, ``We deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the
Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual
reporting.''
   Soldiers briefly detained two journalists with Agence
France-Presse on Wednesday, accusing them of taking photographs of
troops. Authorities confiscated the residence card of Denis Hiault,
the agency's bureau chief in Beijing, and seized film from
photographer Catherine Henriette.
   Television crews also have had film or equipment confiscated.
Some reporters have been stopped by police from talking to people on
the street or had notebooks taken. A British reporter working on a
tourist visa was ordered expelled from Shanghai.
   But the reporting continues.
   ``Our approach is still basically unchanged,'' said Vito
Maggiolo, managing editor of Beijing coverage for Cable News
Network. ``We're going out, doing what we have to do to tell a story
and show what's happening.''
   He said the martial law restrictions have caused some
limitations, particularly with filming in public.
   ``Every time you take out a camera in this town you wonder what
the Chinese authorities might do,'' Maggiolo said. ``We're wondering
who's around. All of this has us always wondering who is watching
us.''
   He said those concerns extend to the Chinese people questioned by
CNN reporters.
   ``We don't want to do anything to put the Chinese people in hot
water,'' Maggiolo said.

<HEAD>Irish Voters Decide Whether To Give Haughey Majority Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland held parliamentary elections today with
opposition leaders saying they would try to deny Charles Haughey a
fifth term as prime minister if his party does not win a majority of
seats.
   Analysts say Haughey, who has led the country four times with
minority governments, may win his majority this time.
   Even so, the standing of the the man who first became prime
minister in 1979 and his Fianna Fail party have slipped in opinion
polls since Haughey announced the new election.
   About 2.4 million people were eligible to vote and counting
begins Friday morning, with the first results to be announced that
afternoon.
   ``Lovely morning,'' Haughey said after casting his vote in north
Dublin. ``Everything's going great.''
   On the eve of the election, however, opposition leaders said they
would not vote for Haughey for another maximum five-year term as
prime minister if he fails to win a majority of the 165 seats in the
Dail, or parliament.
   Alan Dukes, leader of the Fine Gael party, and Def O'Malley,
leader of the Progressive Democratic Party, issued statements saying
they would not vote for Haughey should his party fall short of a
majority.
   They also indicated they they would not abstain to permit Haughey
to muster a plurality.
   In that case, Haughey shot back, voters have a choice between a
Fianna Fail government or no government at all.
   O'Malley called on voters to reject ``the obsession of Mr.
Haughey ... with absolute power.''
   Fianna Fail was preferred by 44 percent of those surveyed in the
final Irish Independent poll, published Wednesday. The Fine
Gael-Progressive Democratic coalition combined for 35 percent,
followed by the Labor Party with 12 percent, the Marxist Workers
Party with 5 percent and others with 4 percent.
   Haughey's party gained none of the undecided vote from a week
earlier, while Fine Gael was up 1 percent and the leftist Labor
Party was up 2 points.
   Fianna Fail has 80 seats in the Dail now and would need 83 to
control it. He might still be able to govern with fewer than 83, but
would need support from some other group or coalition of groups.
   Haughey had received support from Fine Gael for his major
economic policies, which reduced Ireland's budget deficit to less
than 5 percent of gross national product from a peak of 15 percent.
   The government also cut basic tax rates from 35 to 32 percent.
   Unemployment remains at 17.5 percent, however, and emigration has
increased since Haughey took office in 1987.
   The government also aroused deep antagonism in western Ireland by
introducing fishing licenses _ charging $20 a year for trout fishing.
   Fianna Fail strategists had believed it was a good time to call
an election, with inflation running at 3.5 percent a year and
interest rates at only 9 percent.
   Ireland's system allows voters to list their preferences in
descending order, and these are shuffled around in a complex
tallying system that makes opinion polls unreliable. Voters' second
choices will likely decide whether Haughey gets his majority.
   Ireland has not had a majority government since Jack Lynch's
Fianna Fail administration left office in 1973, and no government
has won consecutive terms since the 1960s.
   Though Haughey has served four terms, he was defeated between
each of them and has never won two consecutively.

   A pediatrician has been charged with murder in
the suffocation death of her 7-week-old daughter.
   Dr. Katherine Kiyomi Shiraki Perez, 33, surrendered to the
authorities Wednesday night and was charged with the April 13 death
of Sarah Perez.
   Judge Thomas Nurre freed her on a $24,000 property bond and set
an arraignment for Friday.
   Mrs. Perez and her husband, Dr. Ricardo Victor Perez, said they
found the infant dead in their suburban home. The infant was born
Feb. 22.
   Seth Tieger, an assistant Hamilton County prosecutor, said an
autopsy led to an investigation that resulted in the indictment by a
Hamilton County grand jury. He declined to give details.
   The husband was not involved in the case, Tieger said.
   Mrs. Perez has a private practice in nearby Fort Thomas, Ky.
   The Kansas City, Mo., native has a degree from the University of
Hawaii and is licensed to practice in Ohio and Kentucky.
   David Carby, general consul for the Kentucky Board of Medical
Licensure, said the board would investigate the case.
   Lauren Lubow, spokeswoman for the Ohio State Medical Board, said
Mrs. Perez had not been the subject of any formal disciplinary
actions since she was licensed to practice in Ohio in July 1985. Ms.
Lubow would not say whether Mrs. Perez had been the subject of any
complaints.
   Mrs. Perez could have her medical license suspended, although an
indictment doesn't automatically lead to suspension, Ms. Lubow said.
   ``I'm not sure that this would be enough for a summary
suspension,'' Ms. Lubow said. She said that determination would be
left to the Medical Board.
   A 1987 state law allows the state Medical Board to automatically
suspend the licenses of physicians who are found guilty or plead
guilty to any of 10 crimes, including murder, Ms. Lubow said.

   A bomb exploded today under a
police car parked at a black policemen's barracks, but no injuries
were reported.
   It was the fourth attack on police since Sunday, but so far the
only injuries have been to a 14-year-old boy and three other
civilians hurt when a bomb exploded Sunday under a car at Duduza
Soccer Stadium in a black township.
   Police have not said who they believe is responsible for the
attacks.
   Most bombings are blamed on the outlawed African National
Congress, which has been waging a sabotage and bombing campaign to
force an end to white control of the government.
   Police said the latest bomb went off at 2:15 a.m. under a car
parked in front of the Sandton suburban barracks north of
Johannesburg.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Chinese students in the United States
are trying to tie up Chinese government telephone lines set up for
informants in hopes of blocking Beijing residents from turning in
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The students are paying for the calls with their own money and
with funds raised in recent weeks to support the pro-democracy
movement, which the Chinese government is trying to crush.
   One Stanford University student, who requested that his name not
be used, said he called a Beijing hot line and spoke with an
operator for 20 minutes.
   ``I called and made up a lie about someone I wanted to report
last night,'' the student said Wednesday. ``We talked for about 10
minutes, then I told her it was a white lie, and we talked for
another 10 minutes.
   ``I told her that there were 3,000 people killed by soldiers,
that I had seen pictures and knew this from the BBC, CBS, The New
York Times and other newspapers,'' the student continued.
   ``She said if I were Chinese I would have a conscience and
believe my own government. I said if she were a real Chinese she
would have a conscience and not report to the government on the
students.''
   He said the operator paused, then hung up.
   A nationwide computer bulletin board used by Chinese university
students in this country lists about a dozen Beijing hot lines that
residents of the capital are supposed to use to report the
whereabouts of known dissidents.
   The bulletin board also contains numerous suggestions on how to
jam the lines, thereby keeping informants from being able to use
them.
   ``Some people have proposed that everyone call collect, or to
call and let it ring, then hang up,'' said Liu Dianding, a graduate
student who has read the electronic mail at Stanford University.
   Students across the United States reportedly have raised tens of
thousands of dollars in recent weeks to help support their country's
pro-democracy movement. Stanford students say they have raised about
$100,000.
   The students say they don't know if their calls are having much
impact, but they remain determined.
   ``If we change people's minds, little by little, then one billion
people will know the truth,'' said Liu.

<HEAD>French President Offers Changing Poland Easier Credit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand of France has
offered to relax credit terms for Poland and push for rescheduling
part of this country's foreign debt to help it shore up its sagging
economy.
   Mitterrand made the offer during a dinner toast Wednesday night
on the first day of a three-day visit to Poland.
   He was to meet today with Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski,
then travel to Gdansk for talks with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   At the state dinner held by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, Mitterrand told his audience that France wants to
provide ``concrete support for the process of reforms taking place.''
   He was referring to the Communist government's new dialogue with
Solidarity and the independent trade union's sweeping victory
earlier this month in the country's freest elections since World War
II.
   ``We wish for the success of the current experiment and back it
because it will help Europe in the East and the West,'' said
Mitterrand, who heads a Socialist government.
   Mitterrand said France would push for rescheduling Poland's $39
billion foreign debt.
   He also said France would offer Poland flexible short- and
medium-term credit for financing industrial projects, agriculture,
food processing, and tourism development.
   In a visit to Britain earlier this week, Jaruzelski was told that
that country would provide only limited economic aid to Poland.
Britain also agreed to press for rescheduling of Poland's debt.

<TEXT>
   A violent summer thunderstorm that whisked
through the Washington area left thousands of people without
electricity today and forced the closure of about 30 schools.
   The Wednesday afternoon storm felled trees and caused a power
outage the likes of which the local utility company said it had
never seen. One person was reported killed in the rainstorm after
being involved in a traffic accident, and rush-hour was turned into
chaos as fallen trees and malfunctioning traffic lights frustrated
homeward-bound commuters.
   About 30 schools in the nation's capital and suburban Maryland
were closed today, due to the outages.
   An estimated 150,000 in Washington and suburban Maryland were
left without power at the height of the storm, according to Kevin
Case, spokesman for Potomac Electric Power Co. About 85,000 were
still without power at daybreak.
   Officials of the Virginia Electric Power Co. said an estimated
21,000 customers were blacked out in the northern part of the state.
About 125 customers were without power this morning, a spokesman
said.
   ``This is the worst storm in terms of the number of customers
affected and damage to Pepco's electric distribution system in the
93-year history of the company,'' Case said.
   He said complete restoration of power to all customers would take
several days. The company said about 300 crews were dispatched to
restore damaged lines, and workers were expected to be working
around the clock today.
   Dozens of homes were damaged and in several people were trapped
in cars that had been struck by fallen trees, authorities said. A
house in the District of Columbia had its roof blown off minutes
before a tree fell on it.
   Hail the size of golf balls was sighted in the northwest section
of the district. Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va.
recorded winds at up to 64 mph.
   Police in Fairfax County, Va., reported several traffic
accidents, including a head-on collision in which one person was
killed and another seriously injured.
   A fire truck responding to an alarm collided with a bus in the
district, injuring three civilians and two firefighters, officials
said.
   Pupils attending an after-school program at a Washington
elementary school had to stay later than usual because parents
couldn't reach the school. Parents finally began arriving at 8 p.m.,
hours after the storm had departed the area, and the school decided
to stay closed today.
   Police in Montgomery County, Md., closed sections of several
roads because of fallen trees and power lines. County and state
trucks were dispatched to clear the trees.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor says she was
handcuffed and made to sit in the street while being arrested on
charges of slapping a policeman who had pulled over her white
Rolls-Royce.
   The actress was booked for investigation of evading a policeman,
battery on a policeman, driving without a valid license, driving an
unregistered car and driving with an open flask of whiskey, said
police Lt. James Smith.
   She was released Wednesday on her own recognizance.
   Miss Gabor said she struck the officer in self-defense.
   ``Lots of people stopped and said, `How can you do that to Zsa
Zsa?' This is not a reason to confiscate a $215,000 car and put
handcuffs on me and make me sit in the street,'' the Hungarian-born
actress said.
   ``You just cannot drive a Rolls-Royce in Beverly Hills anymore
because they have it in for you.''
   Miss Gabor's car was later impounded.
   In January, police in Atlanta escorted Miss Gabor off a jetliner
after she refused to keep her dogs in travel kennels.

<HEAD>Judge Says Rape Example of Bad Consequences of `Trial Marriages'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge offered leniency to a man
convicted of beating and raping his live-in girlfriend, saying the
case illustrated the potential consequences of living together.
   Zackary Dwight Owens was convicted in April. A jury recommended
18 years in prison. Circuit Judge H. Calvin Spain on Wednesday gave
him 15 years.
   ``Trial marriages and live-in relationships can lead to bad
consequences,'' Spain said. ``And this is a prime example.''
   Owens will be eligible for parole in 2{ years, six months earlier
than if the judge had imposed the full sentence.
   The sentence reduction was unusual but within the judge's
authority, said Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Kathleen M. Edge.
``The commonwealth obviously would have preferred the full jury
verdict,'' she said.
   Defense attorney G. Roger Schafer had argued that Owens was
provoked into beating his 30-year-old girlfriend when she told him
that she had slept with another man.
   ``They lived together for eight months with no prior violent
incidents,'' Schafer said. ``He had no history of violence and no
prior criminal record. Then one night he just lost control, but it
was provoked.''
   The woman testified Owens beat her, forced her into a bedroom and
sodomized and raped her. She said he held her captive two days,
raping her until she escaped from the condominium they shared.
   Owens, a car salesman, admitted beating the woman but said she
had agreed to have sex with him ``to make it up to me.''

   Twin cold fronts moving through the East today churned up more
rain and thunderstorms, with Georgia and South Carolina getting the
most, while the central and southwestern United States had fair
skies.
   In Texas, showers and thunderstorms hit the lower Rio Grande
Valley. In Dallas, police evacuated parts of a neighborhood because
of flooding.
   ``Everything in the house was ruined. The walls are popping out,
the floors, the ceiling _ everything,'' said resident Betty Hicks.
   Two young brothers drowned Wednesday after being swept away in a
rain-swollen creek in Dallas, bringing to five the number of
fatalities from the flooding since Tuesday. At least one other man
was feared missing.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold fronts,
scattering showers and thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast to
the Ohio Valley.
   In the mid-Atlantic Coast region, a stationary front created more
rain and thunderstorms.
   The strongest thunderstorms bore down on northern Georgia early
today. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for northern
Georgia and northwestern South Carolina.
   On Wednesday, thunderstorms produced severe weather in Alabama,
Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Ohio, Virginia and the
nation's capital. At least seven tornadoes were reported, four in
Alabama.
   Around Washington, D.C., the storm disrupted afternoon rush-hour
traffic and cut off electricity to more than 170,000 customers, half
of whom were still without power at daybreak today. About 30 schools
in Washington and suburban Maryland closed because of power outages.
   ``This is the worst storm in terms of the number of customers
affected and damage to Pepco's electric distribution system in the
93-year history of the company,'' said Kevin Case, spokesman for
Potomac Electric Power Co.
   In Virginia, thunderstorms produced severe weather in the
evening. Winds downed power lines near Martinsville, and a traffic
accident that killed one person was blamed on the storm.
   In northwestern Ohio, a barn was destroyed and four other
buildings were damaged when a tornado touched down in a rural area
near Tiffin, officials said. No injuries were reported from
Wednesday night's storm.
   Cloudy skies with light rain and drizzle prevailed from the upper
Great Lakes to the northern Atlantic Coast. A cold front in the
northwestern United States brought showers and thunderstorms in the
northern Plateau and northern Rockies.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
East Coast to the Mississippi River, from Louisiana to south-central
Texas, the upper Ohio Valley, and Alabama and northern Georgia;
scattered showers in the Pacific Northwest; and scattered showers
and thunderstorms from eastern Washington and Oregon to the northern
Rockies.
   Predicted highs: 60s from New England across New York, the Great
Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley to eastern Kansas; 50s in
Michigan and Wisconsin; 60s in the Pacific Northwest and the
California coast; 90s in the south Atlantic coastal states, eastern
Montana, portions of Utah, along the Rio Grande in Texas and
California's interior valleys; and 100 to 115 in the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Duluth, Minn., to 93 at Phoenix and Glendale, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   A cool-headed radio broadcaster's on-air
plea for help led to the quick arrest of a man who broke into the
station and took his wife away at gunpoint.
   WBNZ News Director Chris Holbrook Anderson said she wasn't
thinking of any risk Wednesday when she asked listeners to call the
sheriff.
   ``I just knew I had to get help here and I knew I had to do it
over the air,'' Anderson said.
   Sheriff's deputies received about 300 calls after the broadcast.
Within 10 minutes, deputies arrested Ed Bartkowiak and freed his
wife, WBNZ Program Director Phyllis Minor. No injuries were reported.
   Anderson said she and Minor were alone about 7:30 a.m. when
Bartkowiak arrived at the rural station. Anderson said she locked
the door, but Bartkowiak broke it open and used a tire iron to smash
the telephone she was using to call police.
   She talked Bartkowiak into letting her go alone into the studio,
where she turned off the on-the-air light but switched on her
microphone.
   ``I said, `Someone please call the Benzie County Sheriff's
Department. There is a man in the building. He has a gun,'''
Anderson said. She managed to tell listeners her plea was not a joke
before Bartkowiak came into the control room and she switched to
playing music.
   Moments later, a sheriff's dispatcher called to say help was on
the way. Anderson convinced Bartkowiak that she had to answer the
telephone and pretended the caller was a listener wanting to
announce a birthday, said station owner Robert Brink, president of
Forum Communications.
   ``I'm not sure I would have done as much. I can't commend her
enough,'' Brink said.
   Bartkowiak left the station with his wife, but sheriff's deputies
pulled over his car two miles from the station, officials said.
   Minor, who moved out of the house she shared with her husband
earlier this week, had received a threatening call from Bartkowiak
Wednesday morning, authorities said.
   The couple had been arguing for a few days, and ``it just blew up
into this,'' said Gina Von, a disc jockey.
   Bartkowiak, 36, was charged with breaking and entering with
intent to commit a felony, assault and committing a felony with a
firearm, county Prosecutor Paul Schendel said.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago he was ``Batman,'' half of a
celebrated police undercover team responsible for hundreds of
arrests.
   On Wednesday, former Detective David Greenberg was charged in a
$350,000 insurance scam.
   Greenberg, 45, was arrested by postal inspectors at his home in
Bel Air Beach, Fla.
   As a detective, ``Batman'' Greenberg made hundreds of arrests in
the late 1960s and early '70s with his partner, Robert Hantz,
nicknamed ``Robin.'' Their exploits were recounted in the 1973 book
and 1974 movie ``The Super Cops.''
   Greenberg quit the Police Department in 1975 and was later
elected to the state Assembly. But in 1978, he was convicted on
federal mail fraud and obstruction charges. He served 10 months of a
two-year sentence.
   The charges filed this week accuse Greenberg; his brother and
business partner, Bruce Greenberg; and their lawyer, Samuel
Konigsberg, of changing documents as part of a scheme to cheat an
insurance company.
   The defendants, charged with mail fraud and insurance fraud, face
up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines if convicted.
   According to court papers, after a 1986 burglary at one of
Greenberg's businesses, a video store in New York City, the men
altered documents to make it look as if the store was covered by a
$500,000 policy instead of a $350,000 one.
   According to the complaint, the Greenbergs also inflated the
losses from the burglary, claiming $350,000 in used videotaped
movies had been taken.
   Bruce Greenberg, 36 and Konigsberg, 34, were freed on $50,000
bail after arraignment in New York City. Prosecutors said David
Greenberg will be extradited to New York.
   In 1987, a 45-year-old retired police officer who was president
of another of David Greenberg's video companies was shot to death as
he left his office. The killing has not been solved.

   A cameraman for ABC television was shot in the
head today with a plastic bullet when Israeli soldiers fired on
Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied West Bank.
   An army spokesman said the TV crew violated an army order putting
the area off limits to reporters. He said the army filed a complaint
with the Government Press Office and would likely file one with
police after investigating.
   The crew could then be subject to arrest, said the official, who
was not identified in keeping with army regulations.
   Bill Seamans, the ABC bureau chief in Israel, said: ``To the best
of our knowledge, we have followed all legal orders.''
   A Palestinian news agency said the cameraman, Shlomo Franco, was
filming a Palestinian demonstration in downtown Ramallah in which
protesters threw stones at soldiers. Troops opened fire, wounding
Franco and several Palestinians, the report said.
   Franco, an Israeli, was hospitalized at Hadassah Mount Scopus
Hospital in Jerusalem. A photographer who visited Franco saw three
fragments of a brownish-gray plastic bullet that had been removed by
doctors.
   Seamans said the bullet struck Franco above the left eye and
lodged between the skin and the skull, causing slight tissue damage.
``His condition is good,'' Seamans said.
   Franco, 42, has worked for ABC for more than 10 years.
   Seamans would not comment on an Israel radio report quoting
Franco as saying he was not shown any order barring reporters from
the area. The report also quoted ABC officials as saying troops
showed a closure order to another TV crew but that it was 10 days
old and no longer valid.
   The army official said the crew had arrived at the scene of a
skirmish between soldiers and about 50 Palestinian youths.
   ``The commanding officer at the scene presented the TV crew with
a warrant closing the areas. The crew left, went around the block
and returned on the side of the demonstrators,'' said the official.
   He said soldiers did not see the crew and opened fire with rubber
and plastic bullets. The cameraman was wounded slightly by a
fragment from a rubber bullet, the official said.
   ``They disregarded the closure order and covered the story from
the side of the people who were disturbing public order,'' said the
official.

   A 21-year-old British soldier
was shot to death today, apparently by a fellow soldier who was
firing at a motorist who tried to run one of them down, police said.
   Police earlier blamed an Irish Republican Army gunman firing from
a passing car. But the Royal Ulster Constabulary said later that
Adam Gilbert of the Royal Marines was probably shot accidentally by
another soldier.
   A spokesman said Gilbert was shot as a military patrol fired at a
car that drove toward them and tried to knock one of them down.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously, said it ``seems probable
that the soldier was accidentally shot when the patrol opened fire
from different points.''
   After the shooting, the car was found abandoned and gutted by
fire at Divis Flats, a public housing complex and stronghold of IRA
support.
   Police said Gilbert was shot just before dawn on the edge of the
mainly Roman Catholic New Lodge area of Belfast. He was taken to a
hospital and died soon after.
   Hours after the shooting, an off-duty soldier was injured when a
bomb hidden under his car exploded in Coleraine, County Londonderry,
police said.
   The solider, whose name has not been released, was taken to a
hospital with serious leg injuries, police said. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push the British out
of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and join it with the
Republic of Ireland.

   A court accused three people today of starting a
riot in Shanghai and sentenced them to death, the first execution
orders since the government began crushing the pro-democracy
movement.
   In another display of the widening crackdown on dissidents, state
television in Beijing showed reputed protest leaders being packed
into police vans, their heads shaved and signs dangling from their
necks describing their alleged crimes.
   Government-controlled media reported numerous arrests in other
cities.
   The death sentences in Shanghai were the first announced since
Chinese troops opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing
on June 3-4, crushing a 7-week-old reform movement.
   The hard-line government since has reported arresting more than
1,000 people in a nationwide crackdown in which the student protest
leaders have been branded as counterrevolutionaries and instigators
of the turmoil.
   Television said the three men sentenced to death were charged
with setting a train on fire and beating security officials who
tried to extinguish the blaze. National television showed the three
men in a courtroom being sentenced.
   The court also accused them of instigating a riot unprecedented
in recent Shanghai history. The men, who appeared to be workers,
were identified as Xu Guoming, Dian Hanwu and Yan Xierong.
   The train incident occurred June 6 when six protesters were
killed as they stood at a barricade on the tracks near the Shanghai
train station and a train from Beijing did not stop in time.
   People in a large crowd set fire to the train and fought with
firemen and police who came to put it out, injuring 21.
   In Beijing, the noon news showed 26 workers, their heads shaven,
being led by armed police onto a stage before a packed hall in the
northeastern city of Changchun.
   Several had large placards around their necks giving their names
and accusing them of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors.
   The signs said they had been sentenced to labor reform, a type of
prison.
   The placards are a throwback to the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
when leftist Red Guards paraded their victims through city streets
wearing dunce caps and signs on their chests.
   Beijing television today also showed young people being jammed
into a police bus in the southern city of Guiyang and said six
people were arrested in central China's Wuhan. It also broadcast the
arrest of Chen Xuedong, a physics major at Nanjing University and
showed tapes of him leading mass demonstrations in the eastern
Chinese city.
   The government kept up its propaganda campaign portraying
soldiers who put down the pro-democracy movement as heroes. The
reports deny troops opened fire on unarmed people as they moved
protesters out of Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say up to
3,000 died were killed in the assault, most of them civilians. The
government contends about 200 people died, half of them soldiers.
   The Communist Party's newspaper, the People's Daily, ran a
front-page editorial today to drum up support for the government,
urging Chinese to ``unite and join forces to fight the common enemy.
   ``A great victory already has been achieved in quelling the
counterrevolutionary rebellion. In Beijing and the whole country,
the situation is moving toward stability ... But the struggle
definitely is not over.''
   The editorial also said it was important to ``strengthen
education'' of the many people who ``are not clear about the true
situation and who took to the streets to march'' in support of the
pro-democracy movement.
   Today, television read a letter from six unidentified Beijing
University students who said they took part in a week-long hunger
strike during protesters' three-week occupation of Tiananmen Square.
   The students were quoted as saying they now regret their actions,
which stirred up popular sympathies for their movement for a freer
China.
   The government on Wednesday ordered the expulsion of two U.S.
correspondents, John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Voice of
America's bureau chief in Beijing, Alan Pessin.
   The two, accused of violating martial law regulations that ban
foreign reporting on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, were
given 72 hours to leave the country.
   Official media have launched daily diatribes against the U.S.
government's VOA service, which enjoys wide popularity among Chinese
seeking information beyond what the tightly controlled Chinese press
offers.
   Pomfret was accused of having contacts with leaders of the
protest movement, and of obtaining unspecified state secrets.
   Pessin said the government accused him of fomenting unrest with
his reports. Both men denied the charges.
   On Beijing's Tananmen Square, site of the bloody denouement of
the student movement and the symbolic heart of China, workmen
planted shrubs around a monument to revolutionary heroes.
   Dozens of tanks that had been sent in the square had disappeared
by Wednesday and 20 remaining armored personnel carriers were
covered with tarps. Key intersections that had been guarded by
soldiers with rifles were unguarded.
   Officials said today that two months of demonstrations and
martial law _ imposed May 20 _ had cost the city $270 million in
economic losses, two-thirds from delays in deliveries of raw
materials and worker slowdowns.

<HEAD>US Reacts Cautiously to Journalist Expulsion Orders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is reacting cautiously
to China's order that two U.S. reporters leave the country in the
hope that a series of retaliatory expulsions might be avoided.
   Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmit met for 45 minutes
Wednesday afternoon with Chinese Ambassador Hun Xu, who was called
to the State Department to receive a U.S. protest on the expulsion
orders.
   The Chinese government has accused Associated Press reporter John
Pomfret and Voice of America bureau chief Alan Pessin of violating
martial law restrictions. On Wednesday, they were given 72 hours to
leave the country.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater rejected Chinese
accusations that the reporters were distorting fact, spreading
rumors and instigating turmoil.
   ``To the contrary: We believe these journalists were trying to
print the truth of the situation in China,'' Fitzwater said.
   The administration said it did not plan any retaliatory action
against the 38 Chinese journalists based in Washington and New York.
   A State Department official, asked why no such step was planned,
said the administration did not want to get into ``a tit-for-tat''
situation.
   ``It would be a losing proposition to do that,'' said the
official. ``We have far more journalists there than they have here,
and it's in our interest to have them there.''
   Fitzwater, while expressing ``grave concern'' over the
expulsions, said that act, as well as Chinese attempts to jam VOA
broadcasts, ``will not succeed in keeping the truth about what is
going on in China from being heard in that troubled land or
throughout the world.''
   Fitzwater praised the work done by journalists who have covered
the unrest in China and the bloody crackdown of the pro-democracy
movement.
   ``The journalists and news organizations in China have performed
with distinction and valor _ in many cases, with personal courage _
to bring the dimensions of the tragic violence there to the peoples
of the world,'' Fitzwater said.
   There were these other reactions:
   _In New York, Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of
The Associated Press, said the AP had ``protested in the strongest
terms to the Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and
factual reporting.''
   ``John Pomfret is a journalist, not a participant, and even those
who have issued this order must surely understand that,'' he said.
   _VOA Director Richard Carlson told reporters that the expulsions
were ``a step backward for the media in China, which over the past
couple of years have demonstrated some steps forward.''
   He added, ``We think it's very unfortunate and sad, in fact, for
the Chinese people, who in the tens of millions depend on the Voice
of America and the BBC and some other outside broadcasters for what
has been extremely reliable, straightforward, factual, unbiased
accounts'' of the turmoil in their country.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said it
was U.S. officials' understanding that Pomfret and Pessin ``weren't
doing anything unusual or out of the ordinary. They were simply
doing their jobs.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, 67 senators called on the Chinese
government to free student leaders jailed for their roles in the
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   ``We urge the immediate release of all those who were peacefully
demonstrating for democracy,'' the senators said in a telegram to
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng.
   Among the signers were Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine;
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas; Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, the panel's senior Republican.

   Imelda Marcos says it was outrageous that U.S.
marshals served a summons on her critically ill husband at the
hospital.
   The summons is based on the civil suit filed by the government in
connection with a criminal case brought against Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife last fall.
   The civil and criminal complaints accuse the Marcoses of looting
over $100 million from the Philippines and using it to buy real
estate and other assets in the United States.
   Deputy U.S. Marshal James Propotnick on Wednesday said marshals
served the summons on the former Philippine president on Monday by
leaving copies with an aide outside Marcos' room at St. Francis
Medical Center.
   Mrs. Marcos was served by posting the documents on the gate of
the Marcos home after the people there refused to accept the papers,
Propotnick said.
   ``This is outrageous. What are they trying to do to Ferdinand,
kill him?'' Mrs. Marcos said in a statement. ``This is a great
shame.''
   Marcos' attorney Richard Hibey called the serving of the summons
``barbaric.'' He said he expects to challenge the legality of
serving a summons on a man who is near death and unable to
understand what is going on.

   People in Britain, Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Spain voted today in European Parliament elections
following campaigns dominated by national rather than European
issues.
   In the other European Economic Community members _ Belgium,
France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and West Germany _
voting for the 518-member assembly takes place Sunday.
   Results in today's elections will not be announced until voting
has ended in the other EEC, or Common Market, countries Sunday
night. The parliament's limited powers include approving trade
agreements involving EEC members.
   Throughout the Common Market, 7,126 candidates are vying for
seats in the 518-member assembly representing 178 national parties.
   Opinion polls predicted the Socialists, with 166 seats, and the
Christian Democrats, with 112 seats, would strenghten their
positions in the elections. Green parties, which favor environmental
causes, also were expected to win more than the 20 seats they now
hold. These gains would be at the expense of conservatives and the
assembly's 16 extreme rightists.
   In Ireland _ as in Luxembourg and Greece on Sunday _ voting for
the European Parliament coincides with national elections.
   In these nations, the campaigns focused on national issues, such
as unemployment and immigration, rather than European issues, such
as the plan to remove the EEC's internal borders and create a single
market EEC by 1992.
   Yet that was also evident in nations where no national elections
are immediately in the offing.
   In the Netherlands, for example, the campaign was overshadowed by
issues facing Dutch voters in the Sept. 6 national elections. The
Amsterdam daily Trouw called voting for the 25 Dutch assembly seats
``a dull event.''

   A moderate earthquake shook northwestern
Tadjikistan today, but there were no reports of deaths or serious
damage, Tass said.
   The earthquake measured 5 on the 12-point Soviet scale, the
official news agency said. A quake of magnitude 5 is considered a
``fairly strong'' temblor capable of shaking furniture, breaking
windows and cracking plaster.
   The epicenter of the quake was located 150 miles north of the
city of Dushanbe, the capital of the mountainous republic that
borders China and Afghanistan. The quake struck at 8:13 a.m., the
news agency said.
   A strong earthquake measuring 7 on the Soviet scale destroyed a
village 30 miles southwest of Dushanbe in January, killing more than
270 people.
   On Dec. 7, an earthquake devastated much of northern Soviet
Armenia and killed about 25,000 people.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi says the
45,000 Indian troops in Sri Lanka will not withdraw immediately
despite a Sri Lankan request to pull out by July 31, newspapers
reported today.
   Gandhi told reporters Wednesday that a withdrawal depended upon
``full implementation of the July 1987 peace accord'' that sought,
with promises of limited autonomy, to end an insurgency by Sri
Lanka's ethnic Tamil minority.
   Last week, President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka sent an
envoy to New Delhi to request an Indian withdrawal by the end of
July.
   India has said in official statements that Premadasa's deadline
was impossible to meet, but Wednesday was the first time Gandhi made
a statement in public.
   ``We are joint guarantors to the agreement with Sri Lanka. Until
the agreement is implemented in full, we will have a responsibility
towards the security of Tamils in Sri Lanka,'' The Times of India
quoted Gandhi as saying in the southern city of Bangalore.
   ``We are willing to sit down and work out a process of
withdrawal,'' the prime minister added, according to the newspaper.
   Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry said today that a mere request by
Sri Lanka for Indian troops to leave should be the only provision
for a pullout.
   ``It is regretted certain statements have been made both here and
abroad to support the continued presence of the Indian troops in Sri
Lanka,'' the ministry said in a communique. ``Such pronouncements
will only have the unfortunate effect of confirming the fears in the
minds of the people of Sri Lanka the Indian troops have come to this
country to remain and not to return.''
   The 1987 peace accord extended limited administrative powers to
the Tamil minority in the country's northeast in return for a
surrender of arms. The Tamils were not a party to the agreement,
however, and the largest Tamil guerrilla group has kept fighting.
   Several Tamil citizens' groups have asked India to remain until
provincial councils with Tamil representatives take office.
   In the past two years, up to 70,000 soldiers have been deployed
in Sri Lanka in an effort to try to end the Tamil insurrection and
to oversee the peace accord signed with Premadasa's predecessor,
Junius R. Jayewardene.
   More than 700 Indian troops have been killed and about 45,000
remain in the island nation off India's southern coast.
   Many ultra-nationalist members of the majority Sinhalese and
several government ministers resent the presence of the Indian
troops.
   Premadasa, who like Jayewardene is Sinhalese, took office in
January pledging to bring about an early Indian withdrawal.
   Tamil extremists started their separatist struggle in 1983. The
Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the country's 16 million people,
claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
population.
   More than 9,000 people have been killed in the Tamil insurrection
and at least 3,500 others have died in the Sinhalese backlash.
Ultra-nationalist Sinhalese say too many concessions are being given
to Tamils.
   India was drawn into the internal strife of its small neighbor
through its role as the regional power and the sympathies of its 60
million Tamils.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state newspaper today broke years
of silence and published a historical account of the 1956 revolt in
Hungary. It said such a rebellion could be abused by ``enemies of
socialism.''
   The account included a biography of the leader of the failed
revolt, Imre Nagy, who is to be reburied in Budapest on Friday along
with four of his associates in a public ceremony. Their bodies were
thrown into unmarked graves after they were convicted of treason
during a show trial and executed.
   State-run media in Czechoslovakia, as in other Soviet bloc
countries, had been silent for many years about Nagy.
   The Hungarian Communist Party recently hailed Nagy as a ``symbol
of socialist reform and said the sentence was illegal.
   Soviet forces crushed Hungary's popular uprising in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia's reform movement of 1968. But unlike other East bloc
countries, such as Hungary and Poland, Czechoslovakia has not taken
the Soviet Union's lead and adopted social, political and economic
reform.
   ``It is natural that the present reform forces have found a
symbol in (Nagy) ... but we should not forget that his legacy as an
exponent of Hungarian revolutionary movement with emphasis on
martyrdom is a target of appropriation by enemies of socialism,''
the Slovak Communist Party daily Pravda.
   The newspaper characterized Nagy as ``contradictory,'' but said
``there is no doubt that everything he did, he did with the best of
intentions, especially in his effort to stop bloodshed.''
   The Hungarian Supreme Court is to review his case on July 6.

   Twenty years after his daughter drowned in Edward
Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick, the father of Mary Jo Kopechne says
she did not die in vain because her death ``kept the senator from
becoming president.''
   ``He was worried about himself, not Mary Jo,'' Joseph Kopechne
said in an interview in the July issue of Ladies Home Journal.
   Miss Kopechne, 28, died July 19, 1969, when a car driven by
Kennedy ran off a bridge at night and plunged into a pond on
Massachusetts' Chappaquiddick Island. Miss Kopechne had been a
campaign worker for Kennedy's brother Robert.
   Kennedy said he freed himself from the car and tried to rescue
his passenger.But it took him 10 hours to report the accident. He
pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and lost his
license for a year.
   In the interview, Miss Kopechne's mother, Gwen Kopechne, 71, said
other women who attended a party with Kennedy and Miss Kopechne
before the accident ``were shut up.''
   ``I think there was a big coverup and that everybody was paid
off,'' she said.
   The Kopechnes received a settlement of $140,904, of which $90,904
came from the senator and $50,000 from his insurance company.
   The couple had two brief meetings with Kennedy after the
accident, Mrs. Kopechne said. ``I don't think he seemed upset either
time we saw him,'' she said, ``and I don't remember him saying he
was sorry.''
   Kennedy has expressed regret for Miss Kopechne's death on
numerous occasions.
   Mrs. Kopechne said Kennedy has telephoned the couple periodically.

<TEXT>
   John Negroponte, a former member of the
National Security Council staff, has won Senate confirmation as U.S.
ambassador to Mexico, surmounting questions about a possible role in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Senate confirmed the career diplomat by voice vote, with no
objections raised, Wednesday night.
   Committee action on Negroponte's nomination had been delayed by
the release of documents at the trial of former NSC aide Oliver L.
North. These documents appeared to raise questions about his
knowledge of North's activities in support of the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   Negroponte testified during his confirmation hearings that he
knew nothing of North's covert activities in Honduras in 1985 in
support of the Contra forces based there.
   The Senate also approved the nominations of Bernard W. Aronson to
be assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs and John
H. Kelly to be assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and
South Asian affairs.
   The Senate took no action on the pending nomination of Michigan
businessman and Republican activist Peter Secchia to be ambassador
to Italy.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, has objected to Secchia's penchant in the past
for ``unseemly'' use of profane and crude language.
   Secchia has pledged not to use such language if confirmed as
ambassador.

   Joey Heatherton rose in the witness box, hands on
her hips, and affected a snide New York accent as she acted out a
brouhaha with a passport clerk who claims the singer-actress slapped
her around.
   Ms. Heatherton, testifying Wednesday, heatedly denied hitting
Mary Polik and said if she touched the clerk at all, it was to
retrieve her papers after Ms. Polik ``threw my pictures in my face
and said, `They're disgusting!'''
   Ms. Polik, 27, is suing Ms. Heatherton for $6 million, claiming
Ms. Heatherton attacked her in 1985 when she pointed out problems
with the entertainer's passport-renewal application.
   Ms. Heatherton, who appeared in a number of TV shows and movies
in the 1960s and '70s and has had a nightclub act, wept as she
described how guards dragged her away from the clerk.
   ``They pulled my knee out of its socket,'' Ms. Heatherton, 44,
testified. ``I said, `Please stop it! I'm a dancer! My leg! It's my
living!' I wanted to get out of there.''
   In her suit, Ms. Polik said that she told the
singer-dancer-actress that she had the wrong type of photos and that
the $35 fee had to be in exact change.
   Ms. Polik said an enraged Ms. Heatherton slapped her, pulled out
a fistful of hair and slammed her head against a plastic partition
before security guards intervened. She said she was out of work for
14 months because of her injuries.
   In 1986, Ms. Heatherton was acquitted of disorderly conduct and
obstructing government administration.
   Ms. Polik's lawyer, Marie Ng, used the word ``battered'' in one
of her questions and the witness replied, ``I never battered anybody
in my life.''
   With that, Ms. Ng referred to allegations that Ms. Heatherton had
stabbed her former manager-boyfriend in 1985. A grand jury refused
to indict her.
   Ms. Heatherton started crying.
   Her attorney, William Kunstler, objected, slamming his papers
onto a table and shouting that Ms. Ng's questioning was ``bad faith
and dirty tactics.''
   The judge sustained Kunstler's objection but told him to tone
down his language.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said today that Moscow regretted some aspects of the conflict in
China and that the failure of reforms there could pose dangers to
the world.
   Speaking at a news conference on the final day of his four-day
trip to West Germany, Gorbachev also praised some of the students
who took part in the pro-democracy movement that was recently
crushed by China's hard-line government.
   Gorbachev's comments were his most extensive yet on the crisis in
China and the government's violent suppression of the pro-democracy
movement.
   The movement gained strength during the week of May 15, when
Gorbachev began his historic visit to China, ending a three-decade
rift between the two communist powers. Up to 1 million people
rallied in the streets of Beijing demanding social reforms, almost
overshadowing Gorbachev's visit.
   At today's news conference, Gorbachev was asked whether he shared
the official Chinese view that the students were
counterrevolutionaries.
   The Soviet leader sidestepped a direct reply, recalling that he
had said during his visit to Beijing that negotiations were the
solution to resolving problems.
   ``I think all of us are very much concerned at what is happening
in China,'' he said. ``All of us want the process of deep reform not
to fail'' in such a large nation.
   ``That failure would be very dangerous for the entire process of
creating a healthy environment in the world,'' Gorbachev added.
   ``All of us want the people and the government of China to find a
way out which corresponds to the interests of the Chinese people and
common aspirations,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said this concern dictated the Soviets' ``balanced, serious
position'' on China, although this did not exclude that ``we regret
some aspects of what happened.''
   Gorbachev and the Soviets have been cautious in speaking about
the events in China, apparently anxious not to undo the results of
the Sino-Soviet summit that sealed the mending of relations after a
30-year rift.
   Gorbachev mentioned that he had received letters from
unidentified students in which they had spoken out in favor of
reform, bilateral cooperation and many other policies that he said
were broadly similar to those of the Chinese Communist Party.
   ``I cannot suspect these people of any evil intention,'' he added.
   But he said there ``could be elements'' in the protest movement
``that took advantage of the situation.'' Gorbachev did not
elaborate.
   The Chinese government, in an elaborate propaganda campaign in
state-run media, has portrayed protest leaders as thugs and
criminals and branded soldiers who occupied Beijing on June 3-4 as
heroes.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the
military raid in Beijing killed 3,000 people, most of them citizens.
The Chinese government says 200 people died, half of them soldiers.

<TEXT>
   A Belgian hostage, Dr. Jan Cools, was freed
today after nearly 13 months in captivity and handed over to a
leftist militia leader in this southern port city, an aide to the
leader said.
   The aide said Cools, 32, a physician with the Norwegian Aid
Committee, was ``turned over'' to the leader of the Nasserite
militia, Mustafa Saad, a Sunni Moslem. Saad's militia controls
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   ``He is wearing spectacles and has a bushy beard. He's having a
meeting with Saad right now,'' said Saad's aide, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Saad's aide said Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain;
his chief aide, Robert Willermain; and Belgian Charge d'Affaires
were at Saad's residence when Cools arrived. Urbain and Willermain
had driven from Damascus, Syria, earlier in the day, apparently
after hearing about a statement from the kidnappers that Cools'
release was imminent.
   ``All of them are meeting with Saad. They'll leave later,
probably for Damascus,'' he said.
   Cools was kidnapped on May 21, 1988, near the Palestinian refugee
camp of Rashidiyeh, where he worked, on the outskirts of the
southern port of Tyre.
   A group calling itself Soldiers of Justice claimed reponsibility
and accused Cools of spying for Israel.
   Cools' parents visited Sidon last month on the anniversary of his
abduction to appeal for his release.
   The Soldiers of Justice, in a typewritten statement delivered to
a Western news agency, said Wednesday that it would free Cools as a
gesture of good will and cited an appeal from Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.
   It also said the decision resulted from negotiations undertaken
by Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical Palestinian guerrilla
faction headed by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   There has been widespread speculation in Lebanon that Cools was
abducted by Abu Nidal's group, despite its public disclaimers. Many
analysts believe Soldiers of Justice is one of many names used by
the group.
   There are now 14 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing
and believed held hostage in Lebanon.
   The longest held is American journalist Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremist factions.
   In a statement released on Wednesday, the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council praised the Soldiers of Justice for deciding to release
Cools.
   It also pledged to ``spare no effort to help release other kidnap
victims, hoping European nations will help curb the Israeli
suppression of our Palestinian people's uprising in the occupied
territories.''
   Nidal formed the council in 1976 after splitting a few years
earlier from Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation
Organization.

   Authorities have arrested hundreds of people in
Uzbekistan in an attempt to halt ethnic violence that has killed at
least 90 people in the southern republic, Soviet officials said.
   Lt. Gen. A. Anikiev, an Interior Ministry officer, said troops
were guarding intersections and government buildings and patrolling
streets in Fergana, the city hit hardest by the 10 days of rioting,
Pravda reported.
   Violence by the native Uzbeks has been directed against Meshki
Turks, an ethnic minority forcibly moved from Soviet Georgia to
Uzbekistan in 1944 by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   The Communist Party newspaper said helicopters were patrolling
the tense city and a 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew that was imposed June
4 remains in effect.
   ``But the situation continues to be serious as an unknown hand
directs bandits to generate tension,'' Pravda quoted Anikiev as
saying.
   He added that the situation in Fergana, 1,500 miles southeast of
Moscow is ``completely under control,'' the newspaper said.
   The official news agency Tass later said police had received
repots of further disturbances today. It said a wagon with
children's clothing that had been collected for fleeing Turkish
refugees was burned in Fergana.
   Tass said more than 15,000 Turks had been evacuated by Wednesday.
Turks have been sent to refugee centers in Soviet Russia.
   Anikiev said prosecutors from throughout the country, including
KGB and Interior Ministry investigators, had converged on Fergana,
Kokand and the republic's capital, Tashkent, to investigate how the
unrest began.
   ``Several hundred people have been arrested on charges of
organizing pogroms, murder and violence,'' he said. ``Along with
ensuring public order, law enforcement personnel are stopping all
manner of provocative rumors and explaining the situation to people
to prevent panic.''
   Proceedings have begun in more than 60 criminal cases, the
newspaper said.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzkhov, who led a Kremlin delegation to the
region this week, said on Wednesday that Communist Party and
government officials ``tarnished the party's prestige'' by giving
gasoline, transportation and vodka to attackers who killed Meshki
Turks.
   Ryzhkov made the disclosure at a meeting with party officials in
Andizhan, a regional center northeast of the Fergana Valley and the
heart of the violence.
   In a report on the session, the official news agency Tass said:
``The involvement of some party and government officials in pogroms
has become known.''
   Ryzhkov said murderers and attackers would be punished but that
communist officials involved bore a special responsiblity.
   Official newspapers say the Meshki minority is angry about the
slow response of troops when the violence broke out and their
failure to use weapons against marauders who attacked with
pitchforks, knives and hunting weapons.
   Anikiev said troops were not authorized to use weapons on the
first day of violence. Newspaper reports earlier this week suggested
that officials wanted to avoid a repeat of the clashes between
troops and pro-independence protesters in the Georgian capital,
Tblisi, on April 9, when 20 demonstrators died.
   Unlike demonstrators in Georgia, however, Soviet news reports
have indicated Uzbek rioters were armed.
   The Interior Ministry official also suggested that any delay in
deployment of troops was due to vague information and indecision on
the part of the republic's leadership.
   More than 12,000 troops had been sent to the region to contain
the violence. Soviet news reports have said that hundreds of homes
were burned in premeditated attacks on the Turkish minority.
   Ryzhkov said on Tuesday that a government commission will examine
the Meshki Turks' request to return to Georgia.

   A former federal security chief arrested in
the 1984 slaying of a crusading journalist had feared the reporter
would link him to Mexico's most notorious drug runners, news reports
say.
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, who was Mexico's equivalent of FBI
director, was arrested Tuesday and called the mastermind of the
murder of newspaper columnist Manuel Buendia.
   On Wednesday, opposition legislators demanded that former
President Miguel de la Madrid and Interior Secretary Fernando
Gutierrez Barrios testify before a parliamentary committee on their
``possible knowledge'' of details surrounding killing, said the
Excelsior News Service.
   The opposition's proposal was rejected by members of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, the news agency said.
   The business daily El Financiero on Wednesday quoted testimony of
those interviewed in the investigation that led to Zorrilla's arrest
as indicating he feared Buendia would publicize his alleged links to
drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero.
   Caro Quintero is awaiting trial in the 1985 torture-murder of a
U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Excelsior, also quoting case testimony, said witnesses told
investigators Zorrilla was linked to Miguel Felix Gallardo and
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, both recently jailed for operating huge
drug smuggling operations.
   The testimony quoted by Excelsior also said Zorrilla had
illegally provided police credentials to 16 drug traffickers to help
them in their operations.
   ``I'm innocent. I need your help. I'm not guilty,'' Excelsior
quoted Zorrilla as saying as he was processed at the Northern
Penitentiary on Wednesday night.
   Zorrilla, 47, was scheduled to be arraigned today.
   He surrendered to authorities Tuesday night after a brief
shootout in a Mexico City neighborhood. No one was hurt.
   He was questioned for 18 hours after his arrest by the deputy
federal attorney general in charge of narcotics, Javier Coello Trejo.
   Zorrilla is accused of masterminding the May 30, 1984, shooting
death of Buendia in a Mexico City parking garage. Buendia was a
columnist for the daily Excelsior and author of hard-hitting books
on corruption and illegal sales of drugs and weapons.
   Authorities refused to identify three other suspects in the
killing, saying that could hamper their investigation.
   Mexico City Attorney General Ignacio Morales Lechuga on Sunday
night announced an arrest warrant for Zorrilla, saying the former
security director had ordered Buendia's death.
   The government has come under intense pressure to solve the
murder of Buendia, one of 25 journalists slain since 1982, and there
have been accusations that high-ranking officials were involved in a
cover-up.
   Zorrilla headed the Federal Security Department from 1981 to
mid-1984. The department was dismantled in 1985 because of
corruption.
   He previously was a congressman and private secretary to
Gutierrez Barrios, now the nation's top law enforcement official.
   Opposition legislators had asked Gutierrez Barrios and de la
Madrid, whose six-year term as president ended in December, to
testify before a parliamentary committee on the ``possible
knowledge'' they had of Zorrilla's involvement in Buendia's death,
Excelsior said.
   The governing party rejected the proposal. ``It is totally
frivolous, without foundation and justification,'' Excelsior quoted
PRI Deputy Dionisio Perez Jacomo as saying.
   Gutierrez Barrios has not made any public statements on
Zorrilla's arrest.
   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa on Wednesday, officials
announced the arrest of a suspect in the February 1988 killing of
another journalist, Manuel Burgueno Orduno.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted the suspect as saying
he killed Burgueno because of the reporter's written attacks against
the suspect's brother, the former Sinaloa state judicial police
commander.
   Police believe the former police commander, who remains at large,
ordered the slaying.
   The agency quoted state Attorney General Manuel Lazcano Ochoa as
saying the suspect, Rigoberto Rodriguez Banuelos, confessed to being
one of four people involved in the killing.
   The news agency said Rodriguez was arrested in Agua Prieta,
Sonora. It did not say when he was arrested.

   Sen. Alan Cranston today said the Bush
administration is refusing to respond to the Senate's request for
documents relating to the role of ambassadorial nominee Donald Gregg
in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We've been stonewalled by the administration,'' Cranston,
D-Calif., said as a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation
hearing resumed into Gregg's nomination to be ambassador to South
Korea.
   Cranston said the National Security Agency ``has rejected our
legitimate inquiries out of hand.'' The CIA proposed a document
review arrangement requiring the presence of four Republican and
Democratic senators, prompting Cranston to call the restrictions so
severe ``as to be laughable.'' Cranston also said the Pentagon had
given unsatisfactory responses and the State Department had been
``utterly nonresponsive.''
   ``They answered our letter after their own self-imposed deadline
and failed to produce specific documents we requested _ and which we
know exist,'' said Cranston.
   Cranston said the Senate committee ``has been stonewalled by
Oliver North, too.'' The former White House aide oversaw the secret
Contra resupply operation from 1984 to 1986.
   Cranston said North hasn't complied with a committee subpoena for
uncensored versions of his notebooks. The uncensored notebooks
contain ``repeated January 1985 references to Felix Rodriguez which
suggest North's involvement in Rodriguez briefings of the Vice
President,'' said Cranston.
   Rodriguez is a longtime friend of Gregg who was sent to El
Salvador with Gregg's help in 1984. Gregg contends he didn't find
out about North's secret resupply operation until August 1986 and
didn't learn the extent of North's involvement and didn't tell his
boss, then-vice president George Bush, until four months later. At
the time, Gregg was Bush's national security adviser.
   Cranston, chairman of the foreign relations subcommittee on East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, promised a committee vote on the Gregg
nomination next Tuesday. Cranston has led the opposition to Gregg's
appointment.
   Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are trying to
find out what Gregg knew about North's secret Contra supply network.
   The committee has been zeroing in on Gregg's ties to Rodriguez
and Gregg's activities after a Contra supply plane was shot down
over Nicaragua in October 1986. That is when the operation started
to come unraveled.
   Gregg insisted in testimony today that he first heard details of
the resupply operation in August 1986 from Rodriguez, but ``did not
know the extent of North's involvement'' until four months later.
   Gregg says he didn't inform Bush about the network until December
1986 after the Iran-Contra scandal emerged.
   If he had known in August 1986 about the network ``I would have
informed the vice president'' and ``I would have taken steps to stop
the operation,'' Gregg testified. The network operated during a
congressional ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   At a May hearing, Gregg said Bush first found out that Gregg had
information on North's operation and Rodriguez' involvement in it
through a newspaper interview given by Gregg in December 1986.
   After talking with Gregg late in 1984, Rodriguez was sent to El
Salvador to help that country in the battle against leftist
guerrillas.
   North recruited Rodriguez to work in the Contra rebel resupply
operation. The Contras, backed by the United States since 1981, have
been fighting to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.
   At his recently completed trial, North testified that he thought
he spoke to Gregg about the resupply operation, but North gave no
specifics.

   The government has banned the Mormon Church
and Jehovah's Witnesses and given their missionaries one week to
leave Ghana.
   The government of Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, in a statement
Wednesday carried on state-run Accra radio, accused the two groups
of disturbing public order and threatening Ghana's sovereignty.
   Accra Radio said two small, domestic sects, Nyame Sunkwa and
Jesus Christ of Dzorwulu, also were banned.
   Of the U.S.-based groups, the statement said:
   ``Despite repeated warnings, the two sects have continued to
conduct themselves in a manner which not only undermines the
sovereignty of Ghana but is also not conducive to public order.'' It
gave no details.
   It said the government had canceled residence permits for foreign
missionaries and other workers with the Mormon Church and the
Jehovah's Witnesses. Their churches were ordered closed.
   Accra Radio did not say how many people will be expelled.
   Jerry Cahill, a spokesman for the Mormon Church in Salt Lake
City, said the church would not comment until it had more details on
the expulsion order.
   The Mormon Church, known formally as Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, is based in Salt Lake City. Mormons believe that
Jesus Christ established one church on earth, that it was removed
upon his death, and then restored in revelations to Joseph Smith in
the 1820s.
   The Jehovah's Witnesses have headquarters in Brooklyn, N.Y..
Their faithful believe that they adhere to the oldest religion on
earth, the worship of Almighty God revealed in the Bible as Jehova.
They refuse to bear arms, salute the flag, or participate in secular
government. They also refuse blood transfusions as being against the
Bible.
   The broadcast said a law requiring all denominations to register
with the Ministry of Interior in this West African nation had been
signed.
   Of Ghana's population of 13 million, 43 percent is Christian. The
other major group, 32 percent, adheres to traditional local beliefs.
   It was not immediately known how many people belong to the banned
groups.

<HEAD>Court Gives Legal Help to Men Trying to Prove Fatherhood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deeply divided Supreme Court today gave some
legal help to any man trying to prove he fathered the child of a
woman married to someone else.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.
   But the court upheld California rulings that denied visitation
rights to a man, identified only as Michael H., who says he is the
father of a 7-year-old girl, Victoria, born to a woman identified as
Carol D. at a time when Carol D. was married to another man.
   At issue was the constitutionality of a California law, similar
to laws in many other states, that creates a presumption of
paternity in favor of a woman's husband if a child is conceived and
born during their marriage.
   Four high court members said men in similar circumstances to
Michael H. have no constitutional right to a hearing where
visitation rights could be won.
   Four justices voted to strike down the California law, saying it
infringed on Michael H.'s constitutionally protected ``liberty.''
   The key 9th vote was cast by Justice John Paul Stevens who voted
to uphold the law, but said Michael H. had been ``given a fair
opportunity to show that he is Victoria's natural father, that he
had developed a relationship with her, and that her interests would
be served by granting him visitation rights.''
   Stevens, saying he was willing to ``assume'' that Michael H. and
others in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearing
to establish paternity, said the California law does not violate the
right because Michael H. received a chance to prove paternity and
get visitation rights.
   ``Because I am convinced that the trial judge had the authority
under state law both to hear Michael's plea for visitation rights
and to grant him such rights if Victoria's best interests so
warranted, I am satisfied that the California statutory scheme is
(constitutional),'' Stevens said.
   Michael H. filed in a state court in Los Angeles a ``reverse
paternity'' lawsuit in 1982, seeking to have himself declared
Victoria's father. His lawsuit was dismissed.
   In upholding the dismissal, a state appeals court said the state
law presumption of fatherhood in Carol D.'s husband, identified in
court records as Gerald D., was based ``upon a determination by the
legislature as a matter of overriding social policy that ... the
husband is to be held responsible for the child and the integrity of
the family unit should not be impugned.''
   Michael H. said he had enjoyed a father-child relationship with
Victoria and that blood tests show a better-than-98-percent-chance
that Victoria is his biological daughter.
   Michael H.'s appeal said that Victoria was born as a result of an
affair Carol D. had while she was married to Gerald D.
   The appeal also said that Carol D. and Victoria moved to the
Virgin Islands to live with Michael H. for several months in 1982
after she and her husband were estranged.
   Court records indicate that Carol and Gerald D. later resumed
living together.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy,
wrote that Michael H. had no constitutional right to a judicial
hearing to establish paternity.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun said he did have such a constitutional right.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.

   Early in former Rep. Pat Swindall's perjury trial,
jurors heard him in tape-recorded conversations with an undercover
agent.
   That's all they're going to hear from him.
   Swindall's lawyers rested their case Wednesday without putting
the former congressman on the stand.
   The case is expected to go to the jury Friday, following closing
arguments.
   Because he won't be taking the stand, Swindall will not face
cross-examination by prosecutor Craig Gillen, who questioned
Swindall for hours on Feb. 2, 1988, before a federal grand jury
about an $850,000 loan deal.
   Prosecutors said that among other things, Swindall lied during
his testimony that day when he denied being told by an agent posing
as a money launderer that some of the loan money might have come
from drug trafficking.
   Swindall, 38, faces up to 45 years in prison. The two-term
Republican from the Atlanta suburbs lost his congressional seat to
Democrat Ben Jones in November.
   The indictment specifies 23 alleged lies, grouped into nine
counts of perjury. Fourteen other alleged lies were dismissed by
U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman or dropped by the prosecution
for reasons of clarity.
   The prosecution won a victory today when the judge said he will
tell the jury that only one deliberate lie is sufficient for a
conviction on any one count.
   He also said he will instruct the jury that Swindall's failure to
testify on his own behalf should not be considered in jury
deliberations.
   The trial was nearly aborted Wednesday after Gillen asked a
defense witness, lawyer Bobby Lee Cook, about what motivates
defendants to testify.
   Gillen asked whether it was correct that ``if a defendant were to
testify and he knew certain things ... could help him ... he would
be more prone to testify in that regard?''
   Swindall attorney Tom Thrash immediately asked Freeman to declare
a mistrial, arguing that the question planted in the jurors' minds
the thought that if Swindall did not testify, it would be because he
had something to hide.
   Freeman denied the mistrial motion, and instructed the jury that
Swindall's failure to testify _ which is his right _ should not be
held against him in any way.

   President Bush, paying tribute to fallen
federal law-enforcement officers, today promised to wage an
anticrime campaign that will ``put the handcuffs on criminals, not
on the criminal justice system.''
   Bush also urged governors to join in his call for mandatory
prison time and no plea bargaining for violent offenders and an
expanded death penalty for convicted killers.
   The president spoke at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center, where agents and police officers from 60 agencies are
enrolled. It is also the place where U.S. ambassadors go to ``learn
to recognize and avoid terrorists,'' he noted.
   Bush also laid a wreath at the Peace Officers Memorial to the 39
graduates of the training center who have been killed in the line of
duty.
   He repeated a warning he made earlier this year at the funeral of
murdered Drug Enforcement Administration agent Everett Hatcher in
New York: ``Better that you had never been born than to attack one
of America's finest.'
   Before his speech, delivered under a broiling sun to a crowd of
several thousand, Bush attended a briefing where he fielded
questions from several students completing their training.
   Border Patrol agent David Rivera of El Paso, Texas, asked for
``some words of wisdom ... as we enter the field.''
   ``A word of wisdom would be, in spite of the suspicion or
circumstantial evidence, an individual should be treated with
respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the evidence
looks overwhelming,'' he said.
   ``I think we've got to stand for that. I know that sometimes is
difficult along the border when you have repeat offenders and you
have people that are brutally using this narcotics money for
personal gain and devastating communities.'
   At the ceremonies Bush signed a document transmitting to Congress
a the $1.2 billion ``take back the streets'' anticrime package he
unveiled a month ago.
   He told the officers he could have signed the transmittal in
Washington with ``a quick flourish of the pen'' and dispatched an
aide on a 10-minute car ride to Capitol Hill.
   ``But when it comes to fighting crime, you deserve more than
business as usual,'' he said. ``That is why I have come almost a
thousand miles to the center, to let you know we intend to back you
where it counts: on the streets and in the courtroom.''
   He said the center was training ``domestic freedom fighters in
the war on crime.''
   Bush spelled out anew three of the central planks of his
anticrime platform: doubling to 10 years the mandatory term for use
of semi-automatic weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs;
eliminating plea bargaining for violent federal firearms offenses;
and an expanded federal death penalty for killers and terrorists.
   ``When a criminal commits a crime with a gun and someone dies,
justice demands something in return: the ultimate penalty, death,''
the president said.
   ``I call on governors to match this federal initiative and
propose these same three standards at home: mandatory time, no deals
without cooperation and the death penalty,'' he said.
   ``Let's put the handcuffs on criminals, not on the criminal
justice system,'' he said. ``In short, I am proposing more law
enforcers to catch criminals, more staff to prosecute them and more
prisons to keep them off the streets.''
   Of the $1.2 billion package, $1 billion would be spent on
building more federal prison space. The prison system, designed for
30,951 inmates, now houses 48,000. The rest of the money would be
used to hire 825 new federal agents and 1,600 new prosecutors.
   Some congressional Democrats have complained that Bush wasn't
being tough enough, especially on semiautomatic weapons, where he
has suspended imports of foreign-made models but not sales of
domestic arms.
   His proposals also would double to 10 years the mimimum sentence
for using a semiautomatic weapon in a crime and ban semiautomatic
weapons clips of more than 15 rounds.
   Administration officials counter that the president crafted a
package that could get through the Congress, which under pressure
from the gun lobby is always wary of imposing new restrictions on
firearms.
   Bush also will outline his plan to a gathering of the 93 U.S.
attorneys at the White House on Friday.
   The president's half-day trip to Georgia was his second journey
outside Washington this week. He returned to the capital Tuesday
evening from a two-day swing through Montana, Wyoming and Nebraska
on behalf of his clear air initiative.
   Bush is taking three out-of-town trips next week _ to
Philadelphia on Monday, Richmond, Va., on Wednesday and New York on
Thursday _ for various speeches and events.

   An explosion ripped through the pump room
of a Pakistani-owned supertanker today while it was in dry dock, and
some deaths and injuries were reported, Persian Gulf shipping
sources said.
   Gulf-based marine salvage executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the tanker as the 231,439-ton Seiva and said
it was operated by the Atlas Shipping Management Co. of Hong Kong.
   The vessel was registered in the Bahamas, but the crew members
were believed to be Pakistani, the executives said.
   The supertanker was being repaired at dry dock facilities in
Dubai, a major southern gulf port, when the blast occurred about 4
p.m., the executives said.
   They said there were deaths and injuries among crewmen working in
the pump room at the time. But no details were available on the
casualties or how many people were aboard the vessel.
   ``A barricade has been thrown around the area where the tanker
was anchored, and we are unable to get close for details,'' said one
executive.
   He said the repair work involved welding and the blast was
probably caused by a spark from a welding gun that ignited gas in
the pump room.

<HEAD>States Given New Protection from Federal Civil Rights Lawsuits in
Michigan Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave states and state
officials sweeping new protection from federal lawsuits accusing
them of civil rights violations.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they may
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against
``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.
   States and state officials are not ``persons'' as defined by the
post-Civil War law, said Justice Byron R. White for the court.
   By contrast, the court previously has held that a city is a
person under the law and municipalities and their officials may be
sued.
   But White said today states and their officials enjoy
constitutional immunity that does not extend to cities. He relied on
the 11th Amendment, which gives states broad legal protection.
   ``Obviously state officials literally are persons,'' White said.
``But a suit against a state offficial in his or her official
capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit
against the official's office.''
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said the
court is giving a ``hypertechnical'' interpretation to a federal law
while ignoring its larger purpose.
   The Congress that passed the 1871 statute ``was fighting to save
the Union and in doing so it transformed our federal system,''
Brennan said. ``It is difficult, therefore, to believe that this
same Congress did not intend to include states among those who might
be liable under (the 1871 law) for the very deprivations that were
threatening this nation at that time.''
   Brennan was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The court today refused to revive a suit accusing Michigan
officials of denying a promotion to a state employee because his
brother was a political activist.
   The employee, Ray Will, sought promotion to a job as data systems
analyst with the state police in 1973. He had been ranked second on
a promotion list and moved up to number one when the applicant above
him withdrew from consideration.
   But Will said he learned years later that he did not get the job
because a so-called Red Squad operated by the state police had
investigated his brother, Charles, a student political activist.
   The Red Squad, which monitored campus radicals with subversive
ideas, was held unconstitutional by a state judge in 1976.
   Ray Will then filed suit in state court under the 1871 federal
law. The suit named the state police and its director as defendants.
   A state judge in 1982 ruled that Will's rights were violated and
awarded him more than $153,000 for lost wages, emotional distress
and as punitive damages.
   But the Michigan Supreme Court overuled the judge in 1987 and
threw out the suit.
   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police, 87-1207.

   The chicks that appeared on the boss'
desk didn't come from the eggs he'd accidentally left behind, but
rather from the fertile imaginations of office practical jokers.
   Dave Brosman, assistant director of the Albuquerque Public Works
Department, left cartons of eggs on his desk over a four-day
weekend. When he returned on Tuesday, he found two chicks scratching
around on his desk.
   His secretary, Marian Peterson, told him she found the chicks
hatched when she came to work, and she repeated the story to an
Albuquerque newspaper Tuesday.
   But it turns out Peterson hatched the plot with co-worker and egg
dealer Gary Daves, who brought the chicks to work.
   ``It was entertainment that turned larger than life,'' Daves
said. ``Blame it on the silliness of June.''
   Brosman said he really believed the chicks had hatched from the
eggs.
   ``It was a joke that went too far, but it did lighten up the
day,'' he said.

   President Bush says Republican Chairman Lee
Atwater is doing a ``great job,'' despite a widely condemned GOP
memo that likened House Speaker Thomas S. Foley's voting record to
that of a homosexual congressman.
   Bush's praise, at the opening of a two-day Republican National
Committee meeting, came as a prominent GOP campaign official said,
``I was guilty of being inarticulate'' in comments on Atwater's role
in the memo.
   Ed Rollins chairman of the GOP congressional campaign commitee,
said he did not intend to question Atwater's earlier statements
disavowing advance knowledge about the memo. ``I was defending Lee
and I take him at his word,'' he said today.
   ``I've heard myself on tape and I am inarticulate,'' he added.
   Rollins told a party meeting in Indiana earlier this week:
   ``I don't care how nice a man Tom Foley is, and he is a very,
very fine man. Just let me preface this by saying, we made a
terrible mistake last week as a party. The national committee, which
Lee Atwater, my friend and my deputy for four years, his committee
made a very serious mistake. I don't think, I take him at his word
that he didn't know about it. But you can't go out and deal with
innuendos and rumors. You need to go out and deal like I said in
facts.''
   The memo depicted Foley as a liberal and compared his voting
record to that of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged
homosexual congressman. Mark Goodin, an aide to Atwater, resigned
under fire after saying he had approved the memo.
   Bush did not mention the memo episode during a speech Wednesday
night at a fund-raising dinner on the eve of a two-day meeting of
the RNC in Washington. But he had high praise for Atwater.
   ``Lee Atwater is doing a great job,'' the president said. ``He
has been a strong voice and a convincing voice about the need to
reach out to minorities and the disadvantaged.''
   Bush's praise of Atwater brought applause from the partisan crowd.
   Meetings of the party's executive, resolutions and rules
committees were scheduled for today, with Atwater, House Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other GOP leaders scheduled to
speak on Friday.
   Bush also touched obliquely on the recent ethical turmoil in
Congress, saying, ``Clearly it is time for an evenhanded ethical
approach across all branches of government.''
   But, he said, ``We will keep the competition on the issues.''
   Some Democrats have asked Bush to call for Atwater's resignation
because of the RNC memo, which was headed ``Tom Foley: Out of the
Liberal Closet.'' The memo compared the voting record of Foley,
D-Wash., with that of Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual.
   Foley was elected speaker after Wright, D-Texas, resigned the
position in the midst of an investigation by the House ethics
committee. Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., also announced his
resignation after allegations about a purchase of junk bonds. Both
men denied any wrongdoing.
   House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois told the
fund-raiser audience Wednesday night that ``reform of the House must
be at the very heart of our party's effort'' as it moves toward the
1990 congressional elections.

<HEAD>Witness Says Suspect Ranted About Palme Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman testified today that she saw the
man accused of killing Prime Minister Olof Palme shouting in a
drunken rage in September and extolling the leader's death.
   The witness, Sigrid Lovisa Malm, testifed that Carl Gustaf
Christer Pettersson said that if Palme had not been dead already, he
should be killed.
   She said Pettersson also may have said he killed Palme, but she
could not make out his exact words.
   Palme, Sweden's four-term prime minister, was killed Feb. 28,
1986, and his wife, Lisbeth, was wounded when they were attacked by
a gunman as they left a movie theater.
   Pettersson was arrested in December.
   Mrs. Malm, 64, testified that she saw Pettersson at a suburban
train station, ranting against Palme and praising his death.
   She said Pettersson shouted that ``I'' or ``someone'' shot Palme.
She said she was frightened by his drunken aggressiveness and could
not distinquish whether he was saying ``jag,'' the Swedish word for
``I,'' or ``man,'' which means ``someone.''
   The prosecution also produced a witness to contradict
Pettersson's alibi that he spent the evening at a gambling club and
then went home.
   Reinhold Julius Jansson, 60, disputed Pettersson's claim that
Pettersson, Jansson and Lena Akerlund, met at the club a few hours
before Palme was shot.
   Jansson said, ``I can't remember meeting either Christer or Lena
that day.'' Asked if he thought Pettersson was lying, Jansson said:
``Maybe he got the day wrong.''
   Miss Akerlund, who also testified, said she did not trust her
memory because, ``I was constantly on drugs mixed with booze.''
   Pettersson initially was a suspect in the slaying but was not
charged until this year because of a bungled investigation in which
authorities pursued a theory that the killing was the result of an
international conspiracy.
   Palme's widow is to testify on Monday after the court granted a
list of her conditions, including the exclusion of Pettersson from
the courtroom. The court refused, however, to hear her testimony in
a session closed to the public.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Sen. Jack Gordon is withdrawing from the race
for the late Claude Pepper's U.S. House seat just two days after
announcing his candidacy, an aide said today.
   Gordon, 67, became the first Democrat to enter the race for the
seat held by Pepper, a liberal Democrat, since 1962. Aide Mike Petit
refused to say why Gordon was withdrawing. A news conference was
scheduled later today.
   Some Democratic leaders had expressed concern that Gordon, a
Miami Beach liberal first elected to the state Senate in 1972, would
be unable to attract conservative Hispanic voters needed to win the
Aug. 29 election.
   Cuban-born Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, a Democrat, has said he
is considering running but indicated he would be reluctant to oppose
Gordon.
   Two conservative Cuban-American Republicans _ state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and businessman Carlos Perez _ announced their
candidacies last week along with black laywer Jeff Allen. The
district is nearly half Hispanic.
   Pepper died May 30 at age 88. GOP leaders consider his
increasingly conservative district a prime opportunity to pick up a
seat in Congress.

<HEAD>Debate Over Freeing Pro-Iranian Terrorist Reopened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Jacques Chirac has renewed debate
over whether France promised to free a pro-Iranian prisoner who is
serving a life sentence to win freedom for its hostages in Lebanon.
   Answering questions from economics students in suburban
Cergy-Pontoise, Chirac alluded to a possible pardon for Anis
Naccache.
   Naccache, who is Lebanese, is serving a life sentence for leading
an unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to assassinate Shahpour Bakhtiar, a
former Iranian prime minister living in exile in Paris.
   Speaking about Naccache and four other men convicted in the case,
Chirac said Tuesday night: ``One might be well-inspired to consider
the occasion that could be found to free these people in the July 14
pardon, because we are in a period of tension and should not add to
the reasons that might make us targets of terrorism.'' Chirac said
he was speaking from ``intuition,'' not from information of a
particular terrorist threat.
   July 14 is Bastille Day, the holiday commemorating the French
Revolution, and there is a government tradition of issuing pardons
as part of the celebration.
   French newspapers today gave the matter front-page play and
sought to determine Chirac's motives for making the comment.
   Iranian leaders have called for Naccache's release, and his case
was widely reported to have been part of a deal Chirac's government
negotiated in 1988 that brought home all Frenchmen held hostage by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Chirac has denied that freedom for Naccache was part of the deal,
which he said involved only a promise to normalize diplomatic
relations with Iran.
   President Francois Mitterrand, who defeated Chirac in the May
1988 presidential election less than a week after the French
hostages were freed, said he would pardon Naccache only if there was
proof that Chirac's government had made such a promise.
   The Socialist government had no comment on Chirac's statement.
Most political leaders reacted guardedly, although Jean-Marie Le Pen
of the extreme-right National Front said the suggestion of a pardon
was ``indecent.''
   Naccache's former lawyer, Antoine Comte was quoted today in the
leftist daily Liberation as saying Chirac may have intended to lay
the groundwork for a political consensus in favor of a pardon.
   ``If Jacques Chirac says today that a solution must be found,
it's no doubt because he wants to help the president get out of this
affair with the agreement of all political forces,'' Comte was
quoted as saying.
   Naccache has claimed to be a spokesman for the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. It is widely believed that
his attack on Bakhtiar was ordered by senior Iranian officials,
possibly by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini himself.

<HEAD>Court Shields States from Federal Suits on Educating Handicapped
Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today shielded states from
federal court lawsuits by parents seeking to enforce a federal law
aimed at assuring adequate education for handicapped children.
   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in his opinion for the court, said
the broad constitutional immunity from suit enjoyed by states cannot
be eliminated unless Congress makes that intent ``unmistakably clear
in the language of the statute. Evidence of congressional intent
must be both unequivocal and textual.''
   Kennedy said the possible intent of Congress to limit sovereign
immunity for states cannot be inferred, for example, from statements
made by sponsors of a bill on the floor of the House or Senate.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
court was trying to impose rules on Congress retroactively.
   ``It is perfectly clear that again the court ignores Congress'
actual intent to abrogate state immunity ... instead resorting to an
interpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated only
with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball,'' he said.
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Today's ruling applies to lawsuits against states in federal but
not necessarily state courts.
   The high court overturned a ruling last year by the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that said Pennsylvania failed to comply
with procedures established by the Education for All Handicapped
Children Act.
   The 1975 law provides federal aid to states and in return imposes
various requirements on them.
   Pennsylvania was accused of violating procedures aimed at
assuring impartiality and prompt decisions when parents challenge
the adequacy of education programs for their children.
   The 3rd Circuit court ordered Pennsylvania to reimburse Russell
Muth of Bucks County, Pa., for tuition he paid to send his son,
Alexander, to a private school in Massachusetts for the 1983-84
academic year. Muth also was awarded attorneys' fees by the lower
court.
   Alexander, who had been living with his mother in Colombia, was
10 years old in 1980 when he came to live with his father in
Pennsylvania.
   The boy was diagnosed as a gifted handicapped child with a
language learning disability.
   Officials of the Central Bucks School District placed him
initially in special classes for speech and language therapy and in
regular classes for art, music and other activities.
   A dispute arose between Alexander's father and school officials
in 1983 after the boy was ``mainstreamed'' _ placed in regular
classes _ and the experience proved unsuccessful.
   School officials then revised the education program for
Alexander. But his father was dissatisfied and sent his son to the
Landmark School, a private school in Massachusetts, for the 1983-84
academic year. Alexander returned to the Central Bucks schools in
1986.
   Muth sued local and state officials in 1984 in federal court. A
federal judge ruled that the state's procedures for resolving
disputes over schooling for handicappped children violated the 1975
federal law.
   The judge ruled that, even though the program proposed in 1983
for Alexander by public school officials was acceptable, the state
violated Muth's procedural rights.
   The 3rd Circuit court agreed, ruling that the Pennsylvania
secretary of edcuation played an improper role in reviewing Muth's
case.
   The appeals court said the secretary was not sufficiently
impartial to act as a hearing officer in the case and also made Muth
wait too long for a final decision that could be appealed in court.
   The case is Dellmuth vsd. Muth, 87-1855.

<HEAD>Astronomers Find Possible `Brown Dwarf' Objects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have spotted nine objects that may be
``brown dwarfs,'' lumps of gas more massive than planets that
scientists believe exist but have not yet confirmed, a researcher
reports.
   The objects do not appear to be in orbit around stars, where
astronomers had first looked for brown dwarfs. Their apparent
independence from stars bolsters the idea that brown dwarfs may help
explain a key mystery of the cosmos, said William Forrest of the
University of Rochester in New York.
   Forrest spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the work
Thursday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Ann
Arbor, Mich. He did the research with other scientists at his
school, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
   According to theory, there are lumps of gas in the universe that
failed to become stars because they did not ignite the internal
nuclear reaction that makes stars shine. They could still shine a
little because of energy created as their gas collapses under its
own gravity. Scientists who have theorized their existence have
dubbed them brown dwarfs.
   Scientists are interested in brown dwarfs partly because they may
help explain what is called the missing mass problem. Studies show
that outer space contains more matter than scientists have observed,
and nobody knows what form this missing mass takes. Part of it may
be brown dwarfs.
   Astronomers have generally looked for brown dwarfs in orbit
around stars. But the newfound objects may be free-floating instead,
suggesting that brown dwarfs may be far more numerous than they
could be as stellar orbiters, Forrest said.
   So they may make up a significant part of the missing mass
relatively close to the sun and perhaps beyond, he said.
   If brown dwarfs exist, they would be hard to spot because they
would be so dim. Forrest and his colleagues looked toward an area
where stars, and maybe brown dwarfs, are still forming, to catch
brown dwarfs at their brightest.
   They chose a region in the constellation Taurus, where young
stars can be seen amid clouds of gas more than 450 light-years from
Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about
5.9 trillion miles.
   Four of the newfound objects show the strongest evidence of being
brown dwarfs, based on the combination of their brightnesses and
estimated age, Forrest said. Their motion across the sky suggests
they lie within the Taurus clouds, making them perhaps about 1
million years old, he said.
   The argument for the other five objects is based on their reddish
colors. This evidence is ``good, but it isn't really overwhelming,''
Forrest said.
   The newfound objects appear to contain five to 15 times the mass
of Jupiter, the largest planet, which is more than 300 times as
massive as Earth.
   The evidence that the nine objects are free-floating rather than
orbiting around stars comes from analyzing their apparent distances
from nearby stars, Forrest said. Essentially, they tend to be
farther away from the stars than one would expect if they were in
orbit, he said.
   Jonathan Lunine, an expert in brown dwarf theory at the
University of Arizona, said he was not familiar with details of
Forrest's work but that the results seem ``quite sensible.''
   The study also provides ``fairly good evidence he's found some
free-floaters,'' Lunine said.

   The artist died of heart failure June 5 at Palms of Pasadena
Hospital.
   Stern, who retired to Seminole from New York City in 1956, went
to work in 1923 for the National Biscuit Co., where he designed
cartoons, wrappers and boxes.
   His projects included redesigning Nabisco's Animal Crackers box,
which depicts caged lions, tigers and bears in bright colors. Stern
also put the cracker on the Uneeda biscuit box and helped design the
Shredded Wheat Box.
   Stern studied at New York's Art Students League, Columbia
University and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
   The Beaux Arts Gallery plans an Oct. 4 exhibit of his works on

<HEAD>Richardson Case Moves to Hollywood in Dispute Over Movie Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of James Richardson, who
spent 21 years in prison wrongfully accused of murdering his seven
children, has become the center of a war of words between movie
producers and lawyers.
   Richardson wants a feature film about his crusade for freedom
done by producer Steve Jaffe, who bought the dramatic rights to a
1970 book about the case by Richardson's lawyer, Mark Lane.
   ``My project is more accurate,'' said Richardson, freed April 25
in Arcadia after a special prosecutor said he was unjustly accused
in the 1967 murders.
   Lane and Jaffe, Richardson says, control the rights to his life
story.
   But producers Suzanne Stanford and Gene Kraft told the St.
Petersburg Times that they have obtained the rights to ``everybody
except James Richardson,'' including newspaper reporters, Richardson
relatives and Arcadia residents who advanced the case while
Richardson was in jail.
   ``There's a tremendous story that surrounds Richardson during
that time,'' Kraft said. Richardson's trial and legal challenges are
available to any screenwriter as public record, and ``his story is
basically the backdrop,'' he said.
   Kraft said that if that logic fails to impress network
executives, the couple's partner might: David L. Wolper Productions.
   Wolper, known for his extravaganzas for the 1984 Olympics and the
Statue of Liberty centennial, is a ``network reliable,'' one of a
handful of producers programmers go to year after year, he said.
   A Wolper executive confirmed Stanford and Kraft have a contract
to develop the Richardson story, probably as a four-hour miniseries,
the Times reported Thursday.
   Jaffe accused his rival producers of trying to exploit
Richardson, who now works for comedian and diet guru Dick Gregory,
who runs a health and weight-loss clinic in Fort Walton Beach.
   And Lane said: ``They don't have James. They don't have me. I
don't know who else there is.''
   Kraft said that's Lane's whole problem.
   ``My feeling would be that Mark Lane is really going to do, not
the James Richardson story, but the Mark Lane story,'' Kraft said.
   Caught in the middle is Ellis Rubin. He worked with Lane as
Richardson's co-counsel, but was fired after Richardson went free.
Lane claimed Rubin threatened Richardson while trying to cut his own
movie deal.
   Kraft, Stanford and Mark Wolper, David Wolper's son, acknowledge
talking with Rubin. But Rubin would not talk to a reporter _ unusual
for the flamboyant Miami lawyer.
   Lane said Rubin has been silent because Richardson sent a letter
prohibiting him, under the rules of professional responsibility,
from discussing his case.
   Furthermore, Lane says, he will sue to stop any production that
does not pay Richardson for the story of injustice he endured for 21
years.

<HEAD>Four Israeli Soldiers Jailed For Beating Palestinian</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with four soldiers ordered jailed in beating
of Palestinian prisoner. TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KIRYAT MALAKI, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court today sentenced
four Israeli soldiers to up to nine months in jail for their roles
in the beating of a Palestinian who later died in custody.
   The defendants left the courtroom angered by what their attorney
termed ``particularly harsh'' sentences and immediately got into
fistfights with photographers waiting outside.
   A photographer for the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot suffered a
black eye in the 10-minute melee, and a military policeman who was a
friend of one of the soldiers was taken into custody for the assault.
   Also today, police raided a news service run by Sari Nusseibeh, a
Palestinian activist accused by Israel of being a mastermind and PLO
paymaster of the Palestinian uprising.
   Authorities ordered the Holy Land Press Service closed for two
years, and Nusseibeh said he was told to report to police
headquarters for questioning.
   ``The office was being used to advance the goals of the PLO and
find ways to incite the uprising,'' police spokesman Uzi Sandori
said.
   In another development, an Israeli cameraman for ABC-TV was shot
in the head today with a plastic bullet by Israeli troops dispersing
Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank town of Ramallah, a
network producer said. A military official said the television crew
violated an army order putting the area off limits to reporters. The
camaraman was hospitalized in good condition.
   The four soldiers were convicted on May 25 of brutality in the
beating of 42-year-old Hani el-Shami on Aug. 22 while arresting him
in a sweep of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp.
   They had been accused of manslaughter but were acquitted when the
judge ruled that el-Shami died after a second beating inflicted by
other soldiers at a military camp. The other soldiers have not been
charged or tried.
   The judge, Col. Emanuel Gross, today sentenced three of the
soldiers to 18 months in prison, nine months of the term to be
suspended. They were 1st Sgt. Yitzhak Adler, 21; Pvt. Yitzhak
Kibbudi, 20, and Pvt. Ron Hakel, 19.
   A fourth soldier, Pvt. Ariyeh Luchato, 20, was sentenced to a
year in prison, six months suspended, because he arrived in the
middle of the beating.
   Defense Attorney Uziel Atzmon described the sentences as
``particularly harsh, especially since we had the feeling that the
major responsibility fell on the commanders.''
   The case was seen as a test of the army's willingness to
discipline soldiers accused of brutality and focused attention on
the army's beating policy. Since the uprising began December 1987,
516 Palestinians have died and more than 10,000 have been injured.
Twenty-two Israelis have also been killed.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said authorities ordered the Holy
Land Press Service because the office in Israeli-annexed Arab east
Jerusalem, ``was being used to advance the goals of the PLO and find
ways to incite the uprising.''
   About two dozen police officers who entered Nusseibeh's
second-floor office carried out boxes and plastic bags filled with
papers.
   Officers changed the office lock and welded the entrance shut.
   ``I have no idea why this was done,'' Nusseibeh, a philosophy
professor at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University, told reporters.
   Sandori said police had evidence the office was being used to
help the PLO and its Fatah faction headed by PLO chief Yasser
Arafat. The PLO is outlawed in Israel. Sandori said police will
review the papers ``and then we will see if we have a good reason to
investigate him. But we wanted to close his office.''
   The Ramallah shooting occurred at 11 a.m. when the ABC crew was
filming Israeli troops dispersing a stone-throwing riot, said ABC
producer Lynn Eshel.
   The bullet struck cameraman Shlomo Franco, 42, above one eye.
   Yael Bossem, a spokeswoman at Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital in
Jerusalem, said Franco was conscious. Franco was later said to be in
good condition.
   A photographer who visited him saw three fragments of a
brownish-gray plastic bullet that had been removed by doctors.
   The army official said the crew was at the scene of a
late-morning skirmish between soldiers and about 50 Palestinian
youths.
   ``The commanding officer at the scene presented the TV crew with
a warrant closing the area. The crew left, went around the block and
returned on the side of the demonstrators,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said soldiers did not see the crew and opened fire with rubber
and plastic ammunition, wounding the cameraman, the official said.
   ``They disregarded the closure order and covered the story from
the side of the people who were disturbing public order,'' said the
official.

   A jury awarded $300,000 to a woman who
swooned and fell at a faith-healing ceremony and fractured her back.
   Evelyn E. Kuykendall, 67, of Marshville, N.C., spent two months
in a hospital after no one broke her fall during a ``laying on of
hands'' in 1988.
   The faith healers, Charles and Frances Hunter of Kingwood, Texas,
had testified during the federal court trial that Mrs. Kuykendall
fell in a ``peculiar way'' and their ``catchers'' were not able to
reach her.
   The verdict against the Hunters and their City of Light
Ministries was reached on Wednesday.
   ``I had my eyes closed in prayer and I recall swaying, but when I
fell, I fell directly backwards and hit my lower back first,'' said
Mrs. Kuykendall.
   Asked if she could have fallen in some strange way, she said, ``I
don't see how. I'd done this many times and always been caught.''
   Mrs. Kuykendall's belief in faith healing has not been shaken
``one bit,'' and she holds no hard feelings toward the Hunters, said
her husband, Marion.
   Mrs. Kuykendall suffers from a spinal disease unrelated to the
fall and was led into the courtroom bent nearly double.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today said the
Berlin Wall is ``no great problem'' in East-West relations, and he
applauded NATO's new willingness to negotiate cuts in short-range
missiles.
   At a news conference in Bonn on the final day of his four-day
state visit, the Soviet leader praised the results of his talks with
West German leaders as having opened a new path toward improved ties
among European nations.
   He hailed a declaration on European goals that he signed with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday as the visit's most important
accomplishment, a step toward ``dissolving the confrontational
nature of our relations.''
   After a visit to West Germany's industrial Ruhr Valley and a
meeting with political leaders in North Rhine-Westphalia state,
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, departed for Moscow from Duesseldorf
Airport at 6:26 p.m.
   The Gorbachevs drew applause, cheers and shouts of approval from
more than 8,000 workers at the Dortmund headquarters of Hoesch, a
giant steel concern.
   At the Bonn news conference, Gorbachev was asked if he considered
the Berlin Wall, which divides the two Germanys, an unacceptable
symbol of a time of more troubled relations.
   ``I don't think the Berlin Wall is the sole barrier between East
and West,'' Gorbachev told about 500 journalists at the summit press
center. ``We must improve many situations in Europe.''
   He observed that ``nothing is eternal'' and conditions on the
continent may some day make all border obstructions obsolete. But he
said of the Berlin Wall in conclusion: ``I see this as no great
problem.''
   At the news conference attended by his wife, Raisa, and senior
officials of the Kremlin delegation, Gorbachev was asked if he could
envision a day when Europe would recognize a single Germany.
   ``The situation in Europe today was determined by historical
realities,'' Gorbachev responded. But he added that the continent is
undergoing great political change and ``time will tell.''
   ``We can hope that we are on the right path'' to better relations
among European states, the Kremlin leader said.
   In his 25-minute opening statement, Gorbachev welcomed the new
NATO position on short-range missiles reached in Brussels last
month. NATO agreed that a partial reductiion of the missiles could
be negotiated once an agreement to balance conventional forces
begins being put into effect.
   The Brussels document contains ``quite a few positive and
constructive elements,'' he said. But he added that the Soviets do
not view it as a major breakthrough since it contains ``a lot of
elements of the old philosophy,'' such as reliance on nuclear
deterrence.
   Gorbachev spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated
simultaneously into English.
   Asked by a Soviet journalist whether he was surprised by his
enthusiastic reception by thousands of cheering West Germans,
Gorbachev said he attributed the welcome in part to the hopes pinned
on his policies.
   ``In the whole world, people want changes for the better,'' he
said. ``They are tired of the Cold War.''
   The Kremlin leader, who outscores President Bush and Kohl in West
German opinion polls, has been warmly received since his arrival on
Monday. Not since President John F. Kennedy's visit in 1961 have
West Germans given a foreign statesman such a jubilant reception.
   In reply to another question, the Soviet leader hedged on the
government crackdown in China. He stressed that ``all of us are very
much concerned at what is happening'' and expressed hope that ``the
people and the government of China can find a way out'' of their
difficulties.
   A moment of humor occurred at the news conference when a
Czechoslovak journalist questioning Gorbachev addressed him as ``Mr.
President.''
   ``Since when have I become a Mister?'' asked Gorbachev, alluding
to the practice among officials of communist nations of addressing
each other as ``comrade.''
   The journalist replied that he had used the term because ``we are
in the Federal Republic of Germany,'' then repeated his question to
``Mr. Comrade President'' Gorbachev.
   The Kremlin leader's news conference lasted barely an hour,
including the opening statement.
   Gorbachev was then given a formal farewell from Bonn by President
Richard von Weizsaecker before he traveled to Dortmund in the
industrial heartland of the Ruhr. He flies home from Duesseldorf
later today.

   Actor-director Sam Wanamaker celebrated his 70th
birthday at a ground-breaking ceremony for a replica of William
Shakespeare's Globe Theater.
   After 20 years of planning and fund-raising, Wanamaker signed a
$30 million contract with a construction company to build his
project close to the theater's original site on the south bank of
the River Thames.
   ``This is the second most important day of my life,'' the
American-born Wanamaker said at the ceremony Wednesday.
   The most important day, he said, will be April 23, 1992, the
scheduled completion date for his project, to be called the
International Shakespeare Globe Center. April 23 is Shakespeare's
birthday.
   The complex will be a center for Shakespeare studies and will
house two theaters, one of them a replica of the Globe, where
Shakespeare's plays were performed in the bard's lifetime. It will
also include an exhibition area, offices, restaurant, apartments and
shops.
   The original Globe Theater was built in 1599 and burned down in
1613. It was rebuilt, but was finally demolished in 1644.
Wanamaker's complex is believed to be a few hundred yards from the
original site. Archaeologists are working to locate the exact site.
   Nearby are the recently excavated foundations of the Rose
Theater, the only relic of a theater of Shakespeare's day to have
been found.

   Who's back, and which concert tickets
are gone?
   Within an hour and a half, some 5,000 tickets were sold Wednesday
at the Glens Falls Civic Center for the opening concert of the Who's
reunion tour this summer, their first performance in six years.
   Heavy rains may have soaked those in line but it did not dampen
their enthusiasm.
   ``I dropped my kid off and came flying,'' said Carol Alden of
South Glens Falls, who'd gotten the news of ticket sales from a
friend.
   The British band opens its 36-date summer stadium tour June 21 in
the 8,200-seat Glens Falls Civic Center on the edge of the
Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York.
   A last-minute decision to make fewer tickets available, including
eliminating standing-room tickets, helped speed sales, event
organizers said.
   The band's stage was ``so humongous,'' the center needed the
extra space, said Event Coordinator Jeff Barrett.
   Joe Patterson, 24, of Utica was first in line and forked over
$100 for four front-row seats, then pumped a clenched fist in the
air to the cheers of the crowd.
   ``This,'' he said, ``is awesome.''

   Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber sold a 200-year-old
cello at auction Thursday for nearly $125,000 to help pay for his
divorce settlement.
   The cello, made by Guiseppe Guadagnini in 1791, was purchased by
a private German buyer, said a spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction
house. But don't worry, Lloyd Webber still has a Stradivarius cello.
   The younger brother of megamusical composer Andrew Lloyd Webber
said recently that he was selling the cello to help pay for his
divorce settlement. He and his wife, Celia, got a divorce in April
after a 15-year marriage.
   Lloyd Webber used the cello in many live performances and
recordings. He was once quoted as saying: ``The relationship between
me and my cello is like a marriage. Nothing, and I mean nothing,
comes between us.''
   The Sotheby's spokeswoman said the auction house was ``very
pleased'' with the price, which outstripped the pre-sale estimate.
She said Lloyd Webber's Stradivarius cello is worth at least twice
the price of the Guadagnini.
   ``Of course he is nostalgic about his cello but I think he feels
it is a shame to have such a nice instrument unused,'' she said.

   Lee Iacocca told television executives to
start censoring their shows, or advertisers, including his own
Chrysler Corp., may pull out their commercials.
   The Chrysler chairman said Tuesday that viewers are tired of
trash TV and are venting their rage on the big advertisers with
angry letters and boycotts.
   ``I don't want to be the censor; I want you to do it,'' he said
in an address to the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society.
   Iacocca warned that companies such as Chrysler, which spends $250
million a year on television, could withdraw advertising from
objectionable programming if steps are not taken to tone down the
``bedroom bingo'' and violence.
   ``Help get me and every other sponsor out of the censorship
business,'' he said. ``We don't want the job.''
   He agreed that some complaining viewers are ``fanatics,'' but
said most are not. ``Don't write them off as a fringe group,'' he
said. ``They've found out they have clout and they're going to use
it.''
   A number of advertisers have reacted to consuer complaints since
a Michigan woman earlier this year got some advertisers to cancel
spots in Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children.''

   Kris Kristofferson wrote a song in Abbie
Hoffman's honor, and director John Avildsen of ``Rocky'' fame
created a video of the late political activist's life.
   Both works will be part of a memorial tribute planned for
Saturday in New York City. Among the expected guests are Norman
Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, Amy Carter, Buster Poindexter, Daniel
Ellsberg, Paul Krassner, Wavy Gravy and surviving members of the
Chicago Seven. Hoffman's three children are also expected.
   ``A man who led such an extraordinary life will be commemorated
by just a few of the thousands who knew, admired and loved him,''
said Abby Hirsch, one of the organizers of the event.
   Hoffman, 52, committed suicide April 12 at his New Hope, Pa.,
home with an overdose of phenobarbital.
   The memorial, ``No Regrets: A Tribute to Abbie Hoffman,'' takes
its title from Hoffman's final public speech, given to students at
Vanderbilt University about his political and social activism.
   He ended that speech by saying, ``I regret nothing.''
   Other memorials have also been held in Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Los Angeles.

   People who do not own property may not be
excluded for that reason from membership on a public body empowered
to recommend a reorganization of local government, a unanimous
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said a
land-ownership requirement for appointment to such a public agency
violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law
for all people.
   ``The mere fact that the board of freeholders considers land-use
issues cannot suffice to sustain a land-ownership requirement in
this case,'' he said.
   The St. Louis freeholder board was created to write a proposed
charter for reorganizing the city and county government structure.
The board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the
city and county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were appointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the
county executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, in a suit on behalf of himself and all others in the city
and county who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the
U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom from unlawful
discrimination.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last year that the
constitutional protection does not apply because the freeholder
board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   Blackmun said today that even though the freeholder board has a
limited role, that does not mean its composition can violate
constitutional protections against ``invidious discrimination.''
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

<HEAD>Probe May Get to the Bottom of Rumors of Rocky Flats Nuclear Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal investigation at Rocky Flats may
get to the bottom of decade-old rumors of a nuclear chain reaction
occurring at the weapons plant during fires 20 or more years ago.
   Rocky Flats critics long have suspected that such a reaction,
which could send radioactivity into the air, happened during one or
both fires in 1957 and 1969.
   Studies in 1977 and 1987 revealed relatively high quantities of
two radioactive elements that can be produced during a nuclear
reaction, but officials at the time said their presence can be
explained in several other ways.
   Rocky Flats officials have denied the fires led to a chain
reaction, although it was acknowledged that plutonium was released
into the atmosphere as a result of the blazes.
   The Denver Post today quoted unidentified sources as saying that
if a chain reaction did occur at Rocky Flats, evidence of it may
surface in Department of Energy or Rockwell International Corp.
documents regarding waste disposal.
   Federal agents raided the plant June 6 as part of an
investigation of alleged illegal storage and disposal of hazardous
waste at the plant.
   Rocky Flats, 16 miles from Denver, manufactures plutonium
triggers for nuclear bombs. It is operated for DOE by Rockwell.
   Dr. Carl Johnson, former Jefferson County health director, first
raised the issue of a possible nuclear reaction at Rocky Flats. In
1977, he found relatively high levels of radioactive cesium in soil
samples outside the plant.
   A 1987 Rockwell study of groundwater at Rocky Flats found high
levels of strontium.
   Cesium and strontium are produced during a nuclear reaction.
   Rockwell and DOE officials said the cesium and strontium came
from fallout from atmospheric bomb tests in Nevada and elsewhere.
   But Rocky Flats critics said the levels are too high to be caused
by fallout, and the Environmental Protection Agency asked the plant
in 1987 for more precise tests.
   Rockwell and DOE officials are conducting those tests, said Nat
Miullo, Rocky Flats project director for the EPA in Denver.
   ``The levels are still extremely low, and no data we have now
indicate that such a reaction occurred,'' Miullo said. But he said
the EPA would not accept Rocky Flats' explanation for the elements'
presence without further evidence.
   ``To reach that conclusion, based on less than high-quality data,
is something we will not stand beside,'' Miullo told The New York
Times.
   He said the strontium and cesium also may have been used in the
calibration of testing instruments and then dumped on the ground, or
they may have showed up as the result of false readings.

<HEAD>Court Rules States May Be Forced to Help Pay to Clean Hazardous Waste
Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may be forced, through private lawsuits,
to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites targeted under the
so-called Superfund Act, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Constitution's Commerce
Clause gives Congress the power to strip state governments of their
constitutional immunity against private lawsuits.
   The decision will force Pennsylvania to defend itself against a
lawsuit by Union Gas. Co. aimed at recovering the clean-up costs the
company owes the federal government.
   Officials from Pennsylvania and 17 other states had told the
hight court that a ruling against Pennsylvania could expose states
to $100 billion in Superfund clean-up costs.
   Hazardous coal tar from an abandoned Union Gas facility began
seeping into Brodhead Creek near Stroudsburg, Pa., after state flood
control officials struck the deposit during excavation in 1980.
   Federal environmental officials worked with Pennsylvania to clean
up the problem, at a cost of about $1.4 million.
   The federal government then sued Union Gas to recover part of the
money, invoking the Superfund law _ also known as the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.
   Union Gas, in turn, sued Pennsylvania. Its lawsuit accused the
state of negligently contributing to the discharge of the hazardous
material.
   The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that 1986 amendments to the Superfund law eliminated the states'
constitutional immunity in such cases and the suit could go forward.
   The appeals court said the Constitution's Commerce Clause allows
Congress to eliminate such immunity.
   Today, the Supreme Court agreed.
   Writing the court's main opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said
the Superfund law ``renders states liable in money damages in
federal court,'' and added that ``Congress has the authority to
render them so liable when legislating pursuant to the Commerce
Clause.''
   He was joined fully by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens and, in part, by Justice Byron R.
White.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to dismiss the suit
against Pennsylvania. They said the state's immunity should prevail.
   Pennsylvania officials, with the support of 17 other states, said
the appeals court ruling wrongly exposed them to great financial
burdens.
   Federal environmental officials have listed some 22,000 hazardous
waste sites with clean-up costs approaching $100 billion, the state
officials said.
   Supporting Pennsylvania's appeal were New York, California,
Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,
New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Utah, Vermont and West Virginia.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.

<TEXT>
   A 2,000-foot-long section of beach on this
tiny resort island was declared an emergency area as the Gulf of
Mexico eats away beach front and threatens to wash away a motel.
   Workers for the island's municipal government started putting
sandbags around the Edgewater Motel late Wednesday, 24 hours after
the state of emergency was declared.
   ``There's no danger of the building falling overnight,'' Mayor
Andy Valence said as water lapped at the pilings under the
Edgewater. But, he said, something had to be done to protect the
building and nearby Louisiana Highway 1, the only route to and from
the island.
   ``It's bad. I don't know what's going to happen,'' said motel
owner Henrietta Collins. ``I have apartments right on the beach, and
it's washing my pilings out. I've already lost my land.''
   She said that before Hurricane Gilbert last year, the beach
extended out a hundred yards from her motel.
   Hurricanes last year eroded large areas, but such huge storms
aren't the only problem, Valence said. Wind up to 20 mph in recent
days has contributed to choppy water that accelerates natural
erosion.
   ``Last week on one day we lost five feet. Now, with the southwest
winds and about 3-foot seas, the beach area in the middle part of
the island is really being damaged,'' Valence said.
   Grand Isle's erosion problems have become more apparent in recent
years, as state and federal officials have become more aware of the
loss of marshy land all along Louisiana's coast.
   Louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of its coastal marshes
every year, about an acre every 15 minutes, an area the size of
Rhode Island over the past 30 years. More than 100 barrier islands
have disappeared off the Louisiana coast in 50 years.
   Part of the loss is due to salt water intrusion through canals
dredged for cypress logging at the turn of the century and for
oilfield exploration and development over the past 50 years. The
salt water kills vegetation that holds the marshes together.
   But most of the loss stems from the taming of the Mississippi
River, which used to spread tons of silt and fresh water through the
marshes, rebuilding wetlands and barrier islands. With levees the
length of the river and 27 sets of locks and dams along the
Mississippi and its tributaries, the silt no longer reaches the
marshes.

   A wind-whipped brush fire charred more
than 375 acres and destroyed two houses, a trailer and six other
structures before being contained.
   ``Fire season is definitely here,'' said Chris Morgan, spokesman
for the California Department of Forestry, urging Northern
California residents to take extra care to trim shrubs and grass
around their homes for fire protection.
   His agency had no damage estimate for the single-family homes
that were lost in Wednesday's fire southeast of San Francisco.
Officials did not know if the trailer served as a home. The
remaining structures were believed to have been sheds and other
types of storage facilities.
   Morgan said gusty afternoon wind was a major obstacle to
controlling the fire, but it was declared contained after about 4{
hours of work by more than 50 firefighters, 16 fire engines, a
bulldozer, a helicopter and three air tankers.

<HEAD>Sleaze Takes Center Stage in Greece Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men who aspire to lead Greece into the
1990s are locked in political combat so blunt and bellicose that
allegations of illicit sex, government corruption and even Nazi
sympathies have buried the issues.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, 70, and opposition leader Constantine
Mitsotakis, 71, head into Sunday's national elections on the heels
of what many have called the most slanderous campaign since the
return to democracy in 1974.
   ``Most people buy three newspapers a day to find out who is
stealing, who is selling out, and who is having sex with who,'' said
film director Nikos Koundouros.
   The feud between the two men, whose personal emnity dates back to
1965, has obscured the fact that Greece has the highest inflation
rate, biggest deficit and weakest currency in the European Economic
Community.
   ``These phenomena are characteristic of a war of mutual
destruction between two gladiators, and of efforts to shift the
people's attention from the country's burning issues,'' says
Leonidas Kyrkos, a leader of a leftist coalition that is Greece's
third major political force.
   The Interior Ministry says 7.89 million Greeks are eligible to
vote the 300 seats in Parliament. A party that wins a majority can
name the premier and Cabinet.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement controls 154 of the
seats, Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy party holds 111 and
the remaining 45 are split between 20 small parties and independents.
   Mitsotakis' party led by about 10 percentage points in recent
polls. But 15 percent of voters were undecided and the close race
raises the possibility of a coalition or minority government.
   Mitsotakis has hammered away at a financial scandal shaking
Papandreou's government, and opposition newspapers are having a
field day with the premier's affair with a much younger woman and
his divorce Friday from his American-born wife, Margaret.
   Nude photos of Papandreou's 35-year-old fiancee, Dimitra Liani,
became almost daily fixtures in right-wing newspapers after the
premier announced the affair in September.
   ``He has made us the laughing stock of the world,'' Mitsotakis
tells supporters.
   The pro-government daily Avriani responded with what it alleged
were transcripts of Mitsotakis' intimate telephone conversations
with a woman who was not his wife. And a radio station owned by the
newspaper aired the almost inaudible tapes for days.
   ``No politician in Greece has been slurred as much as I have and
this is a continuation of those attacks,'' Mitsotakis said the day
after the tapes aired. ``Andreas Papandreou and (government security
services) are behind this.''
   The opposition press recently published excerpts from a diary
kept by the premier's former chief bodyguard that alleges
Papandreou's involvement in numerous sexual liaisons, telephone
tapping and other intrigues.
   ``That is how pitiful they have become. Their slander does not
touch us,'' Papandreou said at a recent campaign rally.
   The mudslinging is fueled by the partisan nature of Greece's mass
media.
   ``People have become used to the poison,'' said Serapheim
Fyntanides, managing editor of the liberal daily Eleftherotypia.
   Fyntanides' newspaper ran a blank front page one day this month
to protest the sleazy campaign.
   Papandreou handily defeated Mitsotakis in the 1985 elections. But
the men have been bitter rivals since Mitsotakis defected from the
party run by Panpandreou's father in 1965.
   Both accuse the other of engaging in political intrigues that led
to the military dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 until 1974.
   The insinuations can be as deadly as the blunt accusations. One
government newspaper runs a half-page photo daily of Mitsotakis
flanked by two German soldiers, implying he collaborated with the
Nazis during World War II.
   Mitsotakis points out that he was a member of the resistance,
arrested twice and sentenced to death by the Nazis in his native
Crete. When the picture first appeared in 1985, he responded that
both Germans were sympathizers of the resistance.
   Papandreou's party portrays the New Democracy as too willing to
sell out to foreign interests and buckle to U.S. influence.
   Mitsotakis contends the ruling party ``has cost the country 400
billion drachmas ($2.3 billion) in 24 of the better-known scandals.''
   George Koskotas, a Greek financier jailed in the United States,
alleges Papandreou authorized the $200 million looting of Koskotas'
Bank of Crete as a way to finance the governing party.
   Mitsotakis advocates a free market economy and pledges to
streamline Greek bureaucracy and cut the 14 percent annual inflation
rate. He said he considers NATO membership and U.S. military bases
vital to Greece's defense.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to pull Greece out of
NATO and the EEC and to close the American military bases here.
However, the premier now says Greece benefits from its membership in
both groups and his government is close to a new bases agreement
with the United States.

   Honor Tracy, a travel writer, columnist and author
of novels that satirized Irish and English society, has died at the
age of 75.
   Miss Tracy died at a nursing home in Oxford on Tuesday. The cause
of death was not given.
   Born and educated in England, she traveled extensively from the
home base she set up in rural Ireland, and published novels and
books set in the British Isles, the West Indies, Japan and Spain.
   From Ireland, she wrote a witty weekly column for The Sunday
Times of London, and became known for her idiosyncratic, original
views, especially when she sued her own newspaper in 1954 for
impugning her professional reputation.
   The paper, facing a lawsuit from an Irish priest who felt
maligned by Miss Tracy's column, ran an apology without consulting
her.
   Miss Tracy won her lawsuit against The Sunday Times, the judge
describing her as ``a woman of great resolution and determination.''
   She published her first fiction in magazines in 1943 while
working for the British Ministry of Information.
   Her hilarious account of Irish life, ``Mind You, I've Said
Nothing!'' was published in 1953, followed the next year by her
first novel, ``The Deserters,'' about military policewomen.
   She wrote half a dozen novels, the most successful of which was
``The Straight and Narrow Path,'' in 1956.
   A brief marriage ended in divorce. She had no children.

   It's not the fish that are biting in
western Ireland, it's the voters.
   Anger about the government's fishing-license law was the oddest
but hardly the least significant issue in Ireland's national
election Thursday.
   The nation's unwanted reputation as a net exporter of people was
an issue, closely linked with continuing high unemployment.
   Cuts in the national health service brought complaints of
patients being left on gurneys because no beds were available, and
every party promised to spend money to improve matters.
   In western Ireland, the fishing license uproar dominated the
campaign. ``I am totally baffled by it,'' Prime Minister Charles
Haughey confessed. ``I think it's the most extraordinary development
ever in Irish politics.''
   Haughey's government pushed through the license plan _ 15 pounts
(about $20.25) a year for trout and 10 pounds (about $13.50) for
other fish, effective Jan. 1, 1988.
   Outraged anglers aren't just refusing to pay. They've shut down
fishing in trout-filled waters such as Lough Corrib, and with it the
tourist industry.
   Signs around Oughterard, on the lough shore, scream defiance:
``no rod license.''
   In County Galway, the combined fishing clubs turned out 200
members to canvass against candidates from Haughey's Fianna Fail
party.
   The rod license made political bedfellows of candidates of Fine
Gael, the party of shopkeepers, and the Workers Party, Ireland's
disciples of Karl Marx.
   Michael Ryan, who owns a guest house in Cong and chairs the local
Fianna Fail branch, campaigned this year for an independent who
opposed the rod license.
   ``I'm not changing my politics,'' he said. ``I'm just fighting
them on this issue.''
   Eamon O Cuiv, a member of the Dail, or parliament, from Galway
West, said he hears about the issue ``every day of the week, not
just here but right around the country.''
   ``It's only 15 pounds,'' Haughey declared in exasperation on a
radio phone-in program.
   It's not pounds but principles, said a caller, to which Haughey
retorted: ``Principles get people in an awful lot of trouble.''
   The fish license was only one of the burning issues as the 2.4
million eligible voters went to the polls to choose among 367
candidates for the 166-seat Dail.
   Turnout was 20 percent by lunchtime, on target to match the 73
percent in 1987. Voters were also electing 15 members to the
European Parliament.
   Haughey found himself in a lot of trouble over cuts in the health
service.
   In pursuit of lower budget deficits, the 63-year-old prime
minister closed 15 hospitals with the loss of 3,600 beds.
   In the last general election, in 1987, Haughey had campaigned
against the health cuts proposed by the Fine Gael-Labor coalition
government, and he has been reminded frequently of Fianna Fail
billboards two years ago which said: ``HEALTH CUTS HURT THE OLD, THE
SICK AND THE HANDICAPPED.''
   Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, a 44-year-old Dublin economist,
promised to take $40 million from the National Lottery and spend it
on health. Haughey has promised total health expenditures of $1.75
billion.
   Emigration, which had been 24,000 a year under Haughey's
predecessor, Garret FitzGerald, has climbed past 30,000 during
Haughey's watch.
   Campaigning in Arklow, Dukes heard Fine Gael Councillor Vincent
McElheron tally the losses: 600 gone from the town in eight months,
four families departed just from one row of six houses. ``We used to
have a boom town,'' McElheron said. ``Now it's dead.''
   Haughey pointed to 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing and trade in
1988. Subtract the lost jobs and it was only a net gain of 3,000,
but that was the first significant increase after the country lost
75,000 jobs between 1980 and 1987.
   Soldiers' pay also figures. Three soldiers' wives were running on
the single issue of better pay for their husbands.
   Haughey continued to preach fiscal restraint, sometimes at a
personal level.
   To a woman in Kilkenny who shouted a demand for a 5 percent
increase in the widows' pension, Haughey retorted: ``You're young
enough and good looking enough to get married again.''

   Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton
pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida
Panhandle city when an electronic problem shut down the cash
registers.
   The 71-year-old Walton, one of the world's richest men, grabbed a
note pad Tuesday evening and started hand-writing merchandise prices
for customers so their bills could more quickly be tallied on
calculators.
   ``People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him,''
said store manager Paul Sively. ``He shook their hands and talked to
everyone he could. The registers were out for about 45 minutes, and
I don't think we had one customer complain.''
   Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to
the store because it was staging a concert by country singer Jana
Jea in its parking lot later in the day. Walton often attends
promotional events for his Arkansas-based chain of discount stores,
and Sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance.
   Walton continued talking with customers during the concert. He
also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in
the Wal-Mart cheer.
   ``He was up there saying, `Give me a W! Give me an A!,' and the
customers went right along with him,'' Sively said. ``He even got
down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court, which touched off an uproar last year by considering
reversal of a key civil rights decision, today upheld the 1976
ruling that has been a powerful tool to fight racial discrimination.
   The justices unanimouly reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted to
help freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused of
race bias.
   But the court, by a separate 5-4 vote, also ruled that the
123-year-old civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racial
harassment.
   The case is Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, 87-107.
   
   STATES-CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court gave states and state officials sweeping new protection
from federal lawsuits accusing them of civil rights violations.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they may
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against
``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.
   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police, 87-1207.
   
   REVERSE PATERNITY
   
   The court gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he
fathered the child of a woman married to someone else.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.
   
   HANDICAPPED CHILDREN
   
   The court shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents
seeking to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate
education for handicapped children.
   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.
   The case is Dellmuth vs. Muth, 87-1855
   
   SUPERFUND
   
   The court ruled states may be forced, through private lawsuits,
to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites targeted under the
so-called Superfund Act.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Constitution's Commerce
Clause gives Congress the power to strip state governments of their
constitutional immunity against private lawsuits.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.
   
   INSURANCE TAXES
   
   The court resolved a tax dispute between the insurance industry
and the Internal Revenue Service in a decision dealing a significant
financial setback to many insurance companies.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that the ``ceding
commissions'' a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another
firm's policies may not be claimed as deductions for the year they
are paid.
   The case is Colonial American Life vs. Commissioner, Internal
Revenue, 88-396.
   
   FREEHOLDERS
   
   The court ruled unanimously that people who do not own property
may not be excluded for that reason from membership on a public body
empowered to recommed a reorganization of local government.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

   The Vietnamese government has informed the
United States it will return next week the remains of what it
believes are 28 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Spokesman Pete Williams said the transfer of the remains would
occur Wednesday, with a team of U.S. military officials flying to
Hanoi. The remains will be flown to an Army laboratory in Hawaii for
possible identification, he said.
   The repatriation will be the 10th since August 1987, when the
United States made a special effort to enlist greater assistance
from Vietnam in accounting for missing Americans.
   The group of 28 is one of the largest to be returned by the
Vietnamese government. The largest repatriation occurred last
December and involved the remains of 38 individuals.
   ``The U.S. government recognizes and appreciates the efforts of
the Vietnamese government which resulted in this unilateral
repatriation and hopes that such accelerated cooperation will
continue to bring increased accountability for Americans still
missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Vietnam.''
   The Pentagon said it had not received any information from
Vietnam on precisely where the various remains had been recovered or
the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
   Currently, 2,353 Americans continue to be listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,719 are listed
as missing in Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 200 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army lab since the end of the war.
   In the past, remains repatriated by Vietnam have occasionally
included those of Vietnamese individuals. As a result, the Pentagon
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be
individually identified by the Army laboratory in Honolulu.

<TEXT>
   Hecklers and a last-minute lawsuit failed to stop
the opening today of Underground Atlanta, a $142 million complex of
shops, restaurants and clubs designed to put the fun back into
downtown Atlanta.
   Mayor Andrew Young's speech was drowned out by homeless advocates
blowing whistles and chanting, ``Atlanta keeps the homeless
underground.'' Police said six protesters were moved. They were not
immediately charged.
   Earlier today, a judge refused to block the developers from
calling the project Underground Atlanta, ruling against a company
called Underground Atlanta Inc. that claims to hold the rights to
the name.
   The project, the result of a three-year overhaul by The Rouse
Co., is seen by backers as the solution to the common complaint that
there's not much fun downtown. It offers 22 restaurants and clubs
and nearly 100 retailers.
   At a news conference, Young said Underground Atlanta has given
the city's center a boost of confidence and strengthened its shaky
investment climate.
   ``Its importance to the city of Atlanta was a heart transplant,''
he said. ``What we've done is put in a new heart. ... It makes other
things happen.''
   At the opening ceremony, Young angrily began defending the city's
record on the homeless against hecklers, then gave up trying to
speak. The number of demonstrators was unclear because they were
scattered throughout the crowd.
   Wind and rain moved through the city just before the complex
opened, but the party, held in a covered area, went on as planned.
About 2,000 attended, with 2,000 more milling about the complex, far
fewer than the hoped-for tens of thousands.
   The original Underground Atlanta opened in the city's viaducts in
1969 but closed in 1982 under the perception that it was riddled
with crime. The new version is around the original site but is three
times bigger.

<HEAD>University Identifies Itself as Major Polluter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The picturesque University of California, Los
Angeles, campus is one of Southern California's major sources of
pollution, says a UCLA study.
   The university creates 15,000 tons of solid waste, 800 tons of
medical waste and 100 tons of hazardous waste such as asbestos,
poisons and explosive chemicals each year, researchers in the
Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning estimated.
   State legislators have expressed interest in the study because
universities historically have been exempt from many environmental
regulations.
   Officials at the campus, located in an area of gentle rolling
hills six miles from the Pacific Ocean and 12 miles from downtown
Los Angeles, said they will study the report and consider some of
its recommendations.
   The university's manicured grounds, filled with palm trees,
magnolias and acres of green grass, even come under criticism in the
study. Those grounds require huge amounts of water in an arid region
that might be better served by desert vegetation, the study said.
   ``We do not mean to imply that UCLA is a worse polluter than
other universities and certainly not than some industries. But it
certainly plays a role,'' said Robert Gottlieb, faculty adviser to
the six graduate students who wrote the study. He described the
findings for a Los Angeles Times story Thursday, a day in advance of
the study's release.
   ``The purpose of the study is to show, as graphically as
possible, what that role is and ... how a university like UCLA, with
all of its intellectual and scientific resources, is uniquely
positioned to start solving some of the nation's most complex
environmental problems.''
   The campus is the city's third largest user of electricity, the
eighth largest consumer of water and with its large fleet of
vehicles, the 10th largest producer of carbon monoxide, the study
says.
   Some suggestions in the study for cutting down on waste include
using coffee mugs instead of disposable cups, making photocopies on
both sides of a sheet of paper, replacing campus mail envelopes with
reusable folders.

   Arrested pro-democracy activists with shaved heads
and placards hanging around their necks were paraded on Chinese
television Thursday, and three others were sentenced to death for
torching a train during a riot.
   The executions, ordered by a Shanghai court, were the first in
the nationwide crackdown on the student-led demonstrations for a
freer China.
   Television news also said a student leader surrendered to
authorities.
   More than 1,000 people have been arrested nationwide since army
troops and tanks moved into Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 3-4
to suppress the movement, which called for freedom of the press and
an end to official corruption.
   The violent confrontation touched off demonstrations and riots in
cities throughout China.
   On June 6, crowds set a train ablaze after it ran through a
barricade erected by demonstrators near Shanghai station, killing
six people.
   Official media reported 21 railway security officials were beaten
by protesters. It said the rail line was closed for 50 hours, nine
train carriages ruined and 900 bags of mailed burned.
   The three condemned men ``frenziedly smashed the railway
carriages and set fire to police motorcycles and the carriages''
during the attack, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. ``They
also prevented firefighters from extinquishing the fire and beat
them cruelly.''
   Xinhua identified the men as Xu Guoming, a contract worker at a
brewery, Bian Hanwu, who is unemployed, and Yan Xuerong, a radio
factory worker. They were given three days to appeal.
   Seven more people were on trial in the case, Shanghai radio said.
   Another 26 workers were shown on the noon TV news being led by
armed police onto a stage before a packed hall in the northeastern
city of Changchun.
   Several had large placards around their necks giving their names
and their sentence to labor reform, a type of prison. They were
accused of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors.
   The placards were similar to a practice during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, when ultra-leftist Red Guards paraded their
victims through the streets wearing humiliating signs on their
chests. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who won the power struggle
after Mao Tse-tung's death in 1976, was among those persecuted
during the Cultural Revolution.
   At the top of the government's wanted list of dissenters are 21
members of the student union that led the pro-democracy movement in
Beijing. Official media announced Wednesday that two had been
arrested.
   Television reports on Thursday said Xiong Wei, 23, a student at
Qinghua University, turned himself in to Beijing police after
traveling from the northeastern city of Shenyang with his mother.
   ``He handed over materials he wrote to show his willingness to
fully resolve his problem,'' it said as several documents were shown.
   The three top student leaders _ Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi and Chai
Ling _ were among the 18 fugitives remaining on the wanted list.
   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke refused Wednesday to
discuss newspaper reports in his country that the Australian Embassy
in Beijing was sheltering Ms. Ling, a 22-year-old psychology student
at Beijing Normal University.
   Chinese official media reported more arrests of workers who
supported the seven weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations and the
detention of three men allegedly involved in the attack of a martial
law soldier killed in Beijing.
   Television news on Thursday gave extensive coverage of the mother
and the sister of the soldier, Cui Guozheng, meeting top officials.
   The government has portrayed troops involved in crushing the
pro-democracy movement as heroes.
   Its campaign to gain support for the crackdown included a large
front-page editorial Thursday in the Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily.
   The editorial, which was read on television and radio, urged the
country to ``unite and join forces to fight the common enemy.''
   It said ``a great victory already has been achieved in quelling
the counterrevolutionary rebellion. In Beijing and even the whole
country, the situation is moving toward stability. ... But the
struggle definitely is not over.''
   People's Daily said it was important to ``strengthen education''
of the many people who participated in the pro-democracy marches.
   The government has tried to get citizens to participate in the
crackdown, and publicized several phone numbers in Beijing for
residents to call to report protesters. Beijing television reported
Thursday that 1,620 calls had been received.
   National television reported that citizen militias had been
formed in the central Chinese city of Qongqing to support security
forces conducting sweeps for government critics.
   The government on Wednesday ordered the expulsion of two U.S.
correspondents, John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Voice of
America's bureau chief in Beijing, Alan Pessin.
   The two were accused of violating martial law regulations that
ban foreign reporting on the pro-democracy movement and were given
72 hours to leave the country.
   Martial law troops continued to patrol Beijing and guard the
perimeter of Tiananmen Square, which the military captured from the
student protesters on June 4.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say up to
3,000 people were killed in the assault, most of them civilians. The
government says about 200 people died, half of them soldiers.
   The vast plaza remained closed to pedestrians, but workers began
planting shrubs around the monument to heroes on the square and
painting road dividers that surround Tiananmen.
   Officials said today that two months of demonstrations and
martial law _ imposed May 20 _ had cost the city $270 million in
economic losses, two-thirds from delays in deliveries of raw
materials and worker slowdowns.

   A tanker carrying 8 million gallons of oil
ran aground off Virginia Beach, but the Coast Guard today said there
was no spill.
   Divers determined the hull was intact, said Coast Guard spokesman
Steve Blando.
   Blando said the Omi Leader ran aground on a sandy shoal six miles
off Cape Henry after 9 p.m. Wednesday.
   Tugboats were unable to free the tanker, and the Coast Guard
began pumping out 1.6 million gallons to lighten the vessel and
refloat it, said Petty Officer 1st Class Rick Woods.
   ``There are no traces of any damage to the vessel, no spill
outside of the vessel,'' he said.
   Blando said the U.S.-registered tanker was en route to Koch
Refinery in Newport News when it went aground.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.

   A sailor who said the Navy was trying
to make him a scapegoat for the deaths of 47 shipmates in the
explosion aboard the battleship Iowa reported to new duties Thursday
at the Mayport Naval Station.
   Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt, 21, has been reassigned
to a destroyer commander's staff in the weapons department, said
Cmdr. Tim Taylor, Mayport spokesman.
   ``He's being handled exactly like any other third-class petty
officer,'' Taylor said at a news conference.
   Truitt's attorney said Wednesday that his client would have no
further comment until the Navy's investigation of the USS Iowa blast
is complete.
   ``He wants to become a sailor again,'' lawyer Ellis Rubin said in
a telephone interview from Miami. ``He would like to just put this
behind him.''
   Shortly after the April 19 disaster, the Navy called Truitt a
hero for trying to save crewmates. Later, published reports said the
Navy was investigating the relationship between Truitt and Clayton
Hartwig, a gunner's mate who was killed.
   Truitt, sole beneficiary of a $50,000 double-indemnity life
insurance policy purchased by Hartwig, reportedly was under
investigation to see if there was a link between the men in a murder
or suicide plot.
   Truitt has vehemently denied wrongdoing and has said the Navy was
seeking a scapegoat.
   The Navy in late May ordered Truitt transferred to Mayport, away
from Iowa crewmates he had publicly accused of false speculation
about his relationship with Hartwig. Truitt also has suggested the
explosion may have been caused by inexperienced sailors pushing bags
of gunpowder too quickly into the gun's breech.
   Rubin said he hopes the Navy board of inquiry report into the
disaster will include an apology to Truitt.
   The Iowa left its home port of Norfolk, Va., on June 8 for a
six-month deployment in the Mediterranean.

   Officials seeking to enforce a town
cleanup ordinance broke into a couple's home while they were out of
town and threw out or gave away their belongings because they
thought the house was vacant.
   ``Our lives have been thrown away,'' said Dawn Wynn, 52.
``Everything that we've had that represented a lifetime is gone.''
   Town officials in this eastern Idaho community, with the help of
an agent for the Wynns' mortgage company, cleared out the home and
buried the items at the local landfill because the lawn had not been
mowed and inoperable vehicles were stored on the property.
   Attorney Scott Hansen, who represents Mrs. Wynn and her husband,
Leo, 51, said the Wynns' son, Rick, a construction worker in
Blackfoot, finally went over to the house last week to mow the lawn
only to find it stripped bare. Even the lawnmower had been hauled
off.
   ``I agree with city ordinances,'' Hansen said. ``But it's amazing
how things have run amok.'' He said a lawsuit was likely.
   Since last summer, the Wynns have been living in Lovelock, Nev.,
where Wynn had found work as a mechanic for a mining company. Their
son had been taking care of the house the Wynns had lived in for 14
years and planned eventually to retire in.
   The city moved last month to enforce a beautification ordinance
it had passed last August. After repeated letters to the Wynns went
unanswered, cleanup enforcement officer Rudy Sanchez concluded the
house was vacant.
   According to Hansen, Sanchez contacted the Lomas Mortgage Co. to
advise officials they were responsible for cleaning up the yard.
Lomas made arrangements to remove the Wynns' possessions and prepare
the house for sale, even though the Wynns were current in the
mortgage payments.
   Hansen said an agent of the mortgage company broke into the house
earlier this month, removed the belongings and took them to the
local landfill or gave them to charities. Birth certificates and
family photographs along with appliances, jewelry and other items
were disposed of.
   Although the dump does not accept household goods, an employee
took them, Hansen said, and then realized the mistake and decided to
bury the items with a bulldozer.
   Some goods have been recovered and returned, and the dump is
still being combed for more, but many of the sentimental items were
destroyed, Mrs. Wynn said.
   ``There is no way to pay for the things that are gone,'' she
said. ``My whole life has been violated and yanked away from me.''

<TEXT>
   Mass mailings by 100 senators during 1987-88
cost taxpayers more than $52.7 million, the congressional watchdog
Common Cause reported Thursday.
   The 27 senators seeking re-election last year spent $20.1 million
of the total, an average of 48 cents per household, according to the
Common Cause study.
   The per-household figures compared to an average of 31 cents for
the 67 senators who were not campaigning for re-election, and 15
cents for six senators who retired in 1988.
   ``Franked mass mailings are used for campaign purposes by members
of Congress and provide incumbents with an unfair and discriminatory
advantage over their challengers,'' Common Cause President Fred
Wertheimer said. ``The use of the frank for mass mailings should be
eliminated or sharply curtailed.''
   The study said taxpayer-financed mailing costs for both houses
have increased from $48.9 million in fiscal 1978 to $113.4 million
for fiscal 1988.
   The bulk of the cost is for mass mailings rather than individual
letters sent out by a member in response to a constituent's
correspondence, the study said.
   In February, the Senate changed its policy and expanded from
three to six the number of mass mailings each senator can make to
every address in his or her state each year.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foray into
the hard-hat heartland of the Ruhr valley Thursday produced a
roaring workers' welcome for his reforms, contrasting with the
grumbles he has heard at home.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, drew claps, cheers, whistles and
shouts of approval from more than 8,000 workers in hard hats at the
Dortmund headquarters of Hoesch, a giant steel concern.
   ``Gorby! Gorby!'' chanted the crowd as Gorbachev gave his first
speech to workers in the West, a rousing series of slogans
punctuated throughout by thunderous applause.
   The workers had waited almost two years to meet the Soviet
leader. Worried about job losses in the Ruhr's outmoded heavy
industry, workers' representatives from Hoesch and other area firms
wrote Gorbachev in 1987 asking for more economic cooperation.
   Gorbachev gave them no firm contracts, speaking instead about
Soviet-German friendship. He clearly enjoyed the response he got.
   ``We don't know exactly what kind of society we are headed for,
but we know it will be a society of broad freedoms, a society based
on human qualities ... a society of people's power,'' he said.
   ``No matter how hard it will be for us, we will determinedly
stick to this path of perestroika,'' Gorbachev said, to roars from
the crowd. ``We feel your solidarity and in the name of our workers,
I thank you for this solidarity.''
   The Ruhr workers, untroubled by shortages of consumer goods that
frustrate their Soviet counterparts, applauded Gorbachev. They
vented their anger at a former economics minister, Otto Lambsdorff,
who drew jeers and whistles when introduced as a guest alongside
former Social Democratic chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt.
   The workers presented Gorbachev with a unique electronic toy
complete with his portrait.
   Werner Nass, head of the works council at Hoesch, said the device
was a miniature of an electronic vote-counting system Hoesch will
deliver to the Supreme Soviet, the new Soviet legislature that
Gorbachev heads.
   The Kremlin leader beamed his thanks and left the hall amid more
cheers.
   Outside, security was tight and the mood less elated.
   Scores of uniformed police lined each side of Gorbachev's route
between Hoesch and the train station.
   Police teams with dogs patrolled the road and residents of the
working-class neighborhood said they had been asked to close all
windows and doors for more security as Gorbachev drove past.
   Police issued megaphone warnings to residents to keep off
sidewalks.
   ``They were standing on the streets in Bonn shaking his hand, and
here we're not even allowed to get close,'' said Brigitte Weidemann,
19. But she still praised Gorbachev: ``He's doing something about
his country's problems. I think he's a good leader.''
   Michael Paprocki, 67, a World War II veteran disabled while
fighting the Soviets, disagreed.
   ``Maybe he'll take billions of marks home with him,'' Paprocki
said. ``But he's not here for any other reason. He should get his
own home in order first.''

   Australia on Thursday granted asylum to
a Chinese diplomat, but Prime Minister Bob Hawke refused to discuss
news reports that the embassy in Beijing was harboring a student
leader of the democracy movement.
   A news report in Japan said authorities there were protecting a
Chinese diplomat who asked for political asylum in the United States
following China's effort to crush the movement.
   Immigration officials in Denmark said nine Chinese citizens had
applied for asylum.
   Australia's Parliament passed a motion condemning China's
military crackdown on protesters in Beijing on June 3-4 and the
continued arrests of activists.
   The Foreign Ministry said Vice Consul Dong Qi, in hiding in
Sydney since Friday, was granted permanent residence on humanitarian
grounds.
   Hawke gave assurances that the 15,405 Chinese citizens in the
country, including 10,600 students, need not worry about being
deported due to expired visas.
   ``The government of Australia will be keeping their situation
under close and sympathetic review,'' he said. ``We would consider
sympathetically the cases of any student who could be considered in
any sense in danger by returning to China.''
   However, Hawke refused to discuss newspaper reports that the
Australian Embassy in Beijing had granted refuge to student leader
Chai Ling.
   The 22-year-old psychology student at Beijing Normal University
is No. 3 on the Beijing government's list of 21 most-wanted leaders
of the pro-democracy movement.
   Hawke said it served no purpose to ``speculate or talk about it.''
   ``There are obvious sensitivities involved,'' he said.
   A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said reports that Ms. Ling was hiding at the embassy were ``way off
the mark.''
   The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong reported that China was
prepared to break relations with Australia and the United States for
harboring Chinese activists at their embassies.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is sheltering two leading Chinese
dissidents, physicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, an
assistant professor at Beijing University.
   Fang did not participate in the seven weeks of demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square, but Chinese authorities claim he led the
pro-democracy movement.
   The newspaper said if Beijing broke relations, Chinese
authorities would be free to enter embassy compounds and seize any
Chinese citizens being sheltered.
   The paper did not identify its sources for the report. The
Foreign Ministry said it had ``no relation to reality.''
   In Japan, Kyodo News Service quoted unidentified Japanese
security officials as saying 27-year-old Ma Qiuyun, an attache at
the Chinese Embassy's consular office, had asked for U.S. asylum and
remained in Tokyo.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry refused to comment. Kyodo said the
office and security authorities were studying how to deal with the
case.
   A Chinese Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said by telephone: ``We hope Japanese government authorities
concerned will act with prudence and the case will not affect the
friendly relations between Japan and China.''
   Seven Chinese studying in Denmark and two people registered as
businessmen applied for political asylum in that country in the past
week, said Inge Thomsen, an immigration official. Thomsen declined
to discuss the cases but said authorities would be ``cautious''
about forcing Chinese to return home under present circumstances.

   The Supreme Court, which touched off an uproar
last year by considering reversal of a 1976 civil rights decision,
today upheld the use of a century-old law to fight racial
discrimination but barred using it to protect minorities against
harassment.
   The decisions were denounced by civil rights advocates, who said
court rulings in recent months had dealt a significant setback to
civil rights law.
   The justices unanimously reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted to
help freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused of
race bias.
   But the court, by a separate 5-4 vote, also ruled that the
123-year-old civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racial
harassment.
   Civil rights groups found little solace in the fact that a bigger
defeat was avoided. They said the decision on racial harassment is
further evidence a newly solidified conservative majority is intent
on rolling back years of progress for minorities and women.
   ``This Supreme Court term has been a disaster for all those
committed to equal employment opportunity,'' said Benjamin Hooks and
Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Speaking of a string of recent Supreme Court decisions, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said ``the end-of-term decisions by the
Supreme Court on civil rights are a growing cause of concern to
Congress and all Americans who care about equal opportunity in our
society and equal justice under law.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in his opinion for the court, said
adherence to precedent compelled the conservative majority on the
court to uphold the 1976 ruling.
   Furthermore, he said, even if that ruling was based on a mistaken
interpretation of law, ``it is certain that it is not inconsistent
with the prevailing sense of justice in this country. To the
contrary, (it) is entirely consistent with our society's deep
commitment to the eradication of discrimination based on a person's
race or the color of his or her skin.''
   But Justice Kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment was
not envisioned by the 1866 law.
   He said the law governs contractual rights _ not most conduct by
an employer after an individual is hired.
   The 1866 law ``covers only conduct at the initial formation of
the contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce contract
obligations through legal process,'' Justice Kennedy said.
   In another decision, the court gave states and state officials
sweeping new protection from federal lawsuits accusing them of civil
rights violations.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they may
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against
``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in an opinion dissenting from the
court's decision on racial harassment, said, ``What the court
declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the other.''
   Brennan said the court ``has to strain hard'' to interpret the
1866 law in a way that ignores ``powerful historic evidence about
the Reconstruction Congress' concerns'' to end race bias.
   Joining Brennan in partial dissent were Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The five-member conservative majority that voted against applying
the anti-discrimination law to harassment cases consisted of
Kennedy, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron R. White.
   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are appointees of former President
Ronald Reagan and Rehnquist was promoted to chief justice by Reagan.
   The court sent shock waves through the civil rights community in
April 1988 when it announced it would use a relatively obscure case
from North Carolina to reconsider its 1976 ruling.
   While no party to the North Carolina case urged the court to
reconsider the 1976 precedent, the justices by a 5-4 vote took the
extraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for a
re-examination.
   The four dissenters then said that the move threatened to
undermine the faith minorities have placed in the high court.
   The 1976 decision, called Runyon vs. McCrary, held that racially
segregated private schools which refused to admit blacks violate the
Civil Rights Act of 1866.
   That law was intended to ensure recently freed slaves all the
rights of citizenship.
   The 1976 ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as
a weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms.
   For example, no other federal law bars racially segregated
private schools. Also, the law provides for heavy punitive damages
against those found to have practiced discrimination.
   That is of particular importance in job bias cases which account
for some three-fourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law.
Congress in 1964 outlawed on-the-job discrimination, but did not
provide for such heavy penalties.
   The 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challeging bias in
the sale of private homes.
   The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of U.S.
senators, more than 100 House members and more than 100 civil rights
and public interest groups urged the court not to tamper with its
1976 ruling.
   The North Carolina case stemmed from an appeal by Brenda
Patterson, a black woman who was a teller at McLean Credit Union.
She sued under the 1866 law, seeking actual and punitive damages for
alleged harassment.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by
a federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., throwing out her suit.
   The Supreme Court today agreed with the appeals court and refused
to revive Ms. Patterson's suit.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he fathered the
child of a woman married to someone else.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.
   _ Shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seeking
to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education for
handicapped children.
   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.
   The case involving the 1866 civil rights law is Patterson vs.
McLean Credit Union, 87-107.

<HEAD>Fickle Weather: Northeast Had Droughts But Now All Wet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusually dry winter had reservoirs in the Northeast shrinking
fast and drought emergency regulations were imposed _ but since then
it has rained, frequently, in record amounts.
   Now the reservoirs are nearly full, there's a bumper crop of
mosquitoes and some people, especially golfers, are tired of the wet.
   ``It's like walking around in beef stew out there,'' Rich
Skyzinski, a spokesman for the U.S. Golf Association, said Thursday
of course conditions at the Oak Hill Country Club at Rochester,
N.Y., where the U.S. Open was under way.
   There was only a little drizzle on the course Thursday after a
week of heavy rain, but the forecast was for more rain at least
through Saturday.
   New York City declared a drought emergency in March because an
unusually dry winter left hardly any snow on the watershed around
its reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains. The reservoirs dropped to
55 percent capacity.
   But the dry winter was followed by April showers, and May
showers, and June showers.
   The city had a record 10.24 inches of rain in May, compared with
a normal 3.76 inches, measured in Central Park. So far this month,
the total is 6.69 inches, already the 10th wettest June on record,
compared with a normal 3.23 inches for the whole month. The June
record is 9.78 inches.
   On May 15, the city ended its drought emergency, lifting
restrictions on business use of water and bans on using water for
lawns, flowers and washing cars. City reservoirs are now at 97.1
percent of capacity.
   Massachusetts officials announced Tuesday that they were easing
restrictions but stopped short of declaring a formal end to the
drought emergency for the 2.5 million people in Boston and 43
surrounding communities that get water from the Quabbin Reservoir.
   Since April 1, the huge reservoir, which normally gets 3.5 inches
of rain monthly, has received 18 inches, including a record 10
inches in May.
   ``It's unusual to have a wet spring after a dry winter, but in
reality, the drought is over,'' said University of Massachusetts
climatologist Ray Bradley.
   A drought warning issued Jan. 16 for 7 million people in
Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania who depend on the
Delaware River basin ended May 12, thanks to the spring rain.
   But all that water, plus some early warm weather, hatched out a
bumper crop of mosquitoes across New England.
   ``We've got an epidemic,'' said Arthur Doty, chairman of the
Mosquito Control District for the Vermont towns of Brandon,
Leicester and Salisbury. He said the flying blood-suckers were
plaguing the region in greater numbers than he'd seen in 30 years.

<TEXT>
   Actor and director Victor French, the bearded
co-star of ``Highway to Heaven,'' and ``Little House on the
Prairie,'' died Thursday from lung cancer. He was 54.
   French was admitted to Sherman Oaks Community Hospital on June 7,
said Johna Rogovin, a hospital spokeswoman. He was diagnosed with
lung cancer three months ago, said his business manager, Bob
Philpott.
   The actor was known early in his career as a leading television
villain, appearing in more than 20 episodes of ``Gunsmoke,''
directing five of them. He was frequently seen in ``Bonanza.''
   He subsequently played the scruffy farmer Isaiah Edwards on
``Little House on the Prairie,'' starring Michael Landon. Beneath
his character's tough exterior was a kind, gentle man.
   French left the series in 1977 to star in his own situation
comedy, ``Carter Country,'' playing a lovable redneck police chief
in a city not far from Plains, Ga., home of former President Carter.
   Several years after ``Carter Country'' was canceled by ABC in
1979, French rejoined ``Little House'' in 1982, staying with the
series until 1983.
   He teamed with Landon again on NBC's ``Highway to Heaven'' in
1984, playing Mark Gordon, a burly and bitter ex-cop who was rescued
from despair in the series by Landon's Jonathan Smith, an earthbound
angel determined to save ruined lives.
   In a 1985 interview, French credited Landon with being ``the
first to see beyond my looks,'' pushing to get him the part in
``Little House'' that allowed him to branch out from villain roles.
   ``The network wanted a name actor, but Michael stood by his guns.
That role changed my career,'' he said. ``Michael is really my
`angel.'''
   In addition to co-starring, French directed every third episode
of ``Highway to Heaven,'' with Landon directing the other two.
   French also played Agent 44 on ``Get Smart'' and appeared in the
short-lived situation comedy ``The Hero'' on NBC in 1966.
   Born in Santa Barbara and the son of a Hollywood stunt man,
French also directed for the theater, winning a Los Angeles Drama
Critics Award for his production of ``12 Angry Men.'' He wrote the
play ``My Daughter Comes on Thursdays'' and taught acting for 20
years.
   French is survived by three children. There will be no memorial
service, Philpott said, adding, ``His instructions were to throw a
party for his friends.''

<HEAD>Soviet Chess Star Who Eloped With American Gets Daughter Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Soviet chess star who eloped with the
captain of the U.S. men's team last year arrived Thursday from
Moscow with her daughter to begin a new life in the West.
   Elena Akhmilovskaya had returned to the Soviet Union from her
home in Seattle on May 26 to arrange an exit visa for Dana, the
7-year-old daughter from her first marriage.
   ``This couldn't have happened five years ago,'' she said, seated
with her family in the back of a taxi as it drove away from Heathrow
Airport. ``Even now I couldn't imagine that it would be so easy to
get every paper and every document.''
   ``I think it's because our lives in the Soviet Union have changed
very much now, especially on the political side, the side of the
bureaucracy,'' she said.
   ``Before, people understood these problems, but they couldn't
help. Now with perestroika, they can,'' Ms. Akhmilovskaya said.
   John Donaldson, a 30-year-old international chess master, and Ms.
Akhmilovskaya, 32, were secretly married during the Chess Olympiad
in Salonica, Greece in November.
   Donaldson said Thursday his first thoughts were for his reunited
family. ``Now I feel good,'' he said. ``The last six months without
Dana have been especially hard for Elena.''
   Ms. Akhmilovskaya had traveled to Tblisi, the capital of Soviet
Georgia, to gain the permission of Dana's father. She then went back
to Moscow to arrange the final documents.
   The speedy processing of Dana's passport by the Soviet
authorities will enable her mother to compete in an international
tournament beginning Saturday in Britain.
   Mother and daughter arrived at Heathrow with three pieces of
luggage and a large doll. The 7-year-old, excited by her new
surroundings, exclaimed: ``Such shoes! Such toys! Such dolls!'' when
the taxi stopped in front of a line of shops.
   The elopement of Ms. Akhmilovskaya, a grandmaster who then was
ranked second among the world's female players and now rated sixth,
stunned the chess world and came at a crucial time in the
competition. Before her dramatic departure, Ms. Akhmilovskaya had
amassed a big score of eight wins and one draw.
   With Ms. Akhmilovskaya gone, the Soviet team managed only a
final-round draw with the Netherlands. This enabled Hungary to move
into first place and wine the gold medals in the separate women's
competition.
   In the future, Ms. Akhmilovskaya will represent the United States.
   When she was in Moscow, Ms. Akmilovskaya said she was greeted
with open arms by fellow players, including champion Garri Kasparov.
   She did not meet with any senior chess officials, she said.
``They did not invite me,'' she said.
   Ms. Akhmilovskaya said she intends to play in the women's world
championship next year, but her first priority would be to arrange a
good education for Dana in Seattle.

<HEAD>State GOP Leaders Support Atwater Despite Foley-Memo Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Republican leaders on Thursday generally
backed GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, who has drawn Democratic fire in
connection with a party memo that likened House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley's record to that of a homosexual lawmaker.
   ``I think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and I think the
proper action was taken (with the resignation of an Atwater aide)
... and that's the end of it,'' Michigan State Republican Chairman
E. Spencer Abraham said.
   ``I found absolutely nothing in it that was insulting to
anybody,'' said Perry O. Hooper, GOP national committeeman from
Alabama. ``I have found nobody that was concerned.''
   Hooper, like several other Republicans gathering for the party's
annual summer meeting, said that when he read the memo he
interpreted it as a description of Foley's position on issues, not a
reflection on his personal life.
   On the other hand, Richard M. Rosenbaum, the national
committeeman from New York, said, ``I find what happened to be very
embarrassing and regrettable.''
   Asked whether the incident would be damaging to Atwater,
Rosenbaum said, ``I don't know. It's still a little early to get a
real consensus.''
   President Bush said in a speech to a party fund-raising dinner
Wednesday night that Atwater is ``doing a great job.'' The president
made no reference to the Foley memo.
   The memo depicted Foley as a liberal and compared his voting
record to that of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged
homosexual. Mark Goodin, an aide to Atwater, resigned after saying
he wrote the memo, which bore the heading, ``Tom Foley: Out of the
Liberal Closet.''
   Some Democrats have asked Bush to fire Atwater from his party
post.
   Jennifer Dunn, the Republican national committeewoman from
Foley's home state of Washington, said she had received ``very few
calls'' about the memo.
   ``It was a very unfortunate thing, but I think it turned into a
media issue and a Democratic issue,'' Ms. Dunn said.
   Elsie H. Hillman, committeewoman from Pennsylvania, said, ``I
guess I'm very naive; I would not, if it hadn't been written up and
hadn't had such a violent explosion, I probably would not have made
any connection with that.''
   Mrs. Hillman said she believes Atwater's position is safe, noting
that the president supports him and has said he believes Atwater's
denial that he knew about the memo.
   William M. Taylor, GOP committeeman from Florida, said, ``I don't
know of anybody who thinks he (Atwater) is in trouble.''
   ``It probably shouldn't have been said in retrospect, but my
hindsight is always 20-20,'' Taylor said.
   Abraham, who is chairman of the organization of Midwestern
Republican state chairmen, said his group met Thursday ``and the
comments were all favorable'' to Atwater.
   ``I think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and I think the
proper actions were taken and Mark Goodin resigned and that's the
end of it,'' the Michigan chairman said.
   Donald B. Cox, national committeeman from Indiana, said
Republicans in his state were not concerned about the issue and, ``I
think it's more of a Washington thing.''

<HEAD>Congress Told Youngsters Involved in Drug Traffic Arm Themselves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen-year-old Detra J. of the District of
Columbia, saying ``everyone knows how to get a gun if they want
one,'' told a House panel Thursday that she knows children as young
as 12 who arm themselves because they are involved in drug
trafficking.
   ``If they hustle for a person _ he's a runner or a hit man _ he's
getting a gun to carry out the orders the man has given him,''
Detra, whose last name was not revealed, told the House Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   Eight people she knows have been shot to death, she said, adding:
``Half had guns and were in a gunfight, and half of them were
innocent bystanders.''
   But the deaths do not keep others from getting involved in the
drug trade, she said. ``Most of them, after their friends die, they
get deeper into it,'' because of the financial rewards, she said.
   ``They get involved because they want fast money, to buy cars,
jewelry and radios. They don't get (legitimate) jobs because the pay
is too low.''
   Detra, who works in a local Recreation Department program to keep
young people off the streets, said: ``Everyone knows how to get a
gun if they want one.''
   She said many ideas floated by lawmakers to keep young people
from obtaining guns won't work, including making it more difficult
to buy weapons legally. The District of Columbia has one of the
toughest gun control laws in the country yet young people have no
trouble getting them illegally, she said.
   Holding parents liable for their children's use of weapons will
fail because, she said, ``there's not too many youth today who talk
to their parents. ... It's not a family bond anymore'' and parents
don't have control over their drug-dealing children.
   Two experts who testified differed on the seriousness of
gun-related violence.
   Pediatrician Katherine K. Christoffel of Chicago, representing
the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that ``10 American children
ages 18 and under are killed every day in handgun suicides,
homicides and accidents.''
   ``Three or four times as many are wounded. One of every 25
admissions to American pediatric trauma centers is due to gunshot
wounds. In 1987, gun injuries were the fourth-leading cause of
unintentional-injury death for children ages 14 and under. For
inner-city black adolescent boys and young men, firearm injuries are
the leading cause of death.''
   But Gary Kleck, an associate professor of criminology at Florida
State University in Tallahassee, said that accidental shootings of
innocent bystanders ``are extremely rare,'' involvement of guns in
youth suicide has been decreasing since 1979, except for a slight
upturn in 1984 and 1985, and fatal gun accidents have been declining
for 20 years.
   Panel chairman George Miller, D-Calif., said Kleck had a ``sense
of arrogance'' by failing to recognize the devastating effects gun
violence has in some sections of the country, particularly inner
cities.
   ``I didn't dismiss'' such situations, Kleck responded. ``I
pointed out the facts that seem to spoil the fun for some people.''
   He said he supports licensing gun owners following thorough
criminal records checks.

<HEAD>After Basra, Workers' Army Will Rebuild Faw `For Peace'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BASRA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of 20,000 construction workers who
rebuilt this ancient port in four months will do the same for the
oil town of Faw to show the world Iraq's peaceful intentions, the
government says.
   ``The reconstruction of Basra, which is within range of Iranian
artillery, and Faw, which is within rifle range, is intended to
encourage Iran to move toward peace,'' President Saddam Hussein told
visiting U.S. businessmen last week.
   Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, is only 12 miles from the
Iranian border and has become a symbol of Iraq's revival after eight
years of war ended with a cease-fire in August. The reconstruction
was declared finished on Wednesday.
   As a new city emerged from the rubble, Iraq also is refurbishing
and expanding the Persian Gulf ports Khor al-Zubair and Um-Qasr,
which were closed by the war.
   Efforts to reopen the Shatt-al-Arab border waterway, Iraq's
outlet to the sea, remain stymied by the deadlock in peace talks.
The Shatt is formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers.
   Dozens of public buildings and schools were built in Basra, which
was founded 1,400 years ago, to replace those destroyed or damaged
in the war. The city has hundreds of miles of new streets and
sidewalks.
   Millions of sandbags that protected buildings have been removed
and the network of canals, which gave Basra the name ``Venice of the
East,'' have been dredged. The bridges over them have been rebuilt.
   Hundreds of houses are in ruins. The government decreed Thursday
that all damaged houses must be restored within a year or it will
have the work done and charge the owners.
   Anwar Saeed Hadithi, mayor of Basra, described the rebuilding
campaign as ``a miracle'' achieved by ``determination and hard
work.''
   ``What the Iranians took eight years to destroy, we've rebuilt in
four months,'' he said.
   Most of the 20,000 engineers and workers who began the job Feb.
16 are moving on to Faw with their tent camps and hundreds of
bulldozers, trucks, steamrollers and mobile cranes.
   The rebuilding of Faw, on the Shatt-al-Arab estuary 60 miles
south of Basra, is to begin next week. Iran captured Faw in February
1986 and the Iraqis retook it in April 1967.
   Abdul Razak Abdul Wahab Ali, head of the port authority, said
work was continuing to clear the stretch of the Shatt under Iraqi
control from Al-Maqal, Basra's port, to the point several miles
southwest at which it becomes the border.
   Scores of ships were trapped in the waterway, which was closed in
the early days of the war, and others were sunk.
   Ali said one hulk, the Greek cargo ship Maria Sofia, was raised
last week and several others were being lifted.
   Iran has rejected Iraqi demands that the 120-mile Shatt-al-Arab
be cleared of wrecked ships, unexploded bombs and eight years of
silt before other provisions of the U.N.-sponsored truce agreement
are implemented.

   If any firemen are worried about whether they
are able to grow a beard to participate in the city's centennial
celebration, they can save face by citing a department policy.
   Beards remain forbidden but the department has relaxed its
mustache policy to allow neatly groomed handlebar mustaches until
Dec. 31, Chief Doug MacDonald has ruled.
   A firefighter would have difficulty sealing his air mask when
wearing a beard, MacDonald said.
   Organizers of the 100th anniversary celebration have threatened
to levy ``fines'' against beardless men. The chief said no
firefighters requested permission to grow beards, but one or two
asked if the city would pay the fine.
   ``My response to that was, as I understand it, it's facial hair,
and we have a mustache policy. Therefore they shouldn't be fined,''
McDonald said.
   The chief said he will ``attempt to come up with a handlebar
mustache'' in keeping with his new policy.
   Police Chief Fred Rainguet has allowed beards, but if they don't
meet his standards, the offending officer may be called before a
Beard Review Board.

   Kenneth Dumas believes he has gone where no
collector of ``Star Trek'' memorabilia has gone before.
   This was no five-year mission, as the prologue of the television
show used to say. When Dumas was 9, he began to seek out and explore
the galaxy of toys, posters, comic books and other spinoffs that
enterprising business people created for science fiction fans.
   Fifteen years later, the 24-year-old state-employed mapmaker says
he may have the largest personal stockpile of ``Star Trek''
memorabilia on this planet.
   ``I haven't found one person who has beaten it,'' Dumas said.
   He figures he has about 32,000 items, the most prized being a
fully operational ``Star Trek'' pinball machine. Remember the
hand-held communicators Kirk and Spock used when exploring planets?
Dumas has seven, as well as a medical scanner like the one used by
Dr. McCoy.
   Dumas has 300 paperback adventures in assorted editions and a
video library of all but 11 of the 79 TV episodes. But he is not
fond of the second-generation ``Star Trek'' television series, the
current movie sequel or the conventions held by ``trekkers.''
   ``I classify myself as a `Star Trek' memorabilia collector,'' he
said. ``I don't wear Spock ears and the costumes and go to
conventions and look stupid.''

   There's nothing unlucky about the number
13 to the Lehman family, especially in June.
   Howard Lehman was born June 13. So was his father, Jerry.
   And now, as if there weren't enough cakes to bake this time of
year, Allison Lauren Lehman was born Tuesday, the third-generation
with the same birth date.
   ``My father-in-law said to me this morning, `OK, you have 18
hours to have the baby,''' Denise Lehman said after giving birth
four days ahead of schedule.
   ``I'd almost forgotten about my birthday,'' said her husband,

It's a great birthday present.''

<HEAD>Removal of Radioactive House Cost $11.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSDOWNE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price tag is millions more than first
predicted, but a 10-month cleanup has removed the last vestiges of a
radioactive house contaminated decades ago by an enterprising
professor, officials said Thursday.
   The federal government said Thursday that it cost at least $11.6
million to tear down the suburban Philadelphia house and two
neighboring garages and haul the contaminated debris, along with
4,000 tons of radioactive soil, to a burial site for toxic waste in
Utah.
   ``I think that's the end of it,'' said Victor J. Janosik of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``We're all cleaned up out there
and we're just doing restoration now.''
   The restoration includes the rebuilding of the two garages and
driveways also destroyed as the cleanup effort, and cost, expanded.
   At first, officials thought they could clean up the site for
about $2 million, but the first written estimate compiled by the EPA
expanded that to $4.5 million. The cost continued to grow as the
true extent of the contamination became known, Janosik said.
   ``We anticipated that most of the contamination would be within
one foot of the soil; in places we were going down to as much as 11
feet,'' Janosik said.
   Contractors began pulling apart the house in August 1988. It was
contaminated from the mid-1920s to the mid-'40s by a University of
Pennsylvania physics professor who used his basement to pack needles
with radium for sale to doctors and hospitals. The radium needles
were used to treat cancer.
   The house was placed on the EPA's Superfund list in 1985 _ the
only private residence to make the list _ after a cleanup in the
1960s failed to decontaminate it.

<HEAD>Factory Use Edges Down in May, Easing Inflation Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operating rate for U.S. factories continued
to ease last month, the government reported Thursday, and economists
said the slower pace so far this year should continue to cool
inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve said the operating rate in May was 83.8
percent, 0.3 percentage points below April's 84.1 percent. The May
rate matched the rate in March, which had declined 0.1 percentage
point from February. Rates peaked in December and January at 84.3
percent, a 10-year high.
   ``This is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room to
run and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off,''
said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber in New York.
   The report ``should relieve concerns about too high a utilization
leading to inflation,'' agreed S. Jay Levy of Levy Economic
Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., adding that the general pattern also
``should erase the fears of a too serious slowdown.''
   The steady increase in operating rates last year had caused
economists to worry about accompanying inflationary pressures. The
closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   Until recently, the Fed had been pushing up interest rates in an
attempt to cool those inflationary pressures without slowing growth
so much that the economy slides into a recession.
   ``It's (the slowing operating rate) consistent with the Fed's
soft landing scenario,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of Data
Resources in Lexington, Mass. ``Certainly some of the pressure on
the productive capacity is easing and that should translate into
less upward pressure on prices.''
   Last month's operating rate of 83.8 percent was up from 82.9
percent a year earlier.
   The operating rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 84.0 percent at
manufacturing plants, returning to the March operating level. Prior
to April, the rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 in January.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big ticket items
expected to last more than three years, fell from 82.8 percent in
April to 82.5 percent in May, reflecting decreases in most
categories.
   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods edged down from
86.3 percent to 86.0 percent last month.
   In another report Thursday, the central bank said industrial
production was unchanged in May after a 0.6 percent hike in April.
Production had edged up 0.1 percent in March after falling 0.2
percent in February, the first decline in a year.
   The Fed's industrial production index stood at 141.4 percent of
its 1977 base, 3.9 percent higher than a year ago and the same as
last month's index.
   Production fell 0.1 percent at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods.
   Output at mines and oil wells rose 1.2 percent following a 1.0
percent jump in April. The May output was 1.4 percent higher than a
year ago.
   Production at utilities edged down 0.5 percent after remaining
flat in May.

<HEAD>First B-2 Bomber Flies in the Next Few Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first B-2 bomber will fly in the next few
weeks, the deputy secretary of defense told Congress Thursday as he
defended the $500 million plane.
   Donald J. Atwood, the No. 2 official at the Pentagon, said
defense officials ``remain convinced the B-2 is a vital'' element
for the nation's security. ``As a deterrent, the B-2 is essential,''
he said.
   Atwood told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he and
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently visited the heavily secured
Northrop Corp. plant in Palmdale, Calif., where workers are
assembling the B-2 to make sure the project is moving forward
properly.
   ``The degree of quality control gives me great confidence,''
Atwood said, noting that the radar-evading bomber, also known as the
Stealth bomber, will be constructed with composite materials.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee's chairman, told Atwood there
will be a great temptation in Congress to siphon money slated for
the B-2 for other programs that the Pentagon wants to eliminate to
save money in fiscal year 1990.
   Among the programs Cheney wants to kill in the spending year that
begins Oct. 1 are the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter and the Marine
Corps' V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Pentagon's proposed purchasing
program for that year is estimated at $69 billion.
   Atwood defended terminating some programs while spending money on
the B-2. Defense officials have proposed building 132 of those
bombers, eventually making three a month at a cost of $500 million
each, including research and development.
   Under questioning by Nunn and Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., Atwood
said the federal government has already committed to spend $22.4
billion on the B-2, including $15.5 billion for research and
development.
   ``When will it fly?'' Exon asked.
   ``Within the next two to three weeks,'' responded Atwood.
   Nunn also sought assurances the Defense Department would not use
money from a revolving contingency fund to correct problems on the
B-1B bomber without informing Congress. Three of the 100 bombers
already have crashed.
   Atwood, who said the Air Force estimates it will cost between
$700 million and $800 million to fix the electronic countermeasure
systems on the B-1Bs, gave Nunn the promise the senator wanted.
   On other issues, Atwood said:
   _ The Pentagon's management study, completed at the behest of
President Bush, has been sent to the White House. It will probably
be forwarded to Congress shortly, he said.
   _ Defense officials are working with contractors to ensure they
establish monitoring system designed to counter any fraud or
corruption. The new controls stem from investigation of Pentagon
procurement practices known as the ``Ill Wind'' investigation.
   Nunn said that once prosecutors have completed their probe,
Congress will schedule hearings to look into the purchasing system.
Atwood did not know how much longer the ``Ill Wind'' investigation
will continue.
   The investigation began three years ago. So far, more than a
dozen people and contractors have either pleaded guilty or been
convicted in the case.

   Yuri V. Andropov ignored rampant corruption that
reached into the Kremlin while he headed the KGB under Leonid I.
Brezhnev, a Soviet magazine said in the first direct official attack
on Brezhnev's successor.
   Ogonyok, a crusading weekly at the forefront of glasnost, also
quoted an official who alleged that Andropov helped Josef Stalin
carry out his bloody purges in 1949-50.
   Andropov, who headed the KGB secret police from 1967-82 and then
led the country until his death in 1984, has not been directly
criticized before in the official press. Andropov was in some ways a
mentor of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has expanded
Andropov's campaigns for honesty in government and against slackness
at the workplace.
   The only previous indication that Andropov might be falling out
of official favor was an announcement in March that a city would be
stripped of his name. One Western diplomat said at the time the
switch indicated ``a major change in the leadership's approach to
Andropov,'' even though many current top Soviet leaders strongly
sympathize with Andropov.
   But it is too early to tell whether the criticism of Andropov
appearing in Ogonyok will lead to an official campaign to discredit
the man who turned the KGB into a modern instrument of espionage
abroad and repression of dissent at home.
   It could just stem from a personal grudge against Andropov by the
man he replaced as KGB chief, Vladimir Y. Semichastny, the source of
the allegations published in Ogonyok. Semichastny appeared bitter
that he was removed as KGB chief after six years of service and
demoted to a party job in the Ukraine to make way for Andropov.
   Another element minimizing the criticism was that it was based on
Semichastny's speculation about what Andropov should have known or
done about corruption during the Brezhnev era. He offered no proof
that Andropov ignored the corruption, saying only ``all those facts
exist in archives somewhere.''
   Semichastny said Andropov ``had to be aware of what was happening
in Uzbekistan,'' a reference to the widespread corruption that
plagued the republic. He also should have known about wrongdoing in
the Soviet Interior Ministry, where cronyism and bribery were
reported rampant, the former KGB chief told Ogonyok.
   Semichastny also implied Andropov did not tell the Kremlin
leadership ``about the adventures of Brezhnev's daughter, Galina,
about the gypsy, about the whole story with this family.''
   Galina Brezhnev scandalized Moscow with her high-rolling
lifestyle during her father's reign. The Soviet press has accused
her of speculating in diamonds, and she has been linked to a bribery
scandal involving a gypsy performer for the Moscow circus.
   She is married to Yuri Churbanov, a first deputy Interior
Minister fired in 1984 and sentenced in December to 12 years in a
labor camp for accepting $150,000 in bribes.
   Andropov kept ``silent along with the rest'' about the corruption
because he probably was afraid he would lose his seat on the ruling
Politburo if he came forward with the allegations, Semichastny said.
He also kept quiet, Semichastny said, because he knew Brezhnev was
friendly with Interior Minister Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who committed
suicide in December 1984 after investigators began probing his
conduct.
   One of Andropov's first major personnel shakeups after coming to
power was to fire Shchelokov, reputed to have amassed a collection
of Western cars and to have accepted boxes full of money and jewels
from Uzbek police officials.
   After Andropov succeeded Brezhnev in November 1982, he cracked
down on corruption, and Semichastny acknowledged that he then
followed the ``right'' policy. But because he was KGB chief during
Brezhnev's rule, Andropov ``had to be responsible in his own way for
what was happening,'' Semichastny said.
   Semichastny also reviewed Andropov's early career that began in
the northern region of Karelia. He referred to Andropov's
``participation in arrests'' in the region during Stalin's purges.

   Any man who says he fathered the child of a
woman married to someone else won limited legal help Thursday from a
Supreme Court bitterly divided over the significance of
``traditional'' family relationships.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to seek visitation rights.
   But by a separate 5-4 vote, they said states may deny men the
chance to file a kind of ``reverse paternity'' lawsuit and obtain a
court declaration of fatherhood.
   The court upheld California rulings that denied visitation rights
to a man, identified only as Michael H., who says he is the father
of an 8-year-old girl, Victoria, born to a woman identified as Carol
D. at a time when Carol D. was married to another man.
   At issue was the constitutionality of a California law, similar
to laws in many other states, that creates a conclusive presumption
of paternity in favor of a woman's husband if a child is conceived
and born during their marriage.
   The California law has the effect of barring some other man from
obtaining a court declaration that he _ and not a woman's husband _
is her child's biological father.
   Four high court members said men in similar circumstances to
Michael H. have no constitutional right to a court hearing.
   Four justices voted to strike down the California law, saying
Michael H. has a constitutional right to prove his paternity in
court and seek vistitation rights.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, casting the controlling ninth vote,
said the California law is valid because it allowed Michael H. ``a
fair opportunity to show that he is Victoria's natural father, that
he had developed a relationship with her, and that her interests
would be served by granting him visitation rights.''
   Stevens, saying he was willing to ``assume'' that Michael H. and
others in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearing,
said the California law does not violate that right because Michael
H. received a chance to get visitation rights.
   Stevens said the law does not have to give Michael H. a chance to
have himself declared the biological father.
   ``Because I am convinced that the trial judge had the authority
under state law both to hear Michael's plea for visitation rights
and to grant him such rights if Victoria's best interests so
warranted, I am satisfied that the California statutory scheme is
(constitutional),'' Stevens said.
   Carol D., an international model, married Gerald D., a top
executive in a French oil company, in 1976.
   The couple established a home in Playa del Rey, Calif., and
Victoria was born in 1981.
   Michael H., a neighbor with whom Carol D. had an affair, sued in
state court in 1982, seeking to have himself declared Victoria's
father. His lawsuit was dismissed.
   In upholding the dismissal, a state appeals court said the state
law presumption that Gerald D. is Victoria's father is based ``upon
a determination by the legislature as a matter of overriding social
policy that ... the husband is to be held responsible for the child
and the integrity of the family unit should not be impugned.''
   Michael H. said he had enjoyed a father-child relationship with
Victoria for nearly a year, and that blood tests show a
better-than-98-percent chance Victoria is his biological daughter.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy,
wrote that Michael H. had no constitutional right to establish
paternity or seek visitation privileges.
   ``Our traditions have protected the marital family against the
sort of claim Michael asserts,'' Scalia wrote for the four.
   But Justice William J. Brennan, joined by Justices Byron R.
White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, said Michael H. has
a constitutional right to establish paternity and seek visitation
privileges.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Can Use More Than One Path to Attack Cells, Researchers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laboratory studies reported this week indicate
the AIDS virus can infect cells in two ways, suggesting that
developing a vaccine against the killer disease may be more
difficult than previously believed.
   A University of California, San Francisco report, to be published
Friday in the journal Science, says test tube studies prove that the
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, can use antibodies
that normally fight infection to actually cause more AIDS infection.
   Instead of helping to kill the virus, Dr. Jay A. Levy, a UCSF
researcher, said, these type of antibodies provide AIDS viruses with
a second way to invade and infect cells.
   He said that any vaccine against AIDS must be designed to not
cause the body to make these so-called ``enhancing antibodies.''
   ``That's our big warning,'' he said.
   Levy said the laboratory studies used antibodies derived from
AIDS patients. He said that like all antibodies, these have a
protein on the surface called Fc.
   Normally, an antibody uses this protein to adhere to a
corresponding protein, called the Fc receptor, on the surface of
macrophages, which are among the white blood cells in the body's
immune system. When fighting infection, the antibody helps the
macrophage search out and destroy bacteria or viruses in the body.
   But Levy said the AIDS virus is able to stick to the Fc protein
on one type of antibody and hitch a ride to a macrophage. When the
antibody locks to the Fc receptor, the virus slips inside the
macrophage and takes control. The virus turns the macrophage into a
virus-making factory that circulates in the body, throwing off new
viruses that then continue the process.
   ``The enhancing antibody allows the virus to enter cells that it
normally would not,'' said Levy. ``This is an important alternate
route for infection. The macrophage is a major cell in the body's
immune system.''
   Previously, it was well-known that the AIDS virus infected
another immune cell, the lymphocyte or T-cell, by locking onto a
surface protein called the CD4 receptor.
   The new study shows that the virus can use both the Fc and the
CD4 receptor to infect cells and turn them into virus-making
factories.
   Some experimental AIDS treatments now under way are trying to
control the infection with injections of a decoy CD4 protein. The
theory is that AIDS virus would lock onto this decoy instead of the
CD4 that is actually on a T-cell surface.
   But Levy said the new study shows that blocking the CD4 receptor
will not be enough to halt spread in the body of the AIDS virus.
   ``We would have to block both the CD4 and Fc receptors for the
blocking protein strategy to work,'' said Levy. The T-cell, he said,
also has Fc receptors.
   To produce an AIDS vaccine, Levy said researchers are going to
have to find which protein in the AIDS virus causes the body to
produce the infection-enhancing antibody. That protein then would be
removed from any candidate AIDS vaccine, he said.
   ``Otherwise, we could be immunizing people with a viral
protein,'' he said.
   Co-researchers in the study with Levy were Jacques Homsy, Mia
Meyer and Masatoshi Tateno, all of UCSF, and Sarah Clarkson of San
Francisco General Hospital.
   The study was published in Science, the journal of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Radical Students Clash With Riot Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students fought
riot police with rocks and firebombs Thursday to protest a
government crackdown on campus activism and dissident movements.
   Students clashed with police in front of at least four
universities. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Fierce fighting broke out at Yonsei and Sogang universities in
western Seoul, where about 2,000 students, many hurling rocks and
firebombs, tried to march into the streets.
   Police, armed with padded fatigues, helmets and shields, blocked
the students by hurling back rocks. They did not use tear gas.
   Smaller clashes also were reported at two other universities in
the capital.
   The students criticized a continuing crackdown by President Roh
Tae-woo's government on dissident movements and demanded that
student leaders be allowed to take part in a world youth festival in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on July 1-8.
   Sogang students were furious about a police raid on their school
last week to seize propaganda materials for the Pyongyang festival.
Sogang, a Jesuit school, is the headquarters of radical students
campaigning to go to the sports and cultural event.
   Seoul officials accused communist North Korea of using the
festival to promote dissident activity in South Korea.
   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was divided
in 1945 at the end of World War II. They fought the Korean War in
1950-53.

   President Bush, promising ``to stand up for
the police officers,'' formally sent Congress a $1.2 billion
anticrime package Thursday proposing tougher sentences for
gun-related crimes and construction of more prisons.
   Praising law officers as ``domestic freedom fighters,'' Bush
said, ``Let's put the handcuffs on the criminals, not on the
criminal justice system.''
   On the other hand, Bush said a person suspected of a crime
``should be treated with respect and given his rights or her rights,
even though the evidence looks overwhelming.''
   Bush unveiled his anticrime program a month ago but decided to
make a special occasion out of the usually routine transmittal of
the plan to Congress.
   He flew nearly 1,000 miles to southeast Georgia to sign the draft
legislation at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where
agents and police officers from 60 agencies and every state are
enrolled.
   A crowd of several thousand people, mostly students, instructors
and their families, waited under a baking sun in muggy weather to
hear Bush's speech.
   In the intense heat, Bush stripped off his suit jacket and
invited the audience to do likewise.
   He placed a wreath at the Peace Officers Memorial to the 39
graduates of the training center who have been killed in the line of
duty.
   Repeating a warning to criminals that he made earlier this year,
at the funeral of murdered Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Everett Hatcher in New York, Bush said, ``Better that you had never
been born than to attack one of America's finest.
   ``We are going after those who kill or wound our police
officers.''
   Bush noted that sending a bill to Congress normally ``would
entail nothing more than a quick flourish of the pen and then
sending an aide on a 10-minute car ride'' to Capitol Hill.
   ``But when it comes to fighting crime,'' he told the law
enforcement officers, ``you deserve more than business as usual.''
   He was applauded loudly as he outlined three of the central
planks of his anticrime platform: doubling to 10 years the mandatory
term for use of semiautomatic weapons in crimes involving violence
or drugs; eliminating plea bargaining for violent federal firearms
offenses, and an expanded federal death penalty for killers and
terrorists.
   The most costly part of Bush's plan calls for spending $1 billion
for new prison construction, in addition to $500 million already
earmarked for that purpose.
   He also proposed hiring 825 new federal agents and staff and
1,600 new prosecutors and staff.
   ``In short, I am proposing more law enforcers to catch criminals,
more staff to prosecute them and more prisons to keep them off the
streets.''
   Bush was cheered when he renewed his pledge to continue a ban of
imports of semiautomatic weapons.
   ``I am going to stand up for the police officers in this
country,'' he said.
   Toward that end, he noted he is proposing the prohibition and
manufacture of gun magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of
ammunition.
   ``I just don't believe that sportsmen require these 30-round
magazines if the legitimate purpose is sport,'' he said.
   However, some critics have said Bush hasn't been tough enough,
especially on semiautomatic weapons since he has not tried to ban
sales of domestically produced models.
   Before his speech, Bush attended a briefing where he fielded
questions from several students completing their training.
   Border Patrol agent David Rivera of El Paso, Texas, asked for
``some words of wisdom ... as we enter the field.''
   ``A word of wisdom would be, in spite of the suspicion or
circumstantial evidence, an individual should be treated with
respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the evidence
looks overwhelming,'' the president said.
   ``I think we've got to stand for that. I know that sometimes is
difficult along the border when you have repeat offenders and you
have people that are brutally using this narcotics money for
personal gain and devastating communities.''

   The Navy on Thursday announced which 11 ships
it will retire next year as part of a four-year plan to decommission
32 aging destroyers.
   The overall plan, approved earlier this year by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney as part of a budget-cutting compromise, calls for 32
guided-missile destroyers in the so-called Charles F. Adams and
Coontz classes to be retired over the next four years.
   On Thursday, the Navy said 11 of those 32 destroyers would be
decommissioned during the course of the next fiscal year, which
begins Oct. 1.
   Six of those ships are based in Norfolk, Va.; two in Charleston,
S.C.; two in San Diego, Calif., and one in Mayport, Fla.
   The Norfolk vessels are the John King, Lawrence, Richard E. Byrd,
Claude V. Ricketts, Farragut and Coontz.
   The Charleston ships are the Dewey and the Sellers.
   The San Diego destroyers are the Henry B. Wilson and the Hoel.
   The Mayport ship is the Charles F. Adams.
   ``The final disposition of each ship has not been determined,''
the service said.
   ``Crew members assigned to the destroyers will be reassigned to
other Navy commands based on manning priorities, with every
consideration given to satisfy individual duty preferences and to
minimize family and command disruption.''
   Beyond those retirements, the Navy said it also planned to
transfer four smaller Knox-class frigates to the Naval Reserve
during the coming fiscal year They are the Hepburn and Cook, both
based in San Diego; the W.S. Sims, based in Mayport, and the
Ainsworth, based in Norfolk.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ordered
prosecutors Thursday to check all local offices of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development for possible cases of fraud and
embezzlement.
   The attorney general's order came in the wake of mounting
evidence of massive fraud of HUD by real estate agents who handle
the proceeds from the sale of government-owned houses obtained
through mortgage foreclosures.
   Thornburgh ordered the nation's U.S. attorneys to review the
operation of the property-sale programs in the local and regional
HUD offices within their 94 jurisdictions, said David Runkel, chief
Justice Department spokesman.
   The increased Justice Department involvement is something Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp ``has been actively seeking,'' said Mary
Brunette, a top aide to the secretary.
   She said HUD auditors already checking agency operations around
the country ``would be involved in every possible aspect of a
Justice Department investigation and would be fully cooperative and
would welcome the assistance.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush is ``confident that Secretary Kemp's going to get it (HUD)
straightened out, to turn the management around and cooperate
fully.''
   At least three U.S. attorneys already are investigating alleged
fraud by real estate agents. In Fort Worth, Texas, a federal grand
jury has charged a real estate agent with stealing $2.5 million from
the sale of 55 HUD-forclosed homes in the Dallas area.
   In addition, the U.S. attorney in Baltimore is investigating a
Maryland real estate agent who has acknowledged keeping $5.5 million
from the proceeds of HUD-owned properties.
   Marilyn Louise Herrell, nicknamed ``Robin HUD'' by investigators,
has claimed in interviews that she gave most of the money to
charitable organizations to help the poor.
   Federal authorities in Washington are searching for a local
attorney who acted as a HUD escrow agent before he disappeared last
year. Investigators say $3 million may be missing.
   Four officials in HUD's Washington field office, including the
director, were recently placed on leave with pay by Kemp.
   HUD auditors also have been sent to several cities, including
Denver, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and New Orleans to check
records of the property sales.
   Real estate agents who represent HUD at the property closings are
supposed to turn over the proceeds of the sales to HUD. But auditors
have determined that money is not being returned to the agency.
   HUD officials, meanwhile, confirmed a report in Thursday's
editions of The Washington Post that they had asked the U.S.
attorney in Denver to investigate allegations that a HUD accountant
in Denver manipulated an automated bill-paying system to transfer $1
million into his personal bank account.
   Justice Department officials in Washington declined to comment on
the case.

<HEAD>Skinner Looking At Adding Alcohol Checks To Random Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department is considering
expanding its drug-testing program to include random checks for
alcohol abuse among 4 million transportation workers, Secretary
Samuel Skinner told Congress Thursday.
   The transportation secretary also said he would recommend that
President Bush veto a House anti-drug bill if passed. He said the
measure, which covers only railroad workers, would require the
administration to start over on a drug-testing program it has
already ordered.
   Skinner made the announcement on alcohol testing before a Senate
committee considering its version of legislation to require random
drug and alcohol testing throughout the aviation, railroad,
shipping, pipeline, trucking and mass transit industries.
   The Transportation Department last November ordered drug testing
programs in private transportation industries beginning at the end
of this year, but the programs face several court challenges. The
Supreme Court has approved some drug testing but has yet to act on
random testing.
   The proposal to put random testing into law brought general
support from transportation industry representatives and strong
objections from groups representing the employees who would be
tested. The Senate passed a random testing law in both 1987 and 1988
but the House failed to accept it.
   ``I have decided that we must step forward and address the issue
of alcohol misuse in transportation now,'' Skinner told the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   The secretary said he has directed department lawyers to prepare
proposed rules that would allow officials to explore ``what more
needs to be done and how best to do it.''
   Skinner said a Coast Guard program of mandatory post-accident
alcohol testing for the maritime industry begins in December, but he
said testing rules that would cover all of transportation raise
complex questions and should be drafted carefully.
   ``A lot more thought needs to go into the idea of extending
random testing to alcohol, and I am making it a high priority to get
needed information,'' he said. He noted, for instance, that alcohol
is legal while current rules apply to illegal drugs.
   Skinner said the House version of the anti-drug bill would
mandate random alcohol test rules just 90 days after enactment of
the bill. ``I look to the long term, and I know that to develop a
program that will achieve its objective and withstand legal
challenge requires more care and consideration,'' he said.
   Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said alcohol and
illegal drug use by transporation workers cannot be ignored, saying
that drugs or alcohol caused railroad accidents once every 12{ days
last year.
   ``Call it intimidation. Call it whatever you will,'' he said.
``But the fact is that random testing is the only method we have to
reasonably ensure that transportation employees will not use drugs
on the job.''
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, sponsor of the House drug bill, said
Skinner's decision to explore alcohol testing was a change from his
department's position that it was not needed.
   He said the anti-drug bill requiring random testing of railroad
workers has bipartisan support and said Skinner wants anti-drug
measures left to the ``whims of the transportation secretary.''
   Michael O'Connell, lawyer for a national association of
owner-operated heavy trucks, said drivers oppose random testing
because ``millions of innocent drivers will be victimized by the
regulations.''
   O`Connell introduced Sandy Craig of Anderson, Ind., who owns and
drives a single truck with her husband, as an example of a driver
who would be subjected to urine testing, possibly in the presence of
the person conducting the test.
   Mrs. Craig, interviewed after the hearing, said she opposes
roadside random testing because it would delay her trips, ``and I
think the procedure proposed is humiliating.''

   Veteran money-launderer Arnold Batliner
celebrated his 85th birthday Thursday, unworried that the FBI might
get on to him. Actually, the pint-sized octogenarian washes all the
change used at the St. Francis Hotel.
   Batliner estimated, with a computer assist, that he has washed
$15.5 million in coins at the hotel over 27 years _ more than a
million pounds of change since 1962.
   Coin-washing has been a tradition at the hotel since 1936, when
silver dollars were in circulation.
   ``The coins were washed as a service for the ladies who
frequented the hotel and wore white gloves which were soiled by the
dirty money,'' said hotel spokesman Don Blum.
   ``We all love you,'' Robert Wilhelm, the hotel's managing
director, told Batliner at a champagne birthday party. The staff
sang ``Happy Birthday,'' tossed down bubbly and snacks, and gave
Batliner a 19-inch color TV.
   And there was a birthday cake decorated with a large candy
replica of a silver dollar.
   Batliner, whose workplace is a security-tight room deep in the
bowels of the famous hotel on Union Square, beamed when reporters
and cameras recorded the scene. Like Batliner, the hotel is also 85
years old this year.
   When the coins come out of the ancient Sahara Silver Burnishing
machine in use at the hotel since 1936, they are as bright as the
day they were minted, a ``touch of class'' the St. Francis says.
   The machine uses buckshot and a special soap compound to wash
each load for 90 minutes before the coins go into a rinse of boiling
water, are dried, recounted and wrapped.
   Batliner said he enjoys his work, reduced to a half-day since he
was hospitalized a few years ago after a mugging at his doorstep.
   ``I'm half-retired, you can say,'' he chortled.
   He said he has one complaint about taking on those dirty coins
delivered by banks in sacks of $1,000.
   ``Sometimes there's chewing gum in them,'' he muttered, but he
added with some pride that he never encountered a coin he couldn't
clean.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday reaffirmed its decision to allocate to land mobile radio
service a frequency band that previously had been available to
amateur radio operators.
   The commission's August 1988 action had been appealed by the
American Radio Relay League and about 700 other amateur radio
organizations and individual ham radio operators.
   David Sumner, ARRL's executive vice president, said the league
plans further appeals in federal court.
   ``The commission's action today is a disappointment, but not a
surprise,'' he said. ``The entire history of this proceeding is one
of the commission ignoring evidence that did not support its
preconceived position.''
   Sumner added that ``now it will be up to the federal Court of
Appeals to determine whether, by so doing, the commission
overstepped its bounds.''
   At Thursday's meeting, the FCC stood by its decision to maintain
the 216-220 MHz band for maritime mobile communications, allocate
the 220-222 MHz band _ which earlier had been available to amateurs
_ to land mobile service and allocate the 222-225 MHz band
exclusively to amateur service.
   A number of other frequency bands also are currently allocated to
amateur radio operators.
   In affirming the previous action, members of the commission said
they were particularly sensitive to the needs an concerns expressed
by amateurs, particularly their requirements for emergency
communications.
   The commissioners said allocation of the 220-222 MHz band to land
mobile service was driven by the need to provide frequencies for
development of spectrum-efficient land mobile technology.
   In other actions Thursday, the FCC:
   _Proposed amending its rules to permit mobile stations in
aviation services to use 40 reallocated channels in the 136-137 MHz
band.
   The commission called for allotting 20 channels for aeronautical
en route services and 15 channels for air traffic control purposes,
with the remaining five channels to be held temporarily in reserve
for future aeronautical advisory and automatic weather observation
services.
   _Amended its rules to expand the use of mobile service
frequencies for tone signaling, which is used for ripping alarms to
indicate equipment malfunctions, monitoring and changing the
operational status of equipment, as well as detecting intruders and
hazardous conditions.

<HEAD>Karpov in Unexpected Draw at World Cup Tournament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union
escaped with a draw against British grandmaster Nigel Short in a
ninth-round game to maintain his lead in the World Cup chess
tournament Thursday.
   The outcome caused a sensation among grandmasters watching the
duel as Karpov, the former world champion, was in a seemingly
hopeless position when the encounter was adjourned after a 60-move
struggle from a Queen's gambit on Tuesday.
   ``Unbelievable!'' shouted Yugoslav grandmaster Ljubomir
Ljubojevic as he watched the drama unfold on a monitor in the press
room adjoining the tournament hall. ``Karpov has a thousand lives.''
   Short, the only player to defeat Karpov this year, was at a loss
for an explanation.
   ``Seven moves into the resumption, I missed a winning
continuation,'' he said. ``I don't know what came over me. I had
analyzed it so well, but Karpov took a completely different line
from what I had prepared.''
   ``He played without any threats, just coordinating his pieces.
Maybe that's why I went wrong,'' Short said.
   Karpov agreed.
   ``Nigel should have floored me 10 times over, even though it was
not so easy as some of the others thought,'' he said. ``But when he
wasted his best chance, I could easily even out. I was lucky.''
   The extra half-point boosted Karpov's score to six points from
the eight games he has played so far and kept him on top of the
standings with a half-point lead over Jan Timman of the Netherlands
and Britain's John Nunn, who tallied 5{ points after nine games.
   It also kept alive Karpov's chances of catching world champion
Gary Kasparov of the Soviet Union in the race for the world cup. The
final cup tournament is in August.
   Two other adjourned games from the previous rounds in the
$100,000 Rotterdam event were completed Thursday.
   Jaan Ehlvest of the Soviet Union and Lajos Portisch of Hungary
drew their adjourned eighth-round game, as did Jesus Nogueiras of
Cuba and Soviet grandmaster Arthur Yusupov.
   The 11th round of the tournament continues Friday.

   Civil rights and women's rights advocates,
protesting a series of Supreme Court decisions they say are turning
back the clock on racial progress, accused the court Thursday of
engaging in ``redneck justice.''
   The court's latest ruling, although a partial victory for
minorities, touched off a storm of angry rhetoric because it comes
on the heels of recent decisions erecting roadblocks for
anti-discrimination efforts.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said conservatives on the court ``again revealed themselves to be
hostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years.
Redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less
painful than the real thing.''
   The court, by a 5-4 vote Thursday, barred the use of a key 1866
civil rights law to fight racial harassment. But the justices,
voting unanimously, did uphold use of the law to sue private
individuals and to fight other forms of discrimination.
   John Buchanan of the liberal People for the American Way said,
``It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's general outlook
on civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with a measure
of relief.''
   He and others said minorities and women now must turn to Congress
for help.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., urged President Bush to join
Congress in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings.
   ``Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source of
genuine concern,'' he said. ``Together they are a serious threat to
the 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairer
society.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of a House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, warned that a court
majority led by appointees of former President Reagan intends to
carry out ``Reagan's unfinished agenda to reverse'' years of
progress for minorities and women.
   Edwards said Thursday's ruling sends this message to minorities:
``Be thankful you have a job but too bad if you experience
discrimination once you're hired.''
   Benjamin Hooks and Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights called the current Supreme Court term, due to end
within two weeks, ``a disaster for all those committed to equal
employment opportunity.''
   Julius Chambers of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
said the latest ruling means ``employers who do not want blacks on
their work force can simply hire blacks and harass them on the job
until they quit.''
   Women's rights groups were equally alarmed.
   ``In several rulings ..., a slim majority of the court has turned
back the clock on advances which so many worked long and hard to
achieve,'' said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law
Center.

   Imre Nagy, executed as a traitor after
the anti-Soviet uprising of 1956, will be reburied as an
``outstanding statesman'' Friday by a new generation of communist
reformers.
   Only a year ago, before Hungary's more liberal leadership changed
the official view of history, police used clubs to break up a
memorial demonstration.
   Kiosks did a brisk business Thursday in Nagy buttons and in
black-rimmed armbands bearing his picture or ``56'' on the national
colors of red, white and green.
   The city government said all public buildings were to display
black flags Friday.
   Nagy was premier in 1956, when a popular uprising began Oct. 23
and was crushed by Soviet tanks on Nov. 4. He and his close
associates fled to the Yugoslav Embassy but later were seized by the
Soviets while traveling outside the embassy with diplomatic escorts.
   They were tried, and executed in Budapest on June 16, 1958.
Nagy's rehabilitation began in February of this year, when the
Communist Party leadership decided the anti-Soviet revolt began with
a popular uprising and was not a counterrevolution after all.
   Exiled survivors of the military crackdown and reprisals returned
to Budapest for Friday's funeral, many for the first time.
   Bela Kiraly, who commanded the paramilitary national guard under
Nagy and now lives in New Jersey, said it was hard to believe he was
in Budapest ``with my past'' for the first time in 33 years.
   He declared to journalists Nagy's leadership was ``absolutely''
right, that the liberal changes made then were an ``absolute, total
victory'' and ``the bastions of the old regime ... were wiped out.''
   Asked whether he thought the leaders of 1956 were ahead of their
time in trying to meet the people's demands for more democracy,
Kiraly replied: ``We were behind the times because changes were due
in 1945,'' before the Communist Party had consolidated power.
   Kiraly said the revolt was an ``expression of popular will'' and
would have continued if the Soviets had not intervened.
   A commemorative plaque was unveiled Thursday at the Budapest
prison where Nagy and the others were held.
   Most newspapers and periodicals carried articles, documents and
photographs about the uprising. Nagy's picture was on the cover of
several magazines.
   Women's Journal, the most popular weekly, put a painting by
Caravaggio called ``Burial'' on its cover. It portrays a Christ-like
figure being borne by mourners.
   At Heroes Square, a platform was built on the steps of the art
museum for coffins bearing the remains of Nagy and four of his
associates, and an empty one symbolizing all who perished.
   Among those paying last respects will be a government delegation
led by Premier Miklos Nemeth.
   One year ago Friday, on the 30th anniversary of the executions,
police with motorcycles and truncheons dispersed protesters who
gathered on the steps of the state television building demanding
democracy and Nagy's rehabilitaion.
   At a news conference with government leaders Wednesday, members
of the independent youth group known by its initials FIDESZ asked
about last year's events in the light of the changed official view.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn responded that ``no one in the
Central Committee could have known one year ago what would happen .
.. and the conclusions that would lead to.''
   About 200 people from a branch of the youth group protested
outside the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, demanding withdrawal of
Soviet forces from Hungary. They chanted ``Russians go home!'' and
carried banners with such slogans as ``There is a limit to our
hospitality.''
   A Hungarian government statement Wednesday expressed sympathy for
families who suffered in the ``national tragedy'' and said:
   ``The government wishes to do everything possible to make sure no
one shall ever again be sentenced in order to serve political
preconceptions and without legal basis.''
   Two weeks after the Communist Party said Nagy was a symbol of
reform policies, the government statement described him as an
``outstanding statesman.''
   ``On the day preceding the funeral, the government reaffirms that
its greatest aim is to contribute to national reconciliation and the
creation of a social consensus for the betterment of the nation,''
the statement said.
   A poll of 276 people in Budapest, published by the weekly
magazine HVG, said only 1 percent agreed with the execution of Nagy.
One-fifth of those questioned said they felt he deserved some
punishment, but 74 percent said he never should have been tried.

   Belgian physician Jan Cools was freed
Thursday after 13 months as a hostage in Lebanon and came to
Damascus, bound for home.
   ``I would like to thank everybody who helped in getting me
released,'' the 32-year-old relief worker said earlier Thursday in
Sidon, his eyes filled with tears, upon being freed in that southern
Lebanon port city.
   ``I feel very happy to be free. I feel very tired.''
   He said his captors treated him well.
   Cools thanked ``especially Col. Moammar Gadhafi for getting me
released.'' Gadhafi leads the radical North African Arab nation of
Libya.
   The physician worked for the Norwegian humanitarian organization
NORWAC and was kidnapped May 21, 1988.
   Upon his arrival in the Syrian capital, Cools was immediately
taken to the home of Belgian Ambassador Andre Vokaer and declined to
make any statements to reporters.
   Damascus airport officials said a Belgian military transport
plane arrived at 11:30 p.m. with Cools' parents and two doctors
aboard. Embassy officials said the plane was to fly Cools home later.
   Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain, who drove with
Cools from Lebanon, said Cools will stay in Damascus for a few days.
   Fourteen other foreigners _ including nine Americans _ are held
hostage in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. Three others
are missing.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In Sidon, Cools spoke with reporters in the apartment of Mustafa
Saad, whose predominantly Sunni Moslem militia has controlled that
city 25 miles south of Beirut since Lebanon's civil war broke out in
1975.
   Younis Amran of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian
guerrilla group led by terrorist Abu Nidal, sat near Cools as the
freed relief worker spoke. Cools thanked Saad for ``efforts that
facilitated my release.''
   Amran said the group calling itself Soldiers of Justice, which
claimed responsibility for abducting Cools, freed him at Gadhafi's
request following ``efforts by us,'' and he was turned over to Saad.
   An aide to Saad said Urbain and the minister's chief aide, Robert
Willermain, drove from Damascus to Saad's residence especially for
the release. Speaking in French, Cools said before leaving Sidon
that his captors told him Thursday morning to ``take a shower.''
   ``I took one, they bought me the new clothes that I am wearing
now and told me I will be released upon Col. Gadhafi's mediation.
They brought me here.''
   He was dressed in a beige shirt and trousers.
   On Wednesday, the Soldiers of Justice issued a statement saying
he would be freed in response to an appeal from Gadhafi. It said
negotiations were conducted by the Abu Nidal faction.
   ``We hope this goodwill gesture will awaken the conscience of
Western nations to support the causes of the oppressed, especially
the people of Palestine, who are subjected to daily killings and
destruction,'' it said.
   There has been widespread speculation that Abu Nidal's group
kidnapped Cools, but spokesmen for the organization have denied it.
   Police say the Soldiers of Justice is a name used by the
terrorist's followers.

<HEAD>Cheney Orders Attack on Gimmicks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered an
internal attack on budget gimmicks used by the Pentagon to make its
five-year spending plan seem small enough to confirm to President
Bush's decisions, a pleased congressional critic disclosed Thursday.
   The special review is expected to slash at least $45 billion from
the spending projections for the fiscal years 1990 through 1994,
even though the Bush administration already has agreed to cut
Pentagon budget requests by $65 billion during the period.
   The two figures are not additive. The $45 billion in projected
cuts would offset elimination of the accounting tricks without
changing the five-year total, $1.6 trillion.
   Cheney's order was disclosed by Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., in a
letter he released from the General Accounting Office updating the
results of a critical study presented to Congress on May 10.
   The GAO update states that Cheney has ordered a ``program
execution review'' with the objective of ``elimination of negative
planning wedges in the five-year defense plan (and) close
consideration of the affordability of currently proposed major
weapons programs.''
   The so-called negative planning wedges are deductions used to
balance some $45 billion worth of spending requests that exceed the
Bush administration's latest five-year plan.
   For example, the Pentagon plan currently contains a negative
figure of $21.7 billion derived from its historical experience that
2 percent or 3 percent of procurement funds ultimately are not spent
because of program changes. GAO said this deduction should not be
included.
   While the special review involves annual budgets that would
undergo extensive revision in any case before finally being
submitted to Congress, it is nonetheless significant because it
could force the immediate demise of programs that the military
wanted to keep alive on its wish list.
   Ireland hailed Cheney's move, saying the defense chief was
showing ``a real commitment to bringing Pentagon spending into line
with fiscal reality.''
   ``While Secretary Cheney makes fundamental changes in the
Pentagon's planning process, Congress also needs a healthy dose of
self-discipline and foresight,'' Ireland added.
   ``Congress must put aside parochial concerns and focus only on
those programs that contribute to a strong and efficient national
defense.''
   The GAO study released last month strongly castigated the Defense
Department for providing Congress a five-year defense plan that
``might be close to'' being worthless. Charles Bowsher, the head of
the agency, said the plan would require at least $147 billion more
than the Pentagon conceded would be needed.
   Especially troubling, Bowsher testified, was the fact the
Pentagon's spending plan exceeded President Bush's own budget plan
by $45 billion.
   Bowsher told the panel that ``since the mid-1980s, the
department's five-year defense planning has been fiscally
unrealistic. More weapons were being planned and developed than
could be produced in an economic manner or supported once they were
produced.''
   Congress has approved $290.2 billion in spending authority for
the Pentagon this fiscal year and is expected to approve a request
of $295.6 billion for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.

   President Bush promised Thursday to push to end
discrimination against disabled people and increase access for them
as he hosted a festival at the White House for handicapped people
with artistic talents.
   ``You're all well on your way to the kind of life that I want to
see for every American _ a life of independence and opportunity and
productive involvement in our mainstream. And that means a
commitment on society's part to end discrimination, to increase
access and opportunity in our schools, on the job and in every
aspect of our society,'' Bush told a gathering of a few hundred
young people on the White House lawn.
   The White House event was sponsored by the Very Special Arts
organization, which is holding a weeklong international festival in
Washington to recognize the accomplishments of the physically and
mentally disabled in the areas of music, dance, drama and creative
arts.
   Bush and his wife Barbara sat in the front row for a show emceed
by game show host Monty Hall and featuring performances by Kenny
Rogers, the Gallaudet Dance Company from the Gallaudet University
for the deaf, and a 14-year-old blind Thai boy who once was a street
begger and now sings in eight languages.
   The boy, Phongsak Muenchanai, sang ``We Are The World,'' and a
rousing ditty in Japanese. He then called the president to the stage
asking to shake his hand. ``I would like to know the difference
between the hand of the president of the United States and a blind
boy like me,'' he said.
   Bush said the boy's accomplishment ``tells us all there's no
limit to how far we can go or what we can achieve.''
   ``You guys don't let any disabilities stand in your way,'' he
told the gathering. ``So it's up to us to make sure that
discrimination doesn't stop you. And federal law must protect
individuals with disabilities and I'm going to do my level best to
see that it does.''
   The Very Special Arts is an organization founded in 1974 by Jean
Kennedy Smith, sister of the late President Kennedy, to coordinate
arts programs for children and adults with mental and physical
handicaps.
   The organization is an educational affiliate of the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Its international festival
this week brings together artists from 52 countries.

   A referendum on constitutional reforms
backed by both the right-wing military government and opposition
leaders will be held July 30, President Augusto Pinochet announced
Thursday.
   The reform package includes the easing of restrictions on Marxist
activity, which had been totally banned by the country's 1980
constitution.
   It fails to eliminate nine senate members to be appointed by the
government but increases the total number of seats from 36 to 48,
thus reducing the voting power of the appointed bloc. It adds an
additional civilian member to a powerful, military-dominated
National Security Council.
   Another amendment would ease the requirements for future
constitutional changes.
   With backing from both the government and opposition, the reforms
are virtually assured of passage in the referendum.
   Gen. Pinochet, who seized power in 1973 coup, faces replacement
in Dec. 11 elections the 73-year-old leader was obliged to call when
he lost a referendum last year on extending his rule to 1997.

   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing and four other
consulate offices in China granted visas Thursday to more than 100
Chinese to go to the United States, the State Department reported.
   Another 114 applicants were turned down for a variety of reasons,
the most likely one being that they apparently intended to use
temporary visas to try to remain permanently in this country.
   Additionally, 350 applicants were asked to return to U.S.
diplomatic offices to have their situations reviewed. Many of them
were sent home because U.S. officials did not have enough time to
interview them by the end of the day.
   The visas were issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the
consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang. The embassy
and the Shanghai consulate had suspended processing while assisting
Americans in leaving China and then resumed on Wednesday.
   Almost all the visas approved were for brief stays. They required
the approval of Chinese authorities, who issued exit permits, and a
knowledge of English.
   An exact count was not available because the Beijing Embassy
reported that of 138 applicants interviewed on Thursday ``a
majority'' were approved.
   In Shanghai, 62 were approved, in Gunagzhou, formerly Canton, 15,
in Shenyang, ll, and in Chengdu, 2.
   There were no reports of interference with applicants by Chinese
security forces posted outside the U.S. diplomatic offices.
   But dissidents and other pro-democracy advocates sought by
Chinese authorities were unlikely to apply. They either would be
apprehended by security forces or denied the required exit permits.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the embassy
and consulates would process as many applicants as show up. The
staff at the embassy and the consulates was not reduced even though
other Americans were urged to leave China.
   There were no figures on how many applications were approved on
Wednesday.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, saying he seeks to
``remove the guilty and protect the needy,'' sought on Thursday to
reassure lawmakers that individual rights will be respected in his
drive for drug-free public housing.
   ``I will be equally tough for due process,'' Kemp told the House
Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control in outlining his
agency's plan to rid public housing of drug dealers and users.
   Key provisions would speed drug-related evictions and seize
apartments of alleged dealers and users. Those elements have been
criticized by tenants' rights groups as not providing adequate legal
protection for the accused.
   ``As we aggressively pursue our objectives to eradicate drugs
from our housing programs we will not do so at the expense of
individual tenants' rights,'' he added in a written statement.
   He said his Department of Housing and Urban Development is
reviewing each state's judicial structure as it relates to eviction
to ensure individual rights are protected.
   HUD has granted exemptions from the agency's administrative
grievance procedures in evictions of alleged drug dealers and users
in public housing in Virginia, Massachuestts, New York and the
District of Columbia.
   Public housing managers said federal regulations which required
local government officials to allow tenants threatened with eviction
to appeal to agency administrative panels and then to courts slowed
evictions by as much as a year.
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., questioned how he would envision
handling the case of the possible eviction of a single mother or
grandmother living in public housing with a drug-selling teen-ager
she feared.
   ``You cannot have one policy that will cover every single
condition in public housing,'' Kemp said, adding eviction actions
would have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
   However, Kemp said he wanted to give public housing authorities
the power to ``to remove the guilty and protect the needy.''
   Kemp also cited the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as legislation
that has hampered his anti-drug efforts.
   The law makes it illegal for any recipient of federal money to
discriminate based on ``mental and physical impairments,'' and
includes drug and alcohol dependent persons among those defined as
being legally handicapped.
   As a result, Kemp said public housing which gives priority to the
disabled would have to include such people.
   ``In my view the drug user should not be put at the top of the
waiting list for public housing,'' said Kemp.
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., has introduced legislation to exclude
drug addicts and alcohol-dependent persons from those protected by
the 1973 law.
   Other aspects of HUD's plan plan for drug-free public housing
would tighten security, reclaim vacant units and deny access to drug
dealers, encourage resident management and homeownership, establish
an anti-drug hotline at HUD for residents to anonymously report
drug-related activities, terminate housing assistance of those
convicted of drug crimes and provide money for athletic programs in
public housing.
   Kemp offered no figures on the total cost of the program.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., head of the
Appropriations subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies, told a
meeting of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities the
secretary's anti-drug effort was initiated to show that the
government wanted to be a good landlord.
   ``The point has been made. Now the point has to be turned into
dollars,'' she said.

<HEAD>Recovering Soviet Alcoholics Ending U.S. Tour</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moscow cinematographer named Victor, sober
now for nine months, says he's undergoing a personal ``perestroika''
thanks to the small but growing fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous
in the Soviet Union.
   ``Perestroika is a very popular word now in my country,'' he
said, referring to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
restructuring the Soviet economy. ``We alcoholics can restructure
ourselves and become better, happier persons. I am rebuilding my
life.''
   Victor, 42, who followed A.A. tradition in asking that his last
name not be used, is among three recovering Soviet alcoholics who
are ending a two-month tour of the United States. They held a news
conference Thursday at the National Press Club.
   Since they arrived April 10 in New York, Victor and his
companions, Sasha, 43, and Volodya, 37, have attended scores of A.A.
meetings from Massachusetts to Texas, visited alcoholism treatment
centers and met with such celebrities as Betty Ford and Kitty
Dukakis, who also are recovering alcoholics.
   On Monday, they met with President Bush's physician, Dr. Burton
Lee, at the White House. They'll end their tour this weekend in
Atlanta with a side trip to Plains, Ga., where they will attend a
Sunday school class led by former President Carter.
   The tour was organized by the Rev. J.W. Canty, an Episcopal
priest from New York who is chairman of the non-profit Soviet-U.S.
Joint Conference on Alcoholism, Drug Addiction and Peace in Moscow.
   Canty, who helped start the first A.A. meeting in the Soviet
capital in August 1987, told reporters that ``A.A. would have to
function underground if it weren't for the new, freer attitudes''
under Gorbachev's reform policies.
   The ``Moscow Beginners'' group of A.A. has about 40 members who
meet seven nights a week at various spots in the Soviet capital.
Small groups active in other Soviet cities bring total A.A.
membership to fewer than 100, Canty said.
   ``It's very small, but it's a beginning,'' Canty said. ``It's
working slowly but well. If you can save even one life, that's an
enormous contribution.''
   Alcoholics Anonymous, a 12-step program of recovery that stresses
spiritual growth and mutual support among members who share their
``experience, strength and hope,'' claimed about 835,500 members in
the United States last year, and more than 1.5 million members
worldwide.
   Canty went to Moscow in 1985, shortly after Gorbachev took office
and began a strict anti-alcoholism campaign. The Communist Party
newspaper Pravda estimated in November 1987 there are more than 4.5
million registered alcoholics in the Soviet Union, with 1 million of
them requiring compulsory care.
   Canty said the actual number of Soviet alcoholics probably ranges
from 10 million to 15 million. He said his efforts to encourage the
growth of Alcoholics Anonymous in that country have been made easier
by the personal support of Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, who
``showed great interest in our work.''
   The times and locations of A.A. meetings are routinely announced
on government-run TV and radio broadcasts. A Gorbachev aide once
informed Canty that the Soviet leader had read all the
Russian-language A.A. pamphlets circulated by Canty's office.
   Volodya, a Moscow factory machinist who drank two bottles of
vodka every day until he got sober 16 months ago, said alcoholics
still suffer a painful stigma in the Soviet Union.
   ``They are treated like the worst human beings,'' he said, while
in America ``they know it is a disease that is treatable, and even
famous people can confess to being recovering alcoholics.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is determined
to reform the Soviet Union, said Thursday it may be dangerous for
the world if reform stops in China, the other communist giant.
   ``I think all of us are very much concerned at what is happening
in China,'' he said. ``All of us want the process of deep reform not
to fail'' in such a large nation.
   ``That failure would be very dangerous for the entire process of
creating a healthy environment in the world,'' the Soviet president
told a news conference at the end of a four-day visit to West
Germany.
   Gorbachev expressed concern about events in China and said,
without being specific, that his government regretted ``some aspects
of what happened.''
   The comments were his most extensive on the subject since the
Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow passed a cautiously worded
resolution after the military crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing two weeks ago.
   He praised at least some of the students, who he said wrote him
an interesting letter, but he made no mention of the violence used
on them.
   Estimates of the number of people killed range from a few hundred
by the government to about 3,000 by Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence.
   When asked whether he shared the official Chinese view that the
students were counterrevolutionaries, Gorbachev did not reply
directly. The Soviet leader recalled that, during a visit to Beijing
last month after a 30-year rift with China, he said dialogue was the
way to resolve problems.
   After he left, ``the situation became rather grave,'' he said.
   ``I don't think we have full information'' on which to make an
assessment, and that dictated his ``balanced, serious position'' on
China, he said.
   Gorbachev said he received letters in which Chinese students
spoke out for reform.
   ``I cannot suspect these people of any evil intention,'' he said,
but there ``could be elements ... that took advantage of the
situation.''
   He did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
   An oil tanker that had been aground on
a sand bar for 19 hours was refloated Thursday after barge crews
pumped off 25,000 barrels of oil to lighten the vessel, the Coast
Guard said.
   The 600-foot Omi Leader, carrying 200,000 barrels of heavy oil,
ran aground late Wednesday six miles east-southeast of Cape Henry
near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.
   After tugboats failed to move the tanker, barge crews pumped
5,000 barrels of oil an hour from the vessel to an adjacent barge.
   The water on the shoal is about 34 feet deep and the tanker draws
35{ feet when fully loaded, Coast Guard Petty Officer Steve Blando
said.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Rick Woods said the tanker
was freed about 4:30 p.m. and moved under its own power two miles
south to drop anchor for the unloading of an additional 15,000
barrels.
   ``They're going to send down divers to look at the bottom of the
vessel to see if there's any hidden damage,'' he said.
   An initial inspection by divers while the ship was still on the
shoal determined the visible part of the ship's hull was intact,
Blando said.
   No injuries were reported and no oil was spilled when the tanker
ran aground. An oil containment boom was placed around the ship late
Wednesday as a precaution.
   The tanker is registered to Omi Leader Transport Inc. of New York
and was heading to Koch Refinery in Newport News when it went
aground.
   An investigation was under way to determine if navigational error
caused the grounding.

<HEAD>Five Nations Vote For European Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Britain, Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Spain chose European Parliament members Thursday
after election campaigns dominated by national rather than
pan-European issues.
   In other European Economic Community nations _ Belgium, France,
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and West Germany _ voting takes
place Sunday.
   Official results of Thursday's balloting will not be announced
until voting ends in the other countries Sunday night. In Denmark,
the vote count begins Monday morning.
   A total of 7,126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518-member
Parliament, which meets one week a month in Strasbourg, France.
   Contenders represent 178 national parties of every political
persuasion.
   Unofficial projections on Thursday's balloting offered a mixed
picture.
   A British opinion poll saw Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party losing four to 10 of its 45 seats, getting 38
percent of the vote against 42 percent for the opposition Labor
Party, which has 33 seats.
   Labor turned the election into a referendum on Mrs. Thatcher's 10
years in power at a time when Conservative support is at its lowest
since she won a third five-year term in 1987. People are concerned
about high inflation and interest rates.
   Mrs. Thatcher sees planned European Community legislation as a
threat to the free-market revolution she is carrying out in England
with mixed results.
   In the Netherlands, an exit poll projected Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers' Christian Democrats will win two more seats from their
Conservative coalition partners, giving them a total of 10 seats.
The Conservatives now hold five seats. Labor Party would retain its
nine seats, according to the poll.
   Spain was out of step with the general trend. Polls there showed
the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez could lose as
many as four of its 28 seats. Conservative and centrist opposition
parties also were expected to post slight losses, leaving them a
half dozen seats while the communist-led United Left coalition was
seen winning 5 seats, up from 3.
   Spanish opposition parties see the election as a litmus test for
general elections to be held by June 1990.
   Opinion polls predict balloting in all 12 member nations will
boost socialists, who with 166 seats already are the largest faction
in the assembly, and centrist Christian Democrats, who hold 112
seats.
   Green parties concerned with the environment hold 20 seats and
are expected to do well, notably in West Germany and France.
   Voting in Ireland coincided with national elections, as will be
the case Sunday in Luxembourg and Greece.
   Especially in these nations, campaigns have highlighted national
rather than European issues such as the plan to remove the
community's internal borders and create a single market by Dec. 31,
1992.
   The European Parliament is one of three institutions directly
involved in the community's lawmaking process. It must be consulted
on single market issues involving the environment, research and
technology, occupational health and safety.
   It also approves some treaties with other countries and
applications for membership.

   An explosion ripped through a
Pakistani-owned supertanker in a Dubai dry dock Thursday, killing
one crewman and injuring at least 10, police reported.
   The blast shattered windows for miles around and triggered a
fierce blaze aboard the vessel, which was being repaired in Dubai, a
major southern Gulf port and capital of the United Arab Emirates.
   Dubai police commander Dhahi Khalfan said firefighters and civil
defense squads took three hours to control the fire.
   One man was killed and 10 others were injured, some seriously, he
told reporters without giving names or nationalities. Marine salvage
executives said they are believed to be Pakistani and Filipino
nationals.
   Dubai-based agents for the 231,439-ton Seiva refused to give
details of the accident. The Seiva is owned by the Pakistani company
Gokul and managed by Atlas shipping company of Hong Kong.
   The salvage executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the blast occurred in the pump room of the tanker. They said a spark
from a welding gun apparently ignited gas from the engine tank.
   ``We have not yet determined the cause of the explosion,''
Khalfan said.
   The explosion was so powerful it tore apart the crew
accommodation quarters on the starboard side of the vessel, one of
the shipping executives said.
   It was not known how many crewmembers were aboard.

<HEAD>Bush's Clean-Fuel Plan Would Boost Corn Prices, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The provision in President Bush's clean-air
package to require use of clean-fuel cars could boost corn prices as
much as 15 cents a bushel, an ethanol industry group said Thursday.
   Production of ethanol, which is made from corn, would rise from
850 million gallons to 1.1 billion gallons a year, the nation's
current production capacity, the Renewable Fuels Association
estimates.
   ``We're real encouraged by that,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., a
leading advocate in Congress of alternative fuels, said in an
interview. ``I personally feel that (estimate) is quite
conservative. ''
   The clean-air program Bush unveiled Monday would require the sale
of a million clean-fuel cars in the nation's nine most polluted
areas by 1997.
   Those cars, which would be powered by methanol, ethanol or
natural gas, would produce fewer of the chemicals that cause ozone
pollution.
   ``Generally, we're very pleased with the president's
announcement,'' said Bob Dinneen, legislative director for the
Renewable Fuels Association. ``We think that it will greatly enhance
the potential for increased production and use of ethanol.''
   General Motors officials recently told Congress they are prepared
to recommend the use of ethanol in their automobiles as early as
next year, Daschle said.
   ``The automobile companies have seen this coming for some time
and they're prepared to address the challenge a lot more effectively
than we might otherwise give them credit,'' Daschle said.

   A military judge gave four soldiers
prison terms of up to nine months Thursday for the beating of a
Palestinian who later died, and he called on the army to ``have the
courage to look in the mirror.''
   The judge, Col. Emanuel Gross, urged the military to bring to
trial officers who gave illegal orders that extended army policy of
beating Palestinians who were rioting to include those who were
arrested.
   The case focused national attention on the beating policy, which
drew fire from foreign governments and human rights organizations
after beatings by soldiers appeared on television newscasts abroad.
   Also Thursday, a 46-year-old man in the Gaza Strip was fatally
stabbed by fellow Palestinians who accused him of collaborating with
Israeli authorities, Israel radio and Arab sources said.
   Sixteen Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in clashes
with soldiers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including a
12-year-old boy shot in the pelvis in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza.
   Shlomo Franco, 42, an Israeli cameraman for the U.S. TV network
ABC was shot in the face with a plastic bullet by soldiers
dispersing Palestinian rioters in Ramallah, West Bank. He was
reported in good condition.
   The four members of the elite Givati Brigade were convicted of
brutality on May 25 but acquitted of manslaughter. Doctors testified
the 42-year-old victim, Hani Shami, died not from their blows but
from a later beating by other unidentified soldiers.
   Gross urged prosecutors to try officers who issued the beating
orders, saying: ``There won't be any value to this trial if we don't
do anything to enforce the law. We have to have the courage to look
in the mirror.''
   The army has said it did not plan to bring charges against the
brigade commander but did not make clear if it intended to charge
other officers.
   Gross said, ``The affair exposed in this case symbolizes perhaps
a breakdown in values which, if continued, would endanger the basic
values that are the true cultural heritage of our country.''
   After Thursday's sentencing, a brawl erupted outside the
courtroom when one defendant, Pvt. Ron Hakhel, 20, lunged at
photographers and TV camera crew.
   The defendants and several of their friends, including a military
policeman, brawled with photographers for almost 10 minutes. One
photographer emerged with a swollen eye.
   Hakhel, Pvt. Yitzhak Kibbudi, 20, and 1st Sgt. Yitzhak Adler, 21,
were sentenced to serve nine months in prison and given additional
nine-month suspended sentences and two years probation.
   Pvt. Ariyeh Luchato, 20, was given six months in prison, six more
months suspended and six months probation. The ruling noted he
participated in only part of the beating.
   The beating was administered after the victim was arrested last
Aug. 22 in the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp.
   In Arab east Jerusalem Thursday, police seized files and papers
from a news service office run by Palestinian activist Sari
Nusseibeh, whom Israel has accused of being the Palestine Liberation
Organization paymaster for sustaining the uprising.
   The office, which provided information to foreign newspapers, was
ordered closed for two years.

<HEAD>Gregg Insists He Didn't Know About North's Efforts to Resupply Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ambassadorial nominee Donald Gregg, under
intense questioning by Senate Democrats, did not waver Thursday from
his insistence that he didn't know at the time about Oliver L.
North's secret efforts to resupply Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gregg, who served as then-Vice President Bush's national security
adviser, said that when he finally learned in December 1986 that his
associate, former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez, had been recruited to
help in North's operation, he felt betrayed.
   ``I was furious at North, I felt very let down by Felix and I
faulted myself for not putting the pieces together,'' Gregg told the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee which is weighing his nomination
to be ambassador to South Korea.
   Gregg's story, given under oath, did not shift in any major
respect from his testimony at an initial hearing last month.
   But Democrats insisted that Gregg could and should have known of
Rodriguez's involvement with North months earlier than he has
admitted and that he should have alerted Bush.
   They repeatedly challenged Gregg's credibility and said his
alleged lack of judgment disqualifies him for confirmation as an
ambassador.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., became the first committee
Democrat to say he may vote for Gregg.
   Robb said through a spokeswoman that ``barring evidence of lying
or perjury,'' he is leaning toward confirmation.
   ``He wants to review all of the evidence and he plans to make a
conscientious decision,'' said Julia Sutherland, Robb's press
secretary.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., spearheading the Gregg probe,
complained that the Bush administration inadequately responded to a
request for documents and declared: ``We are being stonewalled by
the administration.''
   But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Gregg's chief defender on the
panel, said the administration responded fully and quickly and said
of the investigation: ``It is in fact trying to harm the president.''
   ``I think Don has submitted to intense questioning and held up
very well,'' McConnell said.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., told Gregg: ``It seems to me we have
now shifted from you having done something wrong, to your being
wrong in judgment. I think these hearings will have a reverse effect
and you will be confirmed as ambassador. ... I do not think these
hearings have uncovered any wrongdoing.''
   A vote on the nomination will be held Tuesday and committee
members said it is likely to be close.
   Rodriguez was sent to El Salvador in 1984 with Gregg's help to
assist the Salvadoran government to quell a leftist insurgency.
   Gregg contends he had no inkling until August 1986 that Rodriguez
had been recruited to assist North's Nicaraguan Contra resupply
operation.
   All he knew then, he testified, was that Rodriguez told him that
unidentified ``gunrunners'' were ``ripping off'' the Contras and
should be stopped.
   ``Felix told me that North had somehow put the gunrunners and the
Contras together,'' Gregg said.
   But he said he had discounted Rodriguez's characterization of the
situation as a potential ``Watergate'' because he was not told
enough to realize the dimensions of the situation.
   Gregg said he did not put what he knew ``into context'' until
four months later when he learned of the extent of North's operation.
   But Cranston said Gregg was literally surrounded by people who
knew about the resupply operation and Rodriguez's role in it.
   ``You're trying to convince us of an elaborate conspiracy to
prevent you from knowing,'' Cranston said.
   ``Why didn't you know?'' Cranston asked.
   ``I don't think everybody did know from the outset,'' Gregg
replied.
   Gregg said that as the involvement of North and Rodriguez became
clear in December 1986 he twice offered to resign from Bush's vice
presidential staff, and Bush refused to accept the resignations.
   Much of the testimony centered on North's heavily censored
notebooks. Cranston said North hasn't complied with a subpoena for
versions of his notebooks which he said contain ``repeated January
1985 references to Felix Rodriguez which suggest North's involvement
in Rodriguez briefings of the vice president.''
   Notes made available to the congressional Iran-Contra committees
contain brief mentions of Rodriguez and indications of a meeting
with Bush but other parts were blacked out.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said an uncensored look at North's
notes might clear up much of the mystery and said: ``I'm willing to
vote for Don Gregg if we get the notebooks for these particular
days.''
   But other senators pointed out that Gregg does not control
North's notes and that North and his lawyers have resisted demands
they be made available in uncensored form.

<HEAD>Report Says Ethical to Reject Aggressive Treatment in Some Pregnancies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors may ethically counsel women to reject
aggressive medical treatment during pregnancy if their newborns are
very likely to die or have severe brain damage, contends a report in
a medical journal.
   Aggressive treatments such as monitoring the fetus, using drugs
to stop premature labor and delivering the baby by Caesarean section
are often used in cases involving severely defective fetuses, the
report said.
   Using those treatments without telling the mother that doing
without them is a reasonable option may violate her decision-making
rights, said the report, published in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The report describes the outcome of 13 pregnancies in which women
chose nonaggressive management of their cases. Nine of the babies
were stillborn and two died within a month of birth, the report said.
   One child, with serious chromosome abnormalities, died at age 4,
and another, with a usually fatal disorder of the skeletal system,
remains alive at 26 months, though dependent on a respirator, the
report said.
   It said choosing nonaggressive treatment should depend on two
criteria: Virtual certainty in the diagnosis, and a very high
probability that death or severe and irreversible brain damage will
occur in the newborn.
   Recent advances in diagnosis permit the detection of a wide
variety of fetal problems, said the report, by Dr. Frank A.
Chervenak of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and Laurence
B. McCullough of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
   The information usually leads to either aggressive treatment or
abortion, they said.
   Many fetuses with severe abnormalities face a high probability of
death immediately after birth, even with the most intensive care,
the authors said.
   Such intensive care often involves levels of physician-caused
disease, injury, pain and suffering ``that can reasonably be judged
to outweigh any benefits,'' they said.
   An accompanying editorial largely agreed with the authors in
their view that the wishes of the mother should be the main
consideration.
   The editorial, by Dr. Frederick R. Abrams of the University of
Colorado Graduate School of Public Affairs, said fairness ``demands
that in a situation in which there is a wide divergence of values
and no universally accepted source of truth, we ought to respect
patient autonomy.''

   A top State Department official, under heavy
congressional criticism for not offering more help to Americans
during the crisis in China, apologized Thursday but said no one
could have foreseen the violence that resulted from student
demonstrations in Beijing.
   ``Of course we are not satisfied when we hear that major foulups
took place,'' said Richard L. Williams, acting deputy assistant
secretary for east Asian and Pacific affairs. ``We are sorry,
congressman.''
   Williams was responding to Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., one of half a
dozen lawmakers who took the department to task for not moving
faster to evacuate Americans following the Tiananmen Square
massacre. Weiss said the department and embassy had exhibited an
``aloof attitude'' that angered citizens seeking help.
   Meanwhile, a senior administration official said the turmoil in
China does not necessarily mean the country has turned its back on
economic and political reforms. Moreover, the official suggested the
United States still could do business with supreme leader Deng
Xiaoping despite the military crackdown and massacre of hundreds _
perhaps thousands _ of people.
   ``He is the head of a very major country. There are lots of heads
of government and state who do things that we don't like that we do
business with,'' said the official, briefing a group of reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Are you suggesting we should not have done any business with
(Soviet leaders Nikita) Khrushchev, (Leonid) Brezhnev, anybody who
has done anything wrong?'' the official asked.
   Saying it was premature to say China has abandoned reforms, the
official added, ``It is not so clear that they have made a major
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on
before.''
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers pummeled the State Department with
complaints about the way it reacted to the crisis in China.
   ``Frantic parents called my office with desperate pleas for help
in getting their sons and daughters out of China,'' said Rep. Howard
Berman, D-Calif., who said his staff booked flights for students.
``If we were able to make these arrangements from Los Angeles, why
couldn't the State Department provide such assistance?''
   Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., citing a case in his congressional
district, said the State Department has denied visas to Chinese
grandparents who sought to bring grandchildren who are U.S. citizens
to the United States.
   ``It is clear to me that the way we deal with the evacuations of
U.S. citizens in a crisis, especially U.S. children, needs to be
carefully re-evaluated,'' Chandler said.
   ``In a crisis in which the lives of U.S. citizens are in danger,
I believe protection of Americans must be the highest priority.
Clearly this was not the case in China this month.''
   Chandler and others said it was simply ``luck'' that no Americans
were killed or seriously wounded in the violent aftermath of the
June 3-4 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests.
   Williams described efforts by the embassy to provide
transportation for Americans to airports, but Rep. Elton Gallegly,
R-Calif., said one of his constituents seeking help was told by a
diplomatic official that ``the consulate is not in the taxi
business.''
   Williams claimed success for the evacuation effort, noting that
more than 6,000 Americans had left China over the last week in ``one
of the largest evacuations of Americans in a crisis situation since
World War II.'' About 1,000 Americans remain, along with 182 U.S.
government personnel, he said.
   But under questioning from Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, Williams
conceded that the U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not advise Americans
to leave China until June 6, three days after the crackdown started
and well after embassies of other countries had alerted their
nationals to the danger.
   ``We had a period of time where we were deciding what seemed the
best thing to do,'' said Williams, explaining that officials feared
evacuating Americans in remote rural areas would expose them to more
danger as they passed through urban areas to airports than if they
simply remained where they were.
   He said that with some 8,800 Americans in the country, the
embassy had ``a vastly greater number'' of people to help than did
other countries.
   Mrs. Snowe said the State Department ``really didn't have a plan
in place'' to cope with the emergency. She acknowledged it was
difficult to anticipate the violence, but added, ``Ultimately we
should have gotten the drift that something was going awry.''
   Williams appeared at the hearing only under an agreement that he
would not be asked about the handling of the case of prominent
dissident Fang Lizhi, who with his wife was granted refuge at the
U.S. embassy following the violence. The gesture, and a warrant
later issued by the government for Fang's arrest, has heightened
U.S.-Chinese tensions.
   ``It just would not be helpful to the situation for me to
comment'' on that case, Williams said.

   A utility engineer at the troubled Turkey Point
power plant, which includes nuclear reactors, and two other men were
arrested on charges they sold cocaine, the U.S. attorney said
Thursday.
   The FBI moved quickly on the case ``because of the potential
danger drug usage by employees of a nuclear power plant represented
to the south Florida area,'' U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said.
   Vernon Rice, an operator at the complex's fossil fuel section,
and the others were arrested Wednesday on a five-count indictment
handed up Monday by a federal grand jury, said Lehtinen.
   Florida Power &amp; Light Co. notified the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commision of Rice's arrest even though he didn't have clearance for
the containment building, the two reactors inside or the control
room, utility spokeswoman Stacey Shaw said.
   But Lehtinen said, ``A control room operator, an engineering
watch officer in a nuclear power plant, whether its fossil or
nuclear, has access to all of it. It's clear the evidence will show
he was associating with other employees and they were commonly using
drugs.''
   The prosecutor said there was evidence drugs were used at the
plant, but didn't specify if that included nuclear reactor areas.
Both reactors are shut down.
   Ms. Shaw said there were no indications cocaine was sold at the
plant.
   Rice, 31, and Paul Muni, 28, both of Homestead, and David Wetzel,
26, of Leisure City are accused of selling cocaine in May and June.
   Authorities did not say how much cocaine was involved, but the
indictment said 3 ounces of the drug were found at Muni's home.
   Florida Power &amp; Light screens all employees for drugs when they
are hired, and randomly tests workers at Turkey Point's nuclear
section.
   The reactors are shut down partly due to a series of problems
that led the Washington-based Public Citizen group to label Turkey
Point the worst nuclear plant in the nation.
   The plant is operating under special NRC supervision for six
months because of its history of safety violations and
administrative problems.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Fears Indian Soldiers May Stay Permanently</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it fears
the 45,000 soldiers India sent to help end an ethnic civil war are
on the island to stay despite the president's request that they
leave.
   ``It is regretted certain statements have been made both here and
abroad to support the continued presence of the Indian troops in Sri
Lanka,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.
   ``Such pronouncements will only have the unfortunate effect of
confirming the fears in the minds of the people of Sri Lanka that
Indian troops have come to this country to remain and not to
return,'' it added.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said Wednesday the soldiers
could not leave until terms of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka peace
agreement were met, primarily granting local autonomy to the Tamil
minority.
   Gandhi said Wednesday his country has a responsibility for the
safety of Tamils in Sri Lanka, where they make up 18 percent of the
16 million people. Tamils, who are predominantly Hindu like India's
population, claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, most of
whom are Buddhists.
   Gandhi's government has said it does not want the soldiers to
remain permanently in Sri Lanka, which is just off the southern tip
of India, but has made clear there will not be a hasty withdrawal.
   According to the Foreign Ministry statement, the only requirement
for withdrawal under the pact is a request by Sri Lanka, and the one
``made by the president of Sri Lanka to the prime minister of India
has already satisfied this condition.''
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who took office in January, has
said the Indians should leave by July 29, the second anniversary of
the peace agreement.
   The accord, signed by Gandhi and former President Junius R.
Jayewardene, provided for deployment of Indian troops to supervise
the surrender of arms by Tamil rebels, who began fighting in 1983
for an independent nation in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   It promised the rebels limited autonomy in exchange, but failed
when the largest Tamil militia refused to go along.
   India became involved because it is the region's major power and
has 60 million Tamils of its own.
   India has said premature withdrawal would lead to even greater
violence in a nation where ethnic strife has claimed 12,500 lives in
six years.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the Tamil war and about
3,500, most of them supporters of the government, by Sinhalese
extremists who oppose any concessions to Tamils.

   A spending bill providing emergency money for
veterans' programs and other programs was threatened with further
delays Thursday as House and Senate negotiators failed to reach
agreement on whether to increase spending for drug enforcement.
   The House-Senate conference committee reported the bill back to
the two chambers with agreement on most items but not on the most
contentious one: $820 million in additional drug-fighting money for
this year approved by the House but rejected by the Senate.
   The spending bill, which could add more than $4 billion in
additional fiscal 1989 appropriations, has been delayed for weeks as
the House, Senate and White House jostle over its provisions.
   There has been no major disagreement over the underlying $1.2
billion for veterans programs, including health care. However,
lawmakers have refused to pass the bill without boosting other
favored programs and local projects for their constituents.
   The House could take up the bill again next week with a separate
vote possible on the new drug enforcement money for the Justice
Department and Customs Service. The White House says the money could
not be spent efficiently before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
   Fights also are possible in the two chambers on some budget
gimmicks in the bill, such as an accounting change in housing
programs that could increase spending up to $5.8 billion by evading
budget limits.

<HEAD>Austria Asks United States to Lift Ban on Visits by Waldheim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria has asked the United States to lift its
ban on visits by President Kurt Waldheim but ``our position hasn't
changed,'' a U.S. official said Thursday.
   The United States bans Waldheim because of his complicity in Nazi
war crimes during World War II, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, and ``we received a communication from the
Austrian Embassy asking if we could reconsider his status.''
   ``Our position hasn't changed,'' the official added, and a
response to that effect will be given to the Austrian government.
   The United States decided in April 1987 to place Waldheim, who
was secretary general of the United Nations in the 1970s, on its
so-called watch list of undesirable visitors.
   The Austrian Embassy confirmed it had conveyed a note from its
foreign ministry to the State Department but denied it had asked
that Waldheim be removed from the watch list.
   ``We simply reiterated our view that his being placed on the list
contravenes international law,'' said embassy spokesman Ulf Pacher.
   President Bush said when he was running for the White House last
year that he supported the Reagan administration's decision to bar
Waldheim, who served as an intelligence officer in the German army
in the Balkans.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitsky, who heads Austria's Socialist Party,
told reporters here last month that he did not raise the Waldheim
matter in talks with Bush and other U.S. officials during a visit.
Foreign Minister Alois Mock is a leader of Austria's conservative
People's Party with which Waldheim was allied.
   An international commission of historians appointed by the
Austrian government issued a report in February 1988 that said
Waldheim was ``in close proximity'' to some war atrocities, knew
they were going on and made no attempt to stop them.
   The Justice Department said it has evidence that shows Waldheim's
complicity in the deportation of Jews from Greek islands under
German occupation to Nazi concentration or death camps, as well as
the execution of allied prisoners.

<HEAD>Senate Opens Debate on Child-Care Package; Partisan Differences Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate opened debate Thursday on a
multibillion-dollar child-care package revised to accommodate
various Republican concerns but still opposed by President Bush.
   ``This package embodies a truly bipartisan and comprehensive
approach to this nation's child-care crisis,'' said Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., co-author of major elements of the legislation.
``It's not a complete answer, but it's a very solid beginning.''
   The centerpiece of the package is a revised version of Dodd's
proposed Act for Better Child Care, a $1.75 billion program
including subsidies to poor families and grants and loans to
encourage establishment of new and expanded child-care centers.
   Tacked onto the measure was a separate set of tax credits for
poor families, drafted by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and a
provision designed to make clear the legislation was not aimed at
eliminating church-based child care.
   Also included is an amendment unrelated to child care that would
delay the implementation of a law requiring business to test benefit
programs for discrimination. Business interests have been lobbying
heavily for the delay and by attaching it to the child care package
Democrats hope to increase support among Republicans.
   Indeed, several key Republican senators endorse the thrust of the
package although they disagree with certain elements. But Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas was not among them and said he
would fight to quash Dodd's financing approach in favor of a
Bush-supported measure relying almost exclusively on tax credits.
   ``This is a necessity,'' Dole said. ``It is a high priority with
the president. It is a high priority with the administration. But we
believe there is a better way to go.''
   Dole said he hoped to sway Democrats during what likely will be
several days of debate and dozens of attempts to amend the measure.
Democrats said they would negotiate with the administration but were
committed to having the ABC framework in the final bill.
   The compromise version of Dodd's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, leaves virtually all regulatory decisions at the
state level. Federal regulations proposed in the initial bill drew
stiff opposition from Republicans. As revised, the legislation
establishes health and safety categories for which states must adopt
standards.
   Seventy percent of the money would go to parents to help pay for
child care, 22 percent would go to training and grant and loan
programs designed to improve the quality and supply of child care
and 8 percent would go to states to administer programs and enforce
standards.
   The seperate Bentsen tax credits package makes changes in the
dependent care tax credit already provided to some families _ making
it available even if they owe no federal taxes.
   It also establishes a new tax credit of up to $500 to help pay
for health insurance for children. Families with annual incomes of
$21,000 or less would qualify for that credit.
   Over a five-year period the estimated cost of those credits is
$10.3 billion.
   The third component stipulates that any financial assistance
provided under the measure be used ``in a manner consistent with the
Constitution,'' language designed to allow parents to use subsidies
to pay for child care at church-run centers provided government
funds are not used for religious purposes.
   Dole said Dodd's financing approach left too much of the money in
government hands and that the GOP tax credit package, which is
similar to Bentsen's proposals, would put the money directly in the
hands of parents.
   ``They're the ones who are going to make the decisions, not some
institution, not some bureaucrats,'' Dole said.
   But Democrats said there was no guarantee parents would use tax
credits to pay for child care, and that tax credits alone would do
nothing to improve the quality and availability of care.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 15th graf, ``At the,'' explaining that church no longer

<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony Coelho of California said goodbye to
Congress Thursday with a speech on the House floor and a celebration
belying the fact that an ethics inquiry had shot down his soaring
career.
   ``The generosity of my constituents and the goodwill of my
colleagues have enabled me to serve for 25 years,'' he said,
recounting his tenure first as a staffer and, for the last decade,
as one of the most promising Democratic members of the House.
   ``Over that time, we made a difference and we made some changes.
But now the winds of change blow anew,'' he said in a brief speech
that evoked applause in the chamber and tears from some California
colleagues.
   Political friends sponsored a Capitol Hill bash to mark the
occasion and Coehlo's choice of a departure date, his 47th birthday.
   Coehlo was perhaps the most adroit political operator among the
House Democrats. In the early 1980s, he transformed the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee into a modern and powerful
organization.
   Promoted in 1986 to the No. 3 party post of majority whip, he
helped Speaker Jim Wright maneuver legislation with such success in
the 100th Congress that Republicans howled.
   ``You know, I play hard and I work hard,'' he said in an
interview earlier this week. ``And I'm in the big leagues and ... I
knew all along the way that when you're doing that, if you make an
error, it's not going to be like somebody on the back bench who made
an error.''
   Coelho failed to report a $50,000 loan from a savings and loan
whose chief executive had set him up in a junk bond deal financed by
the loan. Coelho maintains that the deal was proper and that his
only mistake had been an accounting oversight.
   But the deal was exposed as Wright's position was collapsing,
when Coelho could have moved up from his post as whip to the
position of majority leader.
   The winds of change that blew Coelho were whipped up by the
Wright affair and Coelho couldn't face the prospect of battling
against them. So instead of stepping up the ladder, he went for
cover. He quit.
   ``I knew for the next two years the Republicans would try to
embarrass my party using the mistake that had been made,'' he said.
The issues he had worked on _ including his efforts on behalf of
fellow epileptics _ were too important, he said.
   ``So my ultimate political trick was to take away from them the
very thing they wanted most, to use me,'' he said.
   Ironically, the final votes of Coelho's House career came as the
chamber considered President Bush's proposed bailout of the savings
and loan industry. Much of the focus of the bill was to rein in
thrift institutions whose sometimes risky investment strategies
bankrupted the federal insurance program.
   Coelho says he's not bitter, not angry, about what's happened to
him. He compares it to a point earlier in his life when his quest
for the priesthood was crushed because of his epilepsy.
   At the time in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church would not ordain
epileptics. It no longer has such blanket prohibitions in canon law
against sufferers of specific diseases.
   ``I was right on the verge of becoming a priest when that was
taken away from me. That's when I found out about my epilepsy. ...
All of a sudden, at the last moment, it was taken away.
   ``But the good lord took me from that narrow pursuit to a
different type of ministry.''
   He preached the Democratic view, but also boasted of having
Republican friends. In recent years, he consulted with former
President Nixon on foreign policy and other issues _ but not, he
says, on the decision to resign.
   Coelho says he hasn't yet chosen a new career, and will spend the
next three months making some speeches for money and mulling his
future.
   That future may be in business or at a university, he said, but
in all likelihood will never mean another run for elective office.
   Coelho said his resignation will permit him to continue his work
on behalf of fellow epileptics.
   He already has raised money to open 14 job centers for epileptics
with hopes for 25 by the end of the year, is sponsoring programs to
educate children about epilepsy, and is raising money for a center
at UCLA to study the treatment of afflicted children.
   ``A lot of people dwell on the one side of me but don't pay
attention to the other side,'' he said. By his resigning, ``They
found out about the other side,'' he said.

   Syrian artillery fire on Thursday set
ablaze a tanker loaded with gasoline for the besieged Christian
enclave north of Beirut, and scuba divers blew up three boats
carrying badly needed food there, police said.
   A police spokesman said the Timex Star, carrying 660,000 gallons
of gasoline, was hit at 9:30 p.m. off Tabarja, 15 miles north of
Beirut.
   The spokesman, anonymous under standing regulations, did not
identify the tanker's owners or registration. He said 19 crewmembers
were rescued but he gave no details.
   ``The ship is ablaze and sinking. It was hit by an artillery
barrage fired from west Beirut as it was 500 yards from the coast,''
he said.
   The blaze lit up the night sky over Tabarja and the nearby
Christian port of Jounieh as thousands of frightened residents
rushed to underground bunkers.
   The enclave's 1 million residents are enduring an acute gas
shortage because of a 3-month-old Syrian artillery blockade. roke out March
8 between Aoun's mainly
Christian army units and Syrian forces in Lebanon and the allied
Druse militias.
   Arab League nations have been trying to enact a truce in the
fighting, the latest violence in the 14-year-old civil war that has
split Lebanon into rival Moslem and Christian governments.
   Syria, with an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate, began shelling the Christian
heartland after Aoun imposed a March 6 blockade on illegal ports run
by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut. The ports were diverting
customs fees from government-run ports.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army command said two of its soldiers
were slightly wounded Thursday when guerrillas fired mortars on an
Israeli army unit in the Jewish state's self-proclaimed security
zone in southern Lebanon.
   It said the attack occurred in the eastern sector near the
Lebanese village of Kaoukaba, eight miles north of the Israeli
border.
   The Israeli unit responded with fire, the command said.
   The firefight came a day after Israeli warplanes bombed a base of
a Syrian-based faction of the Palestine Liberation Front near Beirut.
   The security zone is a six-to-10-mile-wide strip across the
border which Israel carved out in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of
its troops from Lebanon. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive out
Palestinian guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan became an associate member of France's
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences on Thursday and declared he
is more optimistic than ever about the future of peace and democracy.
   He received the honor in an elaborate ceremony beneath the dome
of the French Institute, just one day after Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II made him an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most
Honorable Order of Bath.
   ``These are the days of the triumph of freedom and knowledge,''
Reagan said. ``Ladies and gentlemen, I am more optimistic than ever
in my life about peace and democracy in this world.''
   Reagan is the sixth U.S. president to become a member of the
prestigious academy. The others were Thomas Jefferson, Theodore
Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
   Twelve foreigners currently are members of the academy. It is one
of five making up the French Institute, which was founded in 1795.
   At the start of a three-day visit to Paris, Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, were received under the cupola by academicians in their
formal dress of black tails with elaborate green embroidery. Academy
President Albert Brois presented Reagan with the gold medal that
signifies membership.
   Reagan paid tribute to the man he is replacing, Swiss theologian
Hans Urs von Balthasar, who died last year, then reiterated his
belief in the power of modern communications to undo totalitarianism.
   Taking up the theme he addressed in London, Reagan said
technology is promoting democracy by giving all people access to
information.
   ``All of us here have seen the spirit of the democracy loose upon
the earth in recent months,'' he said. ``The communications
revolution is helping to set that spirit free and to spread its
message.''
   He cited the upheaval in China and changes in Hungary, Poland and
the Soviet Union.
   ``The biggest of big brothers is increasingly helpless because
information is the oxygen of the modern age,'' said Reagan.
Knowledge, he said, seeps through barbed wire and turns iron
curtains to lace.
   Reagan was scheduled to meet Premier Michel Rocard on Friday and
take part in centennial celebrations of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday

   The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a key
civil rights law as a weapon against private discrmination but
barred its use to fight racial harassment such as assignment to
menial tasks on the job.
   Civil rights groups, finding little solace that a larger defeat
was avoided, expressed outrage and called the ruling the fourth
major setback the court has dealt minorities and women this year.
   A newly solidifed conservative majority led by appointees of
former President Reagan is undoing civil rights progress that began
in the mid-1950s, the groups said.
   ``This Supreme Court term has been a disaster for all those
committed to equal employment opportunity,'' said Bejamin Hooks and
Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference of Civil Rights.
   ``In several rulings ..., a slim majority of the court has turned
back the clock on advances which so many worked long and hard to
achieve,'' said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law
Center.
   The court unanimously voted to reaffim its 1976 ruling that an
1866 law enacted to help freed slaves could be used to sue private
citizens accused of illegal racial bias.
   By a separate 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that the 123-year-old
law cannot be invoked to fight racial harassment.
   There was considerable irony in the two-part ruling.
   The justices sparked an uproar in the civil rights community last
year by announcing they would use the relatively obscure case of a
black North Carolina bank teller to consider throwing out the 1976
ruling.
   Some of the outrage was muted Thursday when the court retreated
from that threat. But civil rights activists angrily noted that
Thursday's decision came on the heels of three major defeats for
minority and women's rights.
   ``It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's general
outlook on civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with a
measure of relief,'' said John Buchanan of the liberal People for
the American Way.
   Last January, the court banned racial quotas in the awarding of
public works project by state and local governments.
   On June 5, the justices restricted the use of statistical
evidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities or
women to lower-paying jobs.
   And just last Monday, the court significantly expanded the power
of white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans,
even years after those plans took effect.
   Writing for the court Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said
that concern for precedent compelled a reaffirmation of the 1976
ruling.
   Even if that ruling was based on a mistaken interpretation of
law, he said, ``It is certain that it is not inconsistent with the
prevailing sense of justice in this country. To the contrary, (it)
is entirely consistent with our society's deep commitment to the
eradication of discrimination based on a person's race or the color
of his or her skin.''
   But Kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment was not
envisioned by the 1866 law.
   That spelled defeat for Brenda Patterson, a North Carolina woman
who was a teller at a credit union. She sued under the 1866 law,
seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment.
   Her assignment to sweep floors, she said, constituted
impermissible racial harassment.
   Her suit had been dismissed by lower courts.
   Kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights _ such as
hiring and promotion decisions _ and not other forms of conduct by
an employer, such as assignments to tasks like sweeping floors.
   A victim of racial harassment still could sue under the 1964
Civil Rights Act or various state laws. The 1964 act does not allow
the recovery of punitive damages, while the 1866 act does. Also, the
1866 act applies to all employers, while the 1964 statute exempts
employers of 15 or fewer people, about 15 percent of the work force.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``What
the court declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the
other.''
   He said the ruling severely weakens the 1866 law by ``ignoring
powerful historic evidence about the Reconstruction Congress'
concerns'' about ending racial bias.
   Joining Brennan were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Joining Kennedy in limiting the 1866 law were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia and Byron R. White.
   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are Reagan appointees; Rehnquist was
promoted to chief justice by the former president. White had been
appointed by former President John F. Kennedy.
   The court's 1976 decision at issue in the case is called Runyon
vs. McCrary. It held that racially segregated private schools that
refuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law.
   That ruling allowed civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as a
weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms, and allows
those who sue to collect much larger damages than other civil rights
laws.
   The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of U.S.
senators, more than 100 House members and more than 100 civil rights
and public interest groups had urged the court not to tamper with
its 1976 ruling.
   In a separate decision Thursday, the court said states and state
officials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protects
civil liberties. The 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan said states
and their officials are not ``persons'' as envisioned by the 1871
law.
   In other rulings, the court:
   _Gave some legal help to any man who, saying he is the biological
father, seeks visitation rights to the child of a woman married to
someone else.
   Voting 5-4 in a California case, the justices said states must
give such men a ``fair opportunity'' to seek visitation rights.
   _Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Pennsylvania case, that states may be
forced through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning up
hazardous waste sites targeted under the so-called federal Superfund
Act.
   _Shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seeking
to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education for
handicapped children. The court, 5-4, spared Pennsylvania from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.

<HEAD>Severe Storms Over The Southern Atlantic Coast States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Unseasonably cool air dropped temperatures to record lows
Thursday from Minnesota to Texas, and strong thunderstorms developed
along the East Coast.
   Thunderstorms developed in warm, humid, unstable air ahead of a
cold front from western Virginia across western sections of the
Carolinas and Georgia into northwestern Florida.
   Wind in thunderstorms gusted to 80 mph in Greenville County, S.C.
Trees and power lines were blown down near Seneca, S.C., and in
Greenville County, the National Weather Service said. Trees also
were toppled near Polkville, N.C.; Cherokee County, S.C.; near
Bostwick, Ga.; near Oglethorpe, Ga., and in Oconee County, Ga., the
weather service said.
   Rainfall from the storms was also locally heavy. Atlanta received
three-quarters of an inch of rain in less than an hour.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.82 inches at Troy, Ala.; 2.622 inches at Montgomery, Ala.; 1.14
inches at Milton, Fla.; and 1.05 inches at Atlanta.
   More than 76,000 residents of the Washington area remained
without power Thursday afternoon, down from a peak of 150,000, after
a violent late spring thunderstorm downed electric lines. Potomac
Electric Co. officials said Wednesday's storm was the worst, both in
terms of the numbers of customers affected, and damage to its
equipment, in its 93-year history.
   Two days of severe thunderstorms in Alabama were blamed for a
house fire caused by lightning Thursday and two deaths, plus
scattered power outages and damage from Tuscaloosa to Huntsville.
   The sky cleared Thursday over much of Texas, after several days
of thunderstorms that brought relief to parched southern Texas, but
caused flooding in northern sections of the state that killed at
least five people, inundated homes and forced evacuations.
   From Wednesday until Thursday afternoon, 1 to 1{ inches of rain
fell across the upper Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians and
rain continued into Thursday night. Greenville, Pa., received 2.3
inches of rain in a 24-hour period.
   Rain also fell near a cold front extending from northwestern
Montana through central Idaho to the northern Pacific Coast.
   Unseasonably cool air covered much of the Plains and Mississippi
Valley during the morning, pulled down from the north by the
circulation of a large dome of high pressure centered over western
Kansas. Overnight lows dipped to the 30s and 40s from the central
Rockies across the northern and central Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes.
   Nearly 20 cities tied or broke low temperature records:
   Amarillo, Texas, 48, a tie; Dodge City, Kan., 44; Duluth, Minn.,
35, tie; Eau Claire, Wis., 36; Goodland, Kan., 41; Grand Island,
Neb., 40; Huron, S.D., 38; Lincoln, Neb., 44, tie; Midland, Texas,
56, tie; Minneapolis, 41; North Platte, Neb., 34; Rochester, Minn.,
35, tie; St. Cloud, Minn., 34; Sioux City, Iowa, 41; Sioux Falls,
S.D., 37, tie; Spencer, Iowa, 37; Valentine, Neb., 33; Waco, Texas,
59, tie; and Wichita, Kan., 54, tie.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Worcester, Mass., to 107 at Needles, Calif. Thursday's
low in the 48 contiguous states was 31 at Shell Lake, Wis.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from much of the Atlantic Coast and Florida across the Tennessee and
Ohio valleys to eastern sections of the upper Great Lakes. Scattered
showers and some thunderstorms were forecast from the northern high
Plains across the northern Rockies into Washington state.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted over the upper Great Lakes,
northern Maine, and from the central Rockies to the coast of
Washington state; in the 90s over the Florida Peninsula and along
the southern Atlantic Coast, and from southern and western Texas
across the southern and central Rockies and into interior valleys of
California; above 100 over the desert Southwest, interior southern
California and near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in
the 70s and 80s over most of the rest of the nation.

   A neighbor who found a woman's missing
dog forced her to increase her reward fourfold and set up a
nighttime drop at a gas station, police said.
   But dogged police work resulted in the capture of four people on
extortion conspiracy charges, and Sheila Hawkins got back her
5-year-old miniature Yorkshire terrier, Bentley, in good condition.
   The neighbor, 18-year-old construction worker Ronnie Blackwell,
told police he'd grown fond of the shaggy little dog he said he
found by the public library nearly a half mile from Ms. Hawkins'
home in this northwestern South Carolina city of about 44,000 people.
   ``He said he had become really attached to the dog and felt if he
kept upping the price, the lady would just think the dog wasn't
worth it,'' city police Detective Audrey McNair said Wednesday.
   Bentley had been missing since June 8. Ms. Hawkins, a 30-year-old
hairstylist, put out fliers offering a $50 reward for the dog's
return.
   On Sunday, she received a phone call from a man who said he had
the dog, and promised to bring him to her house for the reward,
authorities said.
   Bentley never arrived. Instead, a woman called three times
Sunday, told Ms. Hawkins, ``We have the dog,'' and said $50 wouldn't
be enough, according to a police report. The woman identified
herself as a mother whose son had found the dog and was very
attached to him.
   During one call, a man said Bentley's captors wanted $200, the
report said.
   Ms. Hawkins agreed to the price, but the dog wasn't returned. She
said she offered the callers a puppy the next time she had Bentley
bred, but they weren't interested.
   On Tuesday, one of the captors' relatives saw a television news
report on the missing dog, and apparently persuaded the four they'd
better return it, authorities said. They called Ms. Hawkins to say
they'd return him that night.
   That evening, she got a call instructing her to go to a gas
station to get her dog, but no money was demanded at that time.
   Detective McNair was at Ms. Hawkins' home when the call came. She
accompanied her to the gas station, where the three people waiting
were arrested.
   A fourth person, 18-year-old Rebecca Entsminger, was arrested
when she showed up at the police station later.
   She, Blackwell, Blackwell's 19-year-old sister, Theresa; and
Kipling Messer, 19, were all charged with conspiracy to commit
extortion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison
on conviction.
   McNair said Entsminger, who is Blackwell's girlfriend, had posed
as his mother in one of Sunday's phone calls.
   The detective said police couldn't determine whether Blackwell's
story that he found the dog was true. Ms. Hawkins said she felt from
the beginning that Bentley hadn't just run away.
   ``I was just hoping whoever had him wouldn't mistreat him,'' she
said.

   U.S. officials said Thursday they are intrigued
by, but unable to explain fully, the surprise arrest in Cuba on
corruption charges of a decorated army general who had been a
trusted servant of the revolution.
   The officials said it was not clear whether the action taken
against Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, 58, was part of an anti-corruption
crackdown or because Cuban authorities questioned his reliability.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said they were cautious
about drawing conclusions because of the absence of hard information.
   Ochoa is a veteran of Angola and Ethiopia and also served as
commander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua. According to Rafael
Fermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on the Cuban military, Ochoa
was awarded the title ``Hero of the Revolution'' in 1984 and was
cited by the Council of State for a variety of virtues, including
``honesty'' and ``purity.''
   The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces said in a
statement Wednesday that Ochoa is being investigated for ``grave
acts of corruption and dishonest use of economic resources.''
   According to one account, Ochoa had engaged in illicit sales of
Cuban sugar to Angola.
   Gen. Rafael del Pino, the highest ranking military officer ever
to defect from Cuba, said he believes there was a relationship
between the arrest of Ochoa and the sacking of Transportation
Minister Diocles Torralba the day before.
   Del Pino said that Defense Minister Raul Castro, brother of
President Fidel Castro, had said in a speech Wednesday that many of
Ochoa's subordinates were arrested as well.
   Del Pino, who defected two years ago, said he believes that the
arrests were based on a high-level of discontent within Ochoa's
command which ``could have led to an uprising'' against President
Fidel Castro.
   He also said Torralba, during his military career, was one of the
``most beloved and intelligent'' officers and had become ``the best
prepared and most intelligent personality in the Cuban government.''
   The Council of State resolution, approved on Jan. 1, 1984, said
that Ochoa ``carried out several internationalist missions with
particular spirit of sacrifice (and) brilliant performance as
commander of Cuban troops in Ethiopia.'' He also was praised for
``his honesty, unselfishness, spirit of sacrifice, purity, desire to
excel and heroism.''
   Del Pino seemed to agree with that assessment, saying that Ochoa
was not a member of the ``corrupt elite'' in Cuba.
   In a telephone conversation from Havana before this week's
arrests, Elizardo Sanchez, a human rights activist in Havana, said
there has been a deterioration of the rights situation in Cuba in
recent weeks which reflects government uneasiness.
   As an example, Sanchez cited the case of Roberto Bahamonde, an
outspoken dissident who was arrested and sentenced to a six-month
jail term last April for trying to organize a demonstration for
visiting Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Sanchez said that last Friday, Cuban authorities added a year to
Bahamonde's jail term for engaging in illegal economic activities.
Bahamonde had been self-employed as a free lance photographer before
his arrest.
   Self-employment generally is illegal in Cuba but Sanchez said the
thousands of Cubans flout that law in order to improve their living
standards. He said the crackdown on Bahamonde could only be
interpreted as additional retaliation for his dissident activities.

   President Bush on Thursday announced
nominations for two Energy Department posts and the U.S. ambassador
to the Organization of American States.
   The White House said the president selected J. Michael Davis to
be assistant secretary for conservation and renewable energy. He
would succeed John R. Berg.
   Davis has been president of GlowCore Colorado Inc., based in
Englewood, Colo., since 1986. He was a division manager in the
Energy Department from 1977 to 1980.
   Stephen A. Wakefield was chosen to be general counsel of the
Energy Department, succeeding Francis S. Ruddy. Wakefield has been a
senior partner in the Houston law firm of Baker and Botts since
1986. He was an Energy Department aide in 1974.
   Bush picked Luigi R. Einaudi to be the U.S. permanent
representative to the rganization of American States, succeeding
Richard Thomas McCormack.
   Since 1977 Einaudi has been director of the office of policy
planning coordination at the State Department's bureau of
inter-American affairs.

   Federal engineers opened investigations into
reports of safety defects in up to 200,000 Subaru cars and Nissan
trucks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said
Thursday.
   The investigations, both preliminary evaluations, involve
complaints of engine fires in 1987 Subaru DL and GL models and
complaints of steering problems in 1987 to 1989 Nissan pickup
trucks. Preliminary evaluation is the lowest level of investigation
conducted by NHTSA engineers when they receive complaints.
   NHTSA said the government received five complaints from Subaru
owners of engine compartment fires. It estimated that 67,000 of the
cars are on U.S. roads.
   Two owners wrote to complain of steering problems in the Nissan
vehicles, including one that resulted in an accident with injuries,
NHTSA said.
   The safety agency said one complaint involved a locked steering
wheel and the other a loss of steering control.
   Engineers will determine whether evidence warrants an upgrade of
their inquiries to engineering analyses which would invovle actual
inspection of the vehicles.
   NHTSA, in its monthly Defect Investigation Report, also announced
upgrade of its investigation involving more than 640,000 Ford Taurus
and Mercury Sable 1986 and 1987 cars.
   An engineering analysis will be conducted into the possibility of
broken or cracked front seat brackets in the cars, following 68
complaints received by Ford Motor Co. and the government.
   A substantial number of motorists have lodged warranty complaints
involving the seat brackets, NHTSA said.

   A witness testified on Thursday she saw
Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson, the man accused of shooting Prime
Minister Olof Palme, shouting in a drunken rage and hailing Palme's
death.
   She quoted Pettersson as saying last September that if Palme had
not been dead already, he should be killed. Pettersson may have said
he killed Palme, but she could not make out his exact words, said
Sigrid Lovisa Malm.
   Palme, Sweden's four-term prime minister, was killed on a
downtown Stockholm street on the night of Feb. 28, 1986, shortly
after emerging from a movie house with his wife. Pettersson was
arrested for the shooting last December.
   Palme's widow Lisbeth, who was grazed by a second bullet, was
scheduled to testify on Monday after the court granted a list of her
conditions, including excluding Pettersson from the courtroom. The
court refused, however, to hear her in a closed-door session.
   Mrs. Malm, 64, testified that she saw Pettersson at his suburban
train station, ranting against Palme.
   She said she was frightened by his drunken aggressiveness and
could not distinguish whether he was saying ``jag'' (I) or ``man,''
(someone).
   ``I (or someone) shot Olof Palme. If he hadn't been shot I (or
someone) would shoot him again,'' Mrs. Malm quoted the defendant as
saying.
   The prosecution also produced a witness to contradict
Pettersson's alibi that he spent the evening at a gambling club and
then went home.
   Reinhold Julius Jansson, 60, countered Pettersson's claim that
he, Jansson and Lena Akerlund met at the club a few hours before
Palme was shot.
   Jansson said ``I can't remember meeting either Christer or Lena
that day.'' Asked if he thought Pettersson was lying, Jansson said,
``maybe he got the day wrong.''
   Miss Akerlund, who also was called to the stand, said she did not
trust her memory because ``I was constantly on drugs mixed with
booze.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Thursday declared his first state visit to West Germany had
yielded ``a convergence of souls'' that stirred hopes for a new age
of trust and cooperation in Europe.
   But while his four-day summit was drenched in an atmosphere of
goodwill, Gorbachev gave no ground on the emotional issue of a
reunited Germany _ the issue of biggest concern to West Germans.
   At a news conference capping his appearances in Bonn, Gorbachev
dismissed the Berlin Wall as ``no great problem,'' compared with
other East-West differences, and sidestepped questions about the
chances for reunification.
   Those issues are of utmost importance to West Germans and
Gorbachev's failure to tackle them could allow the aura of goodwill
to slip.
   Gorbachev enjoys more popularity among West Germans than any
other foreign statesman, according to opinion polls, and most of
that support is rooted in a hope that his reforms will some day lead
to reunification with Moscow-aligned East Germany.
   When the Kremlin leader was asked whether he thought Europe would
ever again recognize a single German state, he gave a vague and
traditional reply.
   ``The situation in Europe today was determined by historical
realities,'' Gorbachev answered, referring to World War II.
   He dismissed suggestions the Berlin Wall stands as a symbol of
the Cold War and a time of less promise in relations between East
and West.
   ``I don't think the Berlin Wall is the sole barrier between East
and West,'' Gorbachev said at the news conference.
   Soviet dissident and Nobel Peace laureate Andrei Sakharov said in
Amsterdam he hoped the Berlin Wall would be torn down soon and asked
the communist world to ``liberate (itself) from the lies of the
past.''
   Sakharov, in the Netherlands to pick up an honorary law degree,
commented on Gorbachev's remarks that the Wall was ``no great
problem ... nothing is eternal in this world.''
   ``It is a very good statement,'' he said. ``I hope it will happen
soon, but it would of course have been best if it would never have
been built in the first place.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass later reported Gorbachev's return
home.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher will give
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III a report on the Gorbachev
visit in Washington next week, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said.
   East Germany built the wall in 1961 to halt a tide of emigration,
and Gorbachev echoed the Berlin government claim that it ``took
advantage of its sovereign rights'' to build the wall, and that its
removal depended on an end to the conditions that led to its
construction.
   Gorbachev suggested the wall should not be given too much
significance in East-West relations, noting it was one of a number
of differences.
   ``I see this as no great problem,'' he concluded.
   Reflecting West Germans' eagerness to see the Soviet visit in the
most positive light, Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein said he
saw Gorbachev's response as containing rays of hope.
   ``The Soviet general secretary said this is something that can be
overcome, something that can be solved,'' Klein said later.
   Gorbachev told steelworkers in the industrial city of Dortmund in
the Ruhr Valley that, ``What we've encountered here on your soil
moved us a lot.''
   ``We saw many faces, we looked many people in the eyes, we felt
much sympathy, I would say a convergence of souls,'' he said.
   Both Soviet and West German officials appeared to take special
care throughout the summit to avoid controversy.
   A joint declaration of goals for Europe, which Gorbachev
described as the most momentous accomplishment of his summit,
reiterated arms control objectives on which both the Warsaw Pact and
NATO have similar approaches. Yet it omitted any mention of
short-range nuclear weapons, over which the two blocs disagree.
   Despite the lack of movement on issues close to West Germans, the
image of successful East-West diplomacy could offer political
rewards for both leaders.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party has lost
badly in recent elections, and Gorbachev continues to face
widespread resistance to his reforms.
   Both Soviets and West Germans suffer some insecurity about their
standing in world affairs, and the outpouring of good feeling the
past four days has boosted their sense of confidence.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said Gorbachev's
visit had formed a bond between the peoples of the Soviet Union and

   ``If you think of all the suffering and also the fear, it's a
real human and political advance,'' Weizsaecker said. ``The
attraction and also trust have grown.''
   At his news conference, Gorbachev also said his leadership
regretted some aspects of the conflict in China and expressed
concern over the future of reforms there. It was his most extensive
comment on China since pro-democracy demonstrations heated up during
his visit to Beijing a month ago.

<HEAD>Bomb Injures Nine In Belfast, Soldier Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded near a road as a
joint police and army patrol passed by Thursday night, injuring nine
people _ seven men in the patrol and two women civilians, police
said.
   The blast ended a day in which a soldier was reported fatally
shot by his own comrades, a bombing injured another soldier and a
sniper fired on a security patrol.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but police
attributed all the attacks to the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
which is fighting to end British rule in the province.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said Adam Gilbert of the Royal
Marines, 21, posted to Northern Ireland two weeks ago, was shot and
killed just before dawn while on foot patrol in Belfast.
   A spokesman, speaking anonymously, said it ``seems probable that
the soldier was accidentally shot when the patrol opened fire from
different points'' at a car which drove at them and tried to knock
down one of them. The car was found abandoned and burned out at
Divis Flats, a public housing complex and stronghold of IRA support.
   A sniper fired a single shot at a police patrol in the Ardoyne
area of Belfast but injured no one, police said, .
   Hours later, an off-duty soldier suffered serious leg injuries
when a bomb hidden under his car exploded in Coleraine, County
Londonderry, police said.

<HEAD>Actor Accused in Court Document of Sex with Minor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe had sex with a minor while using
illegal drugs, a lawyer charged in a document filed in U.S. District
Court to support a lawsuit by the girl's mother.
   The affidavit filed Wednesday by Athens lawyer J. Hue Henry on
behalf of Lena Arlene Wilson added to the seriousness of the
allegations that have led to a criminal investigation of Lowe's
activities at an Atlanta hotel last summer.
   Ms. Wilson is suing Lowe for damages for emotional stress she
says followed Lowe's alleged seduction of her daughter, Jan Parsons,
then 16. The lawsuit has been moved from state to federal court at
Lowe's option as an out-of-state resident.
   A sexually explicit videotape has circulated showing Lowe, 25,
with Miss Parsons and another woman, but it does not show the
alleged intercourse between the actor and the 16-year-old.
   In the affidavit, Henry said he told Dale Kinsella, Lowe's
California lawyer, ``in essence that I believed that the film
depicted sufficient debauchery to sustain a claim for seduction of
an unmarried daughter under Georgia law.'' The affidavit mentioned
illegal drugs but did not identify them.
   Lowe's attorneys have denied that he ``has committed any wrongful
acts giving rise to liability.'' Richard North, one of Lowe's
Atlanta attorneys, said after Henry's filing Wednesday, ``We stand
by our previous pleadings.''
   ``Before filing this lawsuit, I interviewed a witness who stated
that she saw Mr. Lowe engage in sexual intercourse with Ms. Wilson's
daughter,'' Henry's affidavit said.
   He said the witness told him and Pamela Guest, a lawyer
representing Jan Parsons and her father, John, that one of Lowe's
Atlanta-area lawyers was aware of the witness' statements.
   The affidavit denies charges filed earlier by Lowe's attorneys
that Ms. Wilson and her former husband attempted to blackmail the
actor before suing.
   Henry said another California lawyer, Barry Hirsch, invited him
to propose a settlement offer and that he replied that he would
discuss settlement options and that his client would consider any
offer Lowe's lawyers cared to make.
   Henry denied making a settlement demand of $500,000. He said his
client rejected a ``take it or leave it'' settlement offer of
$35,000 in February. He did say he told Kinsella he would recommend
acceptance of a $500,000 offer if Kinsella were to make such an
offer but that he did so at the urging of Kinsella.
   Henry, in his affidavit, repeatedly denied suggesting that Lowe's
acting career could be damaged by criminal or civil actions and
denied suggesting that he could get criminal charges dropped.
   Lowe is under investigation by Fulton County authorities on
possible criminal charges of sexual exploitation of a minor, a
felony that carries up to 20 years in prison.

   Police fired tear gas
Thursday to stop 200 students protesting poor living conditions in
this impoverished Caribbean nation.
   Police said they arrested 12 students. No injuries were reported.
   The protesters, from Santo Domingo's State University, were
demonstrating in support of a 48-hour general strike called Monday
by several trade, student and neighborhood groups to demand higher
wages and protest deteriorating living standards.
   In an about-face Thursday, President Joaquin Balaguer said he
sympathizes with leaders who called the strike and is willing to
negotiate with them. Last week he refused to talk to them. There was
no immediate response from strike leaders.
   Thursday was pay day for many people, and residents anticipating
the strike flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food.
   Police fired the tear gas to stop students moving the
demonstration from the university campus to downtown streets.
Protesters retaliated by smashing car windshields in the area, which
prompted the arrests.
   In anticipation of possible unrest Monday, police armed with
automatic rifles searched for weapons in vehicles entering the
Dominican capital Thursday.
   They also rounded up discarded tires along city streets to
prevent protesters using them to build burning barricades.
   Monday's strike also was called to demand better government
services in the city, which is plagued by water shortages and power
failures.
   The independent newspaper Ultima Hora reported several similar
demonstrations this week by poor residents of the central Dominican
cities of Santiago, La Vega, Salcedo and Mao.

<HEAD>City Wants Capitol Police to Confront Drug Dealers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal police who guard the U.S. Capitol and
the White House are needed in the most drug-plagued neighborhoods in
the nation's capital to help local officers fight the District of
Columbia's crime wave, city police officials said Thursday.
   District Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, departing from previous
statements by city officials that they want federal officers for
help only with administrative tasks, said they could be better used
on the streets.
   ``It was never my intention to have the Capitol police serve in
administrative functions ... to not use them in a front-line mode,''
Fulwood told the House Administration personnel and police
subcommittee. ``We're talking about areas where bad things are
happening _ I can't soften the blow.''
   Fulwood asked the panel for 500 federal officers from the U.S.
Capitol Police, U.S. Park Police and the uniformed division of the
Secret Service, which guards the White House. The Capitol force, the
largest of the three with 1,250 officers, would make the largest
contribution.
   The request comes during a drug-related crime surge that has
given Washington the highest murder rate in the nation. Through
Thursday, 202 persons had been killed here in 1989, compared with
133 at this time last year. There were a record 372 homicides in the
district in 1988.
   Mayor Marion Barry said earlier this month that if federal
officers were put on detail to the city police department, they
would likely handle desk duties while city officers bolster street
patrols.
   Several committee members were taken aback by the idea that
officers who now patrol Capitol Hill hallways filled with
congressional aides and tourists should be put into action against
gun-toting criminals.
   ``That sounds to me like it's damn serious and life-threatening,
said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. ``I'm not sure every Capitol police
officer is a warrior.''
   Fulwood said the officers would be used only until the city can
recruit and train additional officers.
   The House earlier this week passed a measure that would authorize
$127 million in federal spending over five years to help the city
hire 700 additional police officers. The city police force now
numbers slightly more than 3,900 officers.

   Lech Walesa and top Solidarity advisers
welcomed French President Francois Mitterrand on Thursday and
discussed the union's proposed international rescue package to lift
Poland out of economic crisis.
   ``We have a lot of problems and we count on France's help,''
Walesa told reporters as he arrived for a meeting and late luncheon
with Mitterrand at Helvelius Hotel near the famous Lenin Shipyard,
birthplace of Solidarity.
   ``Vive la France, vive la liberte!,'' residents shouted to
Mitterrand earlier as took a walking tour of Gdansk.
   Solidarity leader Walesa, accompanied by his chief economic
adviser Witold Trzeciakowski and about 20 regional Solidarity
chiefs, described over lunch the union's proposed aid project
seeking nearly $10 billion in credit from the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the ``Paris Club'' of Western creditor
nations and commercial banks.
   The project was formulated by Solidarity experts and would be
predicated on a program to fight Poland's near 100 percent inflation
and strengthen the zloty, the national currency.
   Mitterrand told Walesa of France's plans to reschedule part of
Poland's foreign debt, and a French offer of unrestricted loans to
Poland worth $20 million immediately and an additional $14 million
for specific projects later, according to French officials traveling
with Mitterrand.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy signed an agreement
permitting rescheduling of part of Poland's debt to France totaling
over $1 billion. Under the rescheduling, Poland does not have to
make any payments on that sum until 1993.
   Walesa and Mitterrand laid flowers at a monument to shipyard
workers slain during 1970 strikes over food price rises. About 1,500
spectators greeted them with cheers and sang the traditional ``Sto
Lat,'' (May He Live 100 Years) in Mitterrand's honor.
   The monument was erected in 1980, the year Solidarity first was
legalized. The union was banned in the 1981 martial-law crackdown
but was restored this year after round-table talks between the
Solidarity-led opposition and communist authorities.
   Earlier Thursday, Mitterrand, accompanied by Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, paid tribute at a memorial on the Westerplatte
peninsula, where World War II began with a German bombardment of a
Polish garrison on Sept. 1, 1939.
   Economic issues have dominated the Mitterrand visit that began
Wednesday. ``Poland's debt deserves special treatment,'' he said at
a Wednesday night banquet, referring to the $39 billion Poland owes
the West.

   A spunky 12-year-old boy may have been
the smallest reporter at a news conference with Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Thursday, but that didn't stop him from firing off a question and
asking for an autograph.
   Alexander Blume, a Hanover student who works for a West German
youth magazine, asked the Soviet president: ``What do you especially
want to say to the youth in Germany?''
   Gorbachev smiled at Alexander and replied he wanted to appeal to
youth to help ensure international trust in the future.
   Alexander duly recorded the answer on a handheld tape recorder.
   After the news conference Alexander maneuvered his way to where
Gorbachev was exiting the room and pushed out a copy of Gorbachev's
book on Soviet reforms, ``Perestroika,'' for an autograph. The
Soviet president consented.
   ``I'm the youngest political journalist in the Federal Republic
(West Germany),'' said the proud youngster as he disappeared among
his adult colleagues while making his way out of the room.

<HEAD>Researchers Find AIDS Indicators in Hemophiliacs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers studying hemophiliacs say they
have developed a method to predict more accurately whether a person
infected with the AIDS virus will develop the deadly disease within
two years.
   Scientists from Penn State University School of Medicine and the
National Cancer Institute report that hemophiliacs with particular
levels of two AIDS indicators are three times more likely than those
with only one to develop AIDS within two years, according to a
report in this week's issue of the Philadelphia-based Annals of
Internal Medicine.
   The results are similar to findings among gay men, said an AIDS
researcher. Currently, researchers believe that those infected with
the AIDS virus, or HIV, will go on to develop the disease, but some
people remain healthy for years.
   ``All the HIV antibody test tells us is who's infected,'' said
Dr. M. Elaine Eyster of Penn State. ``But it doesn't tell us who
will come down with AIDS.''
   Other AIDS researchers said the results were not unexpected, as
earlier studies showed that additional indicators in other
populations also increase the likelihood of developing AIDS.
   The two-year study examined blood samples from as long ago as
1979 taken from 87 hemophiliacs infected with HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus.
   The researchers compared how well they could predict whether a
patient would go on to develop AIDS based on blood levels of an HIV
protein, p24, and T4 helper cells, which help fight infection.
   According to Eyster, the p24 protein is present in about 50
percent of those with AIDS and about 25 percent of those infected
with the AIDS virus only.
   Of the eight hemophiliacs with low counts of T4 cells and levels
of p24, five developed AIDS within two years, according to Eyster.
Only eight of the 36 patients without p24 and a low T4 cell count
developed AIDS within the same time.
   Eyster said that although the numbers are small, the ratio
demonstrates the higher risk.
   Developing what Eyster called the ``hazard ratio'' will enable
phsyicians to identify individuals at higher risk for the rapid
progression of AIDS and provide counseling and treatment earlier in
the progression of the disease.
   Eyster said the results could be generalized to other populations
at risk for AIDS.
   A researcher at the University of California at San Francisco,
Dr. Andrew Moss, said San Francisco researchers have found similar
results in studies of gay men.
   Dr. Jeffrey Laurence of Cornell Medical School, said the results
added weight to similar studies but were ``totally expected.''
   He said, however, that knowledge gained through the studies will
aid researchers testing AIDS drugs in clinical trials as they select
patients who could best benefit from the treatments.
   Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner, an immunologist with New York University
Medical School whose lab discovered one of the AIDS indicators, said
p24 is limited as a predictor because it is present only in about
one-fourth of those infected with the AIDS virus.
   According to Dr. James Goedert of the National Cancer Institute,
one of the study's authors, the research differed from previous work
because it offered a qualitative risk.
   ``It's an important step,'' he said. ``Prior to this, it's not
been real clear what the expected rate of infection would be in that
population.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is transmitted
through tainted blood, sexual contact and dirty hypodermic needles.
The primary victims in the United States are hemophiliacs, drug
abusers and homosexuals.

<HEAD>Canada Banning Imports of African Ivory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canada will ban ivory imports from Africa to help
protect elephants which are being slaughtered for their tusks at a
rate of 70,000 a year, the federal government said Thursday.
   ``This action should serve to indicate Canada's desire to
discourage any further speculative slaughter of these magnificent
animals,'' External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said in a statement.
   He said Canada also is supporting efforts to ban commercial
trading in African elephant ivory under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.
   ``We are delighted that they have acted,'' said Ron Orenstein, a
spokesman for the African Elephant Emergency Network.
   The Canadian group, whose sponsors include the World Wildlife
Fund and Toronto Zoo, has been lobbying for bans to choke the ivory
market.
   Orenstein said poachers have killed more than 1.25 million
African elephants in the past decade, reducing the continent's
elephant population to 750,000.
   ``About 80 percent of the elephant ivory imported to the West
comes from poachers,'' he said. ``At this rate the elephants will be
extinct in 10 to 12 years.''
   Poaching has increased, he said, because prices for ivory have
gone up from $2.70 a pound in the 1960s to $136 a pound.
   He said the United States, France, West Germany, Britain and
other countries already have taken similar action.
   Officials could not immediately estimate the value of ivory sales
in Canada.

<HEAD>U.S. District Judge Bars Random Testing of U.S. Investigators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday prohibited
random drug testing of the U.S. government investigators who conduct
background checks and oversee drug testing of other federal
employees and job applicants.
   In a nationwide ruling, U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen also
barred mandatory post-accident drug testing of all 5,500 employees
of the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, but allowed testing
of individual employees based on a supervisor's ``reasonable
suspicion'' of illegal drug use.
   Jensen said U.S. Supreme Court rulings in March, allowing drug
testing of certain Customs Service employees and post-accident
testing of railroad workers, did not necessarily authorize testing
of government employees in less-sensitive or less-risky jobs.
   The decision ``takes some of the sting out of the prior
rulings,'' said Lawrence Pulgram, a lawyer for workers affected by
the tests. He called it ``a good first step toward limiting the
government's campaign to implement these drug testing programs
throughout the government.''
   The ruling was issued after government lawyers had left for the
day. It could be appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The OPM is the successor to the U.S. Civil Service Commission.
Besides supervising the federal civil service system, it directs
other federal agencies giving drug tests to workers under an
executive order by former President Ronald Reagan.
   Jensen's decision halts drug testing that began last September in
the OPM's Washington, D.C., office. Testing inother offices has been
suspended while the lawsuit is pending.
   The random drug testing order applied to about 650 investigators
who conduct background checks on applicants for sensitive civil
service jobs and for private jobs with military contractors.
   They were to be required to submit to urine testing at any time
with two hours' notice. The employees' lawsuit said testing without
grounds to suspect individual drug use violated the constitutional
ban on unreasonable searches.
   OPM investigators have less-sensitive jobs, which do not
ordinarily subject them to possible bribery or physical threats, and
can be subjected to an unlimited number of drug tests under the
random testing program, Jensen said.
   He also prohibited post-accident testing, which covered any of
OPM's 5,500 employees involved in an accident that caused injury
requiring hospitalization or more than $1,000 in property damage.
   Jensen said the Supreme Court ruling in the railroad case, which
allowed post-accident testing without individual suspicion of drug
use, was based on justifications that did not exist in the OPM case.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Pardon `Dirty War' Generals; Menem To Assume Power
July 8</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday
refused to pardon ex-President Leopoldo Galtieri and three other
generals charged with human rights abuses during Argentina's 1976-83
military dictatorship.
   The decision complicates an issue that sparked three rebellions
against President Raul Alfonsin and threatens to undermine the
government of President-elect Carlos Menem, who is to take office in
three weeks.
   Alfonsin will hand power to Menem on July 8, the two men
announced Thursday, making a decision reportedly delayed by the
problem posed by some 20 generals facing charges connected to the
military's ``dirty war'' against leftists.
   Also unresolved are the cases of several hundred officers and
soldiers who took part in April 1987 and January 1988 uprisings and
a December 1988 barracks revolt.
   Menem clearly wants Alfonsin to resolve the matter and take the
political heat a decision will generate.
   Alfonsin's term was to expire Dec. 10 but he said Monday he wants
to leave office early because his outgoing government cannot resolve
Argentina's economic crisis.
   Attorney General Andres D'Alessio had asked the Supreme Court to
determine whether the four generals could be sheltered from
prosecution by partial amnesty laws.
   Court spokesman Antonio Lopez de Tejada said the court ruled
Thursday that Galtieri and Gens. Santiago Riveros, Luciano Jauregui
and Ramon Bessone must stand trial.
   About 20 generals face charges of kidnapping, torture and murder
in some of the arrests and disappearances of nearly 9,000
Argentinians between the March 1976 military coup and Alfonsin's
election in October 1983.
   The high command wants the courts to stop the trials and free
officers convicted in December 1985.
   The issue is sensitive. Politicians and military officials talk
vaguely of ``national reconciliation,'' ``healing wounds'' and
``vindicating'' the army's role in what was a ``war.''
   Human rights groups charge the military committed genocide and
demand the generals be tried.
   Gen. Galtieri, who ruled from December 1981 to June 1982, is in
jail for mishandling the 1982 Falklands Island war against Britain.
He is accused of ordering the death of 13 opponents who defense
attorneys say were shot as they tried to escape.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.,
the only authorized channel for American contacts with the PLO, met
with the PLO envoy to Tunisia, Hakam Balawi, the official
Palestinian news agency said Thursday.
   It said the two discussed ``the latest developments in the
Palestinian cause and efforts to push ahead on the road to peace''
in the Middle East at a meeting Wednesday at the U.S. Embassy.
   The United States began a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization in December after the PLO took steps to recognize
Israel, renounce terrorism and opted for a two-state solution to the
conflict with the Israelis.
   Israel refuses to talk with the PLO, calling it a terrorist
organization.
   A U.S. delegation headed by Pelletreau has held three formal
meetings with a Palestinian delegation in the Tunisian capital, in
December, in March, and again June 8.
   Pelletreau and Balawi have met on other occasions, however.
   Western diplomats said meanwhile in Paris on Thursday that
UNESCO's Executive Board has decided to put off for the time being a
debate on whether to admit Palestine as a member.
   They said that under a compromise agreement reached after three
weeks of negotiations, the issue will go on the agenda of the
General Conference, UNESCO's highest decision-making body, which
meets this fall. But they added it may not come up for a vote.
   The diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   A two-thirds majority of the 158 member nations of the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization would be needed to
admit Palestine as a member.
   Another U.N. body, the World Health Organization, decided on May
12 to put off the issue until next year.
   The United States says if Palestine is admitted as a UNESCO
member, this would effectively finish any chance it might return to
the organization.
   The United States withdrew from UNESCO at the end of 1984,
holding it had become overly political and was mismanaged. Britain
followed suit a year later.

<HEAD>Edward James Olmos Given Hispanic Image Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Miami Vice'' star Edward James Olmos was
honored Thursday by the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences
for making an oustanding contribution to the positive image of
Hispanic people.
   ``I represent one race, the human race,'' Olmos, 42, said after
accepting the award from Mayor Tom Bradley at the City Hall rotunda.
``I'm stunned. You're always humbled by anything you do that gets
positive feedback.''
   The ``Imagen'' award, Spanish for image, was given to Olmos for
his role as math teacher Jaime Escalante in the movie ``Stand and
Deliver,'' in which he shapes a group of scholastic misfits into
star students.
   Olmos was nominated in 1988 for an Academy Award for the
Escalante role.
   The actor, who also won a Tony Award for his performance in
``Zoot Suit,'' said he wants to inspire Hispanic youths and destroy

<HEAD>Mexican Former Security Chief Pleads Innocent In Journalist's Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's former federal security chief pleaded
innocent Thursday to charges he ordered the murder of a prominent
journalist and denied links to a Mexican drug kingpin, blaming it
all on ``pure gossip.''
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, 47, was charged with first-degree
murder in the parking garage shooting of newspaper columnist Manuel
Buendia, who exposed drug trafficking, gunrunning and wrongdoing in
high places.
   Buendia, of the daily Excelsior, was killed in Mexico City on May
30, 1984.
   ``I am innocent of all these charges,'' Zorrilla, a former
director of the Mexican equivalent of the FBI said at his
arraignment in Criminal Court.
   ``There is no evidence for the (city) attorney general to send
this case to trial. Because of pure gossip and elaborate work, a
tale was created to have me declared responsible for these crimes.''
   Shortly after the hearing, prosecutors announced the filing of
additional charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of authority and
cover up in investigating the Buendia case.
   Zorrilla faces up to 40 years in prison on the murder charge and
22 additional years on the other charges.
   In testimony and depositions, witnesses and some associates swore
Zorrilla was linked to drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero and ordered
Buendia killed because he feared the columnist would expose him.
   Caro Quintero is awaiting trial in the 1985 torture-murder of a
U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.

   The federal government is spending more to control
AIDS than to conquer heart disease, which kills 20 times more
Americans, but some critics contend it is still not enough.
   A report today, described as the first to sum up the entire
federal AIDS effort, found the government this year is spending $2.2
billion on the epidemic, with more than half going to research and
prevention. The figure will grow to $4.3 billion in 1992.
   ``We were surprised to learn the extent to which so many
different individuals and agencies were involved in AIDS efforts,''
said Dr. William Winkenwerder, who directed the analysis. ``The
breadth of the effort of the federal government was greater than we
thought it might be.''
   In an editorial published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Dr. David E. Rogers of Cornell Medical College
in New York said he believes the nation is still spending ``vastly
too little'' on AIDS.

   Lisa Hart, a single parent getting by as a fast-food worker at an
Oklahoma City Hardee's, said she was looking forward to a good pay
raise until President Bush vetoed the minimum wage bill.
   Lee Soule, who owns a small restaurant in San Francisco, said he,
too, believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the
president vetoed the bill.
   Ms. Hart and Soule were among workers and managers queried by The
Associated Press on Wednesday following Bush's veto of a measure to
gradually raise the current $3.35 hourly minimum to $4.55. Democrats
in Congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to do so.
   Out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue
has the most impact, opinion was mixed, but most people on both the
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough.
   ``People have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live
on $3.35 an hour,'' said Soule, who pays waiters at his mid-scale
Pacific Cafe the California hourly minimum of $4.25.

   A wildcat coal miners' strike that has
spread across West Virginia and Virginia comes at a time of soaring
production, dwindling employment and concerns about President Bush's
clean air proposal.
   The walkout began Monday in support of 1,600 United Mine Workers
members on strike against The Pittston Coal Group. It has spread to
more than 10,000 workers and crippled production in parts of West
Virginia, the nation's third-largest producer, and Virginia, among
the top producing states in the East.
   The strike is taking place with industry and union officials
expressing concern about the potential impact of the president's
clean air package announced this week. It would require a 50 percent
cut in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants by 1990.
   The UMW says the plan could put 30,000 miners out of work.
Particularly hard-hit would be high-sulfur coal mines in Illinois,
Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

   Even Ronald Reagan's personal check for $120
couldn't persuade Sen. Howard Metzenbaum to help the Republican
Party rid the Senate of ``ultra-liberal Democrats.''
   Metzenbaum, the junior senator from Ohio, is one of those
Democrats who doesn't think liberal is a dirty word.
   So when he received a GOP fund-raising letter urging him to match
Reagan's donation, his reply to Sen. Don Nickles, chairman of the
Republican National Senatorial Committee, was brief.
   ``Though I cannot send you any money for your efforts, I can send
you my heartfelt wish that you achieve the same success in 1990 that
the GOP earned in the 1988 Senate race in Ohio,'' he wrote.

   The Capitol is a place of ``high
curiosity and low anxiety'' nearly a year after a group of Alabamans
who doled out $100,000 for legislative favors turned out to be FBI
agents hunting corruption.
   Since 30 federal agents raided the offices of four legislators
and their aides the night of Aug. 24, 1988, one lawmaker has been
indicted for bribery, extortion and money laundering and several
others are under investigation.
   ``We've lived with this for a year now, so that the initial shock
has worn off,'' said Bob Forsyth, a top Senate aide. ``The curiosity
now is about who's next and if they'll be somebody next. There must
be a few people here privately who are worried, but generally there
is high curiosity and low anxiety.''
   The raid revealed a complex 3{-year sting in which the FBI set up
phony companies to dispense cash for special-interest legislation.
Agents videotaped lawmakers taking cash, according to the lawyer for
a key FBI informant.
   The FBI descended on the Capitol after a legislative aide
reportedly refused to work as an informant and agents feared she
would tip other people. As the agents moved through the building,
several staffers reportedly shredded documents and erased sensitive
files from computers.
   Sen. Joseph Montoya, one of the four lawmakers whose offices were
searched, pleaded innocent June 12 to 10 counts of violating the
Hobbs Act, which is used in bribery cases involving public
officials, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act. The El Monte Democrat, who has served 17 years in the
Legislature, faces $2.5 million in fines and 200 years in prison if
convicted. An aide, Amiel Jaramillo, pleaded innocent to three
counts.
   The other three whose offices were searched, all members of the
Assembly, are Gwen Moore, D-Los Angeles, and Republicans Pat Nolan
of Glendale and Frank Hill of Whittier. Nolan served as Republican
leader of the Democrat-dominated Assembly until he stepped down,
partly because of the FBI investigation.
   The San Francisco Examiner reported Tuesday that IRS agents
assisting the FBI had subpoenaed the files on 16 bills carried by
Sen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee.
Robbins declined to comment.
   Except for Montoya, no lawmaker has been indicted or arrested.
All have denied any wrongdoing.
   The undercover agents gave more than $90,000 in campaign
contributions, honoraria and other payments to state and local
officials, aides, campaign consultants and others, according to
government and private financial records obtained by The Associated
Press. A federal source knowledgeable with the investigation said
``about $100,000, maybe a little more'' was budgeted.
   About a fifth of the money went to Paul Carpenter, a former state
senator and now a member of the powerful-but-obscure Board of
Equalization, which sets property tax assessments for utilities and
is California's tax appeals agency.
   Carpenter received three payments in 1986 totaling $20,000.
Carpenter said he was interviewed by the FBI, but has declined to
discuss the case further.
   Moore, Hill and Nolan got several thousand dollars each, and
other minor contributions were scattered throughout the Legislature.
   The sting has been dubbed ``Capscam'' or ``Shrimpscam'' by the
media, but its official FBI file name is ``Brispec,'' for ``Bribery
_ Special Interest.'' According to documents, sources and published
reports, here is how it worked:
   FBI agents posed as representatives of a Mobile, Ala.-based
company planning to launch a shrimp-processing plant in West
Sacramento. They went to lawmakers, seeking legislation that would
lure investment to the phony company as they spread donations around
the Capitol.
   Ultimately, two bills pushed by the undercover agents were
approved by the Legislature. Both _ written by Moore _ were vetoed
by Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off by the FBI.
   One agent, who identified himself as ``Jack Gordon of Alabama,''
was an engaging, country-bumpkin type who became a familiar figure
in the Capitol. He was often accompanied on his Capitol rounds by
John Shahabian, a Senate staffer who was serving the FBI as an
undercover informant.
   Shahabian's lawyer, Sacramento attorney Donald Heller, said his
client was involved in audio and video recordings of lawmakers
taking money.
   The FBI probe was secret until Aug. 24. As about 30 agents
gathered in the Hyatt Regency Hotel across the street from the
Capitol, others were inside the statehouse interviewing Karen
Watson, an aide to Nolan. During the interview, the agents
reportedly asked Watson to work as an informant. She refused.
   Within minutes, agents left the hotel and headed for the Capitol.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newton Van Drunen made millions of
dollars in just three years, but the government didn't like his
methods.
   When U.S. Secret Service agents and Mexican police raided his
suburban Juarez house in February, Van Drunen was running off $50
bills. The authorities seized $12.6 million in phony tens, twenties
and fifties.
   Van Drunen, 61, contends he was just eight months and $1 million
away from buying a paper-manufacturing plant and printing perfect
counterfeit U.S. currency. The Secret Service says he already was
pretty close.
   ``Printing American currency is a very difficult task,'' he said
in an interview at CeReSo prison. ``The Secret Service and Mexican
banking experts both tell me that other people have done better than
I have. I would like to meet those people. I would like to shake
their hand.''
   By the time of the raid, Van Drunen had circulated some $7
million in bogus bills, making him one of the most prolific
counterfeiters in history.
   The owlish, balding Van Drunen speaks slowly in a low, raspy
voice and stoops his 6-foot-5 frame to make himself heard over the
din in the prison's crowded, grimy visiting room. Though
considerably older, taller and grayer than most of the inmates, he
seems to mix well; he uses Mexican hand gestures and, like most
Mexicans, stands closer than most Americans are used to.
   The search for Van Drunen began about three years ago after
counterfeit money turned up in the Denver area. Bill Driscoll, the
Secret Service agent in charge in El Paso, Texas, wouldn't give
details _ relations between U.S. and Mexican police are touchy _ but
the bills were traced to Juarez and to Van Drunen's house. Police
waited to hear the press before bursting in.
   Van Drunen said he intended to use the counterfeit millions to
build a saltwater desalinization plant on the Gulf Coast in
Tamaulipas state. It would have let him make legal profits to help
his adopted homeland.
   Van Drunen was born in Ontario, Canada, to American parents and
grew up in Illinois. He worked in his teens and 20s with Mexican
farmworkers in Illinois and learned Spanish; he says he feels most
comfortable around Mexicans. His wife, Alicia Zamorra, is a native
of Mexico.
   In 1975, he was convicted of smuggling Mexicans into the United
States. He spent 18 months in federal prison in Sandstone, Minn.,
where ``they just needed people in the print shop and they shoved me
in there. Isn't that ironic?''
   Van Drunen used the knowledge he gained in prison when he got
out, fabricating ``green cards'' _ permanent U.S. residency cards
for aliens _ and Social Security cards. Most of his customers were
Mexicans.
   He was caught, convicted of counterfeiting government documents
and spent almost three years in federal prison in Springfield, Mo.
He was released on parole in 1984 and moved to Chicago.
   There, Van Drunen accumulated 10 tons of printing and embossing
equipment. He and Alicia bought a used school bus for $400,
decorated it with curtains and plastic flowers in the windows, and
loaded the equipment inside.
   ``On the 19th day of January, 1986, we invoked the Lord's
blessing on our enterprise and began our pilgrimage,'' said Van
Drunen, who tends to temper his formal, stilted language with a
droll tone of voice.
   A week later, they were house-hunting in Juarez. ``It was not a
spur-of-the-moment thing. I'm somewhat deliberate in everything I
do.''
   He chose to live in Mexico because officials would ask fewer
questions. He picked Juarez to be close to U.S. ink, paper and
equipment supplies and because there are so many U.S.-owned
factories ``that an American passes on the street and no one turns
his head.''
   They bought the house in Alicia's name and persuaded the city to
install heavy-duty power lines. As expected, no one asked questions.
   Van Drunen figured it would take five batches to perfect his
counterfeits. The first couple of lots were of low quality and he
sold them at five cents on the dollar. Most of it _ about $7 million
_ was circulated around Monterrey.
   ``I am afraid that some of it circulated in the United States,''
he said mournfully. ``There was an agreement that none of it would
be circulated in the United States, but I'm afraid they broke their
end of the agreement.
   ``There is not much honor among thieves, son.''
   Still, Van Drunen refuses to talk about the partners and
customers who indirectly contributed to the arrest that ended a
nearly idyllic lifestyle. The couple visited 24 of Mexico's 31
states in a 1974 Chevy pickup truck modified with a heavy-duty
radiator and a seat built to relieve his sciatica.
   ``We went to see things that the tourist never sees. We even
found a race of mule-footed hogs 7,000 feet up in the mountains of
Guerrero. We had a good time. Every time we'd find a flower we were
unfamiliar with, we'd bring it back and see what we could do with
it. I'm crazy about flowers.''
   During fall and winter, when humidity is low and printing
conditions best because paper doesn't swell with moisture, Van
Drunen would make money.
   The job entailed sending paper through a Heidelberg sheet feed
press 10 times, then through an embossing machine to give the paper
its texture. U.S. currency has tiny blue and red threads woven into
it that make it difficult to counterfeit. Van Drunen was printing
tiny lines on his currency to mimic the threads, but he had a
grander plan to buy a paper factory and make currency paper
indistinguishable from the real thing.
   He could have bought the plant with $1 million and could have had
the paper in October, he said. ``The next step was perfection.''
   But Van Drunen likely won't get to achieve perfection; he expects
to spend years in CeReSo. Meanwhile, he and some large-scale drug
dealers intend to bring some type of industry to the prison to give
inmates something to do.
   ``Who knows?'' he said, a devilish grin flitting across his face.
``Maybe we'll set up a print shop here.''

   It's been a bad day for Gordon. He's just learned
his mother is an ape, the local priest has informed him that he is
``an insult to God,'' and to top it all off, the woman he loves
turns out to be his sister.
   Who wouldn't run amok in the forest and run smack into a tree?
   Despite coming from the same team who produced the delightful
``Life and Loves of a She-Devil,'' the three-hour miniseries ``First
Born'' is a silly melodrama airing in three parts, an hour a week,
beginning Saturday on the Arts &amp; Entertainment Cable Network.
   ``First Born'' at least proves that the esteemed BBC is capable
of producing remarkably tedious drivel. Even the fine Charles Dance
is adrift in this self-important tale of a scientist who creates a
half-man, half-gorilla. The film was based on the Maureen Duffy
novel ``Gor Saga.''
   Dance plays Dr. Edward Forrester, a geneticist struggling to
create the new species, coveted by the military for its potential as
a fighting force.
   The film opens with the birth of his seventh attempt at creating
the hybrid _ through in vitro fertilization, thank goodness. No
attempt at major special effects here. The bouncing baby whatever is
a human infant with hair stuck all over him. The mother, a lowland
gorilla named Mary, rejects the baby, and he is raised by a human
foster mother.
   Forrester at first covers up the top-secret experiment by
explaining that he is seeking to cross a gorilla and an orangutan _
though no one at the laboratory seems at all fazed by the baby's
obviously human face.
   Forrester tells the military that the experiment has been
terminated, then concocts a story about the child's parents being
killed in a car wreck and sends ``Gor,'' short for Gordon, packing
off to military school.
   The grown Gor, played by the wide-eyed Jamie Foster, has turned
out to be quite a perfect gentleman. At military school, he proves
to be a fine athlete, but can't bring himself to harm another
creature. He decides to join the priesthood. This doesn't bother
Forrester _ but Gor's budding infatuation with Forrester's daughter
does.
   Everyone involved seems to take the production terribly
seriously, even dressing it up with a lot of religious overtones.
Mary, indeed. For fans of inadvertent comedy, however, the laughable
conclusion recalls the daffy kitsch of the ``Omen'' movie series and
might be worth the wait.

   Today is Saturday, June 24, the 175th day of 1989. There are 190
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 24, 1948, Communist forces cut off all land and water
routes between West Germany and West Berlin, prompting the United
States to organize a massive airlift of supplies into the city's
western sector to counter the blockade.
   On this date:
   In 1314, the forces of Scotland's King Robert I defeated the
English in the Battle of Bannockburn.
   In 1497, the first recorded discovery of North America took place
as explorer John Cabot, on a voyage for England, sighted land,
probably in present-day Canada.
   In 1509, Henry VIII was crowned king of England.
   In 1647, Margaret Brent, a niece of Lord Baltimore, was ejected
from the Maryland Assembly after demanding a place and vote in that
governing body.
   In 1793, the first republican constitution in France was adopted.
   In 1842, author-journalist Ambrose Bierce was born in Meigs
County, Ohio.
   In 1908, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, Grover
Cleveland, died in Princeton, N.J., at the age of 71.
   In 1940, France signed an armistice with Italy during World War
II.
   In 1947, Kenneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, reported seeing flying
saucers over Mount Rainier, Wash.
   In 1948, the Republican National Convention, meeting in
Philadelphia, nominated New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey for president.
   In 1968, ``Resurrection City,'' a shantytown constructed as part
of the Poor People's March on Washington D.C., was closed down by
authorities one day after the permit for the campsite expired.
   In 1975, 113 people were killed when an Eastern Airlines Boeing
727 crashed while attempting to land during a thunderstorm at New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   In 1982, proponents of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the
Constitution officially conceded defeat, but vowed to continue
efforts to fight for equal rights for women.
   In 1983, the space shuttle Challenger _ carrying America's first
woman in space, Sally K. Ride _ coasted to a safe landing at Edwards
Air Force Base in California.
   In 1987, comedian-actor Jackie Gleason, perhaps best known for
his TV series ``The Honeymooners,'' died at his home in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., at age 71.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter arrived in Tokyo to begin a
12-day Asian tour that included a two-day summit conference in Tokyo.
   Five years ago: Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan delivered a
speech in Chicago in which he seemed to refer to Judaism as a
``gutter religion,'' although he later insisted he'd said ``dirty
religion.''
   One year ago: Pope John Paul II, on a visit to Austria, condemned
Nazism during a stopover at the Mauthausen death camp where 110,000
World War II prisoners died.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Al Molinaro is 70. Comedian Jack Carter
is 66. Movie director Claude Chabrol is 59. Actress Michele Lee is
47. Actress Nancy Allen is 39.
   Thought for today: ``There is nothing more frightful than
ignorance in action.'' _ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, German poet,
dramatist and author (1749-1832).

<HEAD>Archaeologists Still Digging in Syrian Oasis After 50 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALMYRA, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have been excavating this
ancient oasis for more than 50 years, but it will take 30 more
before the full splendor of Palmyra's temples, tombs and colonnades
is restored.
   Lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green date-palms.
Hundreds more lie buried in the sand, along with piles of huge stone
blocks dating back 1,800 years to a time when Palmyra was the center
of a kingdom on desert caravan routes.
   ``If we brought in bulldozers, we could clear the site in six
months, but we'd also destroy much evidence needed to assess the
city's role in history,'' said archaeologist Khaled Assad, the site
director.
   ``Doing it slowly means another generation of work by Syrian and
foreign excavators. ... But we'll also be restoring as much of the
ancient city as possible.''
   Polish, French, West German, East German and Japanese
archaeologists are digging in different areas of Palmyra.
   Syria, where human habitation has been traced back 150,000 years,
is an archaeological treasure house of the remnants of countless
civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout its history.
   About half of ancient Palmyra, about 4{ square miles, has been
unearthed.
   It's Syria's top tourist attraction, drawing more than 70,000
visitors a year.
   Palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network of
caravan trails that carried silks and spices from eastern Asia
across the Roman province of Arabia to the Mediterranean.
   But its rebellious Queen Zenobia challenged Rome's authority. The
city was plundered in 272 A.D. after she was captured during a long
siege.
   ``Palmyra is a unique site. ... It's a great responsibility and
we have to look after it, restoring the architecture, bringing it
back to life,'' said Culture Minister Najar Attar.
   This year, conservators finished renovating a 3,000-seat
amphitheater overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays,
concerts and youth festivals will be staged.
   A tall arched portico forms the backdrop, flanked by deep-set
doorways and pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries.
   ``Palymra boasts very lively Roman architecture and its public
buildings are superbly planned,'' said Asif Bahnassi, a recently
retired director of antiquities who supervised the restoration.
   ``We've re-erected more than 150 columns as well as many masonry
blocks. ... You can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur.''
   When excavations started in the 1930s the villagers of Palmyra
lived in the ruins of the huge temple of Bel, the Babylonian
equivalent of Zeus, king of the Gods in Greek mythology.
   They were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30,000.
   The only modern building among the ruins is the 12-room Hotel
Zenobia dating from 1918, mentioned in many Middle East travelers'
memoirs.
   But it's unlikely to be torn down because ``it happens to stand
in the courtyard of a temple to the rain god Belshamin and doesn't
overlie anything important,'' Assad said.
   Last year, he said, Syrian archaeologists pulled 30 pieces ``of
really beautiful statuary'' from an underground tomb dated around 98
A.D.
   In that period, wealthy Palmyrenes buried their relatives in
family tombs decorated with portraits of the deceased in sculpture
and wall painting.
   The excavators are still looking for a likeness of Queen Zenobia.
   ``She doesn't appear in the archaeological record although we
have a good deal of information about her. ... Her career was
recorded in detail by Roman historians,'' Assad said.
   The site of her palace has been identified, but a later Roman
emperor, Diocletian, razed its remains and built a military camp
there some 30 years after the city was captured.
   In the 3rd century, Palmyra won tax breaks from the Romans that
helped boost its commercial importance.
   In addition to its markets for luxury goods, the city operated a
network of caravan hostelries at 15-mile intervals _ equivalent to a
day's journey. Palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in the
Persian Gulf.
   But Zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the city's
independence after her Arab husband, Odeinat, died.
   ``She was very ambitious for her son, Wahballat, but she was also
a strong personality in her own right,'' Assad said.
   Called ``the most beautiful woman in the Orient,'' she wore Roman
purple and addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor on
campaign. She followed political developments in Rome and hired a
Greek philosopher, Longinus, as an adviser.
   Zenobia was seized by the Romans near the Euphrates river, while
riding a camel to seek help against the Emperor Aurelian's siege of
Palmyra.
   According to some historians, she was taken to Rome where she
married a Roman senator and lived in a villa at Tivoli.

<TEXT>
   Built more than a quarter century ago, a
U.S.-style housing project in a Bogota's biggest suburb endures like
a living if somewhat seedy monument to a lost Pan-American dream.
   When built, the project called Superblock Seven was proclaimed by
politicians and planners from a host of countries as a bold first
step toward a grand goal _ the eradication of homelessness and
extreme poverty in the region.
   It grew out of President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress,
a program intended to counter the spread of Fidel Castro's
revolution throughout Latin America.
   Now the lives of its 8,000 middle-income and working-class
occupants reflect a more complex reality in which social chasms
persist. They grapple with graffiti and trash, drug use and crime.
And they sometimes wistfully recall the community's hopeful origins.
   ``This was an extraordinary thing _ nowadays you don't find such
ambitious projects,'' said Francisco Lozano, a civil servant in his
40s who has lived in Superblock Seven for 17 years. ``The state
doesn't get that involved anymore. Now it's all free enterprise, and
the private sector.''
   Superblock Seven was planned as a suburb of state-subsidized
housing south of Bogota for the masses of impoverished Colombians
crowding into the city.
   A pilot project for all of Latin America, the suburb was named
Kennedy City.
   When ground was broken for Superblock Seven in 1961, the area was
little more than open farmland. The project, with its 1,248
apartments in 42 buildings and 214 one-story rowhouses, was to be
the hub of Kennedy City and a magnet for more such construction.
   A magnet it was, but development exceeded planners' expectations
in both pace and scale.
   Shacks began to sprout as people, many of them peasants from the
countryside, streamed in faster than proper homes could be built. In
all about forty superblocks were built, some of them much bigger.
But they hold only a fraction of the suburb's population, estimated
to exceed 1 million and still growing.
   The poverty that planners dreamed of erasing came to occupy the
suburb's fringes just as it persisted in other marginal sections of
Bogota. As in other Colombian cities, violence and political
extremism grew rather than declined, fueled by a new activity _ drug
trafficking.
   As Kennedy City grew the Alliance for Progress lost momentum in
Latin America, and a world recession in the 1970s put the squeeze on
state support for ambitious public projects. Also, a new approach to
development began taking hold, with the state role shrinking and
more emphasis on private funding.
   The area around Superblock Seven became a commercial center,
transforming the project into a kind of strange island: designed by
U.S. architects, its sturdy brick buildings, broad grassy
quadrangles, basketball courts and asphalt parking lots seem more
appropriate to an aging New Jersey suburb. Latin America housing
tends to be more tightly packed.
   ``We knew we were a kind of guinea pig,'' said Carlos Paz Elias,
the 65-year-old president of the project's association of
homeowners. He is one of the original residents, who call themselves
founders.
   ``Kennedy City was supposed to spread out from here,'' he said.
``We were supposed to be at the center of a star, reaching out along
eight avenues. We were suppose to reach out, not be enclosed like a
prison.
   ``But that's what we are like now _ a prison, trying to keep the
the city out.''
   Three city blocks wide by five blocks long, the Superblock has
been gradually closing off its entrances with chain-link fences and
padlocks. Too many people are coming in to dump trash, use drugs,
mug and rob.
   ``The problem is mostly at night,'' said Horacio Valencia Marin,
50, a telephone company workers who has lived 22 years in the
superblock. ``If you come home late, they're sure to mug you.''
   Lozano's teen-age son, Francisco Jr., said, ``At night here, you
see lots of drug addiction. Twenty or 25 boys get together and smoke
marijuana. You can't walk around alone; they'll rob you.''
   The father blamed a general apathy among Colombians and said they
needed to become more socially aware and active. But he also
criticized what he saw as a more confrontational U.S. attitude
toward Latin America.
   ``They used to give us aid, and now look at this problem of the
foreign debt. ... They are squeezing us,'' he said.
   ``Now they sell us weapons. President Kennedy was special. It was
so much better to talk of the Alliance for Progress, than this talk
of an alliance for war.''

   ``Batman'' flies into 2,100 U.S. and Canadian
theaters June 23 amid a cloud of super-hype and mini-controversy,
and a storm of merchandise ranging from earrings to underwear.
   The Warner Bros. version of the 50-year-old comic book has proved
the most talked-about movie of the summer season, though not all of
the talk has been good. The studio hopes that its publicity blast
and the film itself will steamroller the negative stuff.
   Controversy began with the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce
Wayne, a.k.a. Batman. Longtime Batfans were expecting more of a hunk
to play their hero, not a slim comedy actor.
   ``I had heard something (about the protests) while I was making
the picture in England, but it didn't seem like any big deal to
me,'' says Keaton. ``I am shocked-slash-fascinated. I'm telling you,
man, these people must have the same lobbyists as the NRA (National
Rifle Association). These guys have some clout; I can't believe it.
I mean, how many are there?
   ``It's just funny to me. I never had time to get angry about it
because we were working in England, and I missed a lot of it until I
came back.''
   Director Tim Burton adds: ``Comic book people are very specific;
they have a very strong image in their minds. But it's a real source
of argument because every comic book fan has a different opinion.
When we went into (`Batman') we decided to try to be true to it, but
to do our own thing also.''
   Though Keaton achieved stardom in such comedies as ``Mr. Mom''
and ``Beetlejuice,'' he displays little of his antic humor as Bruce
Wayne, and none as Batman.
   ``I always try to do what the role requires, and I try to do a
different role every time,'' he said. ``I discussed the role with
Tim as well as Jack (Nicholson). The character was clearly more
powerful if he was more internal. As Jack said to me in makeup one
day, `Just let the wardrobe act, kid.' There was great wisdom in
that statement. The real power came from within.
   ``My natural tendency is to do more because you sometimes fear
you're not doing enough. The longer I'm an actor, the more I
discover that less is more.''
   Early reviews of ``Batman'' have not been the raves that Warner
Bros. would dearly love. The Associated Press said it was
``ultimately unsatisfying. ... The makers of the 1989 `Batman' can't
seem to make up their minds. Tim Burton ... seems overburdened with
the logistics of an immensely costly production.''
   Rolling Stone called it a classic, but Time magazine found the
style ``daunting and lurching'' and observed that the film ``prowls
_ slowly, so slowly _ in search of grandeur, but it often finds
murk.''
   Daily Variety termed ``Batman'' uneven and commented that ``Jack
Nicholson's incandescent Joker overwhelms Michael Keaton's subdued
title character.''
   Films such as ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' and ``Coming to
America'' overcame poor reviews to amass $100 million-plus grosses.
If reviewers thumb down ``Batman,'' can it prove equally
critic-proof?
   ``I hope so,'' says director Burton. ``You hope people will judge
the movie and not the merchandising.''
   ``I don't care what anybody says, the movie's good,'' declares
Keaton. ``It's an awful lot of fun. How's that _ strong enough?''
   ``Batman'' has been a 10-year crusade for producers Jon Peters
and Peter Guber. Why so long?
   ``Because we were making 30 other pictures, everything from `The
Color Purple' to `Flashdance' to `Caddyshack' to `The Witches of
Eastwick,''' Peters said. ``We paid Tom Mankiewicz $750,000 and went
through five or six drafts and still came up with something that was
too derivative, too much like `Superman.'''
   ``Batman'' began to take shape with the addition of writer Sam
Hamm and Tim Burton, a graduate of Disney animation who had directed
only two films, ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and ``Beetlejuice.''
   Peters recalled suggesting the role of the Joker to Nicholson
while filming ``The Witches of Eastwick'' on location in New England.
   ``We were talking at 3 a.m. on the night before Jack had to do
the church sequence in which he denounced women and threw up over
everybody. I said he should play the Joker, and he said, `Are you
crazy? Here I am playing the devil and making every woman mad at me.
You want to throw my career down the toilet?'''
   After weeks of persuasion, Nicholson began to see possibilities
in the role. Peters' first choice for Batman was Bill Murray. ``I
wanted an action picture that was funny.'' But after seeing
``Beetlejuice,'' the producers chose Keaton. Sean Young (``No Way
Out'') was cast as the press photographer Vicki Vale, but she was
injured as filming began in England. Kim Basinger came to the rescue.
   ``I got a call on Friday night in California that they wanted me
Monday morning and I said, `You're out of your mind,''' Basinger
recalled. ``To fly to London and be there Sunday? I said, `You've
lost it.' Ten minutes later I was on a plane in my mind. I knew I
would wind up doing it.
   ``I got off the plane and started gathering wardrobe and doing
the hundreds of things you need to do for a role. I started making
(the character) up as I went along. ...
   ``I don't have an `approach' to anything. I just dealt with this
film as if I was making a dramatic piece. Vicki Vale is the light of
the movie; it's like `Phantom of the Opera' in the '80s. Tim Burton,
the director, said that. It's very much a light and dark film. These
two dark images, and I am the light. Vicki Vale brings the heart,
the reality to the film. She asks Batman, `Do you love me?' That's
all she cares about: love.
   ``She brings the normality, the human aspect. She grounds the
boys when they get too feisty.''
   In this era of mega-budgets, the cost of ``Batman'' has been
reported from $35 million to $50 million. The final word from
producer Peters: ``Not counting prints and advertising, the actual
cost was between $33 million and $35 million.''

   Father's Day card browsers faced a seemingly
endless choice of saccharin-sweet love messages and bad-taste
zingers this year, tailored to senders ranging from first-born
children to adoptees.
   The card glut reflects an effort by makers to capitalize on the
time-strapped consumer's quest for convenience. They're turning out
more types of cards and cramming them into store space approaching
saturation.
   If you looked past the Father's Day racks, the categories go far
beyond run-of-the-mill anniversaries, birthdays, baptisms and bar
mitvahs.
   The holiday lineup has lengthened into a string spanning more
days of the calendar. Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day,
Easter, Father's Day, Halloween and Thanksgiving are the leaders.
But Sweetest Day, Mothers-in-law Day and Boss's Day are getting
space too.
   No occasion is too obscure or private. Safe-sex friendship cards
warn about the dangers of AIDS. Conventional get-well messages now
include versions for the terminally ill.
   One company recently unveiled a faxable greeting card, betting
that use of facsimile machines will get trendier than it already is.
   In their zeal to satisfy every taste and circumstance, card
companies seem determined to make sure no one ever fumbles for words.
   Card sending may be a widely held habit partly because many
people simply don't know how to express their thoughts in writing,
officials of the $3 billion-a-year card industry say.
   Nonetheless, they're not taking any chances on missing a market
of literate card senders. Many supply artwork-adorned versions with
empty space for customers who have the time and inclination to write
their own.
   Most buyers probably jot down a thought or two anyway,
supplementing the generic sentiments, but even so some may feel
guilty as they span the racks for something to send.
   Commentator Andy Rooney has put his feelings about greeting cards
this way: ``Why are we buying someone else's words to convey
supposedly intimate sentiments? Doesn't anyone just sit down with a
blank piece of paper anymore and write a simple note to someone on a
special occasion?''
   More often than not, the answer is no.
   Industry analyst E. Gray Glass III of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. says consumers seem to be clamoring for alternative cards that
are becoming more plentiful.
   These non-occasion cards, appropriate any day, are part of the
industry push to develop new card-sending opportunities.
   ``That's going to have the effect of expanding the per capita
sending of cards,'' says Glass. ``Cards are also impulse purchases
so the idea is that you should have as many types of cards available
on the market as possible.''
   Marianne McDermott, executive vice president of the Greeting Card
Association, says consumers have become more demanding in choosing
cards and makers have reacted nimbly to social change, creating a
card-choice explosion.
   ``People aren't happy to pick up just any card, it has to say
just the right thing,'' McDermott says.
   The challenge is that cards are proliferating but the growth in
retail distributors has slowed to a crawl.
   Space-wise, one of the few remaining card-selling opportunities
is in mass merchandizing outlets and supermarkets.
   ``Food stores are the last to fill up,'' says McDermott.
``There's still some room for expansion there.''
   American Greetings Corp., the Cleveland, Ohio-based company that
ranks second to industry leader Hallmark Cards Inc., always has
maintained a strong mass market presence. Its cards are carried in
giant retailers such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., K mart Corp., big
discounters and drug chains.
   Spokesman John Hernandis says American Greetings is trying to
enhance its good position within the mass volume retailing business.
Responding to retailer needs, it's making shelf space more
productive.
   Redesigned cabinets increase density, accommodating more cards.
High-visibility locator signs make it easier for shoppers to find
what they want.
   Helping shoppers locate desired cards has grown in importance
partly because women, who buy about 90 percent of the 7 billion
greetings cards sold annually in the United States, have less time
to look. Many work full-time.
   American Greetings also is emphasizing a concept called seasonal
program marketing. They did it first this past Easter by grouping
all Easter merchandise _ cards, party items, giftwrapping and plush
toys _ around a central theme. Bloomer Bunny was the pitch rabbit
for the stuff.
   Hernandis says the company intends to use this approach every
holiday. Placing related merchandise readily at hand makes people
more apt to buy.
   ``You end up spending more, buying more than you would
normally,'' says Hernandis. ``You may have your paper cups and paper
plates, but you may not be even thinking about streamers.''
   Gibson Greetings Inc., based in Cincinnati, Ohio, has found ways
to increase card and related merchandise sales in supermarkets,
which now account for about 15 percent of annual sales industrywide
vs. about 7 percent in the early 1980s.
   Greg Ionna, vice president of marketing, says Gibson has
identified several natural tie-ins between foods and cards.
Valentine's Day cards have been placed in candy aisles, puppy and
kitten calendars have crept into pet food shelves and cards are
appearing alongside flowers in grocery-store floral departments.
   ``There's lots of opportunities, we believe, to cross merchandise
with other products,'' Ionna says.
   Hallmark, of Kansas City, Mo., dominates what it calls the social
expression business, with an estimated 42 percent of the market,
followed by American Greetings with about 32 percent and
third-ranked Gibson with about 10 percent. Possibly as many as 1,000
other companies share the rest.
   The rankings are only analysts' best guesses because Hallmark is
a private company and doesn't disclose many financial details.

   The economic story of the coming decade will be
written in three words: brains over brawn.
   In the 1990s and beyond, know-how and inventiveness will emerge
as the keys to success in every field, from selling hamburgers to
fighting wars to forging steel.
   The emergence of a knowledge-based world economy will create new
winners. But it also will create new losers: people, companies and
countries that can't find a place in a world moving beneath their
feet.
   Associated Press writers from around the country found that the
dawning knowledge economy is remaking societies and shifting the
balance of global power. Those who exploit the trend are riding it
to success. Those who do not are getting run over.
   ``What we've had is a change in rewards for different kinds of
skills. You could think of it as brain power vs. muscle power, or
paper-and-pencil skills vs. other skills,'' says Harvard economist
Richard B. Freeman.
   Knowledge is not only power, it is money, and the erosion of
American living standards directly reflects how the United States
may be losing its postwar domination in the global knowledge game.
   American earnings have stagnated and even fallen. If you're a
30-year-old with a college degree, you're making no more than your
counterpart a decade ago after discounting for inflation. If you
don't have a college education, you're making thousands of dollars a
year less, says economist Frank Levy of the University of Maryland.
   Perhaps more importantly, the knowledge-money connection is
widening the gap between rich and poor, aggravating class tensions
and leading indirectly to rising crime and drug abuse.
   Harvard MBA grads can still walk into a $75,000-a-year junior
investment banker's life on Wall Street. But burgeoning illiteracy
rates are leaving many youngsters with the feeling they have only
two choices: take a $3.35-an-hour dishwasher's job or peddle drugs
and risk jail.
   The demand for knowledge permeates every aspect of life.
   When Michael Jackson brings in laser technicians for his
concerts, he is plugging into the knowledge economy.
   So is Jesus Frias, who consults computer-generated personal
profiles when he counsels crack addicts in Brooklyn.
   So are the Iowans who make Gummi Bear candies for a West German
company that set up shop in Creston, Iowa, to take advantage of an
innovative job training program.
   The potency of knowledge helps explain a lot of today's
headlines, from the crackdown on China's student-led democracy
movement, to the surge in lawsuits over copyrights, to congressional
opposition to the FSX fighter deal with Japan.
   All around the world, the struggle for power is becoming a battle
of wits. In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail Gorbachev is
pressing for glasnost and perestroika out of an awareness that his
economic push will fail unless he can unlock the imaginations of the
Russian people.
   In Armonk, N.Y., International Business Machines Corp. is
spending $900 million a year _ slightly more than the annual budget
of Harvard University _ to educate and train employees in everything
from robotics to public speaking.
   In Miami's troubled Liberty City, Frederick Morley is trying to
prepare the predominantly black, poor students of Drew Elementary
School for a high-tech world that threatens to trap them in poverty.
   ``The way out is education, literacy and skills. I think they're
listening,'' the principal says.
   The quintessential product of the new era, software, is nothing
but a language of encoded knowledge, traveling freely between
computers. Economic visionaries say the people who can parlay their
thoughts into this language hold the key to the creativity that will
shape our future.
   ``The major `capital' of the next century is going to be minds
that produce ideas,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said in a recent speech to American and Japanese executives.
   The brains-over-brawn trend is hardly new, of course: Francis
Bacon observed in 1597 that knowledge is power. What's new is that
technology has made knowledge more mobile and infinitely more potent.
   In the past year, fiber-optic cables that carry information at
the speed of light have been laid across the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans for the first time. It's now possible for Soviet scientists
to plug directly into U.S. scientific data networks by computer.
   Literacy rates have leaped in many developing countries, allowing
them to absorb technology quickly from the big industrial economies.
   Knowledge has become the great equalizer, making it possible for
anyone, anywhere, to compete and succeed. Unlike oil, timber or
nuclear bombs, knowledge can be created and spread on a blackboard
with a stub of chalk, in Bangkok, Thailand, as easily as in Omaha,
Neb.
   In 1866, international communication was only for the elite. It
cost $100 to send a 20-word cable from New York to London on the
first undersea cable. Today it costs $1 to send about 4,000 words
over the same route using an ordinary personal computer and modem.
   Japan's rise to power from a string of rocky islands is the best
evidence that a nation does not need amber waves of grain to make it
in the age of the knowledge economy.
   Conversely, Alaskans have discovered since the Exxon Valdez spill
the frailty of an economy built on natural resources, largely oil,
fish and wilderness beauty.
   The knowledge economy poses challenges at all levels of society _
for governments, businesses and individuals. For the U.S.
government, it is a question of focusing on the big picture,
long-range strategists say.
   To some people, that means industrial planning and initiatives
such as Sematech, the government-industry program in Austin, Texas,
to restore competitiveness in computer chip manufacturing.
   People like Kathryn Harrigan, a professor at Columbia University,
say preserving American expertise should be a central objective of
U.S. trade policy.
   Let foreigners buy as many high-tech U.S. companies as they want,
so long as Americans are guaranteed the intellectually demanding
jobs, she says. In a war, she says, the U.S. government always could
nationalize the companies.

   For state and local governments, education and aid to worker
training are probably the biggest contributions they can make to
their citizens' ability to cope.
   West Germany's Mederer Corp., for example, makes Trolli Gummi
candies in Iowa under a state program that reimburses a company up
to 50 percent of a new worker's salary and benefits for on-the-job
training.
   ``It was a major factor in locating the plant,'' manager Gary
Buck says.
   In the private sector, meanwhile, a new kind of democracy is
emerging: a belief in lifelong self-improvement and a commitment to
the principle that anyone can have a good idea.
   A potentially harmful counter-trend also is bubbling up, however.
In the name of efficiency and uniformity, some companies are
``de-skilling'' the jobs of fast-food laborers, reservation clerks
and even bankers and social workers, removing their flexibility with
rules concocted by centralized experts.
   Yankee ingenuity is still admired around the globe. But the
de-skilling movement is expanding too, fed by the management search
to exert control and avoid the vulnerability of relying on
ill-educated workers.
   ``Extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate the
need for human ingenuity,'' author Barbara Garson writes in a 1988
book, ``The Electronic Sweatshop.''
   ``We call it cloning your best man,'' says George Keller,
executive vice president of AFSM International, an association of
high-tech field service workers.
   Keller says he likes the new systems, which allow generalists to
do specialized repairs by following rules stored in a laptop
computer. But he also worries people could become overly dependent
on them.
   ``People like to use crutches sometimes,'' he said.
   There is no reason the knowledge economy must lead to drudgery.
In fact, the assembly-line mentality catching on in some offices is
disappearing in the factories, where it began.
   Respect for people's ideas at L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. in
Cleveland, for example, has led to a dramatic surge in pride among
the company's workers, who make sheet steel for auto bodies.
   Wes Humphrey, vice president of United Steelworkers Local 9126 at
the plant, says the esprit de corps there is so strong that ``now we
wrap coils like it's Christmastime.''
   Many managers recognize this lesson. ``If we don't work with our
employees to make them happier and get more work out of them, we're
all doomed,'' says David Hoag, president of LTV Steel Co., one of
L-S's corporate parents, which got religion during its Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   For companies that reject the de-skilling approach to survival,
the alternative is shouldering more of the burden of education. That
will pinch smaller businesses that can't spare 18,000 people at a
time, the number of IBMers who receive education or training on a
typical day.
   By the year 2000, 65 percent of all jobs will require some
training or education beyond high school, compared with 54 percent
now, according to a study by the American Society for Training and
Development.
   Many companies complain that their training will go to waste
because newly trained workers will jump to jobs elsewhere. That is
indeed a problem, since good training is so spotty. Still, training
pays.
   In a study for the National Academy of Engineering, Charles W.
Hoover of New York's Polytechnic University concluded that education
outlays for engineers are among the best investments, even in the
short term.
   For workers, or those hoping to find jobs, the keys are lifelong
education and flexibility.
   ``Increasingly, we're in a more complex economy and that is
making for more complex and more demanding jobs,'' says Samuel
Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Unfortunately for those who want to adapt, it's getting tougher.
American society is splintering into a small segment of overworked
technology wizards, a great mass of people who know just enough to
get by, and another small but growing segment mired in permanent
poverty: the underclass.
   Fourteen percent of American adults cannot locate the United
States on a map. About one in five believes the sun revolves around
the Earth. Most young adults cannot decipher a bus schedule, a
Department of Education survey found.
   While American educators struggle to cultivate the seeds of
modern knowledge in this country, foreign literacy is flourishing.
   Japanese automakers that opened U.S. plants found they had to
hire college graduates to fill assembly jobs that would have been
filled by high school graduates in Japan.
   Americans still win a disproportionate share of Nobel Prizes in
science, but by most other measures the top of the knowledge pyramid
is eroding as badly as the base.
   Last year, eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents were
foreign companies. Half the assistant professors of engineering at
U.S. graduate schools are foreign.
   As the U.S. economy becomes more closely tied to the global one,
the winners will be those people whose services, for whatever
reason, are in world demand. That includes movie stars, athletes,
lawyers, and specialists like Michael Milken, the junk bond king.
   Losers are those whose jobs can be done abroad. Data-entry jobs
are moving to far-flung locales from Northern Ireland to China. Some
credit card and insurance companies have their billing statements
done in the Caribbean. Boeing Co. has had programming done in the
Philippines.
   Norman Bodek, executive director of the Data Entry Management
Association of Stamford, Conn., was prophetic when he proclaimed
three years ago that eventually, ``An office in India will be no
different than next door.''
   Perhaps the biggest direct threat to ordinary Americans is that
the knowledge economy could permanently split the population and
undermine any reason for the winners to help the losers. The
alienation and political consequences of that gulf are profound.
   ``As our economic fates diverge,'' Harvard professor Robert Reich
wrote recently, ``the top fifth may be losing the sense of
connectedness with the bottom fifth, or even the bottom half, that
would elicit such generosity.''

   Crack addicts who used to spill their life
stories to Jesus Frias in a basement office of a Brooklyn hospital
are now telling them to a computer instead.
   The traditional intake interview, through which the drug
counselor gained insight into a new patient, has been replaced by a
multiple-choice questionnaire that the patient fills out alone.
   A computer program converts the patient's answers to the 132
questions into a ``narrative,'' a formulaic two-page biography.
   Frias, 34, said he understands why computers have taken over the
initial interviews _ for one thing, they give counselors more time
for other meetings with patients _ but he said something is lost
without that first face-to-face contact.
   ``When you ask the question, is your father or mother alive, and
they say yes, even that yes tells you a lot. You can say, `You don't
sound too happy your father's alive.'''
   The automation of some phases of addiction counseling is part of
a streamlining and simplification of jobs everywhere, made possible
by technology and sophisticated management techniques. Critics call
it ``dumbing down.''
   Wisecracking short-order cooks are disappearing from the American
scene, replaced by drones who answer to french fry computers.
Electronic monitoring is squeezing out the folksy airline
reservation clerks who tell callers that Vancouver is nice this time
of year.
   Even stockbrokers, those cowboys of finance, are getting lassoed.
Some big firms now decide centrally how and where clients should
invest their money, reducing brokers to happy-talking functionaries.
   Office automation is ``rising almost floor by floor to engulf
higher and higher strata of white-collar workers,'' Barbara Garson
wrote in a 1988 book, ``The Electronic Sweatshop.''
   Turning human work over to computers is not an inescapable part
of the emerging knowledge economy. Many companies are moving in the
other direction, trying to gain a competitive edge by encouraging
employees to think independently.
   But there are powerful social forces behind human automation,
including a shortage of skilled workers and management's innate
desire for greater control.
   Counselors and administrators at the Poly Drug Clinic of Kings
County Addictive Hospital say the computerization of intake
interviews has brought greater efficiency and uniformity.
   The questionnaire developed by Auto Assess Inc. asks, for
example, how much patients spend daily for drugs and what they do in
their spare time.
   Another company's Psychological Screening Inventory requires
patients to answer true or false to statements such as ``I enjoy
classical music,'' ``Strange voices have spoken to me,'' and
``Shooting is a good sport.''
   Computers translate the answers into neat statements containing
sentences such as, ``Client feels she is a normal drinker.''
Counselors are supposed to plug holes with a personal interview.
   When interviews were done in person, the writeups tended to be
messy and incomplete, especially when done by the less-educated
counselors hired at a time when it was in vogue to use former
addicts in rehabilitation. They also took two hours or more to do
right.
   ``It's a finite instrument like all, but the purpose is to save
us time for the counselor,'' said the clinic director, Jerry
Halloran.
   ``The downside of it would be a counselor getting this back and
filing it away and never looking at it,'' he said.
   Crack, the highly addictive, smokable form of cocaine, is
ravaging poor neighborhoods of Brooklyn. The success rate for
treatment is low, especially in an outpatient clinic like the Poly
Drug Clinic. Knowing a patient well can help a counselor head off
predictable trouble, Frias said.
   The computerized reports are sometimes adequate, sometimes not,
Frias said. He fears they could be a temptation to laziness. And by
saving counselors' time, they give budgeters a rationale for not
adding more counselors to cope with an increased load of crack
addicts.
   ``You're removing the need for skilled people. Now you just need
people to file,'' Frias said.
   Overall, Frias concludes the computerization is probably good. In
any case, he said, ``Once it's introduced, and people notice it's
convenient, nobody wants to do more work. You're not going to go
back to the old way.''

   If there's one thing American automakers
should be able to do better than Japanese rivals, it's knowing the
styles American drivers like.
   But Japan's automakers set out to eliminate that advantage by
establishing design shops in that car-crazed corner of America,
Southern California. They've turned out the snazzy prototypes for
bestsellers like Mazda's MX-5 Miata, Nissan's Pathfinder 4x4,
Honda's CRX and Toyota's Celica.
   The American-designed Japanese cars were so successful that
Detroit was forced to follow suit with its own California design
studios.
   As is increasingly the case in the knowledge economy, the Big
Three U.S. carmakers found that to stay in the race _ even in their
own backyard _ they have to get smarter about giving consumers what
they want.
   ``They were too insulated from the popular culture; they were
still living mentally and psychologically in the Bloomfield Hills
Country Club,'' said Tony Assenza, senior editor of Car and Driver
magazine, speaking of a wealthy Detroit suburb.
   ``In the United States, everybody looks here for trends,'' said
Hiroshi Moriyoshi, who heads Mazda's Southern California design and
research outpost. ``The whole environment is conducive to
creativity.''
   Cars are so similar in price and technology that style has become
more important than ever. Hence the 14 auto design studios within
120 freeway miles of Los Angeles.
   Detroit for years kept an eye on how Californians customize cars
and hired California-trained designers, part of a watch on trends
nationwide.
   But the Japanese were the first to actually set up shop here,
beginning with Toyota Motor Corp.'s Calty Design Research Inc. in
Newport Beach in 1973. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. followed in 1974 with a
shop in Torrance, Mazda Motor Corp. in 1976 in Irvine and Nissan
Motor Co. Ltd. in 1979 in La Jolla.
   The studios were small, low-profile, seemingly unthreatening.
   Then the 1978 Celica hit the car-show circuit, catching the eye
of auto enthusiasts who tended to look at most Japanese products as
dull compacts meant for the budget-minded.
   The Japanese companies managed to make compacts stylish, turning
out sporty, young-looking cars that young people could afford.
Detroit was left wallowing behind.
   ``It was a mind-set predicated on the fact that the main car of
interest to anybody they talked to was a six-passenger, four-door
luxury automobile roughly in the shape of a brick,'' Assenza said.
   Detroit established satellite design studios, or beefed up
informal sampling of the tastes out West.
   Chrysler Corp.'s Pacific Advanced Product Design Center in
Carlsbad and General Motors Corp.'s Advanced Concepts Center in
Newbury Park sprang up in 1983, followed a year later by Ford
Concept Center California in Valencia.
   Other Japanese makers, plus Volvo and three independents, bring
the number of design studios in the area to 14. Most employ fewer
than 50.
   The Japanese had intensely practical reasons for setting up
design shops in Southern California: The West Coast was already
their business beachhead in America, and the weather was far more
agreeable than Detroit's.
   But it turns out they landed in the most wide-open auto market in
the world, where designers can sample trends just driving to work.
   ``It's the best automotive design melting pot that I can think
of,'' said Fritz Mayhew, chief design executive at Ford Motor Co. in
Detroit, who oversees the contributions of the company's California
designers.
   Then there's California's role as a crucible of popular culture.
   ``Fads, trends, do start here,'' said Ron Hill, head of the
industrial design program at the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena, where many car designers get their start. ``People are
less inhibited to look at the new, to express themselves in ways
they're not so capable of doing in other parts of the country or the
world.''
   Among the auto trends traced to California: Hot rods, pickup
trucks as basic commuter transportation, convertible pickups, trim
and grillwork that's painted not chromed, the new emphasis on
comfortable interiors.
   Nissan's Pulsar NX, a compact with interchangeable tops that
makes it a convertible, a pickup or a station wagon, emerged in
production almost unchanged from the design, said Gerald Hirshberg,
a former GM designer who heads the company's studio in La Jolla.
   The same was true for the company's brawny, American-looking
Pathfinder 4x4 and ``hardbody'' pickups.
   Mazda's studio employs designers from Japan, the United States
and Taiwan. Several have worked in Europe.
   Nissan's Hirshberg has found the Japanese admire their American
co-workers' willingness to take risks in design, while the Americans
are taken aback by the Japanese ability to translate a design into a
practical car.
   ``There's a kind of subtle collaboration that can only happen
when parts of both cultures are put in the frying pan,'' Hirshberg
said. ``You get a tremendous energy burst when you tap into what
each culture does better.''

   By midmorning it was business as usual in Miami's
Liberty City district.
   A kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housing
project where the bullet-riddled body of a 34-year-old mother was
discovered before dawn. A squad car screamed by, blue lights
pulsing. The owner of a furniture store that had been looted in last
January's riots waited at the door for customers. He was armed.
   Inside a small concrete-block building set apart from the Drew
Elementary School, students in blue and white uniforms were told
their future is not necessarily foreshadowed by eve
side of the chain-link fence.
   ``We let them know there are alternatives to drugs, to poverty,
to crime,'nts on the other' said Drew Principal Frederick Morley. ``The
way out is
education, literacy and skills. I think they're listening.''
   The success of educators like Morley is vital not only to the
people of Liberty City but to the nation as a whole.
   As labor shortages arise, companies are hiring people from
disadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity, not philanthropy. At the
same time, the knowledge-based economy demands more sophisticated
skills than ever.
   Morley and otherose round, white face
and shaggy mustache seems more suited to an Irish pub than a ghetto
streetcorner.
   ``I'm just trying to provide the tools _ the education _ to move
in the right direction,'' said Mann, a University of Miami professor
who founded the Entrepreneurial Institute in response to Liberty
City riots in 1982.
   The $15, five-week courses include accounting, international
business and business computer software. About two-thirds of the
2,500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black.
   ``There's an amazing resilience in the human species. The body
and mind only lets you go so far into destitution, then the sense of
survival takes over,'' Mann said. ``That's what we're hoping to tap
into _ that sense that the black community will claw back against
the odds.''
   Education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstream
in Miami. Among other things, they face discrimination from white
and Hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric in
black communities.
   ``Listen, I'll hire anyone, but it seems the ones who can _ and
want to _ work are the Haitians and the Latins,'' said Charles
Genthner, president of Fire Hose Corp., which makes fire hoses in a
1-year-old Liberty City plant.
   ``There has to be the idea that getting into the work force is
the best option,'' said John Cordrey, an economist at the Beacon
Council, a tax-supported Miami area business group.
   ``In my opinion, the blacks have made the Hispanics a scapegoat.
They see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs,''
said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami professor studying local
immigration. ``What is really plaguing the black community here is a
breakdown in the family.''
   ``Identifying the problem is easy. Turning it around is
difficult.''

<HEAD>It's Serve-and-Volley on the Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's bounce-back veto of the
minimum wage bill sets the issue and draws the line for a series of
volleys between the White House and the new Democratic team in
Congress.
   The dispute will be around for a while, although it isn't likely
to intrude on the broader bipartisanship both sides have pledged. On
the minimum wage, each side is determined to prove cooperation
doesn't mean it can be pushed around.
   It is an issue on which traditional Democratic and Republican
philosophies clash and have for 50 years. That is not going to
change, whatever the outcome of the current round.
   ``This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' Bush
said in his first veto message, one he'd waited weeks to deliver.
``It would accelerate inflation.''
   He said that, instead of helping the lowest paid workers, it
would cost jobs _ about 400,000 by White House estimate.
   Democrats dispute each point, insisting the minimum be raised to
provide the working poor anything close to a living wage. Their
debaters denounced Bush as a skinflint bent on denying the poor a
measly three dimes an hour.
   The vetoed bill would have raised the minimum to $4.55 an hour
over the next 2 1@2 years; Bush said he wouldn't go beyond $4.25.
The current rate is $3.35, unchanged since 1981.
   Bush said the difference wasn't ``just 30 cents an hour,'' that
the argument is about the best way to preserve jobs.
   Each side accused the other of political posturing before the
House sustained the veto on Wednesday. The vote was 247 to 178,
short by 34 of the two-thirds needed to override Bush.
   Nobody was surprised. Nobody will be.
   ``It is the most clearly identifiable issue on which a majority
of the two parties have disagreed over and over again over the
years,'' said Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich. ``It doesn't matter who
the president is.''
   President Reagan wouldn't agree to any increase, so it was on
hold throughout his administration.
   During the 1988 campaign, Bush supported an increase, coupled
with a training wage, although he didn't say how much. When he did
say, the veto line was set.
   Then the political maneuvering began.
   The Senate passed the final version of the bill on May 17, making
it ready for the White House, where Bush was promising a veto faster
than the eye can see.
   For nearly a month, nothing happened, as the Democrats held the
bill waiting for an opportune moment.
   Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said it was being held
hostage by Democrats ``so that they can travel around the country
and bash the president.''
   The veto message was written and ready. All it needed was a date
and a presidential signature. The traveling White House took the
message along on the president's week-long European trip.
   But, as Dole complained, the Democrats wouldn't send Bush
``something to veto.''
   They finally did on Tuesday, while Bush was out of town. Bush
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said when the bill got to the White
House, it would ``hit the wall and bounce back like a rubber ball.''
   It did, within 20 minutes, faster than the Democratic leadership
could foresee.
   At the time, the president was aboard Air Force One, between
Jackson, Wyo., and Lincoln, Neb. He signed one copy of the veto
message while the bill was returned to the House with another copy
bearing his facsimile signature.
   ``He said it was excessive,'' complained Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont. ``He said that while he was flying at 30,000 feet in Air
Force One, above America's low-income workers.''
   While White House aide David Kalbaugh was delivering the veto
message to Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders assembled for a final
appeal to Bush not to reject the bill. Before they could start, he
had. So they rewrote their scripts to denounce the veto.
   Now they've got to figure out what to do about it.
   ``The president should know that this issue will not go away,''
said Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy reintroduced the vetoed bill, but said he was willing to
compromise.
   House Republicans proposed a combination minimum wage-tax credit
plan for low income families.
   Democrats said they had only begun to fight.
   All of that raises the prospect of more talk and more stalemate.
The Democrats don't have enough votes to override a veto, and Bush
doesn't have the votes to get his own version through Congress.
   So the speechmaking will go on, despite the apt, capsule
appraisal Rep. Harris W. Fawell, R-Ill., provided during the House
debate. ``I'm not sure that many of us are listening at all,'' he
said.

   If you're breathing somebody else's cigarette
smoke at home or work you risk far more than watery eyes or a runny
nose. A controversial new study suggests passive smoking may be one
of the leading preventable causes of death. The study should
escalate the battle over indoor smoking restrictions.

   Alice Trillin was 38 years old and in excellent
health, she thought. Then ``this completely crazy thing'' happened.
   ``I coughed and a tiny, tiny blood clot took me to get a chest
X-ray. Ten days later I had my lung removed.''
   Trillin had lung cancer, the kind smokers get.
   But she had never smoked a cigarette.
   The cause of her cancer remained a mystery until a doctor friend
asked if her parents had smoked. Yes, Trillin told him, they smoked
heavily.
   ``Nobody had ever said anything about passive smoking. I hadn't
worried about the question much,'' she says.
   Most scientists hadn't worried about the question much either,
until studies in recent years showed that passive smoking was
causing 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths a year in non-smokers. Now
a study estimates that the toll from passive smoking, including
deaths from heart disease and other cancers, may be 10 times that.
   Tobacco smoke in the home and workplace could be killing 46,000
non-smokers each year in the United States, the study concludes.
That's 3,000 lung cancer deaths, 11,000 from other cancers and
32,000 heart disease deaths.
   That would make passive smoking the leading preventable cause of
death after alcohol and smoking itself, said Dr. Ronald M. Davis,
director of the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health. Smoking kills
390,000; alcohol, 120,000.
   ``No longer are we talking about runny nose or watery eyes or
headache or nausea, but a fatal disease,'' said Davis. ``Which ups
the ante, so to speak, for passive smoking.''
   Passive smoking has become the principal battleground for the
tobacco industry and its opponents in the 1980s. It is no longer
merely a health issue, but political and environmental. Cigarette
pollution is fouling the air.
   ``We know that the indoor environment is far more polluted than
the outdoor environment,'' said James Repace of the Environmental
Protection Agency indoor air program. ``We've seen that again and
again wherever we've looked all over the United States.''
   Many people believe smokers have the right to smoke. But they
also believe that others shouldn't have to pay a price.
   ``When you talk about an involuntary risk, the society becomes
much more cautious,'' said University of California-San Francisco
biomedical engineer Stanton Glantz, an environmentalist and
anti-smoking activist.
   The new estimate is controversial. Researchers agree it is
preliminary and needs to be confirmed.
   A tobacco industry consultant said the emphasis on passive
smoking was misplaced. ``Environmental tobacco smoke is a
smokescreen that is keeping us from looking at the total problem,
which is the quality of indoor air,'' said Dr. David Weeks,
president of Per-Med Corp., a health consulting firm in Boise,
Idaho. ``You take the tobacco smoke out of the air and you've still
got the problem.''
   Many public health officials disagree.
   The risk of tobacco smoke ``is greater than the risk of radon gas
is to non-smokers,'' said Repace. ``We're talking maybe 40 percent
greater. And if you're talking about all the carcinogenic air
pollutants that EPA regulates, it's 100 times greater.''
   EPA researchers in North Carolina say in a new internal report
that environmental tobacco smoke ``is a major source of indoor air
pollution and is also the major combustion source contributing to
total human exposure to mutagens and carcinogens.''
   The passive smoking issue poses a serious threat to the tobacco
industry. A confidential opinion poll done for the industry in 1978,
and leaked to anti-smoking activists, showed passive smoking was
``the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco
industry that has yet occurred.''
   ``What the smoker does to himself may be his business, but what
the smoker does to the non-smoker is quite a different matter,'' the
pollsters concluded.
   Concern about passive smoking escalated in 1986 with two reports:
The U.S. Surgeon General concluded that passive smoking doesn't
merely raise the risk of lung cancer _ it causes it. And the
National Academy of Sciences said exposure to tobacco smoke may
raise the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers 34 percent.
   Alice Trillin was lucky; she was cured. But lung cancer remains
one of the most difficult cancers to treat. Few others will have her
luck.
   The link between passive smoking and lung cancer is based on four
lines of evidence, said Davis, whose Office on Smoking and Health
prepares the Surgeon General's reports on smoking.
   First, tobacco smoke contains known cancer-causing agents.
Second, non-smokers absorb smoke from the air; by-products can be
measured in their blood. Third, there's no safe level of exposure to
smoke. Fourth, many studies show that non-smokers whose spouses
smoke have a higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers whose
spouses don't.
   At the end of 1987, 42 states had imposed some restrictions on
smoking in public, more than double the number in the early 1970s,
said Davis. Thirty-two states restrict smoking in the workplace.
   The nation's two largest air-quality agencies, the EPA and the
California Air Resources Board, are preparing assessments of the
danger of passive smoking. Both have included the new estimate in
their calculations.
   The estimate comes from a study published in the December issue
of Environment International by A. Judson Wells, a researcher in
Wilmington, Del., and a volunteer with the American Lung Association.
   ``In general, we don't think Dr. Wells is going to be off base at
all,'' said Margaret Jenkins, coordinator of the indoor air quality
program for the California Air Resources Board.
   The paper's findings on lung cancer agree with other studies; its
findings on heart disease and other cancers are more speculative,
but plausible, Repace said. ``The largest source of death from
active smoking is, of course, heart disease. We know the arteries of
smokers get plugged up very rapidly, and it is very possible that
these same effects could occur in passive smokers.''
   Wells said he himself was surprised by his estimate. ``When I
first calculated these numbers, they scared the hell out of me. I'd
be the first to admit they're wrong, if we can find out why they're
wrong.''
   So far, no one has, although not everyone accepts Wells' estimate.
   Weeks, the industry consultant, dismissed Wells' study, as he
does concern about passive smoking altogether. He believes passive
smoking causes no risk, but he doesn't think any of the data on the
subject are very good.
   Many researchers would agree that current estimates are imprecise.
   But Repace answers Weeks this way: ``Environmental tobacco smoke
is tobacco smoke. And tobacco smoke is known to cause 400,000 deaths
a year. Here is a known carcinogen to human beings. Are we to assume
that low levels are innocuous? The question is, what standard of
proof you require before you take public action?''
   The risk to a non-smoker in a typical office is about the same as
the risk for a non-smoker whose spouse smokes, he said. ``In a
typical office with good ventilation, you're running about 250 times
the maximum acceptable cancer risk for environmental carcinogens in
air or water or food.''
   That is, among 100,000 workers, you'd expect 250 of them to die
from lung cancer caused by passive smoking. ``And in the poorly
ventilated office, it would be four times as high,'' Repace said.
   Occasional exposure in a bar, restaurant or car probably is not
nearly as great a risk as exposure in the home or the office, he
said.
   Most of the regulatory emphasis now is on curbing smoke in the
workplace. ``It's one of the two most important places of exposure
to tobacco smoke, the other being the home,'' Davis said. ``For
somebody who doesn't have any smokers in the home, the worksite
would be the most important place.''
   Even many smokers favor policies that curb the passive smoking
risk.
   According to the 1989 Surgeon General's report on smoking, 64
percent of smokers believe their habit is hazardous to non-smokers'
health. Thirty-four percent of smokers were bothered by other
people's smoking.
   The question for non-smokers is how aggressively to avoid tobacco
smoke.
   ``I'm sure one day's exposure isn't going to do you any harm,''
said Wells. ``But every little bit adds to what you've accumulated
heretofore.
   ``Only the most sensitive individuals are going to die of passive
smoking. The problem is we don't know who they are. It could be you.
It could be me.''

<HEAD>Tomatoes Seek Revenge _ but Fail _ When Insects Eat Them</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   DAVIS, Calif. AP) _ When a bug starts to eat a tomato, it seems
the fruit tries to counterattack by releasing chemicals to stunt the
insect's growth.
   The mechanism fails because the chemicals counteract each other,
but the discovery holds promise for biological alternatives to
insecticides, said Sean S. Duffey, a University of California,
Davis, entomologist. Plants might be genetically engineered to give
them defenses against bugs, he said.
   Duffey and his colleagues studied larvae of the tomato fruitworm
and beet armyworm. Some of the worms were raised on artificial
diets, while others were raised on tomato plants. Duffey measured
the growth of the worms and monitored the chemical properties of the
worms and the tomato plants.
   When tomato cells were damaged by an insect, they released
chemicals called proteinase inhibitors, which interfered with the
insects' digestion of protein. The damage also allowed chemicals
called phenolics to react with others known as polyphenol oxidase
enzymes. That let the phenolics ``bind up'' protein in the tomato so
it was less available for the insect to digest.
   ``Laboratory tests indicated that these reactions, individually,
are potent defenses, dramatically decreasing the growth rate of the
worms,'' a university news release said. ``However, Duffey's work
shows that these two methods of defense work at cross purposes,'' so
the insects can eat with impunity.

   Bacteria could offer an inexpensive
method of cleaning up explosives storage sites, say researchers who
already have found a naturally occurring organism that can break
down nitroglycerin.
   ``For every dollar spent on this method, it will take between $10
and $100 with so-called dump truck technology _ hauling off the
explosives and burning or burying them,'' said Pat Unkefer of Los
Alamos National Laboratory.
   Unkefer and her husband, Cliff, both biochemists, found a
bacteria that breaks down nitroglycerin into water and carbon
dioxide. The Unkefers and technologist John Hanners say it will be
more complicated to find microbes capable of degrading TNT and other
explosives that are more complex than nitroglycerine.
   They say bacteria applied to explosives-tainted soil could
degrade the toxic substances into harmless residue in as little as
six months.
   The researchers collect bacteria samples near munitions plants
and explosives staging sites, return them to the laboratory and grow
them in a culture with nitroglycerin to isolate those with an
ability to live off the normally toxic explosive.

<HEAD>New Mexico Petroglyph Bolsters Argument Indians Saw Supernova</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rock painting discovered in New Mexico
last year provides more support for researchers who believe American
Indians witnessed the extremely bright explosion of a star 935 years
ago.
   Many anthropologists are skeptical that 11th-century Indians
would have recorded the supernova, even though it appeared twice as
bright as the planet Venus. But the rock painting, or petroglyph, is
at least the 22nd example found in the West since the 1950s of
American Indian art depicting a bright object near a crescent moon,
said University of Colorado astronomer Jack Brandt.
   The latest was found by amateur astronomers from Illinois in New
Mexico's Chaco Canyon, which may have been a Pueblo sun-watching
site, Brandt said.
   Only two of the 22 rock paintings or carvings have been ruled out
as records of the gargantuan blast in the year A.D. 1054, he said.
   Ancient Chinese and Japanese historical records reported the
exploding star that formed the Crab Nebula was visible for 653
nights and in daylight for 23 consecutive days.
   Astronomical calculations show that a crescent moon next to the
supernova would have been visible only from what is now the western
United States, he said. No planets or other bright objects would
have been near a crescent moon during the 11th century in western
North America.
   Crescent moons are rare in Indian rock art, supporting the
argument that the Indians saw and made artistic records of the
supernova. ``Almost every time crescent moon rock art is found,
there is a bright object depicted near it,'' Brandt said.
   Such depictions have been found in Arizona, California, New
Mexico, Texas, Utah and Baja California, Mexico.

<HEAD>New Deep-Sea Drill More Versatile, Easier To Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oceanographers hope to learn more about the
structure of the Earth with the help of a new portable drill to bore
holes in the ocean floor.
   ``It's a tool that we've needed badly,'' said Don Pryor, part of
a federal team exploring the economic potential of the ocean floor.
``This new drill will give us the opportunity to get cores from the
deep sea, which we simply have had no means of getting before.''
   The new drill, to be built in August, takes advantage of
state-of-the art mining technology and laboratory drilling
techniques. It can operate as deep as 18,000 feet and was designed
to be handled with a 0.68-inch cable, standard on research ships,
that is strong enough to lift the one-ton rig. Placement will be
controlled by a sonic-navigation network and a remote TV camera.
   The drill was developed by Mike Williamson, a marine consultant,
who got a small National Science Foundation grant in 1982 for
preliminary designs. Five subsequent attempts to finance a prototype
failed but a sixth, with University of Washington oceanographer Paul
Johnson, won a $400,000 grant from the NSF and another $100,000 from
the Office of Naval Research.
   The prototype will drill a precisely oriented, 1{-inch hole 10
feet into seabed rock; the next stage would be a drill that could
secure a 160-foot core.
   Scientists are also looking at uses for the holes the drill will
leave behind. For example, seismologists may place instruments,
firmly attached to the hole's rock sides, to detect ocean-bottom
earthquakes.
   The current conventional deep-sea research drilling effort,
managed by Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling,
lowers drilling pipe from a well in the bottom of a specialized
vessel.
   The new drill, which can be lowered from any ship, will be
``smarter'' than current drills which cannot be adjusted from the
surface once they are running. Pryor, part of a U.S. Geological
Survey-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration project to
map the United States' economic zone extending 200 miles offshore,
said ``portability is the real merit of this new drill, and the fact
that it will be relatively inexpensive compared to bringing in the
drilling ship, probably less than one-tenth the cost.''

   It's possible to get an Ivy League education without Ivy League
costs.
   Good public colleges with private school ambience and advantages
can be found, according to education experts.
   ``There are a number of small public institutions that are
rapidly reaching the standards of the `little' private Ivys,'' says
Richard Moll, who has served in admissions administration at Harvard
and Yale Universities and has written a book, ``The Public Ivys.''
   These small public colleges usually have high quality students
and faculty, small classes, rigorous curriculum, an intellectual
atmosphere and personal attention to students. Campus population
averages about 3,000, which works out to about 22 students in each
class.
   Moll says tuition costs at these colleges range between $850 and
$1,500 per year for in-state students, $2,500 to $4,000 for
out-of-staters. Room and board typically come to about $3,000. This
contrasts with private school tuition and fees which averaged
$12,526 in l988-89.
   Nearly two thirds of public college students receive financial
aid, averaging $2,800 a year, while the same proportion at private
schools receives an average of $6,000.
   Some of the schools mentioned by Moll and another author, Martin
Nemko, include Evergreen State College at Olympia, Wash.; St. Mary's
College of St. Mary's City, Md.; the University of North Carolina at
Asheville; Northeast Missouri State University at Kirksville; Ramapo
College in Ramapo, N.J.; Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg,
Va.; the New College of the University of South Florida at Sarasota;

Minnesota at Morris.
   Nemko, a former New York City teacher who is now an education
consultant and author of ``How to Get an Ivy League Education at a
State University'' cites St. Mary's College in Maryland as a

that will cost you $50,000 less than the original.''
   The University of North Carolina-Asheville was rated in a recent
survey by the Association of American Colleges as having one of the
strongest humanities core curriculums in the country.
   The National Governors Association has called Ramapo College a
good example of a school with a good international focus, with
cooperative education and internship programs with international
corporations in the United States and overseas.
   According to Joseph Olander, president of Evergreen State
College, institutions like his stress critical thinking,
communication and computation skills _ ``the three Cs of education
for the 21st century.''

   The Democratic-controlled House failed to
override President Bush's veto of legislation to raise the minimum
wage, giving the White House a win in its first legislative clash
with Congress.
   House members voted 247-178 to override on Wednesday, but that
was 34 votes shy of the two-thirds needed. Thus, Bush's veto stands
of a bill that would have increased the hourly minimum wage from
$3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991.

   Early-June sales of domestically made cars and
light trucks crept up 1.1 percent compared with last year after
automakers extended incentives to entice late-spring buyers.
   The eight major automakers said Wednesday they sold vehicles at
an average daily rate of 34,994 during the June 1-10 period this
year compared with 34,621 during the same time last year. Car sales
were up 1.3 percent and truck sales rose 0.7 percent.

government's ability to handle the problem and protect their

   The survey, sponsored by the banking consulting firm Alex

that the nation's thrift crisis will lead to a increase in personal

forecasts said.
   Robert Coen, director of forecasting for the ad agency

6.1 percent rise he projected last December because national
advertiser spending has exceeded his expectations and the economic

   U.S. banks must be allowed into the securities
business if the United States is to compete successfully against
Europe and Japan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told
a congressional panel.
   Greenspan, testifying Wednesday before the Senate Banking
subcommittee on securities, said the 55-year-old Glass-Steagall law,
which separated commercial banking from the securities industry, is
hampering U.S. institutions from competing in what is becoming an
increasingly global financial system.
   ``There is no question we are being significantly suppressed by
the Glass-Steagall restrictions,'' Greenspan said.
   ``My concern is that as we continue to internationalize ... that
we are in effect inhibiting our institutions from fully
participating in that,'' he said.
   Last year, the Senate, with Federal Reserve support,
overwhelmingly passed legislation granting banks broad new
securities powers, but the bill died in the House.
   ``Had we had congressional passage of the bill that passed the
Senate last year, I would argue our competitive capabilities in the
world market would be significantly enhanced,'' Greenspan said.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber said in a speech last
month that the administration intends to revive its push to revamp
Glass-Steagall later this year.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the subcommittee,
said his panel will turn its attention to the issue once Congress
passes President Bush's savings and loan bailout.
   ``It's unacceptable to most Americans that we should end up
playing second fiddle in financial services,'' Dodd said. He said
only one U.S. banking company, Citicorp, is among the world's 10
largest and only one securities firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
is among the five biggest.
   Banks in Great Britain and West Germany already have securities
powers. But Sen. James R. Sasser, D-Tenn., noted that Japanese banks
have managed to retain their world standing even though they operate
under restrictions similar to the Glass-Steagall law.
   Greenspan replied that Japanese banks lag in profitability, but
not size, and he noted that Japan is moving to reform its banking
laws.
   ``I should trust we wouldn't be the laggard in that area,'' the
central bank chairman said.

   Strong spending by national advertisers and an
improving economic climate were cited as a prominent forecaster
raised his estimate of U.S. ad spending growth this year to 6.9
percent.
   That still would leave growth in domestic ad spending below the
rises of 7.4 percent to 7.9 percent posted in each of the past four
years and well below the double-digit increases earlier in the
decade.
   But Robert Coen, director of forecasting for the ad agency
McCann-Erickson, said Wednesday that domestic ad spending growth for
this year should exceed the 6.1 percent rise he projected last
December.
   ``National marketers' ad budgets are now keeping pace with
economic growth and, although local retail activity is still
depressed, signs of gradual improvement are becoming evident,'' he
said.
   He said magazines, radio, cable TV and syndicated programing were
seeing bigger-than-expected ad growth, but that expected growth for
newspapers was dismal and network television ad revenues would
barely exceed last year's results.
   He said total U.S. ad spending should reach $126.2 billion this
year, up from $118.1 billion in 1988.
   Spending by national advertisers was expected to rise 7.6 percent
to $70.6 billion, while local ad spending was expected to grow 6
percent to $55.6 billion. Six months ago, Coen forecast a 6.5
percent rise in national ad spending and a 5.6 percent increase in
local ad spending.
   None of the percentage increases is adjusted for inflation. Coen
expects the economy to grow at a 7.5 percent clip this year,
including inflation.
   At a news conference, Coen said the falloff that traditionally
follows an election and Olympic Games year may not be as sharp as he
had expected. Domestic ad spending rose 7.7 percent in 1988.
   Some marketers beef up their ad spending in connection with the
Olympics; election years mean regular advertisers must compete with
political candidates for commercial time and space.
   In 1985, for example, domestic ad spending growth tumbled to 7.9
percent from 15.1 percent in the election and Olympic year of 1984.
   Network television ad revenues were off 4 percent in the first
four months of this year compared with the same period in 1988, but
Coen expects a 1 percent rise for the full year.
   He said ABC's revenues were off 23 percent, compared with last
year when it broadcast the Winter Olympics. But ad revenue was up 5
percent at CBS and 10 percent at NBC in the first four months of
1989.
   ``As the year unfolds, the comparisons will improve until the
months corresponding to last year's Summer Olympics telecast,'' he
said.
   Among the big network advertisers, Coen said fast-food marketers
boosted spending by 29 percent in the first quarter after an 18
percent rise last year. Advertising spending on cable TV, syndicated
programming, magazines and radio all were stronger than expected, he
said. Direct mail and Yellow Pages advertising are expected to grow
10 percent each.
   But Coen said the growth prospects for newspapers were ``quite
dismal,'' projecting a 5 percent rise in local ad spending and a 3
percent increase in national ad spending. Local retail lineage was
down in the first quarter and local classified lineage ``looks
terrible in comparison with last year's highs,'' he said.
   Local ad spending growth also remains sluggish, he said.
   Coen said ad spending overseas was expected to grow faster than
domestic ad spending for the fifth consecutive year, but he scaled
back his December estimate to 10 percent from 12 percent. Foreign ad
spending is expected to reach $133.5 billion in 1989.
   In first estimate of growth for 1990, Coen said he expects U.S.
ad spending to grow 7 percent to $136 billion next year, while
foreign ad spending rises 9 percent to $146 billion.

   Incentive packages generated only modest buyer
interest in early June, as automakers reported a lackluster 1.1
percent rise in car and light truck sales from year-earlier levels.
   ``You used to get a spike when these things (incentives) came
out, and now it's a yawn,'' analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. of New York said Wednesday.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. production reported that
they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,994 during
the June 1-10 period this year, up slightly from the
34,621-vehicle-a-day average during the same time last year.
   Early June car sales rose 1.3 percent. Truck sales increased 0.7
percent.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. began new
incentive programs in early June to replace those in effect since
late March and early April. The new programs generally increased the
number of cars and trucks offering rebates or low-interest financing.
   But, Healy said, ``Their effect is weakening.''
   Incentives are offered in part to shrink inventories. According
to this week's edition of Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry
journal, the eight domestic automakers had a 67-day supply of new
cars on hand on May 31. That compares with a 56-day supply on the
same date last year.
   ``Inventories, although not a disaster, are kind of high now,''
Healy said. The early-spring incentives had been offered after the
sales year began with a sluggish start.
   Through June 10 this year, the domestic automakers said they were
selling cars and trucks at a rate of 37,935 a day, down 3.3 percent
from last year's daily rate of 39,235. Car sales were down 4.6
percent and truck sales were off 0.9 percent.
   During the first 10-day period of June, Ford's car sales were up
5.2 percent, GM's declined 0.7 percent and Chrysler's were down 6.7
percent. On the truck side, GM's sales rose 3.8 percent, Chrysler's
went up 4.6 percent and Ford's fell 3.9 percent.

   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days
last year, and 136 selling days so far this year, compared with 137
selling days in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in

   Lisa Hart, a single parent getting by as a fast-food worker at an
Oklahoma City Hardee's, said she was looking forward to a good pay
raise until President Bush vetoed the minimum wage bill.
   Lee Soule, who owns a small restaurant in San Francisco, said he,
too, believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the
president vetoed the bill.
   Ms. Hart and Soule were among workers and managers queried by The
Associated Press on Wednesday following Bush's veto of a measure to
gradually raise the current $3.35 hourly minimum to $4.55. Democrats
in Congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to do so.
   Out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue
has the most impact, opinion was mixed, but most people on both the
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough.
   ``People have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live
on $3.35 an hour,'' said Soule, who pays waiters at his mid-scale
Pacific Cafe the California hourly minimum of $4.25.
   Ms. Hart, who makes more than the current minimum but less than
$4.55, was asked if $3.35 is a livable wage.
   ``No way,'' she said. `The most you could do is pay your
utilities or your mortgage.''
   Her manager, Anita Feeley, said starting workers at the
restaurant now get $3.65 an hour. She said she didn't think
employers would lay off workers if the wage were raised to $4.55,
but they might become warier about whom they hired.
   In Seattle, Shari Hudson said the tips she receives at Benjamin's
restaurant, bring in about three times as much as her wage of $3.85
an hour, the minimum in Washington state. The proposed raise, she
said, ``might pay the tax on our tips.''
   Interviews at restaurants in Seattle, Yakima and Spokane, Wash.,
plus a dry cleaning shop, a pub and a beauty supply store in the
state turned up no businesses that said they were paying the minimum
wage.
   In Maine, the story was much the same. The state minimum is $3.75
an hour, but in many areas the starting scale is well above that.
   ``There's just too much competition around here,'' said Pamela
Potter, staffing coordinator for four McDonald's restaurants.
   In Boston also, it was hard to find minimum wage workers.
Fast-food restaurants are advertising for employees at $6 or $7 an
hour and dishwashers in Chinatown start at $5, according to a
restaurant owner.
   ``I can see minimum wage for kids in high school. But if you're
living alone, there's no way, no way, you can do it on $3.35 an
hour,'' said Christopher Long, a 23-year-old Bostonian. Leaning
against the bumper of his black 1989 Jeep with a broad smile and
Ray-Ban sunglasses on his face, Long said he would not consider a
job at less than $6.
   In Ocean City, N.J., Roy Gillian, owner of Wonderland Pier, said,
``In the Northeast, it has no effect, because we couldn't get
anybody for $3.35.''
   Vera Kelly, 49, of Queens, who works behind the lunch counter at
Lamston's, a five and dime store in Manhattan, said even $4.55
``still wouldn't support a family. It should be even more than
that.''
   Few workers believed employers would be forced to lay off people
if the minimum were raised.
   ``You've got to have help,'' said Mrs. Kelly. ``You can't cut
back but so far.''
   But Nancy Silks, owner of three That Pet Place pet stores in
State College and Johnstown, Pa., said she would have to close her
downtown State College store and reduce her staff at the Nittanny
Mall if the raise went into effect.
   As canaries chirped away at her mall store, Ms. Silks told a
reporter, ``Ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small
business anyhow.''

   The Senate approved legislation to end 35 years
of federal price controls on natural gas, with critics predicting
that decontrol would set the stage for a damaging round of price
increases in the early 1990s.
   The 82-17 vote in the Senate on Wednesday followed House approval
in April of a similar bill. Reltively minor differences between the
two are expected to be worked out fairly quickly to allow President
Bush to sign a bill into law this summer.
   Bush has made natural gas decontrol one of his top energy policy
priorities.
   Supporters of decontrol say it will help the energy industry by
spurring more drilling activity. Consumers will benefit because
supplies will increase, they say.
   But opponents, led on Capitol Hill by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, contend the legislation will lay a foundation for price
increases in a few years that would mean financial hardship for some
of the 48 million households heated by natural gas.
   ``The gas producers want to ride that rocket as far as it will
take them,'' Metzenbaum said in a floor speech before the vote.
``The consumers of this country are going to be hurt.''
   Ed Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy
Coalition, said the legislation was a cave-in to the financial
interests of the gas industry.
   ``The vote of a majority of the Senate gives gas producers
everything they've ever wanted and is making consumers pay for it,''
he said, adding that within two years natural gas prices probably
would be about 15 percent higher than today.
   About two-thirds of U.S. natural gas was decontrolled by the 1978
Natural Gas Policy Act. Of the remaining gas that still is
controlled, most is selling in the open market at prices below the
federal ceilings. So enactment of the decontrol legislation is not
expected to have much immediate effect on consumer prices.
   But many industry analysts believe prices will start rising
significantly in the early 1990s as a supply glut that has persisted
for much of this decade disappears.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chief sponsor of the bill, said
consumers have nothing to fear from removal of the remaining
controls, since deregulation would fix ``dislocations'' in the
marketplace that serve to limit natural gas exploration.
   ``There'll be more drilling. More jobs will be produced in the
natural gas industry,'' he said, stressing that gas-producing states
such as his own would be major beneficiaries of a freer market.
   The gas industry, which lobbied hard for the legislation, cheered
the Senate vote.
   ``The Senate's passage of natural gas decontrol legislation is a
wonderful day for producers and consumers,'' said Nicholas J. Bush,
president of the Natural Gas Supply Association, the producers' main
trade group. He expressed confidence that the House and Senate
versions could be reconciled and sent to the president.
   The only significant difference between the bills is that the
House version provides for immediate decontrol of all gas produced
from wells drilled after March 23, 1989. The Senate bill contains no
such provision for ``new'' gas.

<HEAD>Yeutter Promotes Dole Drought Bill Over House Version</HEAD>

   New drought legislation in the House includes
provisions that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says could
raise taxpayer complaints.
   ``In my judgment, some of the present drought proposals are, at
best, on the margin of acceptability to the American public,''
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, unanimously approved
a rural development program and agreed to take up drought relief on
July 19.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas had argued before the
committee on Tuesday that quick action on drought relief for winter
wheat farmers should come before rural development legislation.
   Large areas of the Great Plains and western Corn Belt have still
not recovered from the devastating 1988 drought. The winter wheat
crop in Kansas, for example, is down by more than a third from last
year.
   Yeutter, in an interview with reporters, said that ``we have not
officially embraced any drought legislation'' and will ``give an
official response when the time comes.''
   Yeutter said he preferred Dole's drought-relief bill over a
broader version in the House, which he described as ``too
open-ended, with far too much taxpayer exposure and vulnerability.''
   Further, he said, the House bill is ``far too subject to attack
by the general public'' because of its costs and other features.
Yeutter said the Dole bill ``is far more acceptable in that regard.''
   Dole's drought bill would extend terms of last year's drought
relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989, mostly winter
wheat, which is normally Kansas' biggest crop.
   The House bill, which was approved by the agriculture committee
on May 25, is basically an extension of the $3.9 billion 1988
drought relief law. Under it, if farmers qualified, they could get
federal aid for any affected crop or livestock operation.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House committee,
said the bill ``provides the thinnest of safety nets for farmers
around the country who have suffered significant financial losses
because of the continuing drought and other types of weather
damage.''
   De la Garza said the committee ``acted in a compassionate and
budgetarily sound manner'' to deal with the tragedy of these farmers.
   But Yeutter said there are limits on measures the federal
government can or should take to remove risk from the nation's
agriculture.
   ``We are already covering price risk in agriculture in a very
significant way through a variety of programs,'' he said. `` We are
already covering income risks to agriculture in a very significant
way through a variety of programs, including deficiency payments
(subsidies).''
   Yeutter added: ``If we're now also to cover weather risks in a
very significant way, one must wonder just what additional role
government should take up on behalf of American agriculture _ and at
what cost.''
   Already, he said, there are ``multibillion-dollar price tags''
for the price support and income protection under federal crop
programs.
   ``It seems to me at some point in time, as an industry, we're
likely to experience a taxpayer rebellion, and we ought to be
careful to ensure that we can persuasively defend these programs to
the American public,'' Yeutter said.
   The Dole drought bill ``is obviously more attractive'' than the
House bill because it is limited mostly to winter wheat, he said.
``That, at least, limits the (cost) exposure to the American
taxpayer and confines it to a segment of our economy that has really
been damaged.''

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says that
if Congress goes along with President Bush's clean air plan, corn
farmers may see a growing market in the fuel industry in the decade
ahead.
   It's too early to make predictions, he said, but Bush's call for
more cars to use ``neat'' fuels that don't pollute ``should be
perceived as potentially good news'' for farmers.
   Yeutter said the Bush proposal calls for manufacturers to turn
out 500,000 cars a year by 1995 and 1 million a year by 1997 that
are equipped to use alternative fuels.
   During his visit this week to the University of Nebraska, Bush
participated in a demonstration of an automobile using ethanol-based
fuel, and witnessed another using a combination of ethanol and ETBE
_ ethyl tertiary-butyl ether _ a promising alternativeto gasoline.
   Ethanol, a fuel-grade alcohol currently processed in the United
States mostly from corn, has held high hopes for many farmers and
energy companies for years. It's production has been heavily
subsidized to make it competitive.
   Yeutter told reporters Wednesday that ETBE has an ethanol base at
the moment but also could be based on methanol, a rival fuel made
from coal, natural gas and plants.
   ``A lot can happen in the next six or seven years,'' he said.
``We really don't know what might be the fuels of choice at that
time.''
   Yeutter said that during talks within the administration on
reform of the 1970 Clean Air Act, he cautioned against announcing a
specific fuel for the 1995 project and beyond.
   ``Technology that exists today for ethanol or methanol or any
other neat fuel could change dramatically,'' he said.
   Also, Yeutter said, the current technology and methods of
providing ethanol from corn could not compete with gasoline without
federal subsidies.
   ``Whether or not that will be the case by 1995 remains to be
seen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Chairman Predicts New FAA Administrator Approval</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   James B. Busey is headed towards quick Senate
approval as head of the Federal Aviation Administration, according
to Senators who ushered the four-star admiral through a congenial
confirmation hearing.
   They also told Busey on Wednesday that he could keep his status
as a retired military officer and collect his full pension even
though the law says the FAA administrator must be a civilian.
   Both Busey's confirmation and a bill that would provide an
exemption to allow him to collect the pension are likely to pass by
July 1, predicted Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   Busey told the committee on Wednesday that his priorities for
aviation would be safety, security and modernization of the civil
aviation system and pledged to keep a strong work force to monitor
the skies. He also pledged to listen to the advice of aviation
interest groups and others.
   ``I don't have any plans to do anything different from what is
done right now,'' Busey said, when asked by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass,
if he would take additional steps to guarantee the safety of
financially troubled carriers such as Eastern Airlines.
   But Busey, who is retiring as commander of U.S. Naval forces in
Europe, pledged that ``any indication that safety procedures were
not being followed would trigger us into immediate action.''
   The former jet fighter pilot gave similar noncontroversial
responses throughout 90 minutes of questioning from a handful of
Senators.
   By the end of the hearing, only the committee chairman, Sen.
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., was left on the panel, and he predicted Busey
would win easy Senate approval.
   The FAA has been without an administrator since Allan McArtor
resigned in February. Busey apologized for the delay, saying the
time it took to be relieved of his overseas duties does not indicate
a lack of interest in the job.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee expressed support
for Busey. No objections were raised to his nomination, and no
senator challenged anything the admiral said before the committee.
   Busey indicated much of his knowledge of issues affecting the FAA
had come from briefings he has received since being nominated by
President Bush.
   He said in written response to earlier questions from the
committee that he had no new suggestions for using the $6 billion
Airport Trust Fund, no proposals for improvement of FAA
procurements, no new initiatives for improving the air traffic
control system, no opinion on anti-collision systems or proposals
for head taxes at airports and was keeping an ``open mind'' on the
need for a national airliner noise policy and on the issue of
banning smoking on more commercial flights.
   Asked about proposals to make the FAA an independent agency,
separate from the Transportation Department, Busey said he has
agreed to work together with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   ``I do not come to this position seeking autonomy or
independence,'' he said in his written answer.
   Ford, who plans to introduce legislation giving the FAA autonomy,
asked Busey during the hearing to at least remain neutral on the
bill.
   Ford also advised Busey not to appoint a chief of staff who would
have authority over career officers in the agency and suggested that
he look into new FAA rules allowing airlines to maintain their
planes at foreign repair stations.
   Busey gave no response to the first suggestion. Addressing the
second, he said he would not approve overseas facilities where the
FAA could not assure their reliability and would revise the rules if
there is any indication safety might be compromised.

   The new owner of the National Enquirer and
Weekly World News said it would lay off 47 employees to cut costs
and would turn out the lights on the town's Christmas tree unless it
got some help.
   Michael Boylan, president of Macfadden Holdings Inc., said 20 of
270 employees would be laid off immediately at the Lantana
headquarters of the two supermarket tabloids. Departments affected
will include editorial and advertising, he said.
   Twenty-seven more employees will be laid off when the Pompano
Beach plant that prints the News closes July 19, he said. Printing
of the News, which sells about 1 million copies a week, will move to
Atlanta.
   Boylan also said the company can't afford to continue its annual
Christmas tree display without financial support from the community.
The display, which reportedly costs as much as $1 million, was begun
by the tabloids' former owner, the late Generoso Pope Jr.
   ``There's no way in the world we can throw a million-dollar
Christmas party on our own,'' Boylan said. ``Mr. Pope was Santa
Claus, and we just can't afford to be.''
   Macfadden bought the News and the Enquirer _ which sells 4.3
million copies weekly _ in April for $412.5 million. The company was
put up for sale after Pope died of a heart attack in October.
   Macfadden, whose titles include True Story, True Confessions and
Modern Romance, bought the News and the Enquirer with the financial
backing of Boston Ventures, a New York venture capital company.

<TEXT>
   In its first day of trading on the big
board, Weirton Steel Corp.'s stock rose 63 cents a share to $15.125,
and more than 1.2 million shares traded hands.
   Weirton Steel went public Wednesday by offering 4 million shares
of its common stock for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Employees of the nation's seventh-largest steelmaker and largest
worker-owned company in March approved a plan that reduces their
profit-sharing from 50 percent to 35 percent of the company's
after-tax income.
   The plan, which guarantees employee control of the company, also
allowed the public sale of stock.
   Weirton Steel stock opened at $14.50 a share and closed at
$15.125.
   The company announced the plan to go public in January. Officials
said it was part of a plan to fund a $650 million modernization
project. Under that 3-year project, the company will renovate its
continuous slab caster, blast furnaces and finishing mills and
complete its hot mill renovations.
   Weirton Steel produces and sells flat-rolled and coated carbon
steel. In 1988, it reported net income of $150 million on sales of
$1.4 billion.
   The company, which has about 8,000 employees, gives stock to
employees and former workers based of their annual earnings and the
coporation's earnings.

<HEAD>Hunt Brothers File Liquidation Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Will stand. Hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. CDT</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Uncle Sam would receive the lion's share of the
proceeds from the liquidation of the multimillion dollar holdings of
William Herbert and Nelson Bunker Hunt, but the former billionaires
would remain wealthy under their proposed settlement plans.
   The sons of wildcatter H.L. Hunt, pushed into bankruptcy by
lawsuits and Internal Revenue Service claims, want U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Harold Abramson to allow creditors to vote on the plan, which
would create liquidation trusts for each brother.
   A hearing was scheduled for today in Abramson's downtown Dallas
courtroom, but he is not expected to rule immediately.
   The brothers filed for protection from their creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last year after a Peruvian
mining company won a $196 million judgment against them for their
attempt to corner the silver market in 1979 and 1980.
   The IRS also has multimillion-dollar claims against the brothers,
charging taht Bunker and his wife, Caroline, owe the government $600
million while Herbert and his wife, Nancy, owe $300 million.
   Bunker and Caroline Hunt have said they have about $258.83
million in assets to cover debt of more than $1.2 billion; Herbert
and Nancy value their assets at $169.38 million and debts of $887
million.
   Attorneys for some creditors objected to a similar plan presented
in April. Especially objectionable, they said, were provisions that
would allow the brothers control over the trusts and leave them with
millions of dollars in assets.
   ``The real creditors don't want the Hunts managing this,'' said
Hugh Ray, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York,
which claims the brothers owe the bank $36 million.
   The plans, filed Wednesday, contain the most detailed look yet at
the brothers holdings, ranging from Bunker Hunt's $10 silver
Churchill Commemorative Coin to his $19 million coin collection,
``the largest and most valuable privately held collection of ancient
coins in the world.''
   Besides the coins and another $3 million in vases, art,
porcelain, statues and jewelry, Bunker Hunt's holdings are a maze of
partial interests in Dallas-area real estate, oil and gas properties
worldwide and $7.36 million in cash.
   Herbert Hunt's assets include $3.95 million worth of producing
oil and gas leases, a $3.5 million collection of ancient bronze
statues and artifacts, $2 million worth of Byzantine coins, a home
worth $1.25 million and $1 million interest in the Dallas Bowling
Center.
   While the brothers' plans differ in detail, they both suggest
creating of a liquidation trust, which would sell off their holdings
over a six-year period to pay down their debts.
   In both plans, the IRS would get the largest chunk of the
proceeds _ 70 percent of Bunker Hunt's, 60 percent of Herbert Hunt's.
   On Wednesday, Abramson granted the brothers' request to dismiss
from the bankruptcy proceedings 601 claims from people who say they
lost $87.7 million because of the brothers' attempts to corner the
silver market.
   The ruling did not affect almost 600 claims amounting to about
$360 million stemming from the brothers' silver speculation.
Included in that is a reduced $134.6 million judgment in favor of
Minepaco, S.A., a Peruvian mining company.
   It was the judgment last year in favor of Minepaco that prompted
the brothers' Chapter 11 filings.

<HEAD>Hilton Hotels Seeks To Boost Stock Price</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp., in a move that
could lead to the sale of all or part of the company, announced it
will explore strategies to boost its stock price.
   The action had been widely expected since the company's chairman,
Barron Hilton, won voting control of about 25 percent of Hilton
stock five weeks ago. He had been embroiled in a long legal battle
over the estate of his father, Conrad Hilton.
   Hilton stock jumped $3.12{ a share to close at $95.12{ on the New
York Stock Exchange Wednesday. The stock has climbed steadily from
$63 a share on May 8, the day the estate dispute was settled.
   According to a statement issued Wednesday, the company will hire
a financial adviser to help its board evaluate strategies ``to
optimize shareholder value.''
   Although several parties have expressed interest in the company
over the last five weeks, there have been no formal offers, said
Hilton vice president Roy Judge. He declined to name the prospective
investors.
   An investment adviser would be chosen in a week to 10 days, Judge
said.
   In addition to selling all or part of the company, Hilton could
opt to borrow money to pay stockholders a big dividend. Another
option analysts have suggested would be selling the company's hotels
and keeping its casinos in Las Vegas.
   ``My guess is they'll wind up selling the whole company because
tax law favors that alternative,'' said Daniel Lee, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``Barron's made some big
hints that he was likely to sell the company.''
   The estate settlement ended a legal battle between Barron Hilton
and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation over control of 13.5 million of
the company's 48.7 million stock shares. The foundation supports
travel and drug education and Roman Catholic nuns around the world.
   Conrad Hilton left the stock to the foundation when he died in
1979, but his son maintained through a nine-year legal wrangle he
was entitled to buy it at its 1979 market value.
   The settlement provided Barron Hilton with 4.1 million shares,
the foundation with 3.5 million, and the rest went into a trust with
income to be split 60-40 between Hilton and the foundation for the
next 20 years. Barron Hilton gets to vote the shares in the trust.
That, combined with his other holdings, gives him control of about
25 percent of the company.
   Hilton owns 11 hotels, including the Waldorf Astoria and the Las
Vegas and Flamingo Hiltons in Nevada, and manages 13 hotels it owns
in partnerships with others, including the Hilton Hawaiian Village
in Honolulu and Hiltons in San Francisco, Chicago, New York and
Washington. The company manages 21 hotels it doesn't have any
ownership interest in and franchises 225 Hilton Inns.

   Lisa Hart, a single parent getting by as a fast-food worker at an
Oklahoma City Hardee's, said she was looking forward to a good pay
raise until President Bush vetoed the minimum wage bill.
   Lee Soule, who owns a mall restaurant in San Francisco, said he,
too, believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the
president vetoed the bill.
   Ms. Hart and Soule were among workers and managers queried by The
Associated Press on Wednesday following Bush's veto of a measure to
gradually raise the current $3.35 hourly minimum to $4.55. Democrats
in Congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to do so.
   Out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue
has the most impact, opinion was mixed, but most people on both the
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough.
   ``People have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live
on $3.35 an hour,'' said Soule, who pays waiters at his mid-scale
Pacific Cafe the California hourly minimum of $4.25.
   In Washington, the Labor Department said California is one of 12
states with minimum wages higher than the federal one. The District
of Columbia, Guam and the Virgin Islands also have higher minimums.
Among these 15 jurisdictions, the highest is the District of
Columbia, where the minimum varies according to circumstances but
can be as high as $4.75. New Hampshire and Vermont, with $3.65
minimums, are the lowest among the 15. The lowest minimum wage set
by state law is $1.50 in Ohio, but that has long been overridden by
the federal standard.
   Ms. Hart, who makes more than the current minimum but less than
$4.55, was asked if $3.35 is a livable wage.
   ``No way,'' she said. `The most you could do is pay your
utilities or your mortgage.''
   Her manager, Anita Feeley, said starting workers at the
restaurant now get $3.65 an hour. She said she didn't think
employers would lay off workers if the wage were raised to $4.55,
but they might become warier about whom they hired.
   In Seattle, Shari Hudson said the tips she receives at Benjamin's
restaurant, bring in about three times as much as her wage of $3.85
an hour, the minimum in Washington state. The proposed raise, she
said, ``might pay the tax on our tips.''
   Interviews at restaurants in Seattle, Yakima and Spokane, Wash.,
plus a dry cleaning shop, a pub and a beauty supply store in the
state turned up no businesses that said they were paying the minimum
wage.
   In Maine, the story was much the same. The state minimum is $3.75
an hour, but in many areas the starting scale is well above that.
   ``There's just too much competition around here,'' said Pamela
Potter, staffing coordinator for four McDonald's restaurants.
   In Boston also, it was hard to find minimum wage workers.
Fast-food restaurants are advertising for employees at $6 or $7 an
hour and dishwashers in Chinatown start at $5, according to a
restaurant owner.
   ``I can see minimum wage for kids in high school. But if you're
living alone, there's no way, no way, you can do it on $3.35 an
hour,'' said Christopher Long, a 23-year-old Bostonian. Leaning
against the bumper of his black 1989 Jeep with a broad smile and
Ray-Ban sunglasses on his face, Long said he would not consider a
job at less than $6.
   In Ocean City, N.J., Roy Gillian, owner of Wonderland Pier, said,
``In the Northeast, it has no effect, because we couldn't get
anybody for $3.35.''
   Vera Kelly, 49, of Queens, who works behind the lunch counter at
Lamston's, a five and dime store in Manhattan, said even $4.55
``still wouldn't support a family. It should be even more than
that.''
   Few workers believed employers would be forced to lay off people
if the minimum were raised.
   ``You've got to have help,'' said Mrs. Kelly. ``You can't cut
back but so far.''
   But Nancy Silks, owner of three That Pet Place pet stores in
State College and Johnstown, Pa., said she would have to close her
downtown State College store and reduce her staff at the Nittanny
Mall if the raise went into effect.
   As canaries chirped away at her mall store, Ms. Silks told a
reporter, ``Ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small
business anyhow.''

<TEXT>
   A wildcat coal miners' strike that has
spread across West Virginia and Virginia comes at a time of soaring
production, dwindling employment and concerns about President Bush's
clean air proposal.
   The walkout began Monday in support of 1,600 United Mine Workers
members on strike against The Pittston Coal Group. It has spread to
more than 10,000 workers and crippled production in parts of West
Virginia, the nation's third-largest producer, and Virginia, among
the top-producing states in the East.
   The strike is taking place with industry and union officials
concerned about the potential impact of the president's clean air
package announced this week. It would require a 50 percent cut in
sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants by 1990.
   The UMW says the plan could put 30,000 miners out of work.
Particularly hard-hit would be high-sulfur coal mines in Illinois,
Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   Richard L. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association,
called some of the plans provisions ``unnecessary, unduly harsh and
economically onerous.''
   Company officials in West Virginia and Virginia say it's too
early to tell what effect the wildcat strikes will have on business,
but any extended walkout would be a severe blow to the Appalachian
economy by cutting into tax revenues.
   ``It usually takes at least a week or 10 days before you start
noticing it,'' said Williamson Mayor Sam Kapourales, whose town is
in the heart of the southern West Virginia coal field. ``I hope it's
not going to be a long or lengthy thing. I hope they get it worked
out, because nobody wins under these circumstances.''
   The walkout hasn't hurt West Virginia's economy yet, but the pain
threshhold could be near for some areas, state Energy Department
spokeswoman Twila Matheny said.
   ``When you're talking about your heavier coal producing counties,
and 90 percent of their mines closed, we could be near that now,''
she said.
   Utilities also could be affected if the strike persists,
especially if a hot summer boosts demand for air conditioning,
Matheny said. American Electric Power Co., the nation's leading coal
buyer, has a normal stockpile to last 55 to 75 days, said Chuck
Ebetino, managing director of coal procurement for the utility's
coal-buying division. The utility supplies power to parts of seven
Midwest and Appalachian states, including West Virginia and Virginia.
   ``We have had some shipments during the period, although they
have mainly been from mine inventories. Obviously if it were to
continue it would affect our storage,'' Ebetino said of the strike.
   Coal production has been climbing despite a decline in jobs in
recent years. Companies laid off workers during the recession of the
early 1980s, and competition from low-cost, government-subsidized
coal from countries like Poland and Australia has kept pressure on
jobs.
   Because of the introduction of labor-saving technology, 1988 coal
production in West Virginia hit a 20-year high of 143.7 million
tons, while employment slid to 24,280, the lowest since the state
began keeping records in 1900.
   Nationwide, production increased from 776 million tons in 1979 to
914 million tons in 1987, while mine employment fell from 224,000 to
142,000, the federal Energy Information Administration said
Wednesday.
   Union members at Pittston had been working for 14 months without
a contract before going on strike in April over wages, benefits and
work rules. In particular, workers are angry that the company
dropped out of the union's national contract with the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association in an attempt to wring favorable
work-rule changes.
   About 650 employees of Westmoreland Coal Co. walked out Wednesday
at three mines in Wise County, Va. It was the first major expansion
of the wildcat strike that began Monday by about 10,000 miners in
southern West Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp in Charleston told wildcatters
to go back to work at four West Virginia companies, but strikers
have ignored Knapp's previous back-to-work orders at other southern
West Virginia companies.
   The UMW has not sanctioned the wildcat strike, which violates a
no-strike clause in the national Bituminous Coal Operators
Association pact.

   President Bush won his first battle with
Congress over raising the minimum wage, but Democrats are promising
to emerge from the next round of the fight with a new measure the
president will be unable to kill with a veto.
   ``Our obligation now is to move forward with a bill which will be
enacted and put money in the pockets of low-wage workers this
year,'' House Labor Committee Chairman Augustus Hawkins said
Wednesday after he and fellow Democrats failed to override Bush's
veto of a minimum-wage bill.
   Hawkins, D-Calif., said he was preparing a new bill but wanted to
talk with administration officials first to see if there was room
for compromise.
   Across the Capitol, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wasted no
time in beginning the second phase of the fight, introducing a bill
identical to the one Bush vetoed Tuesday.
   ``The president should understand that this is an issue on which
Congress has only begun to fight,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the
Senate Labor Committee. ``The issue is fairness and America's
working poor deserve a fair increase in the minimum wage.''
   Kennedy, too, said he hoped to strike a compromise with the White
House and with Hawkins invited Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to
appear before a joint session of the labor committees next week.
   But Kennedy served notice he wanted to advance a new bill quickly
and would do so whether or not Bush gives ground.
   ``I would prefer to work out an acceptable compromise with the
administration,'' Kennedy said. ``But if that is not possible we
will try to enact a measure that has the support of a veto-proof
majority.''
   Initial White House reaction indicated that Bush was not about to
budge.
   ``The Congress should enact the president's minimum wage proposal
at the earliest opportunity,'' said Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Mrs. Dole said that if Congress is unwilling to accept Bush's
minimum wage proposal it should drop the issue and instead focus on
job training, vocational education and other efforts to help the
working poor.
   ``I hope that now we can move on to the issues that will really
make a difference in people's lives,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Bush's offer is to increase the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to
$4.25 by January 1992, with employers being able to pay all new
hires a subminimum wage for six months.
   The legislation he vetoed Tuesday would have increased the floor
wage to $4.55 by October 1991 and contained a restrictive clause
allowing employers to pay a subminimum to some new workers for no
more than two months.
   The House, under new Speaker Thomas S. Foley, tried to override
the veto just 24 hours after it was issued, but the effort fell
short by more than 30 votes. The vote was 247-178, with 20
Republicans joining 227 Democrats in trying to override the veto.
Twenty-eight Democrats joined 150 Republicans in thwarting the
leadership from reaching the two-thirds margin it needed to override.
   A coalition of House Republicans also entered the second round of
the fight, introducing a new minimum-wage proposal of their own that
also includes a modest expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
available to families with young children.
   The new GOP measure would be closely studied by Democrats looking
to draft a new bill that will attract enough support to override
Bush in the event of a second veto.
   While he introduced a measure identical to the one vetoed,
Kennedy said he considered it only a start and would consider
amendments. In the House, Hawkins was considering a proposal calling
for an increase in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour within two
years.
   That level matches Bush's final target for the minimum wage but
would bring it there a year earlier than Bush favors. But Hawkins
said he was not prepared to meet Bush's demand for the six-month
subminimum, a provision the president has said must be in any
minimum-wage legislation for him to sign it.
   The new Republican proposal matches Bush's three-year formula for
bringing the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour. But it takes the middle
ground in the fight over the subminimum, allowing it to be paid for
four months _ twice what Democrats say they will allow and two
month's short of Bush's demand.

<HEAD>Judge Clears Way For Holly Farms Merger Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware Chancery Court has denied
Tyson Foods Inc.'s request to block ConAgra Inc.'s $1.3 billion
offer for Holly Farms Corp., essentially clearing the way for the
combination.
   Judge Maurice Hartnett on Wednesday also denied Tyson's bid to
force Holly Farms to redeem its poison-pill anti-takeover defense.
   ``Naturally we're pleased by the decision,'' said ConAgra vice
president Walt Casey.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor which has been
trying to acquire Memphis-based Holly Farms since last October, said
it still was not calling it quits.
   ``We have not given up and we have not lost our desire to try to
compete for Holly in some kind of fair environment if we can find
one,'' said Jim Blair, general counsel for Tyson.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., has offered $63.50 a share in
cash, or $1.1 billion for Holly Farms. That offer has been rejected
in favor of ConAgra's $70-a-share stock swap offer valued at $1.3
billion.
   Hartnett agreed with Tyson's argument that Holly managers favored
ConAgra in an auction for the company, but he said behind-the-scenes
dealing between Tyson and ConAgra justified such actions.
   ``It is the interest of the Holly Farms shareholders which must
be primarily considered,'' Hartnett said.
   Hartnett was told at a hearing earlier this month that Tyson
agreed to pay ConAgra $50 million to get out of the bidding for
Holly Farms but the deal fell through.
   In ruling to leave Holly Farms' ``poison pill'' intact, Hartnett
said there was no assurance Holly and ConAgra shareholders would
uphold the latest merger proposal and he said Tyson might be able to
buy enough Holly stock to block it.
   Shareholders are expected to vote on ConAgra's proposed merger
with Holly Farms next month.

<TEXT>
   Time Inc. stock continued to fluctuate in the
absence of any word from the media giant on how it will fight
Paramount Communications Corp.'s unwanted $10.7 billion takeover bid.
   Time stock _ which rose $5 on Tuesday on speculation about a
higher bid from General Electric Co. _ fell $4.87{ to $175.12{ a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Paramount rose $1.75 to $59.50 a share and Warner
Communications Inc., which still hopes to preserve its own pending
merger agreement with Time, was up 75 cents to $55 a share.
   Traders apparently speculated that Paramount might itself receive
a takeover bid and weren't discounting the possibility another
suitor might make an offer for Time higher than Paramount's
$175-a-share bid, said J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   Time gave no hint as to its plans, leaving investors to buy on
speculation alone.
   The board was expected to meet sometime this week to discuss the
media giant's strategy, but spokesman Edward Adler refused to
comment on whether the board met Wednesday.
   Even if no formal meeting was scheduled, it was likely the
directors were in contact about the situation.
   Among the options the Time board was believed to be considering
were a recapitalization of the company, a cash tender offer for
Warner, a cash tender offer for Paramount or a continued pursuit of
its planned merger with Warner. Warner also could launch a cash
tender offer for Time.
   ``I really feel the picture is unpredictable at this point,''
Noble said, but he added, ``I think the original merger as proposed
is probably dead.''
   The Time-Warner merger likely would have to be renegotiated
because of the surge in Time's stock price since the Paramount bid
was announced last week. Time shares were trading at $126 before
Paramount announced its offer, and the Time-Warner agreement was
based on the lower stock price.
   Under the planned merger, Time stockholders would get a share in
the new company for each share they own while Warner shareholders
would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each of their
Warner shares.
   On Tuesday, Time _ in one of the few public moves the company has
made since the Paramount bid was announced last week _ asked the
Federal Communications Commission to deny a Paramount request to
create a voting trust for Time stock.
   The trust would allow Paramount to purchase Time's shares pending
FCC approval of the transfer of cable television franchises and
licenses held by Time's 82-percent-owned cable TV unit, American
Television and Communications Corp.

<TEXT>
   Arizona's second largest savings and loan and
another thrift were declared insolvent and have been taken over by
federal regulators in a move that reflects the area's weakening real
estate markets.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board placed Western Savings and Loan
and Sun State Savings and Loan into receivership of the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The FSLIC in turn named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as
managing agent of each thrift, officials announced Wednesday.
   FDIC officials said the thrifts will maintain normal operations
as federal mutual savings and loans. All depositors will continue to
be protected up to the $100,000 insured limit.
   However, the FDIC said the receiverships relieve both Western and
Sun State of their stock and subordinated debt obligations. ``The
two new institutions also did not assume any obligations to the
stockholders of the insolvent thrifts,'' the agency said.
   ``You invest your savings and in a day they take it away. It's
rough.'' said a Western investor who attended the news conference
and who declined to be identified.
   FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney blamed the Phoenix area's
depressed real estate economy for much of the troubles of Arizona
financial institutions. He said 35 percent of Arizona's banks lost
money last year, the highest percentage in the nation.
   Acting State Banking Superintendent William H. Rivoir III said
Western and Sun State were taken into receivership to conserve
remaining assests.
   ``It's certainly no coincidence that approximately $9 million of
the institution (Western) would have been paid to the bondholders
tommorrow,'' Rivoir said when asked about the timing of the seizure.
   Western, which is Arizona's second largest thrift, had been
scheduled to decide today whether it would make a $9 million payment
on $155 million worth of subordinated notes.
   On April 30, Western had $5.78 billion in assets and $5.99
billion in liabilities, and on May 31 was $85.8 million below the
required capital level, the FDIC said. Sun State on April 30 had
$1.06 billion in assets and $1.09 billion in liabilities, and on May
31 was $2.72 million below the required capital level, the agency
said.
   Virginia Judues, named the FDIC's managing agent for Western,
said while she would consult with Western Chairman Robert Stallings,
the financial decisions would be made by the government.
   Ms. Judues said the FDIC is in the process of setting up an
advisory board to manage the thrift. Western will limit its
real-estate lending to financing single-family residences.
   Herbert Chin, who like Ms. Judues is a senior liquidation
specialist with the FDIC in San Francisco, was named Sun State's
managing agent.
   Both thrifts recently were placed under new management after
regulators forced the ouster of previous executives.

   Stock prices headed lower in early trading today
as a wait-and-see attitude prevailed in the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.02 to 2,495.34 by
10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about a 5-to-3 margin, with
565 down, 336 up and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.31 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks slid
0.46 to 180.37.
   Friday's ``triple witching hour'' when stock-index futures, index
options and options on individual stocks expire has tempered the
trading enthusiasm of some investors.
   Analysts detected little reaction to a Commerce Department report
showing the country's merchandise trade deficit fell to $8.26
billion in April.
   The improvement in the trade balance was largely expected but
economists are doubtful the deficit will continue to shrink due to
the strength of the dollar, which makes American exports more
expensive for foreign buyers.
   In the early going, Monsanto gained 5 to 109 after a delayed
opening. The company reportedly plans to announce settlement of a
dispute involving an intrauterine device.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down { at 109~, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down \
at 35|.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average ended almost where
it started at 2,503.36, off 0.18.
   The NYSE's composite index closed at 180.83, down 0.11.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
745 up, 725 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 170.54 million shares, against 164.87
million in the previous session.

   MCorp lost nearly $1 billion last year, but the
five banks that it retains narrowed their loss to $13.4 million in
the first quarter, according to the bank holding company.
   Federal regulators seized 20 of the company's 25 subsidiary banks
in March, pushing it into protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code. The five remaining banks are profitable and
solvent, although some do not meet federal capital requirements.
   MCorp's loss last year totaled $977.9 million, a figure that was
held down by a $215.5 million gain from the sale of Dallas-based
MCorp's 80 percent interest in MTech, a data-processing company, in
the second quarter last year.
   MCorp said it lost control of the 20 banks last Oct. 1, and
write-offs in connection with their closing account for a large
portion of the losses.
   MCorp said in a news conference Wednesday it is confident it can
emerge from Chapter 11 as a profitable company.
   Joe Stroop, a spokesman, said the banks' $13.4 million loss in
the first quarter does not reflect MCorp's fully earning potential.
   The first-quarter bank figures, obtained from Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reports, also do not include performance of other
holding company subsidiaries, including a trust bank that probably
earned a profit, said Frank Anderson, bank analyst with Stephens
Inc. in Little Rock, Ark.
   The financial services company's 1988 loss was nearly four times
the $258 million shortfall for the previous year.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit dipped
sharply to $8.26 billion in April as exports rose to a new high and
imports declined, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the secnd straight monthly
improvement in the country's trade balance came from a 0.8 percent
increase in exports and a 2.6 percent decline in imports.
   The April deficit was 13.4 percent below a revised March
imbalance of $9.54 billion. March's trade gap originally had been
estimated at $8.86 billion.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
was ``very pleased by the continuing decline in trade figures.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher also hailed the numbers, but
cautioned: ``it is always unwise to put too much weight on any one
or two months figures in these volatile statistics.''
   ``The recent strength of the dollar leads us to be concerned
about the economy's ability to sustain the excellent trends seen so
far,'' Mosbacher said.
   April's trade gap was the lowest since last July, when the
deficit hit $8.02 billion. The report was even better than the $8.5
billion gap that many analysts had been expecting for the month.
   The trade deficit so far this year has been showing improvement
over its 1988 track record. Analysts are divided, however, over how
long the nation can expect the good news to continue as oil prices
rise and the stronger value of the dollar makes American products
more expensive on overseas markets.
   For the first four months of 1989, the trade deficit ran at an
annual rate of $108.9 billion, a marked improvement from last year's
actual deficit of $119.76 billion.
   The April improvement came even though the bill for foreign oil
jumped 9.9 percent to $4.05 billion.
   The average price of a barrel of oil shot up 11.6 percent to
$17.83 in April, the fifth straight monthly increase. The volume of
imported oil, meanwhile, rose to 7.57 million barrels a day from
7.45 million in March.
   Overall, imports fell to a seasonally adjusted $38.84 billion.
The lower figure included declines in sales of foreign cars,
manufactured capital goods and agricultural products.
   U.S. exports, meanwhile, hit a record $30.57 billion in April.
Exports of industrial supplies, manufactured capital goods and
consumer goods all increased.
   Economist Joe Carson of Chemical Bank in New York said he expects
continued progress on the trade front despite recent strengthening
of the dollar against foreign currencies.
   ``I don't think the recent rise in the dollar will break the
favorable trend that's been in place for the past two years,''
Carson said in advance of today's report. ``The most recent trade
figures have been very encouraging. We're still experiencing very
strong export growth and import growth is slowing.''
   Nevertheless, many analysts remain concerned that the imbalance
between imports and exports will begin growing again this year under
the adverse influence of higher oil prices and slower demand for
U.S. exports.
   Economist Howard Roth of Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles said that as the strength of dollar takes hold, it could
negatively affect the trade deficit on both the import and export
fronts as ``Americans start buying more imports and foreigners find
our goods more expensive.''
   Roth, anticipating today's favorable report, said April ``may be
the last hurrah. It might be getting worse from now on.''
   As usual, the United States posted its largest trade deficit in
April with Japan. But the $3.89 billion gap was down sharply from
$4.22 billion in March.
   The nation posted its second straight trade surplus with Western
Europe in April, registered a $232 million surplus on top of $397
million in March.
   The imbalance with Canada, the largest U.S. trading partner, rose
to $477 million in April. Other large deficits were recorded with
Taiwan, $840 million; South Korea, $545 million; and Brazil, $365
million.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said recent improvement in the trade deficit probably was
attributable to short-term factors that do not point toward
long-term progress.
   He said the improvement in the trade deficit in recent years was
largely the result of a weakening dollar.
   ``We think that the cessation of the (weakening) dollar at the
end of 1987 ought to begin to show up more prominently,'' Dederick
said. ``We don't think we're going to get improvement to continue on
the order of the past two years.''
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, is counting on continued
progress on narrowing the trade gap to spur economic growth this
year. Last year's dramatic 21 percent drop in the trade deficit from
an all-time high of $152.1 billion in 1987 accounted for nearly half
of all U.S. economic growth.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that a broader measure of
U.S. trade worsened dramatically during the first three months of
the year. The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current
account was 7 percent larger than in the final three months of 1988.
That deficit figure reflected improvement in merchandise trade, but
a widening of the deficit in the services category.

   Household International Inc., based in Prospect Heights, said in
a news release that it expects to complete the cash transaction by
the end of August.
   Thermos, based in Freeport, Ill., is the largest of six
manufacturing subsidiaries that Household is selling as part of its
decision to focus on the financial services businesses, which
include Household Finance Corp.
   Thermos, established in 1907, is a leader in the design,
manufacturing and marketing of outdoor leisure products in North
America and Europe. It is best known for commercialization of the
glass vacuum bottle. The company also makes lunch boxes and
recreational products.
   The company employs about 1,900 people in the United States,
Canada and England. It had sales of about $194 million in 1988.
   Nippon Sanso is one of the world's largest manufacturers of
industrial gas, including oxygen, nitrogen and argon. It has
recently diversified into consumer products such as frozen foods and
stainless steel vacuum bottles, and its acquisition of Thermos
represents a further expansion in the consumer-products area.
   Household announced in January plans to divest all manufacturing
operations. In April it spun off to shareholders three manufacturing
companies: Eljer Industries Inc., Scotsman Industries Inc. and
Schwitzer Inc.
   Household expects to sell its five remaining manufacturing
companies by the end of the summer, said spokesman Robert Hartney.
Those companies are: GC-Thorsen, Albion Industries, King-Sealy, Omni
Products International and WaterTest Corp.
   Household's financial-services businesses are Household Finance,
Household Bank, Household Commercial Finance and the Alexander
Hamilton Life Insurance Co.

   In a move designed to focus more closely on its
core oil business, British Petroleum Co. PLC announced Thursday that
it has put most of its worldwide coal operations up for sale.
   BP said in a statement it hoped to sell its Cleveland-based BP
Coal subsidiary to a single buyer but would consider selling some
properties individually. The company has retained Chase Manhattan
Bank is its financial adviser.
   BP Coal has 3,350 employees and reported 1988 revenues of $959
million. Last year the company produced 32 million tons of coal.
   ``In line with BP's strategy of focusing increasingly on oil,
gas, chemicals and the varied opportunities presented in the
nutrition sector, we believe we have now reached the point where our
coal interests are likely to offer greater value to a company in the
coal or mining sector,'' said BP Managing Director Patrick Gillam.
   London-based BP said it hoped the sale would be completed by the
end of the year.
   BP Coal has 2.1 billion tons of extractable coal reserves,
including operations in the United States, Australia, South Africa
and Europe.
   About 40 percent of the reserves are in the United States, where
BP Coal's production totaled 17.9 million tons last year, or 56
percent of its total.

   Corn and wheat futures were mostly lower and
soybeans were narrowly mixed in early trading on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting some profit-taking after the sharp gains of the
past two sessions.
   Losses in the corn and soybean markets were limited, though, by a
National Weather Service Forecast for warmer- and drier-than-normal
conditions in the Midwest next week.
   The forecast, issued late Wednesday, followed a similarly
warm-and-dry 30-day outlook for the region. The 30-day National
Weather Service forecast came out on Tuesday and sparked the
strongest one-day rally in 10 months Wednesday in the corn and
soybean markets.
   Selling of soybean futures was also limited by news of a
smaller-than-expected devaluation of the Brazilian currency. Brazil
is the world's second-largest soybean producer.
   Good harvest weather in the Great Plains kept pressure on wheat
futures prices.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.97 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1\ cents lower with July at $2.56} a bushel; oats were \ cent

<HEAD>Two Canadian Companies Launch Bid For Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Canadian firms, Unicorp Canada Corp. and Cara
Operations Ltd. launched a hostile $305.3 million tender offer today
for Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   The $43-a-share offer replaces a friendly $298.2 million bid
rejected by Dunkin' Donuts last month. Richard Hart, Dunkin' Donuts
vice president and treasurer, said the company would not comment on
the offer announced today.
   Dunkin' Donuts stock was up 50 cents to $40.12{ a share in early
over-the-counter trading today.
   Unicorp's merchant banking arm, Kingsbridge Capital Group, owns
about 12 percent of Dunkin' Donuts' 7.1 million outstanding shares.
   Dunkin' Donuts, a Randolph, Mass.-based chain with approximately
1,700 franchise shops, has set up a series of takeover defenses,
including a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan and an employee
stock ownership plan.
   The company also has bought back more than 350,000 shares of its
stock and sold 28,000 shares of preferred stock for $28 million to
General Electric Capital Corp.
   Unicorp spokesman Eric W. Evans said his company would file a
lawsuit today in Delaware Chancery Court challenging the ESOP, stock
buyback and preferred stock sale. Dunkin' Donuts is incorporated in
Delaware.
   Evans said Unicorp and Cara Operations have formed an equal
partnership to make the cash bid. He said they do not yet have
financing commitments, but have ``had discussions with two large
banks that have givenus letters of interest'' in financing the deal.
   Unicorp. is Canada's 15th largest company, with assets of $5.8
billion Canadian dollars. It has three main businesses: natural gas
distribution and energy services; Lincoln Savings Bank in New York
City and a U.S. real estate portfolio; and merchant banking.
   Cara Operations is a food services company provides airline
catering and runs duty free stores in 12 Canadian airports. It has
two large franchised restaurant chains: 125 Swiss Chalet family
restaurants in the United States and Canada and 230 Harvey's
hamburger restaurants in Canada.

<HEAD>SEC Bars Bogus Stock Bidder Herrlinger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
barred a Cincinnati stockbroker from the securities business but
said he could be reinstated if he gets a clean bill of health from a
psychiatrist.
   The broker, P. David Herrlinger, caused an uproar on Wall Street
on June 23, 1987 when he called Dow Jones News Service and announced
a bogus $6.8 billion offer to buy Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson
Corp., one of the nation's biggest retailers.
   Speculators responding to the Dow Jones report of the purported
$70 a share bid sent the price of Dayton Hudson stock soaring by as
much as $9 a share in heavy trading. The price later tumbled after
Herrlinger's attorney reported the offer was a hoax.
   Herrlinger was fired by Capital Management Corp., an investment
counseling firm, the same day and subsequently hospitalized. He was
diagnosed as suffering from manic depression.
   The SEC sued Herrlinger in July 1987 for securities law
violations and alleged he profited by trading Dayton Hudson stock
options through his brother _ a stockbroker in Albuquerque, N.M. _
before and after making the bogus bid.
   Herrlinger also has been sued by several investors who claim they
lost money due to the false offer.
   Herrlinger's lawyer, Anthony Covatta, said Thursday that the SEC
seemed to understand that ``on the day of the big event Mr.
Herrlinger wasn't himself.''
   ``He didn't get off totally unsullied by the SEC, but certainly
the sanctions are less than they could have been,'' Covatta said.
   Herrlinger will be allowed to reapply for admission to the
securities industry in one year but must first obtain a
psychiatrist's certification that he is mentally stable, according
to the settlement agreement handed down Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today resolved a tax dispute
between the insurance industry and the Internal Revenue Service in a
decision dealing a significant financial setback to many insurance
companies.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that the ``ceding
commissions'' a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another
firm's policies may not be claimed as deductions for the year they
are paid.
   Instead, the court ruled that any tax deductions for those
commission payments must be spread out over the anticipated life of
the policy.
   ``We have concluded that ceding commissions are costs incurred to
acquire an asset with an income-producing life that may extend
substantially beyond one year,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote
for the court.
   ``General tax principles provide that such costs must be
amortized and capitalized over the useful life of the asset,'' he
said.
   The IRS refused to let Colonial American Life Insurance Co., a
Louisiana-based corporation, claim some $1.5 million in such
deductions for 1975 and 1976.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tax agency's
refusal, but other federal appeals courts had allowed such
deductions.
   Colonial American in 1975 and 1976 agreed to partially indemnify
Transport Life Insurance Co. policies. In return, Colonial American
became entitled to the same percentage of future premiums received
on the policies.
   The agreement required Colonial American to pay Transport ceding
commissions in consideration for the business acquired. The
commissions totaled $680,000 in 1975 and $852,000 in 1976.
   Colonial American then sought to deduct as business losses the
full amount of the commissions in the years they were paid.
   The court, calling the commission payments investments in the
future, today said the IRS correctly disallowed the immediate,
lump-sum deductions.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented.
   The case is Colonial American Life vs. Commissioner, Internal
Revnue, 88-396.

   The stock market moved down today amid uneasiness
ahead of Friday's ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 19.78 to 2,483.58 by

   Declining issues outpaced advances by a wide margin, with 880

80.99 million shares at the same point in Wednesday's session.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks slid

   A downturn in bond prices after some initial strength spilled
over into the stock market, analysts said.
   Friday's ``triple witching hour'' when stock-index futures, index
options and options on individual stocks expire has tempered the
buying enthusiasm of some investors.
   Analysts detected little reaction to a Commerce Department report
showing the country's merchandise trade deficit fell to $8.26
billion in April.
   The improvement in the trade balance was largely expected but
economists are doubtful the deficit will continue to shrink due to
the strength of the dollar, which makes American exports more
expensive for foreign buyers.
   Takeover stocks continued to figure on the list of actively
traded NYSE-listed issues.

<HEAD>Investment Firm Penalized For Bond Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities
Dealers has penalized managers at the investment firm Buchanan &amp; Co.
for wrongdoing in the underwriting and sale of $250 million in
tax-free bonds that later defaulted.
   Robert M. Buchanan Jr., owner and chairman of the defunct
Jackson-based company, was fined $200,000, censured, suspended from
the NASD for two years and banned from control of any NASD-member
company.
   The penalties were imposed after company officials ``consented to
findings that they engaged in deceptive, dishonest or unfair
practices'' in the underwriting and sale of bonds, the NASD said in
a news release Wednesday.
   NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing said the officials' consent statement
neither admitted nor denied guilt and was similar to a
``no-contest'' plea.
   Company officials had insisted that they were innocent of any
wrongdoing.
   Buchanan's business plummeted after reports in 1987 that
thousands of investors had been left holding worthless paper from
bonds _ mostly for nursing homes and retirement centers _ that were
underwritten by the company.
   The company, which in its heyday had 150 employees in six states
and annual sales approaching $300 million, filed for
bankruptcy-court protection last December and has been sued by
numerous investors in several states.
   Besides Buchanan, the NASD imposed penalties on the company's
president, Robert C. Fairly, who was censured, fined $20,000,
suspended from the NASD for a year and prohibited from being a
principal in an NASD company for five years.
   Lesser penalties were imposed on branch managers Jonathan D.
Ulrich, Russell W. Clark, Murl D. Calton, Jeffrey D. Rhodes, Kenneth
C. Weber and Mary S. Nelson and on salesmen Kenneth E. Crowl,
Randall J. White, Lorin W. Surpless, Gerard P. Musto and William B.
Nelson.
   The NASD said Buchanan and Fairly were responsible for
misrepresenting and omitting facts in the sale of 10 municipal bond
issues worth $74.47 million.
   The NASD also found that ``the firm, acting through Buchanan and
Fairly, orchestrated a high-pressure, misleading retail sales
campaign for these bonds, as well as for other high-yield, non-rated
bonds.''
   Many of the bonds were sold to fixed-income investors at free
seminars in retirement areas such as Tucson, Ariz., and Tampa, Fla.
   A colleague of Buchanan's at another investment office where he
is currently working said he was out of town and unavailable for
comment today. Fairly's daughter also said he was unavailable for
comment today.

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent decline in interest rates has stirred
up new enthusiasm for mutual funds that invest in bonds.
   When rates decline, as they have since early spring this year,
prices of existing bonds naturally tend to rise. That gives owners
of bond-fund shares a shot at capital gains from the funds' rising
net asset values, on top of the interest they earn.
   For all but the wealthiest individual investors, financial
advisers widely recommend picking a mutual fund or other packaged
vehicle rather than shopping for individual bonds.
   ``We think smart investors should avoid individual issues,''
analysts at the Value Line Investment Survey say in a recent
commentary.
   For one thing, Value Line says, funds provide a diversified
portfolio for even the smallest investments. Diversification reduces
credit risk _ the potential losses you might suffer should an
individual bond issuer default.
   ``Diversification is especially important with long bonds _ even
governments, which have no credit risk _ because the manager has the
ability to select the mix of maturities and coupon rates he or she
considers the most desirable,'' Value Line observes.
   ``A long-term bond fund reduces transaction costs, especially if
the investor has limited his consideration to funds with no
front-end load, redemption or other charges.
   ``The major advantage the fund offers an individual, in addition
to professional management, is its buying power. One million dollars
is the typical trading unit.
   ``Because the fund managers are in the marketplace every day
dealing in large amounts with many brokers, they usually can obtain
advantageous prices on both sales and purchases.
   ``The individual owner of, say, $10,000 worth of bonds will
probably not do nearly as well.''
   Another advantage funds offer is automatic reinvestment in new
fund shares of dividends and any capital gains distributions that
shareholders decide not to receive as cash payouts.
   Investors pay a price for these benefits, of course, even in
funds which impose no sales or redemption charges. Operating
expenses and management fees are collected from the assets of a
fund, thus effectively lowering the yield that flows through to
shareholders.
   Another characteristic of bond funds that some people find
troublesome is their lack of a stated maturity date. Because fund
portfolios are continuously managed, their life span is indefinite.
   So, you cannot tell in advance what the dollar value of your
investment will be when you cash it in, whether you do that six
months or 30 years from now.
   An alternative to bond funds is a unit trust, a package of
securities assembled by a brokerage firm and resold to investors in
small pieces with a predetermined maturity date.
   ``When buying a unit trust, you know what securities are
contained in it, now and when it matures,'' says George Bernard,
senior vice president-unit trusts at the investment firm of Gruntal
&amp; Co.
   ``In the case of a bond unit trust, you'll know what it will be
worth at maturity.''
   Unlike no-load mutual funds, unit trusts typically are offered
with an up-front sales charge. If you hold them for a long period,
however, this cost may be offset by the lower operating expenses and
fees that come with the trusts' fixed portfolios.
   A big selling point with mutual funds is the ease of getting your
money in and out of them on short notice, whenever you wish.
   Most sponsors of unit trusts also state their willingness to cash
in some or all of your investment before maturity. In that
situation, the price you get for your units, as with mutual fund
shares, will be subject to the ups and downs of the credit markets.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has denied a request for a new
trial by a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. assistant trader
convicted of perjury.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand on Wednesday ruled that the
lawyer for Lisa Jones, 26, was too late in filing a request that the
judge declare a mistrial and order a new trial.
   Sand said the request had to be filed within seven days of the
verdict. Jones was convicted March 22 of five counts of perjury and
two of obstruction of justice for lying to a federal grand jury
investigating insider trading involving Drexel.
   Jones' attorney, Daniel Bookin, said in court last month that the
deadline for filing the mistrial motion had passed when he was hired
in mid-April to represent her.
   The request for a retrial was based in part on an allegation that
Bookin's predecessor, who also represented other Drexel employees,
had a conflict of interest in representing Jones.
   But Sand ruled he had found no reason to believe that Jones had
been denied a fair trial.
   ``What was truly damaging to Ms. Jones was her apparent inability
to tell the truth while sitting on the witness stand at trial,'' the
judge said.
   Jones faces a total of 35 years in jail and up to $1.75 million
in fines. Sentencing is scheduled for June 28.

   Boeing Co. said it has received orders for four of
its aircraft from Lufthansa German Airlines and Maersk Air of
Denmark in deals valued at a total of around $400 million.
   Lufthansa converted three options for Boeing 747-400s to firm
orders valued at about $375 million, Boeing said Wednesday. The
planes are scheduled for delivery in 1991.
   The new orders bring to 15 the number of long-range 747-400s
ordered by Lufthansa. Four of those are combination models capable
of carrying passengers or being used to transport cargo only.
   Maersk Air, an independent Danish carrier, ordered one Boeing
737-500 jet valued at $24 million to $28 million.
   The airline had previously ordered three of the jets. The new
planes are scheduled for delivery in 1990.
   The jets will replace the carrier's fleet of 737-200s, said
Maersk Air President Bjarne Hansen.
   The Maersk Air order brings to 151 the total number of 737-500s
on order, from 17 customers.
   Orders for all types of Boeing jetliners for the year now total
604, valued at about $33.2 billion, the company said in a statement.

   Troubled toymaker Coleco Industries Inc.
has agreed to sell most of its assets to rival Hasbro Industries
Inc. for $85 million in cash, the companies announced today.
   Coleco, which is operating under bankruptcy court protection,
will also receive warrants to purchase a million shares of Hasbro
stock. A hearing on the agreement, which is subject to court
approval, will be held within 30 days.
   Under the agreement, Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro will buy
certain accounts receivable and inventory of Coleco, the maker of
Cabbage Patch dolls. The deal is subject to the approval of
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, Coleco
directors and completion by July 17.
   Coleco and Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, also have
entered into a management consulting agreement providing for
Hasbro's active participation in Coleco's business operations up to
the closing of the transaction.
   The 57-year-old Coleco grew to be one of the nation's largest toy
companies during the past decade, propelled in part by the success
of its Cabbage Patch dolls.
   But demand for the dolls dropped in 1986, and Coleco failed to
make up for lost sales. Coleco filed for bankruptcy protection a
year ago, listing debts of $540.3 million.
   Coleco said its committee of unsecured creditors, which late last
month dropped a $71 million lawsuit against the company's largest
creditors, has approved the agreement with Hasbro.

<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton
pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida
Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash
registers.
   The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world's
richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started
hand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills could
be tallied on calculators quickly.
   ``People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him,''
said store manager Paul Sively. ``He shook their hands and talked to
everyone he could. The registers were out for about 45 minutes, and
I don't think we had one customer complain.''
   Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to
the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana
Jea in its parking lot. Walton often attends promotional events for
his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss
might make an appearance.
   Walton continued talking with customers during the concert. He
also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in
the Wal-Mart cheer.
   ``He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and the
customers went right along with him,'' Sively said. ``He even got
down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''

   The House today defeated an attempt to blunt
the key reform in savings and loan bailout legislation after
President Bush threatened to veto a watered-down bill.
   The vote was 326-94, with 114 Republicans and 212 Democrats
supporting the president. Fifty-six Republicans and 38 Democrats
opted to support the S&amp;L industry on the heavily lobbied issue of
capital.
   Bush is insisting that the government force S&amp;Ls to back their
lending with more of their own capital.
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., tried unsuccessfully to provide an
exemption for S&amp;Ls that previously received an accounting break,
known as ``supervisory good will,'' in exchange for taking ailing
institutions off the government's hands in the early 1980s.
   The accounting break allows some of the acquiring S&amp;Ls to operate
without risking any of their owners' money. Hyde's amendment would
have permitted 241 S&amp;Ls that would fail tougher capital standards to
appeal administratively for an exemption.
   ``No result is mandated'' in the hearings, Hyde said, ``just a
chance to make your case ... before the scarlet letter is painted on
your forehead.''
   However, critics complained the procedure would burden regulators
and effectively delay Bush's key reform by 18 months for a
significant portion of the industry.
   ``Make no mistake about it. This amendment guts the bill. ...
What this amendment does is allow those very weak institutions to
delay and delay and delay the day of reckoning. And while they delay
and delay and delay, the taxpayers will pay and pay and pay,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee.
   Bush, in a letter to House Republican Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois, made it clear he would veto the S&amp;L bill if it included
Hyde's proposal.
   ``Giving recognition to good will as capital or creating
procedural changes that could have the same effect is not
justifiable,'' the president wrote. ``Each of the amendments to the
tough capital standards ... would render this bill unacceptable to
me.''
   It was the first time that Bush made the veto threat, although
his advisers have said previously they would recommend that action
if Congress watered down the president's capital reforms.
   ``There should be no mistake. This matter goes to the very heart
of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the
savings and loans, about which every voter is entitled to be
outraged,'' Bush wrote.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he would
keep the House in session late tonight and that he was determined to
pass the bill by Friday.
   Foley predicted the House also would pass an amendment forcing
the administration to count $44 billion in S&amp;L bailout spending as
part of the budget deficit, setting up a conflict with the Senate.
   However, budget director Richard Darman told reporters today,
``It may be that it's an utterly academic question.'' Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, has collected signatures from 41 Republican senators
pledging to support Bush's funding plan.
   That effectively scuttles Democratic attempts in the House to
alter it, because any change must be approved by 60 out of 100
senators.
   The president met with congressional leaders on Wednesday, for
the first time lobbying in person to perserve his capital reforms.
Thumping the table in the Cabinet Room, he said, ``Every American
citizen has every right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by
this situation.''
   Bush's bill, the largest government bailout in history, would
spend $285 billion over 30 years _ $157 billion from taxpayers _ to
protect S&amp;L depositors, according to the congressional General
Accounting Office. It also proposes a series of changes designed to
prevent the most serious financial crisis since the Depression from
recurring.
   In addition to requiring S&amp;Ls to risk more capital, the bill
reorganizes the regulatory bureaucracy to give the administration
greater control over S&amp;Ls and it provides money to the Justice
Department to prosecute fraud at thrift institutions.
   The Senate passed its own version of the bill in April and
congressional aides expect a conference committee to take at least
until mid-July to resolve differences between the two chambers.
   On Wednesday, the House voted 330-95 to adopt procedures limiting
debate on the bill to 15 amendments, including measures that would:
   _Forbid S&amp;Ls from investing in junk bonds.
   _Strengthen the law prohibiting banks and S&amp;Ls from
discriminating against poor and minority neighborhoods.
   _Delete a provision requiring the industry-owned Federal Home
Loan Banks to subsidize housing for poor people.
   A few members objected to the decision by the
Democratic-controlled Rules Committee to prohibit a vote on an
amendment offered by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who wants to delete
provisions granting special exemptions to individual institutions
and companies.
   ``There's pork in there,'' warned Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa.,
ticking off a list of companies that succeeded in winning
concessions, including such well-known names as Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co.; Merrill Lynch; and Chemical Bank.
   ``This is wrong,'' agreed Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``This is
the Congress of the United States at its worst.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Back Bill to Limit Foreign Ownership of Cable Companies</HEAD>

   Chinese governmental action to control
television coverage of citizen protests in China was raised Thursday
as a reason to limit foreign ownership of cable companies in the
United States.
   ``I am not troubled to know that, here in our nation's capital,
the Chinese government could continue its control of a fashionable
restaurant,'' Andrew Jay Schwartzman, executive director of Media
Access Project, told a House subcommittee. ``I would be troubled if
that regime, or persons subject to its domination, owned and
operated Channel 4 or D.C. Cable.''
   His opinion was echoed by witnesses supporting legislation
sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., that would limit foreign
ownership of cable companies in this country to 20 percent.
   Such restrictions already exist in other facets of the industry,
such as broadcast stations and common carrier properties.
   Markey said his bill would close a loophole opened when cable
television grew into the method by which 80 percent of American
homes receive TV programs.
   ``This is not a question of protectionism, but of national
interest and national security,'' he said.
   ``The recent Chinese experience most clearly illustrates the
power television has in informing and educating a nation, and the
important role of the electronic media serve in facilitating the
free flow of information,'' he said.
   Those opposed to the bill said it was unnecessary and would not
only hurt foreign cable companies already operating here but also
encourage retaliation against U.S. business abroad.
   Former Federal Communications Commissioner Robert E. Lee said
there was ample authority in federal law to seize property of aliens
in time of war.
   ``Also consider the two biggest issues facing our economy today _
the twin deficits of budget and trade,'' he said. ``The complicated
trade deficit appears to have shown some slight improvement recently
but every foreign investment that is made in this country helps to
ease that problem.''
   In opposition to the bill, a letter from former Secretary of
Commerce Elliot Richardson, who now heads the Association for
Foreign Investment in America, was submitted to the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which held
the hearings.
   ``Sectoral restrictions on foreign investment not only undermine
the traditional U.S. policy to reduce barriers to international
investment, but also encourage retaliation against United States
business abroad,'' he said.
   Markey, who introduced the bill Wednesday, said additional views
would be gathered before action is taken on the measure.
   ``My view is that we can construct something that makes some
sense,'' he said.

   Stock prices finished mostly lower Thursday on the
back of early losses on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost 4.0
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,129.6. The index spent most of
the day in positive territory, rising a maximum 9.6 points shortly
after the opening.
   The Financial Times 30-share index also was down 4.0 points at
1,758.9 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 2.07
points to close at 1,214.00.
   Volume picked up sharply to 593.4 million shares, boosted by a
moderately large program trade early in the day. By comparison,
there were 467.6 million shares traded Wednesday.
   The market opened on a buoyant note, with continued buying
interest with speculation running high that U.S. trade figures would
show a narrowing of the trade deficit.
   The U.S. trade deficit did narrow in April _ to $8.26 billion
from $9.54 billion in March. But since the figures, announced at
midday local time, were in line with economists' forecasts, equities
showed little response.
   What pulled support out from under the market was a disheartening
performance on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average
was down nearly 20 points as London trading came to a close.

   The theft of an ultra-secret computer
code used to design Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh is being
investigated by federal authorities and the Santa Clara County
district attorney's office, it was reported Thursday.
   The San Francisco Examiner quoted an unidentified source close to
Apple as saying federal officials had joined the probe, but Apple
spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur confirmed only that local prosecutors
were involved in the case.
   ``Any details regarding the investigation are confidential until
we have identified an individual,'' she said.
   Floppy disks with the code, which is supposed to be restricted to
a small number of Apple employees, have been sent to various people
along with a letter signed by the ``New Prometheus League.''
   The name stems from the Greek Titan who stole fire from heaven
and gave it to man. Prometheus was later chained and tortured by
Zeus for the theft.
   Apple officials have said the code is the basis of the company's
``intellectual property,'' and they will seek to have the pirates
prosecuted.

<HEAD>Reilly Predicts Long, Expensive Effort to Clean Toxic Waste Dumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Environmental Protection Agency
predicted on Thursday that a long, expensive effort will be needed
to clean the nation's toxic waste dumps and he suggested the public
may have expected too much of the cleanup drive begun nine years ago.
   ``There's no magic wand that I can wave to make this problem go
away,'' EPA Administrator William Reilly told a Senate subcommittee.
   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that states may be
required through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning up
hazardous waste sites targeted under the Superfund law.
   The justices decided that the Constitution gives Congress the
power to strip state governments of their immunity from private
lawsuits. The decision will force Pennsylvania to defend itself
against a suit by Union Gas Co. aimed at recovering cleanup costs
the company owes the federal government.
   In his testimony to a Senate panel dealing with Superfund
matters, Reilly outlined an internal EPA report that suggested
cleaning up the nearly 1,200 toxic sites on the current cleanup
schedule will cost at least $30 billion and not be completed until
into the next century. By then, another 1,000 sites are expected to
be singled out for decontamination, possibly costing just as much,
according to EPA estimates.
   Reilly listed changes he plans for his agency's toxic cleanup
program, including giving more emphasis on increased enforcement to
force polluters _ and not the government _ to clean the waste dumps.
   Reilly noted that Congress so far has provided nearly $10 billion
for the Superfund program but that cleanup has been completed in
only a handful of sites.
   In separate testimony, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said the latest EPA figues show that
of the nearly 1,200 toxic dumps on the decontamination list, actual
cleanup has been completed on only 41 sites and begun on another 204.
   Reilly said that, because of money and manpower shortages, often
a choice must be made between ``either complete cleanup at some
sites, or incremental cleanup at many sites.''
   ``Even if more funds were available ... EPA lacks sufficient
expert staff and the nation doesn't have enough qualified engineers
to take on a full-scale effort at all sites simultaneously,'' Reilly
continued.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., subcommittee chairman, lauded
Reilly for some of the changes he envisions in the Superfund
program, including focusing more on taking polluters to court to
force them to clean up contaminated sites.
   As part of new emphasis on enforcement against polluters, the EPA
will shift $75 million from accounts used to hire outside cleanup
contractors and use it to hire 500 additional lawyers and cleanup
site supervisers.
   The EPA chief promised the agency would use ``all the enforcement
tools at its disposal'' in the enforcement actions including the
threat of seeking treble civil damages from polluters. The clear
threat of legal action ``will create a better environment for
settlement,'' he said.
   At the Supreme Court, Justice William J. Brennan, writing the
court's main opinion, said the Superfund law ``renders states liable
in money damages in federal court,'' and added that ``Congress has
the authority to render them so liable when legislating pursuant to
the (Constitution's) Commerce Clause.''
   He was joined fully by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens and, in part, by Justice Byron R.
White.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to dismiss the suit
against Pennsylvania. They said the state's immunity should prevail.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese officials disagreed Thursday on
whether their talks on elimination of Japanese market barriers this
week fell under the ``Super 301'' clause of the 1988 trade act.
   Japanese officials said they repeated to their American
counterparts their refusal to negotiate under the clause, which
provides for penalties for nations that do not agree to open their
markets within 18 months.
   The high-level trade talks, which ended Wednesday, were the first
since Japan was named a ``priority'' nation last month under the
trade act because of its alleged restrictions on U.S. satellites,
supercomputers and forestry products.
   U.S. and Japanese officials said they had agreed in the talks to
focus in the future on eliminating ``structural'' barriers, such as
Japan's complex distribution system and the United States' low
savings rate, that thwarted attempts to reduce the huge bilateral
trade imbalance.
   ``We have a large trade deficit with Japan that has not responded
to the dollar-yen changes in ways that we thought were
appropriate,'' said Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack, who
led the U.S. delegation.
   ``It is very important that we seek ways to increase American
exports to this country and deal with some of the structural
impediments that we feel are hindering those exports.''
   Trade friction between the two nations flared last month after
the United States charged Japan with unfair trading practices. But
officials from both sides, in separate briefings for reporters
Thursday, said this week's talks emphasized cooperation.
   ``We will not go into negotiations with the understanding there
will be retaliation if no successful resolution can be found,'' said
Mitoji Yabunaka, director of the Foreign Ministry's Second North
American Division. ``It's their law, and doesn't bind Japan at all.''
   But U.S. officials said they interpreted this week's trade talks
as a first step in the negotiations required under the ``Super 301''
provision.
   ``We do consider the discussions ... to be consultations within
the context of our Trade Act,'' said Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Linn Williams.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost met Thursday with
Ryutaro Hashimoto, secretary general of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
   Hashimoto pledged Japan would do its best to solve trade problems
but criticized the U.S. decision to invoke the ``Super 301'' clause
against Japan, saying, ``We don't like to negotiate with a pistol
pointed at us,'' Kyodo News Service reported.

   In an unusual move that has embittered
current and former employees, Goldome bank has threatened to cut the
severance pay of laid-off workers if they talk to the media about
losing their jobs.
   As many as 150 people have been terminated in recent weeks and
asked to sign a ``Release and Confidentiality Agreement,'' according
to sources within the company.
   The agreement prevents ex-workers from suing Goldome or
discussing their layoff with anyone except ``counsel, personal tax
advisor, immediate family or as required by law.''
   If laid-off employees refuse to sign, their severance benefits
will be cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six.
   Although many companies require new employees to sign
confidentiality agreements, it is highly unusual for a company to
require terminated employees to sign such an agreement as a
condition of receiving severance pay.
   ``It's not illegal, but I wouldn't consider it morally right,''
said an analyst with Mercer, Meidinger and Hansen, a leading human
resources consulting firm in Washington.
   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers have signed the
agreement, sources said.
   Goldome, one of the nation's leading thrifts, lost $119 million
last year and is in the middle of a restructuring effort led by new
chief executive officer Thomas Cooper.
   Goldome officials have refused to discuss the layoffs or the
confidentiality agreement. A bank spokeswoman said Thursday the
company had a longstanding policy of not discussing employee matters.
   Sources within the company said management thinks news of
Goldome's layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from the
bank.
   The new confidentiality requirement comes after the company
reduced its severance policy May 1. Companies are not required by
law to provide any severance pay, but most offer it as part of a
benefits package to attract qualified employees and as a
humanitarian gesture.

   Wheat futures prices slipped Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while corn and soybeans closed mixed on
profit-taking after two straight days of sharp gains.
   Slack export demand and expectations for a weekend of good
harvest weather in the Great Plains weighed on the wheat market.
   Corn and soybean trading was choppy and notably quieter than in
Wednesday's session, when a 30-day National Weather Service forecast
for warmer and drier-than-normal conditions in the Midwest sparked
the strongest one-day rally in nearly 10 months.
   Selling in both the corn and soybean markets was offset by buying
linked to Wednesday's National Weather Service six-to-10-day
outlook, which predicted warmer, drier weather in the Corn Belt next
week, and to weakness in the dollar, which could encourage foreign
purchases of U.S. grain.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94\ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.59\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to
} cents lower with July at $1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents
lower to 10 cents higher with August at $7.01 a bushel.

<HEAD>EEC Chief Says European Nations Split On U.S. Debt Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe's leaders are divided over whether to
endorse a U.S. plan for easing the debt of Third World Countries, a
top European trade official said Thursday.
   Failure by prosperous European nations to support the plan could
undermine the package proposed last March by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady for reducing by 20 percent the debt owed by the 39
largest debtor nations.
   The U.S. plan will be one of several major topics of conversation
at the summit of the world's seven leading industrialized nations to
be held in Paris next month, said Jacques Delors, President of the
Commission of the European Communities.
   President George Bush is hoping to win approval for the package
and consolidate the success of his new administration's other major
foreign policy initiative _ the proposal adopted earlier this month
by NATO to reduce superpower troops and weapons in Europe.
   Delors, who met with Bush on Wednesday, said the 12-nation
European organization is trying to reach agreement on its position
so that it can present a united front at the Paris summit. The EEC
takes part in the annual summits as the eighth participant, and four
of its members _ Britain, France, Italy and West Germany _ also take
part individually.
   ``There is a different approach'' among the EEC members, Delors
told reporters. ``I'm not sure we'll succeed'' in reaching a
consensus, he added.
   The leaders of the EEC are meeting in Madrid later this month to
discuss a compromise being fashioned by the host nation, Spain,
other EEC officials said.
   Chief among the European detractors of the Brady plan appear to
be Britain and West Germany, whose approach is ``more
conservative,'' said an EEC official who spoke on condition he not
be named.
   The British and Germans are concerned about the plan because they
view it as a bailout of the large commercial banks which hold much
of the estimated $370 billion debt, said the official.
   The U.S. proposal encourages the banks to voluntarily forgive a
portion of the debt burden in return for guarantees that the rest of
the money will be repaid. Those guarantees are to be provided by the
151-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister organization,
the World Bank.
   Banks have so far been lukewarm to the plan, saying the
guarantees offered by the World Bank and IMF are insufficient.
Critics of the plan say wealthy governments should offer additional
guarantees.
   Brady was in Europe earlier this month, seeking to enlist the
support of governments and international bankers.
   The Brady plan could suffer another setback if its first phase _
negotiations under way in New York between Mexico and its debtor
banks _ remain deadlocked. Bush had hoped to have the agreement
ready as a model to be presented to his fellow leaders in Paris.

   Assets of the nation's 467 money market mutual
funds rose $2.80 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $317.26 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $1.78 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group. The previous week's
   The funds' assets hit their previous record high of $314.45
billion in the week ended June 7. That total was revised Thursday
from the originally reported record total of $314.48 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $562.6 million to $102.15
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.15 billion to
$134.19 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose $1.09
billion to $80.91 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.94 percent from 9.08 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 9.08 percent from 9.12 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 39
days, up from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.57 percent as of Wednesday from 6.60 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.93
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.06 the
previous week. Yields were 9.00 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.15 percent; 8.82 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.98 percent;
and 8.75 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.90 percent.

   The stock market moved sharply lower today,
pressed down by weakness in bond prices and futures-related selling.
   A setback for bonds spilled over into the stock market, analysts
said. Today's weakness in the credit market, which recently has
rallied on rising optimism that a robust dollar would attract
foreign investors, coincided with a steep slide in the dollar.
   Wall Street analysts also said trading maneuvers related to
stock-index futures contributed to the selloff. Stocks are being
sold ahead of Friday's ``triple witching hour'' when stock-index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks expire.
   Analysts detected little reaction to a Commerce Department report
showing the country's merchandise trade deficit fell to $8.26
billion in April.
   The improvement in the trade balance was largely expected but
economists are doubtful the deficit will continue to shrink due to
the recent strength of the dollar, which makes American exports more
expensive for foreign buyers.
   Evidence of slower economic growth didn't evoke much of a
response in the stock market either.
   The Federal Reserve reported that the operating rate for U.S.
factories, mines and utilities dropped in May to 83.8 percent, down
0.3 percentage point from the previous month. The Fed also reported
that the pace of industrial production held steady in May.

<HEAD>Tyson May Raise Bid For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. may raise its bid to acquire
Holly Farms Inc. after a judge denied its latest effort to block the
merger of Holly Farms and ConAgra Inc., a Tyson spokesman said
Thursday.
   A Delaware Chancery Court has denied Tyson's request to block
ConAgra Inc.'s $1.3 billion stock offer for Holly Farms. The action
clears the way for shareholders of ConAgra and Holly to vote on the
merger proposal.
   Judge Maurice Hartnett on Wednesday also denied Tyson's bid to
force Holly Farms to redeem its poison-pill anti-takeover defense.
   James Blair, Tyson's general counsel, said Thursday that one of
his company's options is to increase its bid for Holly Farms of
Memphis, Tennessee.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., has offered $63.50 a share in
cash, or $1.1 billion for Holly Farms.
   In a flurry of activity that began May 19, directors of ConAgra
and Holly Farms approved a new merger agreement that calls for Holly
Farms shareholders to receive 2.1 shares of ConAgra stock for each
of their Holly Farms shares.
   Based on ConAgra's mid-day Thursday price of $32.625 per share,
each Holly share would be worth $68.51.
   In his decision, Hartnett said, ``I find that although the
directors of Holly Farms have consistently favored ConAgra in the
bidding between ConAgra and Tyson Foods for Holly Farms, their (the
directors) acceptance of ConAgra's latest proposal on May 20 was in
the best interests of the shareholders of Holly Farms ...''
   The judge said that Tyson wouldn't be harmed if he allowed
shareholders of ConAgra and Holly Farms to vote.
   ``Tyson Foods is also free to make a new enhanced offer which
might be accepted by the stockholders of Holly Farms,'' Harnett said.
   The judge said he isn't convinced that the bidding process is
over. ``The record indicates that Tyson may have the wherewithal to
make an improved bid for Holly Farms,'' Harnett said. ``Don Tyson
(Tyson's chief executive officer) stated as much in his March 5
deposition when he stated that Tyson has not yet made its highest
offer.''
   In ruling to leave Holly Farms' ``poison pill'' intact, Hartnett
said there was no assurance Holly and ConAgra shareholders would
uphold the latest merger proposal and he said Tyson might be able to
buy enough Holly stock to block it.
   Walt Casey, ConAgra's vice president of corporate communications,
said his company was pleased with the decision. He said ConAgra
hopes to have its shareholder meeting by the end of July. Holly's
shareholders would meet at the same time.

<HEAD>Hog Futures Climb On Hopes For Stronger Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog futures prices climbed Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid expectations for stronger pork demand late this summer
due to an anticipated tightening of beef supplies.
   On other markets, oil futures prices rose; precious metals were
higher; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Hog futures settled .05 cent to .90 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in June at 47.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .10 cent to 1.50 cents higher with July at 34.30 cents a pound;
live cattle were .15 cent to .35 cents higher with June at 71.42
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .52 cent higher with
August at 80.97 cents a pound.
   The contract for August delivery of hogs posted the sharpest
gain, .90 cent, at least partly on expectations that consumers will
be looking to buy more pork in August because beef prices are likely
to rise.
   The prediction is based on anticipation that Friday's 7-state
cattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture Department _ a monthly
tally of the cattle being fattened for slaughter in the seven
largest producer states _ will show about a 15 percent decline in
May feedlot placements compared to last year.
   If a smaller number of cattle were placed on feedlots this past
May than were placed a year earlier, the number of cattle ready for
slaughter by mid-summer will also be smaller than the previous year.
   Analysts expect Friday's report to show fewer placements because
of relatively large placements earlier this year due to dry pasture
conditions in the West.
   ``We're looking for tighter supplies of beef down the road, and
that creates demand for competitive meats, such as pork,'' said Paul
Georgy, president of Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Cattle futures prices advanced moderately in line with firmer
cash prices in cautious trading ahead of Friday's cattle-on-feed
report.
   Crude-oil futures finished higher but well below the day's highs
on the New York Mercantile Exchange on signs of tightening supplies
of the U.S.-produced crudes that give the highest gasoline yields.
   ``Each day there is becoming less and less of the light, sweet
crude oil in the mid-continent,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy
analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Beutel said the low oil prices of the mid-1980s discouraged
domestic oil exploration, so supplies of popular domestic crudes
such as West Texas Intermediate are relatively low.
   West Texas crude for July delivery climbed as high as $21 a
barrel Thursday but settled at $20.57, a gain of 34 cents from the
previous session. Other crude contracts settled 17 cents to 26 cents
higher. Heating oil was .36 cent to .70 cent higher with July at
46.26 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .12 cent to .48 cent
lower with July at 59.44 cents a gallon.
   A sharp drop in the dollar's value against major foreign
currencies gave precious-metals prices a boost on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $3.20 to $4.10 higher with August at $370.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 5 cents to 6.1 cents higher with July at $5.33 a
troy ounce.
   Wheat futures prices slipped on the Chicago Board of Trade while
corn and soybeans finished mixed on profit-taking after two straight
days of sharp gains.
   Slack export demand and expectations for a weekend of good
harvest weather in the Great Plains weighed on the wheat market.
   Selling in both the corn and soybean markets was offset by buying
linked to Wednesday's National Weather Service six-to-10-day
outlook, which predicted warmer, drier weather in the Corn Belt next
week, and to weakness in the dollar, which could encourage foreign
purchases of U.S. grain.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 5\ cents lower with July at $3.94\ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.59\ a
bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with July at $1.66{ a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 9 cents higher with July at
$7.34 a bushel.

<NOTE>Eastern Flight Riddled with Safety Problems, Pilots Say</NOTE>
<NOTE>With BC-Eastern-Maintenance</NOTE>
<NOTE>By MARCY GORDON</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP Business Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I have thanked God that I am alive today. If
air crew members cannot get better support than we had on this
flight, I feel we should tender our operating certificate to the
FAA.''
   That was the verdict of John Rosser, second officer on Eastern
Airlines' Flight 9 from Miami to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on Aug. 4, 1988
_ a flight pilots describe as a brush with death of which the 295
passengers were unaware.
   The regularly scheduled three-hour trip in a Lockheed L-1011
TriStar illustrates what many Eastern pilots call the range of
maintenance problems that have plagued the airline. The safety
question has emerged as an element in the pilots' union decision to
honor a strike by mechanics that began March 4.
   A copy of the Flight 9 pilots' report, an internal document of
the Air Line Pilots Association, was obtained by the Associated
Press. The report gives the impression that nearly everything that
could go wrong did.
   Eastern declined to comment on the Flight 9 report. The FAA,
which is monitoring Eastern's compliance with maintenance
procedures, also declined to comment. Officials at both the airline
and the federal agency had been informed of the incident, the pilots
say.
   As outlined in the pilots' account, one of three electrical
generators on Flight 9 wasn't working. One of three air conditioners
was defective, creating cabin temperatures near 100 degrees
Fahrenheit. The temperature gauge for one engine turbine had been
reported as inoperative several times over the previous four months.
   The Omega long-range navigation system, required by federal
regulations for flying over water, was found unreliable when checked
against other navigating devices aboard. The flight recorder, or
``black box,'' was inoperative. The fuel gauge was inaccurate.
   Those deficiencies, the pilots contended, should have been
corrected before the flight but were superficially patched or passed
over in a rush to get off the ground.
   In addition, human error saddled the plane with around 15,000
pounds of extra fuel in the wing tanks, making the right wing
heavier than the left, the report charged.
   A faulty count recorded 200 passengers instead of 295, and the
crew was short 50 meals.
   According to the Flight 9 report entry by Bill Homer, 53, a
30-year Eastern veteran who captained the plane, his inspection of
the maintenance log before takeoff from Miami showed the turbine gas
temperature system hadn't been repaired despite several reports.
   Homer told his supervisor Mike Vaughn, Eastern's chief pilot,
that he wouldn't fly the aircraft because he considered it unsafe.
   Homer quoted Vaughn as responding that he ``didn't like his
attitude''.
   The first officer on the flight, Glyn Taylor, also told Vaughn he
felt the plane was unsafe and would put the crew under too much
stress to fly. Taylor said he was suffering from stress and high
blood pressure because of the situation.
   Vaughn ordered Taylor to report to Eastern's medical facility for
a psychiatric evaluation. He later took medical leave, according to
Homer's report.
   Another first officer was called to replace Taylor. Meanwhile,
the flight had been scheduled to leave Miami at 1:15 p.m. EDT but
was delayed for hours by the inspection check and the encounters
between the pilots. The new first officer arrived at around 7 p.m.
and the flight departed around 7:30.
   Fifteen minutes later, Homer recounted in the report, he realized
the fuel gauge was inaccurate and the plane was carrying 15,000
pounds of extra fuel because of a faulty calculation by ground
staff. At that point, a flight attendant entered the cockpit and
informed Homer that they were 50 meals short. When Homer replied
that there were only 200 passengers aboard, the attendant said there
were 295.
   The extra fuel and 95 passengers created a weight problem for the
TriStar. Homer decided he must make a careful, overweight landing in
Guayaquil and ruled out the options of dumping fuel or returning to
Miami.
   An overweight landing involves increased landing speeds with
unusual stress on the landing gear and tires, the report notes.
   After delicate procedures and visual checks of the wing flaps,
Homer landed safely in Guayaquil. He refused to fly the next
scheduled leg of the flight to Quito.

<HEAD>Important Dates in Drexel Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the investigation
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its high-yield bond trader
Michael R. Milken:

Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with the government's investigation and surrenders $11.6
million in illicit profits and restitution.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information
supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate
with investigators in a much broader investigation of Drexel and its
chief financier, Michael Milken.
   Feb. 20, 1987 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and
fined $362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and
perjury.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving his sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   July 5 _ Dennis Levine is released from Lewisburg, Pa., federal
prison facility to serve the remainder of his term at a halfway
house in Manhattan.
   Aug. 4 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the investment
concern Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel trader over
an alleged multimillion dollar fraud and racketeering scheme, the
first-ever racketeering charge against securities professionals.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky. rexel and the others deny the accusations.

of a dispute over the impartiality of the presiding judge, Milton
Pollack.
   Nov. 15 _ A three-member panel of the appeals court rejects the
bid to dismiss Pollack.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle what became
the biggest securities fraud probe in history. Under the settlement,
Drexel must also settle the related SEC litigation and cooperate in
the government's pursuit of other alleged wrongdoers.
   Jan. 25, 1989 _ The government files formal charges against
Drexel, publicly detailing for the first time the accusations to
which it will plead guilty. Most are related to the firm's alleged
relationship with Boesky.

plea agreement on the grounds it violates his rights by forcing
Drexel to fire him and withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay.

formation of his own consulting firm that will not trade any
securities.

   Stock prices took a pounding Thursday, hit by
futures-related selling programs plus plunges in bond prices and the
dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 28.36 to 2,475.00.
   Losers swamped gainers in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,078 issues down, 444 up and 466
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.48 million
shares, up from 170.54 million in the previous session.
   Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said computer-driven program trading manuevers ahead of
Friday's ``triple witching hour'' accentuated the selloff.
   Stocks were sold in preparation for the so-called triple witching
hour, something that occurs once each quarter when stock-index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks expire. Wall
Streeters expect trading volume to be heavy Friday as investors
adjust their positions in stocks and futures.
   A setback in the credit market acted as a catalyst for the stock
selling. The 30-year Treasury bond dropped about 1{ points, or $15
for every $1,000 in value. The bond's decline coincided with a steep
slide in the dollar.
   Bond traders previously had been buying amid optimism that the
dollar's recent strength would draw foreign money into U.S.
investments.
   Wachtel said the market declines were unsurprising.
   ``I guess we just got a case of tired blood,'' he said. ``The

excess.''
   ``When you begin to see days when you have over 1,000 declines,
you know you're tuckered out,'' he said in reference to the number
of shares that lost value on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.
   Stock analysts detected little direct reaction to a Commerce
Department report showing the country's merchandise trade deficit
fell to $8.26 billion in April from March's deficit of $9.54 billion.
   Evidence of slower economic growth didn't evoke much of a
response in the stock market either.
   The Federal Reserve reported that the operating rate for U.S.
factories, mines and utilities dropped in May to 83.8 percent, down
0.3 percentage point from the previous month. The Fed also reported
that the pace of industrial production held steady in May.

   The dollar plummeted Thursday in a sharp reversal
of its recent rally, as traders who had been boosting the currency
started selling it in droves.
   Market watchers said there seemed to be no fundamental news to
account for the dollar's drop, which amounted to 2.5 percent or more
against the British pound, West German mark and Japanese yen.
   Instead, traders said the dollar appeared to have risen too far,
too fast in recent weeks and may have been ripe for a selloff by
speculators anxious to cash in their gains.
   ``It was just inevitable we would reach some level where there
were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage,''
said Bob Giordano, chief dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York.
   Some traders also said the dollar was hurt by weakness in the
bond market, which followed the government's report showing May
industrial production was stronger than expected, raising concerns
about resurgent inflation.
   The dollar sank 4 yen to about 145 Japanese yen and 5 pfennigs to
about 1.98 West German marks. The British pound rose 4 cents to
$1.55.
   For a number of weeks the dollar had been rising against major
foreign currencies, reaching levels not seen since 1987 or late 1986
in defiance of waves of dollar-selling by government central banks
trying to curb the rally.
   A rising dollar increases American buying power overseas but also
raises the cost of U.S. exports.

   Crude futures prices rose in active trading
Thursday, while refined petroleum products turned in a mixed
performance.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, advanced 34
cents to close at $20.57 a barrel after trading as high as $21 a
barrel. Contracts for delivery later in the year showed more modest
gains.
   Among refined oil products, unleaded gasoline prices fell on what
analysts said was a late bout of profit-taking. Unleaded gasoline
for July delivery fell 0.48 cent to finish at 59.44 cents a gallon,
while contracts for later delivery also declined.
   July heating oil rose 0.61 cent to 46.26 cents a gallon, pulled
up by crude prices, energy brokers said. The contract rose 1.07
cents in Wednesday's session.
   Analysts said there was little economic news to drive crude
prices higher. However, a change in the method of delivery of crude
oil to various customers had some investors worried.
   Traders said some customers who had been receiving WTI were
getting similar light, sweet crude that met their specifications but
was not WTI.
   ``What we're seeing is for some reason a bit of a panic on
delivery of spot crude,'' said Greg Dreis, a broker with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures. ``The contract just says it must be a sweet,
light crude, and some WTI is being replaced with foreign and other
oil.''
   Observers said that in some cases buyers who want only WTI are
being asked to pay extra for delivery.
   Analysts said July crude prices also were pushed higher by
investors buying before the contract expires on Tuesday.

   The dollar plummeted Thursday in what analysts
called the biggest single-day drop in years, as traders who had been
powering the currency's long rally suffered a sudden crisis of
confidence.
   Market watcheps said there was nn apparent fundamental news to
account for the dollar's drop, which amounted to 2.5 percent or more
against the British pound, West German mark and Japanese yen.
   Instead, traders said the dollar appeared to have risen too far,
too fast in recent weeks and may have been ripe for a selloff by
speculators anxious to cash in their gains.
   ``It was just inevitable we would reach some level where there
were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage,''
said Bob Giordano, chief dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York.
   Analysts say a market rally often breaks when market sentiment is
strongest that the advance is unstoppable, because there is no one
left to persuade and therefore no fresh cash available to enter the
market.
   The dollar sank 4 yen to about 145 Japanese yen and 5 pfennigs to
about 1.98 West German marks. The cost of a British pound rose 4
cents to $1.55.
   Andy Robertson, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, said
the dollar's single-day fall was one of the biggest he has seen
since he began trading currencies in 1980. Dealers said they could
not recall the date of the last biggep drop.
   Graspilg for explanations, some traders cited a Japanese news
report quoting unidentified sources saying the Bank of Japan would
continue to sell more than $1 billion a day in the open market if
necessary to restrain the dollar's recent rally.
   Weakness in the U.S. bond market also hurt the dollar, traders
said. Bonds fell after the government issued a report on May
industrial production that showed more economic strength than
expected, raising concerns about inflation.
   There were unconfirmed rumors that the Federal Reserve and other
central banks contri`uted to knocking the dollar down.
   The Commerce Department's report that the merchandise tpade
deficit fell to $8.26 billion in April initially drove the dollar
higher. Shortly after the trade figures were announced the dollar
touched 2.0475 West German marks and 151.85 yen while the British
pound fell to $1.4940 before the reversal began.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 3.25 yen to 151.30 yen, its highest level since
August 1987. Later in London, the dollar fell to 149.60 yen. In New
York the dollar fell to 145.40 yen from 149.45 late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5195 from $1.5143 late
Wednesday. In New York, sterling rose to $1.5510 from $1.5120 on
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9845 West German marks, down from
2.0374; 1.7095 Swiss francs, down from 1.7555; 1.1966 Canadian
doll`rs, down from 1.2001; 6.7390 French francs, down from 6.8945;
and 1,443 Italian lire, down from 1,470.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
ratds, included: 2.0235 West German marks, down from 2.0290; 1.7490
Swiss francs, down from 1.7525; 6.8680 French francs, down from
6.8690; 2.2915 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2805; 1,472.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,464.50, and 1.1993 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold and silver prices mostly were higher.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $367 a troy ounce from $363.80 on Wednesday.
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $366.80 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $361.70 on Wednesday.

   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 83 cents a troy ounce to close at

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in early June, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$2.3 billion to a seasonally-adjusted $776.0 billion in the week
ended June 5 from a revised $773.7 billion the previous week,
initially reported at $773.9 billion.
   The central bank said the money measure known as M2 rose $4.0
billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,080.1 billion from $3,076.1
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $6.8 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,963.3 billion from $3,956.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In announcing the latest figures, the Fed also said the May
declines of $9.7 billion in M1 and $8.3 billion in M2 were the
largest monthly declines in those measures in the 1980s.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,077.4 billion, a 1.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,954.9 billion, up 3.5 percent, while M1 fell
4.1 percent to an average of $779.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $471 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$464 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.3 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$289.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Strong Dollar: Possibly Good For Toyota Buyers, Bad For Kodak Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong dollar is good for buyers of Toyota
Camrys but bad for the people who make film for Eastman Kodak Co.
It's bad for foresters in the Northwest but good for wine buyers on
Park Avenue.
   For the nation as a whole, a strong dollar raises the likelihood
of a recession, economists say.
   The dollar has soared this year, causing reappraisals by everyone
from car-buying consumers to chief executives of the Fortune 500. A
rising dollar increases American buying power abroad and at home for
foreign-made goods, but also makes U.S. exports more expensive and
therefore less competitive.
   What's not clear is how long the dollar's rally will last. It
suffered a sharp setback on Thursday when a round of panicky selling
drove the currency down 2.5 percent against the British pound, West
German mark and Japanese yen.
   Thursday's steep drop raised the possibility that the long-term
downtrend in the dollar that began in early 1985 was reasserting
itself.
   ``If the downward trend were to be reestablished, this rally
would look like a little wart, or a bump on the side of a hill,''
said Christopher Probyn, a financial economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill
Inc.
   Before Thursday's drop the dollar had reached heights not seen
against various major currencies since 1987 or late 1986.
   If vacationers are any measure, most Americans have not changed
their behavior much yet in response to the dollar's rise. The
nation's biggest chain of travel agencies, Ask Mr. Foster Travel,
says the increase in bookings to foreign destinations has been
negligible.
   Buyers of imported cars are not seeing the benefit of the
dollar's strength yet, although Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. says it
will take the rise into account in August when it makes pricing
decisions on its 1990 models.
   ``It certainly takes the pressure off'' the need for price hikes,
said J.R. Olson, a Toyota spokesman. But he added, ``There's no
telling where the yen is going to be two months from now.''
   A bottle of white wine from Australia _ say, a Sutherland
semillon _ costs $9 now compared to $10 in early 1988 at Acker
Merrall &amp; Condit Co. in Manhattan.
   Employees and stockholders of companies such as Kodak and
Weyerhaeuser Co. that rely on exports are concerned about the
dollar's strength.
   Weyerhaeuser said the combination of the strong dollar and strong
customer demand in the past year has driven to $840 from $725 the
price per metric ton it charges in Europe for its Northern bleached
kraft pulp, which is used in making paper products.
   That could make it tougher to compete against rival Scandinavian
producers.
   For Kodak, ``We are concerned, let me put it that way,''
spokesman Henry Kaska said. ``It can affect our competitive
position.''
   ``There is a lag time of about a year before this starts catching
up with you. But we're concerned and we'll be increasingly concerned
if this upward trend doesn't reverse itself,'' he said.
   Thirty-four of 52 economists surveyed in early May by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., were counting on the dollar to
decline into 1990, helping the economy.
   In spite of that, two-thirds expected a recession later this year
or next year. If the dollar rises, that would increase the chance of
a recession, said Bob Eggert, editor of the survey.
   ``It is weakening the one area of the economy, trade, which has
the kind of strength necessary to keep the economy out of a
recession. So it's serious,'' said DRI's Probyn.
   At a time when the economy already is slowing, the dollar's
strength could be the fatal blow to the longest peacetime expansion
in U.S. history, one that dates to the fall of 1982.

   Unicorp Canada Corp., spurned last month in a bid
to buy Dunkin' Donuts Inc., took on a partner Thursday and launched
a $305.3 million hostile tender offer for the doughnut store chain.
   Unicorp and another Toronto-based firm, Cara Operations Ltd.,
offered $43 a share for Dunkin' Donuts, which has said it wants to
remain independent and set up a series of defensive steps.
   Dunkin' Donuts vice president and treasurer Richard N. Hart Jr.
said the company would have no comment on the latest offer.
   Dunkin' Donuts stock closed at $39.62{ a share in national
over-the-counter trading, unchanged from Wednesday's close.
   Unicorp, a real estate, banking and energy firm controlled by
Toronto investor George Mann, previously indicated it might try to
buy the doughnut chain on its own. Since December, it has built up a
12 percent stake in the company, which has 7.1 million shares
outstanding.
   Last month, Unicorp proposed a friendly $42-a-share, or $298.2
million, buyout that Dunkin' Donuts rejected.
   Unicorp and Cara, a food service company that has franchised more
than 500 restaurants, said their offer expires July 13 and is
conditioned on obtaining at least 75 percent of Dunkin' Donuts'
stock.
   Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, Mass., has franchised more
than 1,700 doughnut shops worldwide and reported profits of $13.5
million on sales of $112.8 million last year.
   After Unicorp's merchant banking arm, Kingsbridge Capital Group,
began buying large numbers of shares last spring, Dunkin' Donuts
began to shore up its takeover defenses, creating a ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan and an employee stock ownership plan.
   A poison pill enables a company to issue additional stock in the
event of a hostile takeover bid, driving up the cost of buying the
firm.
   Dunkin' Donuts also announced plans to repurchase 1.4 million
shares of its common stock and has sold 28,000 convertible preferred
shares for $28 million to General Electric Capital Corp.
   GE Capital is acting as a ``white squire,'' lending support to
Dunkin' Donuts management.
   The doughnut chain's moves are similar to the strategy Polaroid
Corp. used to defeat a hostile bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc. earlier
this year.
   Unicorp and Cara Operations filed suit Thursday in state court in
Delaware _ where Dunkin' Donuts is incorporated _ challenging the
employee stock plan, the stock buyback and the preferred stock sale.
Unless the suit is successful, securities analysts have said, the
bidders will have difficulty obtaining the 75 percent of the shares
required under the offer.
   ``I don't see how they can get 75 percent when management owns 15
percent, the employees have 15 percent and GE Capital has 10
percent,'' said Roger Lipton, an analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann in
New York.
   Lipton called the $43-a-share offer ``more than fair'' and said
Unicorp and Cara ``may live to rue the day'' they bid so much.
   ``They are taking a very big gamble in offering top dollar for a
franchise operation where relationships are so important,'' he said.
``This is not a manufacturing operation. It's a service business
where the relationship between management and the franchisees is
very meaningful.''
   Unicorp spokesman Eric W. Evans said the bidders believe they can
run Dunkin' Donuts successfully and expand its foreign operations
rapidly.
   ``Canada is very underdeveloped for Dunkin' Donuts, and worldwide
there is potential, too,'' he said.
   Unicorp took on a partner because Cara has expertise in the food
business, Evans said.
   ``Dunkin' Donuts itself has pointed out that Kingsbridge doesn't
have any operating experience in the food service industry,'' Evans
said. ``But Cara does.''
   Cara provides airline catering, runs duty free stores in 12
Canadian airports, and has two large franchised restaurant chains:
125 Swiss Chalet family restaurants in the United States and Canada
and 230 Harvey's hamburger restaurants in Canada. It reported sales
of $560 million last year.
   Unicorp is Canada's 15th largest company, with assets of $4.8
billion. It has three main businesses: natural gas distribution and
energy services; Lincoln Savings Bank in New York City and a U.S.
real estate portfolio; and merchant banking.

<HEAD>Coleco To Be Sold To Hasbro for $85 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc. agreed Thursday to
be bought by Hasbro Inc. for $85 million, marking the likely end of
the company that made the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the
Cabbage Patch Kids doll.
   Hasbro, the largest American toymaker, will receive all of
Coleco's product line, which includes Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games, as part of the all-cash deal, Coleco Chairman Morton Handel
said.
   The deal still must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, where Coleco, swamped with $540.3 million in debt, sought
protection from creditors a year ago. A hearing on the sale is
expected next week or in early July, Handel said.
   Avon-based Coleco is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million
shares of Hasbro stock as part of the deal. Hasbro, based in
Pawtucket, R.I., will get inventory, equipment to make products and
some accounts receivable.
   Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and
Coleco directors also must approve the deal, which must be completed
by July 17.
   If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's 250 employees are
expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by Hasbro,
Handel said.
   Coleco has about 75 salaried workers in Avon, 75 in Mayfield,
N.Y., and a total of about 100 assembly line workers at both
locations.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy analyst with Standard &amp; Poors
Corp. in New York. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Russian immigrant Maurice Greenberg founded the Connecticut
Leather Co. in 1932. The company expanded its leather and shoe
products line to toys in 1954 and its name was changed to Coleco in
1961.
   Analysts said Coleco ran into trouble after the phenomenal
success of the Cabbage Patch doll, which became the best-selling toy
of all-time with more than $600 million in sales in 1985.
   David Leibowitz, senior vice president of American Securities
Corp., said Coleco borrowed money to expand after the Cabbage Patch
success.
   But when Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products,
including Adams home computer and toys based on the Rambo movies,
did not sell, Coleco couldn't pay off the new debts, he said.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' Valentine said.
   Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and
Transformers, had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from just
$104.3 million in 1980. Hasbro in the last decade has bought
big-name companies including Milton Bradley Co. and introduced a
steady stream of new products.
   Hasbro Executive Vice President Barry Alperin said of the Coleco
deal: ``It means the acquisition of good, stable game products, like
Scrabble, Parcheesi and Aggravation ... and it's a good chance to
add to our toy division.''
   After the transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million
in cash, $85 million from Hasbro and about $65 million it had in
banks in mid-March, Handel said. The cash will be used to pay off
the company's debts, he said.
   Coleco also said it would retain some real estate assets, which
will be converted to cash.
   The companies also agreed that Hasbro will participate in Coleco
business operations up to the close of the transaction as part of a
management consulting agreement.

   The government said Thursday that the U.S trade
deficit narrowed dramatically to $8.26 billion in April, its lowest
level in nine months, but even the Bush administration is concerned
that the strong dollar could stunt future progress.
   April's deficit was down 13.4 percent from a revised March trade
gap of $9.54 billion, the Commerce Department reported. The
improvement reflected a 0.8 percent increase in exports, to a record
$30.57 billion, and a 2.6 percent drop in imports, to $38.84
billion, despite rising prices for foreign oil.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher hailed the report as evidence
of ``continued improvement in U.S. trade performance'' but he added
a note of caution.
   ``While the April data are encouraging, it is always unwise to
put too much weight on any one or two months' figures in these
volatile statitics,'' he said. ``The recent strength of the dollar
leads us to be concerned about the economy's ability to sustain the
excellent trends seen so far.''
   The Bush administration has been hoping for continued progress on
narrowing the trade gap to spur economic growth. Last year's big 21
percent drop in the trade deficit from an all-time high of $152.1
billion in 1987 accounted for nearly half of all U.S. economic
growth.
   Many analysts are concerned that the trade gap could start to
widen again due to the recent strength of the dollar, which makes
U.S. goods more expensive on overseas markets and imports cheaper
for American consumers.
   The dollar reversed path Thursday as traders who had been
boosting the currency started selling it heavily. The U.S. currency
dropped 2.5 percent or more against the British pound, West German
Mark and the Japanese yen.
   Traders said there was no fundamental news to account for the
drop and that it appeared instead the dollar's quick rise may have
made it ripe for a selloff by speculators anxious to cash in their
gains.
   ``It was just inevitable we would reach some level where there
were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage,''
said Bob Giordano, chief dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York.
   For the first four months of the year, the trade deficit was
running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, well below last year's
actual deficit of $119.76 billion. April's trade gap was the
smallest since an $8.02 billion deficit last July.
   ``So far this year we're going great guns,'' said economist Maury
Harris of PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``But eventually, this
higher dollar's going to eat into exports.''
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said that while U.S. businesses have improved their
competitive position in the world marketplace, ``we're not going to
hold on to that competitive position if the dollar continues to
rise.''
   However, William T. Archey, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said that with April's favorable report, worries about the
impact of the dollar on the trade deficit ``have been revealed as
exaggerations.''
   Analysts said the narrowing of the deficit so far this year, even
as foreign oil prices have marched upward, has been partly a
reflection of a general slowdown in an economy that is sucking in
fewer foreign goods.
   In another sign of a slowing economy, the Federal Reserve
reported Thursday that the operating rate for U.S. factories dropped
in May to 83.8 percent, down 0.3 percentage point from the previous
month. The Fed also reported that the pace of industrial production
held steady in May.
   Analysts said the easing of factory use could help relieve
inflationary pressures in the economy.
   On the trade front, imports fell in April to a seasonally
adjusted $38.84 billion, reflecting declines in sales of foreign
cars, manufactured capital goods and agricultural products.
   The dip occurred even though the bill for foreign oil jumped 9.9
percent to $4.05 billion. The average price of a barrel of oil shot
up 11.6 percent to $17.83 in April, the fifth straight monthly
increase.
   U.S. exports, meanwhile, hit a record $30.57 billion in April as
foreign sales of American-made industrial supplies, manufactured
capital goods and consumer goods all increased.
   As usual, the United States posted its largest trade deficit in
April with Japan. But the $3.89 billion gap was down sharply from
$4.22 billion in March.
   Other large deficits were recorded with Taiwan, $840 million;
South Korea, $545 million; Canada, $477 million; and Brazil, $365
million.
   The nation's trade picture was helped by a second straight
surplus with Western Europe. The surplus registered $232 million in
April and $397 million in March.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that a broader measure of
U.S. trade worsened dramatically during the first three months of
the year. The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current
account was 7 percent larger than in the final three months of 1988.
That deficit figure reflected improvement in merchandise trade but a
widening of the deficit in the services category.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Sale of LTV Steel's Bar Division to Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the
sale of LTV Corp.'s Ohio-based steel bar division to workers, a
company official said.
   The sale for approximately $220 million to a new Employee Stock
Ownership Plan corporation with headquarters in Massillon, Ohio,
still must be ratified by employees who are members of the United
Steelworkers of America, LTV spokesman Charles Palmer said.
   A new labor agreement now must be worked out between the
steelworkers union and the employee group, Palmer added.
   The sale was approved by Judge Burton R. Lifland of U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York, Palmer said.
   The sale agreement was announced May 30. Russell W. Maier,
current president of the bar operations, is to be the new company's
chief executive.
   At the time of the May 30 announcement, LTV Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Raymond A. Hay, said:
   ``The sale of the bar division will complete the divestitute of
steel operations identified for disposition as part of LTV's
long-range plan to emerge from Chapter 11 with a profitable but
down-sized steel company, concentrating on the flat rolled and
tubular business.''
   LTV said then that the 4,700 salaried, hourly and senior
management employees in the bar division would be offered employment
with the new company, which is projected to produce about 1.2
million tons of steel a year.
   Dallas-based LTV is a diversified manufacturing company involved
in steel, aerospace, defense and energy products.
   The division's steelmaking facilities in Canton, Ohio, provide
continuously cast and ingot-poured billets for hot rolling mills in
Canton and Massillon, Ohio, and Chicago.
   The Canton plant also provides steel to the division's cold
finished bar plants in Massillon; Gary, Ind.; Willimantic, Conn.;
and Beaver Falls, Pa.; as well as the division's special metals
plant in Canton, which produces alloy steel for aerospace and
defense applications.

   The decision, which came at a shareholders meeting in London, had

   The company said in a news release that under extreme pressure,
the pedal could become caught by a stopper that is covered by floor

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar opened sharply lower against the
Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rebounded strongly.
   The dollar started trading at 146.00 yen, down 5.30 yen from
Thursday's 151.30-yen close, the highest since mid-August 1987.
   Traders attributed the dollar's plunge to concerted
dollar-selling intervention by the U.S. and European central banks
overnight.
   The dollar surged shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department's
announcement Thursday morning that the nation's April trade deficit
was $8.26 billion, down from $8.9 billion in March. But then it
plunged in trading analysts said was driven by a lack of confidence
among investors.
   An analyst at the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar-yen rate was
fluctuating wildly, making it difficult to predict which direction
the trading would turn.
   ``The volatility is in part because of the Bank of Japan's
dollar-selling intervention,'' he added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The amount of dollars the central bank sold was unknown, he said.
The Bank of Japan makes no comments on its monetary activities.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 489.90 points Thursday, its largest one-day loss
this year, quickly picked up 267.17 points, or 0.82 percent,
rebounding to 33,180.26 within the first 15 minutes of trading.
   Stock dealers said the yen's surge in currency markets overnight
had reassured Japanese investors.
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 major issues
lost 28.36 points overnight following the dollar's plunge agaist
other major currencies.

of Milken's forfeiture.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, whose financial wizardry helped
reshape 1980s corporate America but also led to his indictment for
fraud and racketeering, resigned Thursday from Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to form his own business.
   During his 19-year career at Drexel, Milken widely was credited
with creating a $175 billion-a-year market in the low-cost
securities called junk bonds that turned Drexel from a Wall Street
also-ran into an investment powerhouse.
   But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers through
Drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes
with now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   It was unclear what the impact of Milken's departure would have
on the government's case or on Drexel, where Milken still commands
tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and many
Drexel clients.
   Milken's new consulting firm, International Capital Access Group,
will advise and assist companies seeking to raise money to start up,
expand or stay in business. It will not buy or sell securities,
people familiar with Milken's plans said.
   Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his March 29 criminal
indictment on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering. His brother,
Lowell, who also was charged in the case, announced Thursday he was
quitting the firm to return to practicing law.
   ``Drexel is the only company I've ever worked for since
graduating from college. And it's the only one I ever expected to
work for,'' Michael Milken said in a statement.
   ``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as
part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,'' he
said.
   Under a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission of insider trading and other charges, Drexel in May
agreed to sever ties with Milken and to bar its employees from
direct or indirect business dealings with him.
   ``Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel
Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad
event,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''
   Milken has been accused of insider trading in a separate SEC
lawsuit. No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in
that case.
   Milken, 42, joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from
the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1978, he
moved Drexel's entire junk bond division to Beverly Hills, Calif.,
and revolutionized the sale of the securities in the 1980s.
   Milken's aggressive sale of junk bonds _ previously used mainly
by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the decade's
corporate takeover mania by giving small- and medium-sized companies
and some corporate raiders a more accessible tool for financing
growth, mergers and takeovers.
   He also earned enormous sums. According to court papers, Milken
made more than $1 billion from 1983 to 1987, including $550 million
in 1987.
   The criminal securities and racketeering indictment against
Milken marked the pinnacle so far of the government's three-year
crackdown on Wall Street crime. A broader indictment of Milken also
is expected.
   Milken's trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan is set for
March 1990. Under the racketeering provisions, Milken faces up to
$1.85 billion in forfeited illegal profits. He would also be subject
to huge fines and a lengthy prison term if convicted. Milken is free
under a $700 million bond package.
   Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resign
may have been calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's
agreement with the SEC to dismiss him once its settlement is
approved by a federal judge.
   Approval has been delayed pending Milken's challenge to certain
provisions governing his employment status. But the Supreme Court
this month refused to hear Milken's case and the SEC and Drexel soon
are expected to ask U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack to ratify the
agreement.
   But with Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of
the Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges to the case.
They also are expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and
Milken from doing business with the same clients.
   People familiar with Milken's plans said his new firm has a
handful of employees and a temporary office in Los Angeles. No one
working for Drexel has been hired and the firm does not intend to
take people from Drexel, they said, but there could be defections.
   Milken's statement said his firm would provide ``advice and other
assistance to individuals, communities and companies'' and
``emphasize the creation of ownership opportunities for employees,
minorities and unions.''

<TEXT>
   G.D. Searle &amp; Co. has agreed to settle all
claims and lawsuits alleging injury from the use of Searle's Copper
7 contraceptive device that were brought by a law firm representing
over 100 such clients, a company spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Searle spokeswoman Kay Bruno said the agreement, which still
requires approval from the clients represented by the law firm of
Robins, Kaplan, Miller and Ciresi of Minneapolis, bars disclosure of
the terms and conditions of the settlement, including the number of
claims settled.
   Ms. Bruno confirmed the June 9 agreement in response to questions
from the media. She also said the settlement ``does not have a
materially adverse effect'' on the financial positions of Searle or
its parent, Monsanto Corp.
   Ms. Bruno said the settlement leaves about 350 other pending
Copper-7 lawsuits in state and federal courts.
   Women who brought lawsuits against the Skokie, Ill.-based
pharmaceutical concern contend the Copper-7, once one of the
nation's most widely prescribed intrauterine devices, caused pelvic
inflammations, ectopic pregnancies or perforation of the uterus, and
could result in infertility.
   Searle pulled the product from the market along with a second IUD
in January 1986, citing the high costs stemming from hundreds of
lawsuits. The company has maintained in court documents the product
``cannot cause the various injuries plaintiffs claim.''
   Ms. Bruno said: ``At last count, 330 cases involving the Copper-7
had been disposed of (prior to trial) in our favor. Of the 19 that
went to trial, we won 15 and lost four.
   ``Two of those are pending appeal and of the two completed, we
have paid a total of about $300,000,'' she added.
   Esther Kociemba, represented by the Minneapolis firm, was awarded
$8 million last year by a jury in St. Paul, Minn.
   It could not be determined whether that case was part of the
settlement. The law firm said previously that it represented more
than 100 people in such Copper-7 litigation.
   Michael Ciresi, who has been the firm's lead attorney in Copper-7
cases, did not return calls seeking comment left with his office.
   Attorney H. Robert Erwin Jr. of Baltimore, whose firm is handling
similar Copper-7 cases, said: ``Typically, IUD cases can range from
$10,000 if the causation is weak and the injury nominal to $250,000
or more if you have a young, married couple rendered childless due
to an infection from an IUD.''
   Erwin said his firm had not been similarly approached by Searle
about a settlement.

<HEAD>Eastern Announces Plans to Make $100 Million Pension Payment On Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike-crippled Eastern Airlines announced Thursday
it plans to pay about $100 million into employee pension plans by a
September deadline, but the payments first must be approved by a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
   Part of the Miami-based carrier's plan to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection include on-time payment to its seven pension
plans, the company said.
   Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy after Machinists union
members, pilots and flight attendants walked off the job March 4,
filed for deferral of the Sept. 15 payments before formally seeking
bankruptcy court approval.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the deferral request with the
Internal Revenue Service is a formality in case the bankruptcy court
does not approve the payment plan.
   Ashlock did not know when the bankruptcy court would rule on
Eastern's request.
   On June 1, Eastern reached an agreement with the U.S. Labor
Department to pay $3.1 million to several benefit plans to settle a
case in which the government alleged the carrier illegally tapped
employee funds to pay corporate expenses.
   Eastern entered into the agreement without admitting or denying
it violated federal pension laws.
   The Labor Department complaint alleged that beginning in 1977
Eastern paid some corporate expenses with pension plan assets and
insurance commissions earned by its employee welfare plans.

<HEAD>Inner-City Dock's Hits the High Seas of Fast-Food</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Qahhaar is CQ</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Eugene Qahhaar started Dock's takeout 15
years ago, he was just another black businessman peddling hot dogs
and hamburgers from a rundown storefront on the South Side.
   But since 1984, Qahhaar has taken on new partners, Dock's has
expanded to 17 outlets in this city and five more in Philadelphia,
and he has set his sights on becoming a major force in the fast-food
industry.
   What sets Dock's apart in the fast-food free-for-all is the fish
that anchors the menu _ dipped in a spiced batter concocted by
Qahhaar. It's not spicy-hot _ he calls the flavor ``continental.''
   Qahhaar and partners _ Dennis Robertson, president of Fishy
Things Inc., Dock's parent company, and Qahhaar's former landlord,
Joe Pecora _ hope to find a niche for Dock's in middle-class black
communities around the country before taking on a broader market.
   ``In the beginning, I did not set out to create an ethnic
business,'' said Qahhaar, whose partners are white. ``I wanted
something to apply across the board.''
   But Dock's started out in a black neighborhood and business was
booming, so they concentrated on that market, though the first
downtown, sit-down Dock's is to open in Chicago later this year.
   Four years ago, there were four Dock's. Last year, a surge of
growth brought 11 more to the Chicago area and put the fledgling
chain in Philly.
   Franchises, offered for the first time this year, make up three
of the 17 area outlets operating now, Robertson said.
   Within four years, the partners want 28 company-owned restaurants
and 40 franchise operations in such cities as Detroit, Cleveland and
St. Louis.
   Dock's takeout menu offers batter-fried fish sandwiches, fish and
chips, catfish and smelt _ as well as fried shrimp, seafood salad,
chowder, gumbo, cole slaw and onion rings. For dessert, sweet potato
pie, bean pie embellish the more routine offerings of cheesecake and
carrot cake.
   The fish sandwich, whiting fried in polyunsaturated oil, ``is
just sensational,'' Robertson said.
   Dock's orange-white-and-green shops have a 1950s flavor, with
portholes and roped timbers, a spouting-whale logo and the slogan,
``That great fish.''
   ``We don't go into standard buildings, so the colors are really
what alert the people,'' Robertson said, noting Dock's prefers to
rehabilitate abandoned inner-city stores and gasoline stations.
   Dock's owners have their work cut out for them, partly because
seafood can be a tricky menu item in the competitive fast-food
business. Most people still prefer burgers.
   ``Fish chains have had a bad time. Arthur Treacher's is an
example, although they are making somewhat of a comeback,'' said
Stuart Meyer, professor of policy and environment at Northwestern
University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
   But a distinctive product can make the difference.
   ``Offering something that is successful in one place makes it
easier to penetrate other markets, if it's really new,'' Meyer said.
   Dock's can make it with proper financial backing and a solid
management formula, Meyer said. If Dock's achieves success in the
inner city, the market will look more attractive to others.
   Qahhaar says he's sure he has a winner.
   Docks is expected to top $11 million in sales this year in the
city, up from $10 million in 1988, he said.
   The Philadelphia outlets, which did $1.9 million in sales last
year, are being franchised, Robertson said.
   While the partners have been approached about selling stock to
the public to raise money for more expansion, Robertson said, ``we
need to do some growing and proving this kind of success can be
replicated elsewhere.''
   Qahhaar, in his 40s, opened his first restaurant in 1973, selling
hot dogs and hamburgers. He named the place after his father, Dock
Meadows, an Alabama house painter. Qahhaar _ formerly Eugene Meadows
_ changed his own name when he converted to Islam.
   One night, a Muslim selling fish door to door offered him a good
deal if he'd buy 50 pounds of whiting. Business was poor, so he gave
it a try.
   ``I bought some spices and made up a recipe,'' said Qahhaar. ``I
made several batches of batter and the one I liked was the one I
kept.''
   The fish was gone in a week, but the customers who bought it kept
coming back.
   By 1975, Dock's was specializing in seafood, but Qahhaar was
having trouble making ends meet. Five years ago, despite a thriving
business, he was months behind in rent.
   His then-landlord, Pecora, introduced him to Robertson, then part
owner of several Sizzler restaurant franchises in area suburbs.
   Robertson remembers he didn't look forward to the meeting. He was
doing fine and had no desire to get involved in an inner-city
business.
   ``There was a great line of people outside waiting to get
served,'' he recalled. ``I said, `What does he need us for?' That's
when Joe revealed to me that he owed him a lot of money.''
   A cordial relationship developed, and the partnership in which
each controls a third of Fishy Things Inc. Robertson shed his other
business interests.
   Robertson concedes the inner-city locations could hold down
profits because of generally lower household incomes, but notes
there are advantages, including high population density and fewer
competitors.
   Property is cheaper, and there are plenty of rehab opportunities.
   Qahhaar says he's taken some heat for taking on partners, but has
few regrets.
   ``I look upon myself as a creative person. Administration is not
my strong suit. I struggled along for several years, not getting the
company to the point where I wanted to,'' he said.
   ``If you have to do things to make it stronger, to get more money
or better management skills, then you do it,'' Qahhaar said.
   Pecora handles real estate decisions and Robertson the business
end at Fishy Things headquarters in southwest suburban Willowbrook.
   ``When Robertson came aboard as a partner, he had a portfolio the
banks could respect,'' Qahaar recalled. ``We received banker
support, paid debts. A lot of problems were eliminated.''
