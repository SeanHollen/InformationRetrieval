   Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev could use the weekend summit to try to nudge President
Bush toward accords on the shape of Eastern Europe and on banning
nuclear weapons in the Mediterranean, a top Kremlin official hinted
today.
   ``The importance of achieving preliminary agreements on a host
of issues, including the Mediterranean and Europe, is of course
great and that is precisely the reason for our meeting,'' said
Valentin Falin, the head of the International Department of the
Soviet Communist Party.
   However, Falin, a former Soviet ambassador to West Germany
1971-78, said it was unlikely that any accords would issue from the
Malta summit, even though the superpower session could speed the
timetable for U.S.-Soviet accords on reducing nuclear, conventional
and weaponry.
   ``I think President Bush is right when he says there will be no
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting,'' said Falin.
   Bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms control
and that he was ``not going to surprise'' the Soviets with any
flashy proposals. The president also has said he will not discuss
Eastern Eurpopean boundaries with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, however, is known for doing the unexpected, and he
may try to pressure Bush into talks on naval power by proposing a
ban on nuclear weapons in the Mediterranean.
   U.S. officials have rejected Gorbachev's proposal to ban nuclear
weapons from the Baltic Sea and other regions, and have balked at
repeated Soviet efforts to open talks on naval arms control.
   Nevertheless, arms control is always on the summit table, and
analysts believe the Malta meeting may speed negotiations on
nuclear, chemical and conventional arms.
   ``It would seem like all the signs are pointing to quick
resolution,'' said James Rubin, assistant director of the Arms
Control Association of Washington. ``But a summit resolution to
move to completion to all three is the best we should hope for.''
   Gorbachev, in a joint statement Thursday with Italian leaders,
expressed hope for agreements by the end of 1990 to cut
conventional and chemical weapons _ and a third deal to sharply
reduce strategic arms stockpiles.
   Bush and Gorbachev have said that the next summit, to be held in
the United States next spring or summer, might be used to sign a
proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). This would slash
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads
per side.
   For the first time since Gorbachev sat down with then-President
Reagan in Geneva in 1985, the arms control agenda is not dominated
by the U.S. space-based missile shield proposal, otherwise known as
Star Wars, and that's a good omen for START.
   The Soviets said in September they were removing a major START
obstacle by dropping their precondition that the United States
agree not to violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
restricts strategic defenses.
   Instead, the Soviets have reserved the right to rearm if the
United States violates ABM by deploying Star Wars defenses.
   The Soviets also agreed to include submarine-launched cruise
missiles in a separate agreement rather than in START. The United
States has balked at curbing that class of weapons.
   In September, the United States also removed a major obstacle to
START, dropping its demand to ban mobile missiles. The Soviet Union
has deployed two such systems, the 10-warhead SS-24 and the
single-warhead SS-24.
   Congress has approved funding for two comparable U.S. weapons,
and the U.S. Air Force announced Wednesday that it was designating
sites to deploy 50 mobile versions of its 10-warhead MX missiles,
which have been housed in silos up to this point.
   On conventional arms, the Western and Eastern military alliances
have made steady progress in multilateral talks to sharply reduce
forces in Europe, with only one major issue dividing them, the
definition of an offensive aircraft.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization wants the Warsaw Pact to
cut 7,000 planes, versus a reduction of 1,000 for the West. But the
Kremlin says many of its planes, such as trainers, should not be
counted, and that NATO has an advantage of up to 3,600 aircraft.
   The two sides also have proposed different methods of counting
troops, with NATO seeking a limit of 275,000 deployed by either
superpower in Central Europe. The Warsaw Pact wants its proposed
ceiling of 300,000 to cover British and French troops in West
Germany. That would mean a reduction of about 30,000 U.S. troops in
Central Europe and 325,000 for the Soviets.
   Eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles may prove more
complicated, since 40 nations are involved in negotiations on a
global ban. But a bilateral deal to cut U.S. and Soviet chemical
arms may be easier.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The East German Parliament today voted
overwhelmingly to change the constitution and eliminate the
Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly on power, a major reform
demanded by the mass movement for democratic change.
   While at least five lawmakers voted to abstain, the rest in the
500-member People's Chamber appeared in a show of hands to approve
the change.
   It is the latest in a series of reforms announced since the
hard-line Communist government was ousted by mass protests on Oct.
18.
   The new Communist leadership bowed to continued pressure and an
exodus of citizens to the West on Nov. 9 when it opened its borders
and the Berlin Wall to allow free travel to the West.
   The vote on the constitutional change came as a surprise.
   Parliament speaker Guenther Maleuda opened the session 40
minutes late and announced that the party leaders had met to change
the agenda and put the issue of Communist domination as their first
order of business.
   There was no debate on the issue. The lawmakers broke into
applause after the vote.
   The Christian Democratic Union, one of the smaller parties that
had been allied with the Communists during the past 40 years,
proposed striking the constitution's designation of East Germany as
a ``socialist nation,'' but that motion failed to win the needed
two-thirds majority of votes.
   Only 112 deputies from among the 420 present voted in favor and
20 others abstained.
   Many Communists as well as opposition activists have called for
maintaining the socialist nature of East Germany and rejected West
German calls for reunification of the countries, divided after the
Nazi defeat in World War II.
   The leader of another small party, Guenter Hartmann of the
National Democrats, told East German television that all of the
party leaders agreed on the need to consider a constitutional
change involving the Communists' monopoly on power.
   East German politicians had been considering striking Article 1
from the constitution, which guarantees the Communists a ``leading
role.''
   Today's vote may have been spurred by the swift decision in
neighboring Czechoslovakia this week to also change the
constitutional provision guaranteeing the Communists a monopoly on
power.
   The Czechoslovak Parliament voted unanimously Wednesday to
repeal the constitutional designation of the Communists as the
leading force.
   Maleuda said at the start of the East German parliamentary
session that a simple two-thirds majority of the members' votes was
needed to change the constitution.
   Opposition groups had demanded such a revision, and even the
Communists have conceded they should give up the unfair advantage.
   ``This kind of change would be a good beginning,'' Hartmann told
East German television.
   The next step in advancing political pluralism will come
Thursday when the Communists sit down with opposition groups to
determine the nation's future course.
   The Parliament later debated a proposed law that would guarantee
all citizens the right to travel and provide for a way to supply
them with hard currency for trips to the West.
   But Finance Minister Uta Nickel told the chamber that the
exchange system was being delayed by ``considerable problems.'' She
said the government was not prepared to discuss a guaranteed
minimum exchange for private trips for at least another three weeks.
   The constitutional change temporarily took attention away from a
criminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by former East
German leader Erich Honecker and other ousted officials.
   ``The party must completely and decisively reject such misuse of
office to earn the trust of the people,'' Communist Party leader
Egon Krenz said on national television after the investigation was
announced Thursday.
   Honecker also was stripped of immunity from prosecution, and the
official news agency ADN reported that the country estates of
Honecker and his top associates were under tight security to
prevent removal of valuable or evidence.
   Krenz, who was considered a follower of Honecker's and a
hard-liner before he replaced his old mentor, faces widespread
opposition among pro-democracy activists as well as within the
party hierarchy, which is to meet in a special congress Dec. 15-17.
   Krenz said he hoped the disgraced officials could be brought to
justice before the party congress.
   He also contended he had never kept quarters at exclusive
hunting lodges set aside for the party elite.
   An internal party inquiry was announced a week ago into reported
wrongdoing by Honecker, his deputy Guenter Mittag and other top
Communists.
   Mittag was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitive
action against any ousted official.
   Opposition activists accuse party leaders during Honecker's
18-year regime of lining their pockets while the national economy
faltered.
   Honecker, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster six
weeks ago. He is reported to be seriously ill.

   Lynn Bari, an actress who appeared in
dozens of low-budget Hollywood films during the Depression years,
has died.
   Miss Bari died Nov. 20 at Goleta Valley Community Hospital,
Daily Variety reported Thursday. The cause of death was listed as
cardiac failure.
   Hospital officials said she listed her age as 69, but film
anthologies show she was born in either 1913 or 1915.
   The husky-voiced siren appeared in nearly 50 movies, mostly in
the '30s and '40s. Her credits include ``Dancing Lady,'' in which
Fred Astaire made his screen debut, ``Sun Valley Serenada'' and
``Orchestra Wives.'' She also had a role in ``The Bridge of San
Luis Rey.''
   Miss Bari made her final picture, ``The Young Runaways,'' in
1968. She also appeared in two short-lived television series in the
50s, ``Detective's Wife'' and ``Boss Lady.''
   She was born Marjorie Fisher in Roanoke, Va.
   The actress retired to the Santa Barbara area to be near her
son, John, who was the object of a stormy custody fight between
Miss Bari and her second husband, Sid Luft, who later married Judy
Garland.
   Her first husband was Walter Kane, an agent, and her third was
Dr. Nathan Rickles, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist. They divorced in
1972 after 17 years of marriage.
   Her ashes were scattered at sea, Daily Variety said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today ordered U.S.
fighters into action to provide air cover for two Philippine air
bases and help defend the Aquino government against a coup attempt.
   ``We are hopeful the matter will be contained,'' Bush told
reporters soon after arriving in Malta for his weekend summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretary
of State James A. Baker III said. ``We have provided some air
support, air cover.''
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, ``no U.S.
planes have fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft.''
   He also said a contingent of 100 Marines had been sent from the
base in the Philippines to defend the U.S. Embassy in Manila.
   ``We're cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have from
the Philippine government that the government forces seem to be
prevailing,'' Rear Adm. Edward D. Scheafer of the Defense
Intelligence Agency said in Washington.
   The air assistance came at the request of Philippine President
Corazon Aquino, who spoke by telephone to Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``She was very grateful for the call and very grateful for the
assistance, and seemed to be confident, but that was several hours
ago,'' Bush said.
   His national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said U.S. forces
``were not in the thick of anything. They are simply providing air
cover. That's all we have been requested to do.''
   Williams was asked at a Pentagon briefing how far the United
States would go in providing military help to keep Mrs. Aquino in
power. He replied, ``That's awful speculative.'' Williams said that
Bush's order ``authorizes assistance, without force if possible,
with force, if required.''
   He declined to say whether any consideration was being given to
evacuating some 20,000 American dependents of military personnel
stationed in the Philippines, principally Subic Bay and Clark Air
Force Base. There are some 15,000 U.S. military personnel stationed
to the Philippines.
   In a statement issued from Air Force One as Bush flew to this
island nation, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``This assistance is intended to allow the democratically elected
government of the Philippines to restore order. The president also
is determined to protect the lives of Americans in the
Philippines.''
   Fitzwater said today that he was not aware of any requests for
U.S. assistance beyond the air cover. Asked if Bush would telephone
Mrs. Aquino, he said, ``It is not clear he will call her today
because of the nature of her situation.''
   Mrs. Aquino, in Manila, said, ``Even now, U.S. fighters are
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops. Once
more, two Pacific democracies stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the
defense of freedom.''
   A Bush administration official said the U.S. fighters were
authorized to fire ``only if (rebel) planes are attempting to take
off from these two bases, but that would be only after repeated
warnings.''
   The F-4s from Clark Air Base were flying combat air patrols, and
there were no reports of engagements with rebel aircraft, Oborn
said this morning.
   The Bush administration official confirmed that the U.S. planes
began flying over the two rebel-held Philippine air bases shortly
after the presidential authorization came at 12:32 a.m. EST today.
   ``The goal in this authorization has been to discourage any
hostile attempt on the part of the rebels in the Philippines.
President Aquino's request was very specific and that was to
conduct an aggressive cap over two Philippine air bases, Villamor
and Sangley Point,'' the official said.
   The official said the U.S. aid involved solely those flights
over the bases, and added that ground military personnel were not
involved. It was not immediately known how many planes were being
used.
   The coup attempt has left at least 10 dead and 64 wounded, and
was the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swept Mrs.
Aquino to power in February 1986 and forced the late President
Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.
   On Thursday, the White House condemned the coup attempt and
threatened to cut off U.S. aid if the Aquino government is ousted.
Meanwhile, the State Department warned Americans not to travel in
the Philippines.
   Fitzwater said Thursday: ``We reiterate the unequivocal support
of the U.S. government for Philippine democracy and the government
of President Corazon Aquino. We strongly condemn the effort to
destabilize the elected Philippine government.''
   He added that, ``according to U.S. law, all U.S. foreign
assistance to the Philippines would be suspended if the elected
government of the Philippines were removed by a military coup.''
   Rep. Steven J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Asia-Pacific
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said a
successful coup would be ``a colossal disaster'' that would play
right into the hands of the Communist-led rebels.
   Late Thursday, the State Department issued a warning against
travel in the Philippines.
   The department established a monitoring group to track
developments in the Philippines around the clock, its second such
group to be activated. Another task force is monitoring
developments in El Salvador.
   Mrs. Aquino visited the White House Nov. 8 and received Bush's
promise of continued U.S. aid for her government, established four
years ago after dictator Ferdinand Marcos was driven from power.
   The United States and the Philippines are scheduled to open
negotiations in December on the future of the lease agreements for
two major U.S. military installations, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Station, as well as smaller facilities in the Philippines.
The current leases expire in September 1991.

   Terrorists meticulously planned
for weeks the bomb attack that killed one of the world's most
powerful financiers, the chief federal prosecutor said today.
   Police searched nationwide for a 31-year-old terrorist suspect
wanted in the killing of Alfred Herrhausen, the head of Deutsche
Bank. He was slain when a bomb ripped through his car Thursday in
the Frankfurt suburb of Bad Homburg.
   In Frankfurt, 5,000 people took part in a silent march past
Deutsche Bank headquarters in memory of Herrhausen.
   Authorities have offered a $2.2 million reward for the capture
of Herrhausen's killers.
   Herrhausen, 59, headed the country's largest bank and had been
one of the world's most influential financial figures.
   The Red Army Faction, which had been relatively dormant for
three years, claimed responsibility for the sophisticated bomb
attack that wrecked Herrhausen's armored car as he was being driven
through this affluent suburb to work in nearby Frankfurt.
   Herrhausen's driver survived the attack with serious injuries.
   ``The perpetrators began preparing for the attack at least four
or five weeks ago,'' said chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.
   ``Near the area of the attack wires had been buried in the
asphalt. The asphalt had been chiseled out up to nearby bushes, and
after the wires were laid filled in again,'' he said.
   Rebmann said the terrorists took care to tint new asphalt poured
over the wires the same as the rest of the 4-foot-wide sidewalk to
make the work unnoticable.
   His office said one of two men seen running from the scene
matched the description of 31-year-old Christoph Seidler.
   A Hamburg court in 1981 convicted Seidler of supporting the
leftist Red Army Faction, which claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack.
   Seidler has been a fugitive for several years. His name
routinely appears on a wanted poster of two dozen leftist
terrorists that is displayed in West German post offices and other
public places, said prosecutor's spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster.
   Seidler has been involved with the Red Army Faction for at least
a decade, said a statement issued by Rebmann's office.
   It said Seidler also was sought in a bank robbery in 1985.
   A controversy developed over whether Herrhausen had been given
enough protection. Media reports said authorities had received
indications he might have been singled out as the target of a
possible attack.
   Imprisoned Red Army Faction members went on a hunger strike
earlier this year to back demands to be housed together in one
prison.
   They broke off their hunger strike without gaining the
concession but issued a statement warning about new steps in their
``anti-imperialist struggle.''
   The Red Army Faction has a long history of attacks against West
German business and political figures, as well as against U.S.
military targets.
   The group had been little heard of since the 1986 murders of
Karl Heinz Beckurts, chairman of the giant Siemens industrial
concern, and diplomat Gerold von Braunmuehl. However, the group was
believed to be involved in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of
finance ministry official Hans Tietmeyer in September 1988.
   Rebmann said authorities would have to review security measures
because of the sophistication of the device that killed Herrhausen.
   Foerster said the explosive appeared to have been attached to a
bicycle placed on the street.
   He said the bomb was detonated by a sophisticated light-beam
device that had never been used before in a terrorist attack in
West Germany. Herrhausen's car triggered the explosion by passing
through the light beam, he said.
   ``For a long time, the Deutsche Bank and Herrhausen in
particular have been targeted by the Red Army Faction,'' Foerster
said.
   The spokesman noted that leftist terrorists for years had
accused Deutsche Bank of ``repression'' and of fueling the
``military-industrial'' complex with the bank's worldwide
investments.
   Herrhausen had been a friend and an adviser of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, often accompanying the chancellor on major foreign trips.
   The tall, striking bank chief had been leading the Deutsche Bank
on an aggressive expansion course aimed at making the institution
one of the top 10 or 15 banks in the world.
   Herrhausen also urged greater investment in the Soviet Union and
other parts of Eastern Europe.

<NOTE>GORBACHEV'S SPEECH:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Your Holiness, gentlemen:
   I thank you for your kind attention and for the interest you
have shown toward my country, our policies and our views about the
world.
   A truly extraordinary event has taken place. It has become
possible due to the profound changes that are sweeping many
countries and nations. What is more, we can expect it to help
assure their positive continuation.
   We had much to discuss. I feel that my thoughts and concerns
have been duly appreciated, as well as my explanations of the
problem that now exist in our country, including problems between
the state and various churches, which we are addressing in a spirit
of democracy and humanism and within the framework of perestroika.
   The Soviet Union and the Holy See participate in the Helsinki
process. To the extent of their abilities and with due regard for
their special roles, both are helping it to proceed at a normal
pace, promote solutions to common European problems and create a
favorable external environment enabling nations to make their own
independent choice.
   Respect for the people's national, state, spiritual and cultural
identity is an indispensable condition for a steady international
environment which Europe and the world now need to cross the
historic watershed and attain a new period of peace.
   We proceded from these positions in initiating our dialogue with
the Holy See _ the dialogue which has now been consecrated by this
summit meeting. I am pleased to note the high degree of mutual
understanding and readiness to fill this dialogue with specific
actions.
   We have reached agreement in principle to give official status
to our interstate relations. As for the modalities, they will be
determined by our diplomatic officials.
   People of many confessions, including Christians, Moslems, Jews,
Buddhists and others, live in the Soviet Union. All of them have a
right to satisfy their spiritual needs. Shortly, a law on the
freedom of conscience will be adopted in our country. Within the
mainstream of perestroika we are learning the difficult and
indispensable art of comprehensive cooperation and consolidation of
society on the groundwork of renewal.
   I greet you and join in the good wishes that we have just heard
from his holiness.

<NOTE>POPE JOHN PAUL II'S SPEECH:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The visit which you are making to the successor of Peter is an
important event in the history of relations between the Soviet
Union and the Apostolic See. As such, it is being followed with
great interest by Catholics throughout the world and by all people
of good will. It is well known that the pope's house has always
been a home for the representatives of all the peoples of the
Earth. You are therefore cordially welcome here, Mr. President.
Through you I also wish to greet all the peoples of the Republics
of the Soviet Union. My esteem and affection goes out to all of
them.
   Last year we celebrated the millennium of the baptism of the
Rus', an event which left such a profound mark on the history of
the peoples who on that occasion received the message of Christ. In
this way, the riches contained in Revelation concerning the dignity
and value of the human person, which derive from the person's
relationship to God the creator and father of all, admirably merged
with the original heritage of those peoples, a heritage which in
the course of centuries has been enhanced by so many other
religious and cultural values.
   I am pleased to consider your visit, Mr. President, against the
backdrop of the millennial celebration and, at the same time, to
look upon it as a promise-filled sign for the future. Your visit,
in fact, enables us to look with greater confidence to the future
of the communities of believers in the Soviet Union.
   The events of past decades and the painful trial to which so
many citizens were subjected because of their faith are widely
known.
   In particular, it is well-known that many Catholic communities
are today eagerly awaiting the opportunity of re-establishing
themselves and of being able to rejoice in the leadership of their
pastors.
   Recent developments and the new perspectives which have opened
up lead us to the hope that the situation will change, thanks to
the repeatedly affirmed decision of your government to proceed with
a renewal of internal legislation in order to bring it into full
harmony with the solemn international commitments to which the
Soviet Union has also subscribed.

   On this occasion I make my own the expectation of millions of
your fellow citizens _ and with them of millions of others
throughout the world _ namely, that the law on freedom of
conscience soon to be discussed by the Supreme Soviet will help to
guarantee to all believers the full exercise of the right to
religious freedom which, as I have said many times, is the
foundation of the other freedoms. My thoughts turn in particular to
those Christians living in the Soviet Union who are in full
communion with this Apostolic See. On their behalf _ whether they
be of Latin, Byzantine or Armenian Rite _ I express the fervent
hope that they be able to practice freely their religious life.
   In a climate of restored freedom, Catholics will thus be able to
work together with their brethren of the Orthodox Church, who are
so dear to us. Indeed, we share with them a common patrimony and
wish to cooperate with them in a renewed ecumenical commitment to
preach the Gospel of Christ to new generations and to work together
with them in the vast field of human development, as we await the
rebuilding of that unity which Christ willed for his church.
   With you, Mr. President, we have had the opportunity to dwell on
the international situation and on some specific and more urgent
problems. We have also discussed the development of contacts
between us for resolving the problems of the Catholic Church in the
U.S.S.R. as well as for fostering a shared commitment on behalf of
peace and cooperation in the world.
   At the end of the second millennium of the Christian era, the
church appeals to all those who have the future of mankind at
heart, to unite in the service of its material and spiritual
betterment. Such concern for man cannot only pave the way for
overcoming international tensions and ending the confrontation
between blocs; it can also favor the birth of a universal
solidarity, especially with regard to the developing countries.
Solidarity _ as I have had occasion to affirm _ helps us to see the
`other' _ whether person, people or nation _ not just as some kind
of instrument...but as our neighbor, a helper, to be made a sharer,
on a par with ourselves, in the banquet of life to which all are
equally invited by God.
   This is particularly true for the richer and more powerful
nations. With respect to them, I have noted that surmounting every
type of imperialism and determination to preserve their own
hegemony, ... (those nations) must have a sense of moral
responsibility for the other nations, so that an effective
international system may be established which will rest on the
foundation of equality of all peoples and on the necessary respect
for their legitimate differences.
   To be sure, mankind today awaits new forms of cooperation and
mutual assistance. The tragedy of the Second World War has taught
us, however, that if fundamental ethical values are forgotten,
fearful consequences for the fate of peoples can result and even
the greatest of enterprises can end in failure. Hence, in my
Apostolic letter commemorating the outbreak of the Second World
War, I felt the need to remind all peoples that ``there can be no
peace if man and law are held in contempt'' and ``if the rights of
all peoples _ particularly the most vulnerable _ are not
respected.'' What is more, I expressed to statesmen and the leaders
of nations my profound conviction, ``that respect for God and
respect for man go hand in hand. They make up the absolute
principle which allow states and political blocs to overcome their
hostilities.''
   Mr President, our meeting today will hardly fail to have a
powerful impact on world opinion. Not only is it something new and
unusual; it will also be interpreted as singularly meaningful: a
sign of the times that have slowly matured, a sign that is rich in
promise.
   The Holy See follows with great interest the process of renewal
which you have set in motion in the Soviet Union. It wishes you
success and declares itself ready to support every initiative that
will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of
individuals and peoples, so that peace may be ensured in Europe and
in the world.
   Tomorrow you will meet with the president of the United States
of America, Mr. George Bush. For my part, I express cordial good
wishes and pray that the forthcoming talks may lead to a new
understanding, one based upon a careful heeding of the needs and
aspirations of peoples.
   With these sentiments, Mr. President, I renew my best wishes for
you and for your mission, for your family and for your country,
invoking upon all of you the blessing of Almighty God.

   A police officer accused of manslaughter in a
killing that reignited the city's racial tensions testified that he
shot a black motorcyclist in self-defense.
   But prosecutors asserted that Officer William Lozano and his
partner concocted the story.
   ``Is it an unwritten rule among partners that they cover for
themselves, even in court?'' Assistant State Attorney John Hogan
asked Thursday. ``There's not a brotherhood in blue, where you lie
to protect your partner?''
   The Colombian-born Lozano, speaking with a soft Spanish accent,
denied that he and partner Dawn Campbell made up the self-defense
story so it wouldn't appear he had fired his weapon unnecessarily.
   ``There could be a lot of brotherhood, it's true, but I would
not cover for'' anyone, the officer responded.
   Lozano, 31, faces two counts of manslaughter in the Jan. 16
deaths of 23-year-old Clement Lloyd and Lloyd's 24-year-old
passenger, Allan Blanchard. Lozano shot Lloyd in the head, killing
him instantly. Blanchard, also black, died the next day of head
injuries suffered in the subsequent crash.
   Lloyd's death promptly triggered racial violence in Miami.
   Twice before in the 1980s, innocent verdicts favoring police
officers accused of killing blacks have led to rioting, and the
Miami and Metro-Dade police forces are on alert for renewed
violence.
   The defense had been expected to finish its presentation today,
but the morning session was canceled because of an illness. Court
officers did not specify who was ill. The case was tentatively
scheduled to resume in the afternoon and should go to the jury next
week.
   Television and radio in Miami are broadcasting the trial live.
Cable News Network carried Lozano's testimony live nationally.
   Lozano testified that Lloyd's motorcycle headed straight at him
in the wrong lane, and he fired instinctively.
   Lozano's lawyer, Roy Black, asked how close the motorcycle came.
   ``(So) close that I thought I might die, that I was going to be
run over and I was going to die,'' the officer said. ``I feared for
my life.''
   But Hogan said Lozano and Ms. Campbell had talked the night of
the shooting to invent an alibi.
   Earlier in the trial, prosecutors showed photos of Lozano and
Ms. Campbell together just after the incident and suggested they
had invented the story that the motorcycle almost hit him. Lozano
testified the photos were taken at the scene of a minor accident
that occurred at the same place, and said he and Ms. Campbell had
never discussed the shooting.
   ``You asked Dawn Campbell to lie for you that night, didn't
you?'' Hogan asked.
   ``No, I never spoke to Dawn Campbell that night,'' Lozano said,
adding, ``Not about lying.''
   Lozano, who has been on the Miami police force for five years,
began his testimony by reciting a litany of commendations. Then he
recounted events the night of the shooting, which occurred as he
and Ms. Campbell were speaking to an Overtown man about a lost
license plate.
   Lozano said he never saw the motorcycle _ only the pursuing
squad car and its lights _ until he had already walked out into the
roadway.
   Hogan later challenged him on differences between that account
and the first verisons he gave investigators, which indicated he
knew the motorcycle was approaching. Lozano said he could not
explain the discrepancies. He suggested the investigators had made
mistakes.

   Helicopters dumped pesticide on a
10-square-mile area radiating from a guava tree where a pregnant
Medfly was trapped, marking the first 1989 infestation in
citrus-rich Orange County.
   Residents covered cars, fish ponds, and bird baths with plastic
tarps to protect them from the gooey pesticide malathion Thursday
night before two helicopters began spraying in the latest attack on
the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   The malathion is mixed into a sweet bait mixture that contains
corn syrup and can ruin car finishes.
   The spraying in Brea and neighboring La Habra Heights came as
agricultural officials announced expansion of two malathion
spraying zones centered around Monrovia, just east of Los Angeles,
and Downey, to the southeast. The spraying on those two areas is
scheduled for next week.
   The western section of this city about 20 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles that underwent spraying once was home to
orange groves and strawberry fields, but has become a developed
suburb with homes and a regional shopping center.
   ``Nobody likes the idea, but everyone recognizes the need to do
it,'' Mayor Gene Leyton said before the spraying began.
   Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission chief deputy Bill
Edwards said Thursday an area set for spraying next week was
expanded to 21 square miles after a Medfly was found in a trap set
in suburban Temple City.
   The prolific Medfly lays its eggs in 250 kinds of fruits and
vegetables, making it a serious threat to the state's $16 billion
farm economy.
   Los Angeles County's agriculture business is minimal, but Orange
County still has a $225 million annual business, including such
Medfly targets as citrus fruit, avocados and strawberries.

   Surgeons implanted a pacemaker in Mother
Teresa today, and hospital officials said the Nobel laureate's
condition had improved.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun who suffered a heart attack
in September was admitted Wednesday to a hospital known was the
Woodlands Nursing Home with high blood pressure and giddiness.
   ``Mother had a permanent pacemaker implanted today,'' a hospital
statement on her health said today. ``She withstood the procedure
very well and is now resting comfortably,'' said a hospital
statement.
   The pacemaker will provide regular, mild electric shocks that
stimulate contraction of the heart muscles and restore normalcy to
the heartbeat.
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work
among the poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5 with a high fever and
vomiting. She suffered a heart attack three days later.
   Her condition worsened until a temporary pacemaker stabilized
her heart. Doctors attributed the illness to her hectic schedule.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the Missionaries of Charity in
1959 in an abandoned hostel donated by the city of Calcutta.
   The order, which was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965,
expanded and now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

   President Bush warmly praised
Mikhail S. Gorbachev today and said he hoped their weekend summit
would lead to a freedom that ``will last for generations.'' The
Soviet leader met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican and pledged
religious liberty throughout his communist homeland.
   Bush arrived at the blustery summit site after ordering American
warplanes to support Philippines President Corazon Aquino's
struggle against a military coup attempt.
   While Gorbachev promised to establish diplomatic ties with the
Vatican and guarantee religious freedom for all Soviet citizens,
one of his major European allies _ East Germany _ took another
major step toward democratic reform.
   Touring the U.S. aircraft carrier Forrestal in the Mediterranean
after his arrival for the weekend summit, Bush said he yearned for
a future ``free of both tyranny and fear,'' and urged the Soviet
Union to ``join us in building that kind of future.''
   ``A new freedom is sweeping the globe,'' the president told
officers and crew members aboard the carrier before arriving at the
USS Belknap, his home for the next two days. ``Our meeting here off
Malta will last a few days, but the freedom we seek will last for
generations.''
   Bush presented the Forrestal's crew with a piece of the
crumbling Berlin Wall as ``a symbol of the peace we seek.'' He
thanked them for making the Malta summit possible because ``you and
sailors like you around the world have kept us strong.''
   He said the two-day summit starting Saturday aboard U.S. and
Soviet warships anchored in the harbor off Malta's shore presented
``a historic opportunity to foster the peace.''
   Bush saluted Gorbachev as ``a dynamic new Soviet leader willing,
as Lincoln said, to think anew.'' The president added that ``we
want him to succeed'' in bring economic and political reforms to
the Soviet Union.
   On the carrier, Bush watched as warplanes were catapulated off
the deck, screeching into the sky on maneuvers. ``I've got a banana
in my ear,'' he joked to reporters, referring to yellow earplugs he
wore during the noisy demonstration.
   A F-14 surprised the president with a thunderous sonic boom, and
Bush ducked partially down behind a railing, as did other visitors.
Quickly recovering, the president grinned and screwed up his face
in mock horror for the cameras.
   Bush also joined enlisted men in the mess for a lunch of lasagna
and a glass of milk.
   After the 70-minute Vatican meeting, Gorbachev said the Soviet
Union would soon adopt a law guaranteeing religious freedom within
its borders, and would establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican.
   ``People of many confessions, including Christians, Moslems,
Jews, Buddhists and others live in the Soviet Union,'' Gorbachev
said. ``All of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs.''
   The pope called the meeting, the first between a Soviet leader
and the head of the Roman Catholic Church, a ``promise-filled sign
for the future,'' and pledged support for Gorbachev's attempt to
reform Soviet society.
   A top Soviet official, meanwhile, said he doubted any formal
agreements would be signed during the summit.
   ``I think President Bush is right when he says there will be no
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting,'' said
Valentin Falin, the head of the International Department of the
Soviet Communist Party.
   But Falin, an architect of Soviet policy toward Europe, hinted
that Gorbachev will try to nudge Bush toward accords on banning
nuclear weapons from the Mediterranean Sea and coping with
political changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   After his arrival, Bush spent the day visiting officers and crew
members aboard the U.S. aircraft carrier Forrestal in the
Mediterranean and dealing with a violent military insurrection
against the Aquino government in Manila.
   En route to Malta, Bush ordered U.S. warplanes to provide air
support for the Aquino government against military insurgents who
bombed the presidential palace in Manila.
   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretary
of State James A. Baker III said. ``We are hopeful the matter will
be contained,'' the president said.
   U.S. officials said American warplanes were circling two air
bases controlled by rebel forces at Villamor and Sangley Point, and
100 American Marines were shifted to Manila to protect the U.S.
Embassy. A Soviet spokesman in Malta denounced the U.S. move as
``interference in internal developments.''
   At the Vatican, Gorbachev broke into a smile as the Polish-born
pontiff offered his hand and guided the Soviet president into the
papal library for private talks at an oaken desk beneath a
religious painting.
   In a major gesture to the Vatican, Soviet officials cleared the
way for legalizing the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which has been
banned since the days of dictator Josef Stalin. An official of the
Soviet republic said today the church's estimated 4 million members
will be allowed to register with Ukrainian authorities like members
of other faiths.
   At the same time, the East German parliament voted
overwhelmingly to change the constitution and eliminate the
Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly on political power, a major
reform demanded by the mass movement for democratic change.
   Gorbachev flies to Malta tonight after meeting with Italian
Premier Giulio Andreotti and business leaders in Milan, Italy.
   Preceding Gorbachev to Malta, Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said it was unlikely the summit leaders could do anything to
resolve the conflict in Central America, where the United States
says Soviet arms are continuing to flow to leftist guerrillas.
   ``We are not helping anybody there,'' Gerasimov said during a
``CBS This Morning'' interview. ``It's very dangerous to infuse
great-power rivalry into this conflict, which we think must be
settled by political means.''
   Before boarding Air Force One on Thursday for the summit site,
Bush said the people of Europe can see that ``Mr. Gorbachev and I _
East and West _ are not in some kind of competition. Rather, we're
both working to make the world a more peaceful one.''
   Gorbachev declared Thursday there was no turning back from the
democratic reforms sweeping through the Eastern bloc.
   The Soviet leader said the United States, Canada and European
nations should hold a ``Helsinki 2'' meeting earlier than the 1992
date set under the 1975 Helsinki Accords on human rights and
security in Europe.
   Bush, asked by reporters aboard Air Force One about Gorbachev's
proposal, said: ``I'll talk to him. Any ideas he's got, I'll
discuss them with him. Then we'll let you know.''
   Malta's entire 1,200-man army was mobilized to assist in
ensuring security for the superpower leaders. Soviet, American and
Maltese flags fluttered side by side throughout the capital city.
   The U.S. and Soviet warships where two days of summit talks will
begin Saturday _ the USS Belknap and the Slava _ were anchored
offshore, visible from the cliffs overlooking the bay.
   Besides the whirlwind changes in Eastern Europe, the 11{ hours
of talks between Bush and Gorbachev are likely to deal with
negotiations to cut nuclear arms and conventional forces, trade
issues, and regional disputes, including a U.S. complaint about
Soviet-made weapons shipped to El Salvador.

   Vishwanath Pratap Singh today was
appointed India's new prime minister to succeed Rajiv Gandhi, his
one-time ally who was defeated in bitter national elections last
month.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman named Singh prime minister, an
hour after Singh was unanimously elected parliamentary leader of
his centrist coalition.
   The United News of India news agency said Singh would be sworn
in by Venkataraman on Saturday and given 30 days to prove his
coalition has the support of a majority in Parliament.
   Singh, 58, a former Gandhi Cabinet minister, campaigned in the
parliamentary elections against what he called the widespread
corruption and ineptitude of Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Singh's election today to lead the National Front coalition did
not come easily. There were last-minute conferences, a fistfight
and allegations of skullduggery within the front, which is united
by little more than antipathy toward Gandhi and his party.
   The National Front formed the most cohesive opposition force in
India's 42 years of independence to defeat Gandhi in national
elections held Nov. 22-26.
   Gandhi, whose Congress Party had held power for nearly all of
India's independence, lost his bid to remain prime minister when
his party failed to win a parliamentary majority.
   The elections were marked by widespread allegations of fraud,
which led to re-voting in several districts, and violence that
killed more than 100 people.
   After his election as coalition leader, Singh told fellow Janata
Dal members Parliament: ``I wish to thank you for the confidence
you have (given) me. This is a difficult time and there are
difficult problems before the nation.''
   ``We should make an India of which every Indian will be proud,''
Singh said.
   On Thursday, members of the coalition said Singh, a former
defense minister, was the only candidate for prime minister. But
Singh's professed reluctance to take the job spurred two other
candidates, Chndra Shekhar and Devi Lal, to enter the fray.
   Singh and other leaders drove from house to house and office to
office for a series of consultations today.
   The fistfights occurred outside the home of Chandra Shekhar and
riot police were called to break them up.
   Ram Jethmalani, a senior member of the National Front, was
punched and kicked by supporters of Chandra Shekhar when he got out
of his car to begin a hunger strike aimed at persuading Chandra
Shekhar to step aside in favor of Singh.
   The 78-year-old Jethmalani, one of India's top criminal lawyers,
fell to the ground as reporters watched.
   By the time the Janata Dal legislators entered Parliament to
choose their leader, the deal had been made. But Chandra Shekhar
said he had been duped.
   When the proceedings started, Singh stood up and proposed Devi
Lal for party leader. Chandra Shekhar seconded the proposal.
   Then Devi Lal stood up, said he didn't want the job and proposed
Singh. A Singh supporter immediately seconded the proposal, and
Singh was declared unanimously accepted.
   Chandra Shekhar later told reporters that Singh was elected
``without my knowledge and without my consent.'' He refused to
elaborate but said he would support Singh.
   Gandhi resigned Wednesday after his party failed to win a
majority, but he was asked by Venkataraman to continue until a new
government is formed.
   Gandhi, grandson of the late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and
son of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, will become leader of
the opposition in the new Parliament.
   Singh was also chosen today as leader of the Janata Dal party,
the major component of the five-party National Front coalition. It
holds 141 of the front's 144 seats in Parliament. The other three
seats are held by smaller parties in the coalition.
   The Congress emerged as the single largest party with 191 seats
out of the 525 at stake. Its small-party allies got another 17
seats.
   But the National Front also has been promised support by the
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which has 88 seats, and by
several left-wing groups, which won a total of 51 constituencies.
   That would give the front and its tacit allies a total of 283
seats _ enough to carry a vote if there are no defections.
   Under the constitution, the president decides who will be asked
to form a government. In past elections, one party always emerged
with a comfortable majority. In the absence of such a majority, the
president is free to choose the party he considers the most capable
of forming a government.

<HEAD>Party Ideology Chief, Lithuanian Leader Split on Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a message
delivered today that Lithuanian communists risk damaging his reform
movement if they persist in their fight for independence, a
Lithuanian journalist and political activist said.
   Eduardas Potashinskas said the Communist Party ideology chief
read the statement during a meeting of the Lithuanian Communist
Party Central Committee on the Baltic republic's drive for
independence.
   Lithuanian leader Algirdas Brazauskas rebuffed the ideology
chief, Vadim A. Medvedev, as he read the appeal, said Potashinskas,
a Lithuanian TV editor and a member of the Sajudis political
movement.
   Medvedev told Lithuanian communists, ``Any movement toward
secession will deal a most severe blow to perestroika, and it will
come at its hardest period, its turning point.''
   He quoted Brazauskas as responding, ``Lithuania without
sovereignty is Lithuania without a future.''
   Rimintas Kanapenas, Sajudis' spokesman, said most Lithuanian
Central Committee members supported Brazauskas.
   About 2,000 protesters gathered outside the Central Committee
building in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, and some stayed all
day, Kanapenas said.
   The meeting was being broadcast on radio and was taped for later
presentation on television.
   Gorbachev and the Moscow party leadership summoned Brazauskas
and the Lithuanian party leaders to the Kremlin two weeks ago to
discuss Lithuania's plans to split its Communist Party from the
national party. That move could be taken at a congress of the
Lithuanian party beginning Dec. 19.
   Gorbachev, who was visiting the Vatican today, has spoken out
against such a move several times, and he emphasized the point in
the message Medvedev delivered today.
   ``It must not be allowed. It is inadmissible now to follow the
way of splitting communists on the basis of national or social
background. This contradicts the very essence of internationalist
socialism. This would contradict the interests of the people,'' the
message said.
   Such a move would ``question the issue of the popular foundation
of the postwar European home that has been born out with such
difficulty, which is not firm enough yet and even fragile in some
ways, peaceful, but living through a difficult transformation
now,'' the TV editor quoted the statement as saying.
   The three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were
absorbed into the Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940 under a
secret agreement with Adolf Hitler's Germany. They had been
independent since the fall of the czarist empire.
   On Monday, they won approval from the national parliament for
broad economic independence beginning Jan. 1. Baltic leaders say
the plan allows them to get a share of the earnings of factories
run by Moscow-based ministries and to print their own money for
internal use.
   Thirty-nine Communists in neighboring Latvia, including eight
members of the local party's Central Committee, also have called
for an independent party, the Tass news agency said Thursday.
   In Estonia, the local party's ideology chief, Mikk Titma, said
in an interview with his party's daily that he is certain the legal
guarantee of the party's leading role in political life will be
eliminated from Estonia's constitution.

<HEAD>Late-Season Tropical Storm Brings Heavy Rain to Cuba</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tropical storm warnings went up again in Cuba today
as forecasters watched Karen, a rare late-season tropical storm,
loop southward in the Caribbean after dumping heavy rains on the
island.
   At 11 a.m. EST, the storm was near latitude 19.0 north,
longitude 83.2 west, about 130 miles west of Grand Cayman Island
and about 300 miles south of Havana, said forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Karen's highest sustained winds were 40 mph. The storm was
drifting south at 5 mph after a Thursday encounter with a cold
front and was expected to slow to a halt today.
   Storm warnings were posted for western and central Cuba and the
Isle of Youth.
   Forecaster Miles Lawrence said satellite pictures showed an area
of thunderstorms over the system's center. ``That could indicate
temporary strengthening,'' he said. ``It was not really expected.''
   The system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical storm
strength Thursday when its winds hit 39 mph.
   Many communities in South Florida had hoped the storm would help
ease a near-record water shortage, which has led to mandatory water
restrictions in some areas.
   But it seemed Cuba and its coastal waters would get most of the
storm's rains, Lawrence said.
   The hurricane center reported more than 14 inches of rain fell
on Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth Thursday. More than 7 inches
in Matanzas and nearly 5 inches in Havana.
   The hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. However,
hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.

   The government today denied a report
that it expelled a renegade CIA agent who has been sought by the
United States since his defection to the Soviet Union in 1985.
   The Los Angeles Times quoted a U.S. government source as saying
Hungary revoked Edward Lee Howard's asylum status at least a month
ago, despite protests from the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service.
   But Col. Karoly Nagy, head of the Hungarian Interior Ministry's
Department for the Supervision of Foreign Nationals, told The
Associated Press today that Howard had not been expelled from
Hungary.
   ``As far as I know he is still here, but he has indicated that
he plans to leave Hungary,'' said Nagy. ``He cited personal, family
reasons, nothing political. When he leaves, it will be of his own
free will.''
   When asked about Howard's travel documents, Nagy said, ``I think
he has his American passport. If he has a multiple-entry visa, he
can come and go.''
   The U.S. Embassy said today it had no immediate information on
Howard's reported expulsion.
   Nagy said he did not know where Howard would go if he left
Hungary.
   Howard, who reportedly provided the Soviets with CIA
information, has spent significant periods of time in Hungary since
defecting to Moscow in 1985, according to David Wise, author of a
book on Howard's defection.
   The Los Angeles Times said Howard's wife Mary, who lives in St.
Paul, Minn., had spent up to three months with him in Hungary.
   In its story Thursday, the newspaper quoted a U.S. official as
saying that federal authorities had been trying to persuade Hungary
to expel Howard for months. It did not identify the official.
   CIA Director William H. Webster made a veiled reference to an
expulsion in a speech Wednesday at the National Press Club in
Washington.
   He was asked about cooperation between intelligence services of
East Bloc countries and the Soviets in light of the recent
democratic reforms sweeping Hungary, Poland, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   Webster cited the case of ``a prominent defector from the United
States (who) was permanently expelled from a bloc country which had
provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past. And that would have
been contrary to the wishes of the KGB.''
   Soviet Embassy spokesman Sergei Semyonov said Thursday of
Howard, ``I regret but we know nothing about such a man.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged in a historic
meeting with Pope John Paul II today that the Soviet Union will
guarantee freedom of religion at home and establish diplomatic ties
with the Vatican.
   Joaquin Navarro, a Vatican spokesman, said Gorbachev also
invited the pope to visit the Soviet Union and that John Paul
thanked him and expressed the hope that developments would allow
him to make the trip.
   After the Vatican meeting, Gorbachev flew to Milan to meet with
business leaders before heading to Malta and summit talks with
President Bush.
   The beaming pope welcomed today's visit _ the first between a
Kremlin chief and Roman Catholic pontiff _ as a ``promise-filled
sign for the future'' and pledged support for Gorbachev's attempt
to reform Soviet society.
   In his address after about 70 minutes of private talks, John
Paul referred to the ``painful trials'' that Soviet believers
suffered in past decades.
   He issued a strong call for religious freedom for all believers
that included a reference to the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which
had been suppressed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   ``On their behalf _ whether they be of the Latin, Byzantine or
Armenian Rite _ I express the fervent hope that they be able to
practice freely their religious life,'' the pope said.
   The Vatican said the pope in his private talks also raised the
issue of the Ukrainians. In the Soviet Union, officials said they
had cleared the way for the eventual legalization of the Ukrainian
Church.
   In a cautious response to the Vatican meeting, Rome-based
Ukrainian Catholic leader Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky restated
the church's demands for full freedom and offered to cooperate with
the rival Russian Orthodox Church.
   The pope also said the Holy See was following with interest
Gorbachev's efforts to renew society and promised support for
``every initiative'' to protect the rights of people and help
ensure peace.
   John Paul spoke first at the news conference, beginning in
Russian and switching to Italian, and Gorbachev responded to the
pope's concerns in his brief remarks.
   ``People of many confessions, including Christians, Moslems,
Jews, Buddhists and others live in the Soviet Union. All of them
have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs,'' Gorbachev said,
speaking in Russian.
   He said a freedom of conscience law would soon be adopted.
   The Soviet leader also said the Vatican and Moscow had reached
agreement in principle to give ``official status to our interstate
relations'' with the details to be worked out by diplomats. The
pope has long sought to re-establish relations with the Soviets,
broken since the Russian Revolution.
   Departing from his prepared text, Gorbachev said: ``We discussed
a future papal visit.'' John Paul has frequently express the wish
to visit the Soviet Union, provided he can meet with his flock all
over the country, including Lithuania and the Ukraine.
   The pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred
from visiting Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the
Soviet Union.
   Navarro did not provide a date for such a trip. ``I don't know
when, but certainly the pope will be going some day,'' Navarro told
reporters.
   The Polish-born pontiff, smiling and touching his pectoral
cross, welcomed Gorbachev to the first meeting ever between a
Kremlin chief and pope.
   Gorbachev, the leader of a system that has reviled religion for
most of this century, appeared serious as he walked through the
marble and frescoed halls of the Apostolic Palace but smiled when
the pope offered his hand.
   The two men chatted and posed for photographers before the
white-robed John Paul led Gorbachev, wearing a pin-striped suit,
into the papal library, guiding him to an oak desk beneath a
religious painting to begin the closed-door talks.
   In their private meeting, the two men spoke alone in Russian for
five minutes. Then their interpreters joined them for the rest of
the session and John Paul switched to Polish.
   As Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, entered the Apostolic Palace,
they were greeted by bemedaled Vatican dignitaries and received a
salute from a detachment of Swiss Guards, the pope's ceremonial
army.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's red dress raised eyebrows at the Vatican, where
protocol normally calls for women to wear dark dresses. But she
seemed at ease as she toured the palace and asked questions about
its art works.
   The pope and Gorbachev smiled as Mrs. Gorbachev and the Soviet
entourage were ushered into the library after the talks.
   Earlier in the clear but chilly morning, thousands of Romans
lined the broad avenue leading to St. Peter's basilica, the largest
church in Christendom, and cheered as Gorbachev's black limousine
headed into St. Peter's Square and he entered the Vatican.
   In announcing that the Ukrainian Church will be legalized,
Nikolai Kolesnik of the Soviet republic's Council on Religious
Affairs said from Kiev that regional officials have decided that
``societies of Greek (rite) Catholics can be registered like other
religious groups'' as now required by Soviet law.
   The church was forcibly merged under dictator Josef Stalin with
the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946 and went underground. According
to Western sources, it has up to 4 million members.
   Kolesnik said in a telephone interview from Kiev to The
Associated Press in Moscow that it was possible the Ukrainian
Catholic church's hierarchy could also be restored.
   Gorbachev would like Vatican support for his reform policies,
and was believed to be seeking a pledge from John Paul that he
would use his influence to keep the church from becoming a vehicle
for nationalism in the Baltic republics and the Ukraine.
   John Paul, a strong anti-Communist, indicated from the outset of
his papacy 11 years ago that he intended to battle for the rights
of his fellow Eastern Europeans. His return to Poland in 1979
sparked calls for democratic reforms that led to the birth of the
Solidarity labor movement.
   The Turkish gunman who shot John Paul in May 1981 claimed he had
Bulgarian and Soviet support, although the allegations were never
proved.

   Three terrorists recruited by Palestinian
guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril built the bomb that destroyed Pan Am
Flight 103 and killed 270 people, ABC-TV reported.
   The three, identified as Ibrahim Twafik-Youssef, Mohammed
al-Makoussi and Hassan Hadi al-Ahar, had been imprisoned by Israel
for nine years for a failed rocket attack on an El Al jet at
Nairobi Airport in 1976, ABC said Thursday on its ``PrimeTime
Live'' program. The network cited terrorist sources.
   ABC reported that Jibril, a former Syrian army captain who heads
the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, has bragged privately that he was behind
the bombing and was paid by Iran.
   Terrorism experts and media investigations previously suspected
Jibril in the case. Some theories hold that Iran hired the
organization to avenge a U.S. warship's downing in July 1988 of an
Iran Air jet with 290 people aboard. Iran has denied any
involvement.
   But Jibril publicly has denied any involvement with the
explosion of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 on the ground were
killed.
   Authorities asked a court in Sweden today to approve the seizure
of 15 bags of clothing by Scottish detectives from the apartment of
a Palestinian suspected of complicity in the bombing.
   The lawyer for Mohammed Abo Talb, who is awaiting a verdict on
separate charges related to terrorist bombings in Scandinavia and
Holland, asked the court to have the clothing returned. The judge
said he would decide by Monday.
   Abo Talb, a former activist in the Palestine Popular Struggle
Front, was linked to Flight 103 when it was established he was in
Malta two months before the plane explosion.
   ABC said Scottish police raided Abo Talb's apartment in Upsalla,
Sweden, three days ago and found clothes that matched those found
in the suitcase believed to have contained the bomb that exploded
on Flight 103.
   A government source told The Associated Press on Tuesday that
clothing fragments from the exploded suitcase had been traced to a
store on the Mediterranean island of Malta.
   ABC reported that on Oct. 23, 1988, Abo Talb went to a store
called Mary's House on Malta and bought clothes chosen at random.
Court records examined in Sweden by the AP confirm that Abo Talb
visited Malta Oct. 19-26, 1988, after spending a day in Cyprus.
   British newspapers had previously reported on the Malta clothing
link.
   Investigators believe they have linked Abo Talb to Jibril, ABC
said.
   Previously, the Sunday Times of London said Jibril ordered his
top aide, Hafez Dalkamoni, to set up the bombing team, and that
Dalkamoni recruited Marwan Khreesat, a Jordanian member of the
Popular Front, whom the Sunday Times and others had named as the
bombmaker.
   ABC said Jibril did set up an operation involving Dalkamoni and
Khreesat, but it was a smokescreen to divert attention from his
real plan to bring down a U.S. airliner. ABC added that Jibril
suspected Khreesat of being a spy.
   Khreesat and Dalkamoni were arrested in West Germany two months
before the Pan Am bombing during raids of people suspected of
planning a terrorist attack there. Raids in Frankfurt and Nuess
also yielded Semtex bombs with air pressure-sensitive detonators,
like the one that later blew up Flight 103.
   Dalkamoni and another Palestinian remain in a West German jail;
the others were released. The British Broadcasting Co. has reported
that Khreesat was freed because he was a double agent working
inside the Popular Front for Jordanian intelligence, and now lives
in Jordan.
   The network said Jibril has bragged privately that Iran paid him
$10 million for the bombing. In May, the West German magazine Quick
reported that Iran paid Jibril $1.3 million to carry out the attack.
   London's Sunday Times has reported that a baggage list shows one
suitcae was transferred onto the Pan Am flight in Frankfurt, West
Germany, from Air Malta Flight KM180. In violation of international
regulations, it was not accompanied by a passenger. Air Malta has
said all the flight's passengers and baggage were accounted for.
   The Pan Am plane flew to London, where it became Flight 103. It
exploded en route to New York City.
   West German police have maintained there is insufficient proof
that the bomb was put on board in Frankfurt.

   A man shot his estranged wife and raped
two teachers in front of 19 children in a school standoff with
police that ended when a teacher grabbed the weapon from the man,
authorities said.
   Larry Bates, 35, was charged with aggravated assault, two counts
of capital rape, two counts of sexual battery, possession of a
firearm by a felon and 22 counts of kidnapping in the incident
Thursday at Northside Primary School, said Natchez Police Chief
Eddie Jones.
   Adria Bates, 40, a teacher's aide at the school, suffered
gunshot wounds to the scalp and back. She was in good condition
today at Jefferson Davis Memorial Hospital, a nursing supervisor
said.
   Mrs. Bates said she recently had filed for divorce and that
Bates had ``been hearing a lot of untrue rumors.'' She did not
elaborate.
   ``It was humiliating to the children and to the other staff,''
she said from her hospital bed.
   The two teachers who were raped and beaten were treated at the
hospital and released.
   Police and sheriff's deputies stormed the kindergarten classroom
to end the hourlong standoff after a teacher grabbed a .38-caliber
revolver from Bates, Assistant Police Chief George Rutherford said.
   ``A tragic situation was prevented with only one ... injury due
to the quick wits of the teachers involved,'' said Adams County
Sheriff Tommy Ferrell. ``These were pretty gutsy women that could
do something of that sort.''
   Rutherford said police received a report of a man on the campus
about 1:30 p.m.
   Officials quoted witnesses as saying Bates shot at his wife's
head.
   Two shots were fired in the classroom, police said, but it was
not certain whether both struck her or whether her injures were
caused by a ricocheting bullet.
   Rutherford said Bates lined the 5- and 6-year-old children in
front of windows _ between himself and police _ and had the
teachers cover the glass with paper.
   There were four teachers and aides in the classroom when the
incident began, Rutherford said, but Bates sent one for aspirin and
had his wounded wife removed from the room.
   Officers said the man ordered the children to look away while he
sexually assaulted the two teachers.
   Rutherford said Jones talked to Bates on the school's intercom
system and ``distracted him long enough for one of the teachers to
grab the weapon.''
   Bates, who had previously been convicted of burglary and
assault, was taken to the Adams County Jail.

<TEXT>
   The state can still regulate who can own
guns despite an amendment to Nebraska's constitution that allows
residents to bear arms in almost all circumstances, the state
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The ruling came in the case of two men whose cases were
dismissed by district judges who cited the amendment, approved by
voters in the Nov. 8, 1988, general election.
   Defendants Charles A. Comeau and Larry Rush of Lincoln County
contended that the amendment's language must be read literally and
that the language prevents any regulation by the Legislature of the
right to possess arms.
   The state argued that the right to keep and bear arms is limited
to lawful purposes.
   ``There are very few rights which are absolute,'' Judge Leslie
Boslaugh wrote in the state high court's opinion. ``In every phase
of everyday experience, there are extremes beyond which some
restraint or regulation is necessary for the common good.''
   Most states regulate handgun ownership in some form, Boslaugh
said. Prohibiting convicted felons, for instance, from possessing
guns is widely accepted, he said.
   Four states prohibit carrying a handgun without a license or
permit, and several states do not allow handguns to be concealed
without a license, Boslaugh said.
   ``We conclude that the right to keep and bear arms is not
unlimited,'' Boslaugh wrote. He added the state had the power to
make ``reasonable regulations for the purpose of protecting the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens.''
   The controversial amendment to the Nebraska Constitution
includes a part that reads, ``the right to keep and bear arms for
security or defense of self, family, home, and others, and for
lawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all other
lawful purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringed
by the state or any subdivision thereof.''

   Asian artwork worth $1 million that was
stolen from a New York collector on Christmas Day 11 years ago was
recovered with the help of an art-theft sleuth, police said.
   About 300 Tibetan and Nepalese items, including ``Buddhas and
all different kinds of brass and prayer wheels,'' were found at a
residence where police arrested Craig K. Warner, 40, police Lt.
Buster Althizer said Thursday.
   The artwork was one of the biggest collections of its type and
had an estimated value of $1 million, he said.
   Detective Bill Martin, who specializes in art theft, tracked the
stolen artworks during a four-month investigation, Althizer said.
   ``He received a letter from the owner who had been looking for
the art for some time,'' Althizer said. ``Martin was able to
develop a lead and followed up on it.''
   Althizer said the art collector, Dr. Jane Werner of New York
City, planned to fly west to claim her belongings.
   ``She is beside herself'' with happiness at the recovery,
Althizer said.
   Warner, arrested for investigation of receiving stolen property,
was booked into the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center.
Althizer would not disclose the nature of his illness.

<TEXT>
   Two years after being proposed, several major
legislative recommendations from congressional Iran-Contra
investigators are being enacted into law over the grumblings of
President Bush.
   Bush on Thursday signed the toughest of the provisions: a
requirement for an independent inspector general to monitor the
activities of the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Creation of the office, similar to oversight posts at other
government agencies that review federal programs and ferret out
abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing a reported $25
billion to $30 billion for U.S. intelligence activities for the
coming year.
   Bush last week approved a foreign aid bill containing a ban on
use of U.S. money to entice foreign governments into carrying out
policies banned by U.S. law. The provision is a reaction to
President Reagan's apparent use of aid money as a reward to
Honduras for harboring the Contras in its territory along the
Nicaraguan border.
   Bush also is expected to sign a measure providing criminal
penalties for sales of weapons to terrorist countries, such as the
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired the House Iran-Contra
investigating panel, said its primary finding was that the affair
stemmed not from a failure of the law, but a failure of individuals
to obey it.
   ``Congress could not legislate fidelity to the law,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the committees suggested a series of changes that
would make it less likely that abuses could occur.
   Meanwhile, Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh was quoted
in today's Washington Post as saying the Bush administration
decided to adopt a stricter policy on releasing classified
information for Iran-Contra trials after former Reagan White House
aide Oliver North was convicted in May for his role in the affair.
   Walsh said one consequence of the new policy was the
administration's decision to block disclosure of classified
documents in the trial of former CIA official Joseph F. Fernandez,
the Post said. That move led to the dismissal of the Fernandez case
last week.
   Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh today asking for an explanation on why he
blocked disclosure in the Fernandez case.
   ``Specifically, the committee would like to know the
intelligence information of concern, the probability it would have
been disclosed and the possible consequences of its disclosures,''
said Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the committee, and
Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine, its senior Republican.
   The changes passed in the waning hours of this year's
congressional session ``were not unimportant provisions,'' Hamilton
said. Other recommendations, mostly dealing with how the president
notifies Congress of covert operations overseas, will be hammered
out next year and may be more difficult to enact, he said.
   Bush accepted the changes despite protests that they
unnecessarily tie his hands in carrying out foreign policy and amid
cautionary statements that he will resist any effort by Congress to
use the new authority to ``micromanage'' the administration's
activities.
   Bush said the new inspector general post ``could impair the
ability of the CIA to collect vitally needed intelligence
information by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be
guaranteed.''
   The CIA ``must be able to assure foreign individuals and
organizations that their identities, the fact of their association
with the United States, and the information they provide are not
subject to exposure,'' said Bush, himself a former CIA director.
   CIA Director William Webster has said that while the provision
could damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in U.S.
ability to keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild safeguards
against compromising intelligence sources and methods.
   Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that
would let the CIA director quash any inspector general's
investigation he believed might compromise national security.
   The inspector general would be appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate, and the auditor's reports would be
available to the House and Senate committees that oversee U.S.
intelligence.
   Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by the
CIA director and reports only to him. That arrangement has caused
friction with the House ntelligence Committee, which has been
denied access to some reports.
   The congressional Iran-Contra investigators said the agency's
inspector general lacked independence and didn't have ``the
manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover arms-for-hostages
transactions or the diversion of profits to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels.
   The implication was that as an underling of former CIA Director
William Casey, who was deeply involved in the affair, the inspector
general lacked the muscle to detect or report Iran-Contra abuses.

   Rebel soldiers today abandoned their
last strongholds in Manila after bombing the presidential palace
compound and seizing three military bases in the strongest bid yet
to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   U.S. warplanes joined the battle to save the government as the
attack began before dawn. By sundown the Philippine government had
declared the coup a failure.
   Late tonight, mutineers left the government television station
and Villamor Air Base _ the air force headquarters _ which they had
seized in the early hours of the assault.
   Hundreds of mutinous marines also marched out of Fort Bonifacio,
their home garrison, and members of all three groups marched
together down a major thoroughfare toward Camp Aguinaldo,
headquarters of the armed forces general staff.
   It was unclear what they intended to do when they got there, but
pro-government troops did not try to stop them. Occasionally,
rebels fired weapons in the air and pointed rifles at journalists
trying to follow them.
   Earlier, Manila radio stations broadcast a statement from Mrs.
Aquino in which she said the ``enemy is routed but is not yet
vanquished.'' She was not seen on national television.
   At sundown, the military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa,
declared that the sixth coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino was
crushed and that loyal troops had recaptured armed forces
headquarters at Camp Aquinaldo and the Sangley Point naval base.
   At least 22 people were killed and 87 wounded during the coup
attempt, most of them civilians, officials in the Phillipines said.
Estimates of the number of rebels ranged from 800 to 2,000.
   As their vintage planes fired on targets, crowds of civilian
onlookers cheered.
   ``Wow! That was a great shot,'' said cigarette vendor Julio
Torres, pointing toward the presidential palace. ``But it would
really be better if there could be a dog fight later on, just like
in the movies.''
   U.S. F-4 fighter jets flying ``combat air patrol'' roared over
the capital from Clark Air Base, 50 miles from the capital, said a
U.S. Defense Department spokesman, Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Oborn.
He did not report any firing by the American planes.
   Rebel soldiers would not say who led the fighting. When it began
just after midnight Thursday, de Villa said it was believed the
mutineers were followers of Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan,
who led an August 1987 coup attempt in which at least 53 people
died.
   Honasan has been at large since his escape from prison in April
1988. Honasan supported Mrs. Aquino when she came to power four
years ago in an uprising that ousted Ferdinand Marcos. He then
turned against her, accusing her of failing to deal effectively
with Communist insurgents and not fighting corruption or improving
the economy.
   Early today, two T-28 aircraft bombed and rocketed the
presidential Malacanang Palace compound. Witnesses said two
presidential guards and three other people were killed.
   ``They're bombing us!'' a palace staff member cried over the
telephone. ``We're going down!''
   When mutineers at the rebel-held government TV station saw the
attack, they cheered and shouted, ``Cory is dead!''
   But Philippines Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez, interviewed in
Washington today on NBC's ``Today'' show, said the palace was not
hit.
   Mrs. Aquino was reported safe. Her latest comments were made at
a Cabinet dinner about 12 hours after the attack at Malacanang
Palace, according to private radio stations that broadcast them.
   A Bush administration official said U.S. planes began flying
over the Sangley Point and Villamor bases shortly after the
presidential authorization came at 12:32 a.m. EST today.
   David Andresen, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, said
at 8:10 a.m. EST that he had not heard any planes flying overhead
for an hour.
   The Bush administration official said U.S. ground troops were
not involved.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
American planes were intended to prevent rebel planes from taking
off. This allowed the Philippine government to consolidate its
forces.
   A spokesman for the rebels, speaking on condition he not be
named, said his forces had declared themselves a provisional
revolutionary government. He said the U.S. move was an affront to
Filipino sovereignty.
   The U.S. military has 40,000 troops, military dependents and
Defense Department civilians stationed at six bases in the
Philippines. The U.S. military presence here is strongly opposed in
the Philippines Senate.
   Mrs. Aquino has not said where she stands on renewal of the
lease for the bases, which runs out in 1991.
   The rebels appeared to be mainly from the army and marines.
   As the assault began, they were transporting large amounts of
ammunition to Villamor from nearby Fort Bonifacio. In addition to
Villamor, they seized parts of Manila's main airport and bombed
government installations through the day.
   Local reporters said rebels also seized the airport near
Legazpi, 220 miles southeast of Manila. Retired Brig. Gen. Jesus
Hermosa, a security adviser in Cebu province, said a boatload of
mutineers landed near Cebu City's Mactan International Airport, 350
miles southeast of Manila. Mactan is the country's second major
airport.
   A rebel bomb knocked out the government's RPN television and
rebel forces held a private television station. Witnesses reported
two pro-government soldiers and three civilians were killed during
clashes near RPN.
   Rebel helicopters and propeller-driven planes repeatedly bombed
the Philippine Constabulary headquarters at Manila's Camp Crame,
setting the main building ablaze.
   Other bombs landed across the street at Camp Aguinaldo, the
armed forces headquarters. One heavily damaged de Villa's home.
Thousands of civilians fled neighborhoods around the suburban
military garrisons.
   De Villa estimated rebel strength at 800. A mutinous captain put
the figure at 2,000. De Villa claimed troops remained loyal in
northern Luzon, Mindanao and in the southern Luzon command.
   But Gov. Rudolfo Aguinaldo of Cagayan province said in a radio
interview later that soldiers in his northern Luzon area supported
the mutiny.
   Unlike the August 1987 coup attempt, when civilians poured into
the streets to back Mrs. Aquino and cheer government forces, this
time they watched in silence as planes pounded the garrison.
   Besides dissatisfaction within the military, public discontent
with the Aquino government has been growing because of rising
prices, a shortage of electricity and allegations of corruption.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sporadic fighting between
leftist rebels and government forces was reported outside the
capital today, but San Salvador was calm and some residents used
the lull to repair their damaged homes.
   Others in the capital, fearing more battles in coming weeks,
closed up their homes and headed for refuge with relatives or
abroad.
   Today's calm followed two days of combat that forced the
evacuation of many people from the city's wealthy neighborhoods,
including nearly 300 Americans.
   Elsewhere, assault rifle fire was heard outside Zacatecoluca, a
provincial capital 25 miles southeast of San Salvador, residents
reported. Two O-2 observation planes fired several rockets at
suspected guerrilla positions outside the city of 75,000 people.
   For the first time in the 10-year-old civil war, the guerrillas
reportedly fired a surface-to-air missile on Wednesday, in
Zacatecoluca.
   The SAM-7 fired at a A-37 jet fighter missed its mark, but air
force pilots obviously were worried about the missiles.
Zacatecoloca residents, contacted by telephone, said the O-2s were
flying very low, which makes them harder to hit with the missiles
but easier to hit with rifle fire.
   A total of 282 Americans, many living in two San Salvador
neighborhoods under attack this week, fled the country Thursday
when the guerrillas declared a six-hour truce. U.S. Embassy
personnel and dependents were among those who departed in two
chartered planes.
   The neighborhoods, on the west and southwest side of the city,
were the scene of a surprise rebel incursion late Tuesday and early
Wednesday that turned their stately tree-lined streets and
carefully tended lawns into battle zones.
   Leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebel
organization said the invasion was part of the rebel's biggest
offensive in the decade-old war, which was launched Nov. 11.
   Infiltrating in small groups under cover of darkness, the
guerrillas had seized and entrenched themselves in about 40 homes
in the neighborhoods.
   There were no reports of civilian casualties from the fierce
fighting. The number of combatants killed was not known, although
reporters at the time counted 11 bodies in battle gear lying in the
area.
   By nightfall Thursday, when a dusk-to-dawn curfew went into
effect, the rebels vanished as silently as they had come and no
more shooting could be heard.
   But the neighborhoods remained littered with spent cartridges,
burned-out luxury cars, downed power lines, and some damaged homes
and mansions _ and a few rebel dead.
   One of the bodies in Escalon had been burned by soldiers and
dumped, headfirst into a mesh trash can outside a mansion, a crude
cardboard sign scrawled with a skull and crossbones jammed beside
the charred remains.
   Written on the piece of cardboard was a sign in Spanish saying
the soldiers take no prisoners. ``There is no man, no law that
holds us back,'' the sign added.
   One infantryman with a shoulder-length mop of hair lounged by
the trash can. ``He thought he'd scare us,'' the soldier explained
laughing, ``We burned him.''
   Before departing, the rebels set the National Information Center
ablaze.
   The center was set up Nov. 12, when the government suspended
constitutional guarantees, declared a state-of-siege, imposed
censorship on Salvadoran news media and forced the networks to
broadcast its news programs several hours every day.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government Sunday accused
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government of smuggling the missiles
and other military supplies to the rebels and suspended diplomatic
relations with the neighboring country.
   Cristani denounced the Sandinistas a day after a two small
planes were caught reportedly ferrying the military hardware.
   He said both planes had taken off from Nicaragua; Nicaragua's
president, Daniel Ortega, did not deny the charge.
   The United States, which has been supporting a succession of
Salvadoran governments with military and economic aid, protested to
the Soviet Union, which had been supplying the Sandinistas
regularly with weapons over the years.
   President Bush said he would also bring up the issue during a
summit meeting he is holding off the coast of Malta with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   More than 71,000 people have been killed, most of them
civilians, since the civil war began Oct. 15, 1979, according to
human rights groups.
   On Thursday, the military searched the homes of two U.S.
free-lance journalists and that of Ricardo Chacon, the Salvadoran
bureau chief of the Spanish news agency ACAN-EFE, and warned news
agencies to be ``objective'' in their reporting.

   Iraq on Friday marked ``Martyr Day,''
commemorating the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who
fell in its war with Iran.
   Special sermons were held in mosques and churches at dawn with
Moslem prayers and pealing bells booming out over loudspeakers.
Official radio and TV pre-empted regular programming to broadcast
dirges and specials on the war.
   Local party officials toured houses of families who lost sons in
the eight-year war to express their condolences.
   Western military experts have said Iran and Iraq suffered about
1 million dead in the war that started in September 1980.
   Iraq decided to commemorate Martyr Day after an Iranian
opposition group reported that extremist Revolutionary Guards once
machine gunned hundreds of Iraqi soldiers taken captive during a
major battle in southern sector of the gulf war. They were reported
killed near the southern Iranian port of Sunsangard on Dec. 1, 1982.
   The Iranians denied the report from the Mujahedeen Khalq, based
in Baghdad.
   The war ended with a United Nations cease-fire August 1988, but
all attempts to establish a formal peace treaty have failed.

   Ten Tibetan members of a pro-independence group,
including at least eight Buddhist monks, were sentenced to prison
terms in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, official reports said Friday.
   The 10 received sentences Thursday ranging from five to 19 years
for forming a ``counterrevolutionary organization'' in January, the
Xinhua News Agency said.
   At least eight of those convicted were monks from the Drepung
Monastery, a community of more than 400 monks on the outskirts of
Lhasa and one of the centers of Buddhist-led pro-independence
unrest in Lhasa in the past two years.
   The reports said the organization collected information and
mimeographed ``reactionary leaflets for their foreign boss,'' an
apparent reference to Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai
Lama.
   The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since fleeing
Tibet after a failed uprising against the Chinese military in 1959,
on Dec. 10 will receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to
achieve indpendence for his homeland through peaceful means.
   China has strongly objected to the decision to award the Dalai
Lama the prize, saying he has incited reactionary forces trying to
split the nation.
   The Beijing government imposed martial law in Lhasa on March 8
after three days of violent riots, the fourth major outbreak of
anti-Chinese disturbances in the city since the fall of 1987.
   In September, Tibetan courts sentenced 10 men, including at
least six monks, to prison terms of up to life on charges of
rioting and spying for the Dalai Lama during the March uprising.
   Nine nuns were also reportedly sentenced to labor camp in
September for shouting pro-independence slogans at a festival
earlier in the month.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter and
delegations from Sudan's government and rebel groups began talks
Friday aimed at ending the North African nation's nearly 7-year-old
war.
   Immediately after a brief opening session, however, both sides
recessed for the day out of respect for the Moslem Friday Sabbath
and were scheduled to reopen their discussions Saturday.
   Carter said he would chair only the first day of talks after
which the negotiations will proceed without a mediator at the
delegations' request.
   He traveled to Sudan and Ethiopia this month for meetings with
Sudanese rebel and government leaders that resulted in bringing the
warring parties together. He was expected to leave Kenya on Sunday,
but said he would remain available should his help be needed.
   Carter has been in Nairobi since Nov. 19 when he arrived to
chair 10 days of preliminary peace talks between warring Ethiopian
factions. Those negotiations ended Wednesday with both sides
agreeing to begin substantive talks next year.
   Like the Ethiopian talks, the Sudanese negotiations are
open-ended and will take place in secret at a private Nairobi
residence provided by the Kenyan government.
   It is the second time the high-level delegations have met to
discuss an end to the war in Sudan that has displaced millions of
people and killed hundreds of thousands. They met in Ethiopia's
capital, Addis Ababa, in August, but broke off after two days
without making any progress.
   Three main issues are set to be discussed, the stickiest being
the application of Sharia law _ the harsh Islamic penal code
employed by Sudan's government _ which the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army wants lifted. The other measures the rebels seek
before considering a cease-fire are the abrogation of Sudan's
military pacts with Libya and Egypt, and the lifting of the
nation's state of emergency.
   ``I have no doubt that after dealing with the first issue, the
other two questions can be resolved,'' said Carter.
   However, the talks also are seeking agreements that would allow
for the resumption of southern Sudan relief flights which the
government suspended in early November after renewed fighting with
the rebels.
   Both sides had observed a de facto ceasefire begun in April when
a U.N.-organized relief operation began moving large amounts of
food and supplies into southern Sudan to avert widespread famine.
   But the cease-fire broke down in October in battles for a
western border town and continued into November with the bombings
of several rebel-held towns.
   During the opening ceremony, the rebels called on the
international community to put pressure on Sudan's government to
allow the flights to resume.
   ``Use of food as a weapon is a most uncivilized and deplorable
military strategy, and we call upon all governments, organizations
and people of good will to bring pressure to bear on the Khartoum
junta to lift this unfortunate relief embargo,'' said rebel
delegation leader Lam Akol.
   The relief effort sought to avert a repeat of 1988's tragedy
when an estimated 250,000 southern Sudanese died in a famine made
worse by war.
   The rebels took up arms against Sudan's Moslem-dominated
government in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic reforms
for the predominantly Christian and animist south.

   The CIA has reported that some senior
Philippine officials are worried that entire segments of their
armed forces supposedly loyal to President Corazon Aquino will fail
to ``fight effectively'' in fending off the rebels attempting to
topple her government, an administration source said today.
   The Central Intelligence Agency, in its daily intellgence
summary prepared for top U.S. officials, reported that the
situation in the Philippines remains ``quite uncertain,'' said the
official, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.
   ``It's all very gauzy stuff,'' said the source, who added that
the assessment was open to change given the fluid situation on the
ground in the Philippines.
   The report came as Rear Adm. Edward D. Sheafer, a Defense
Intelligence Agency official, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing:
   ``We're cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have from
the Philippine government that the government forces seem to be
prevailing.''
   Sheafer, went asked how much support the rebel forces had
outside Manila, said, ``It's difficult to judge how well it's
organized.'' He added that recent reports indicate the NPA _ the
communists _ were not playing an active role in the rebellion.
   The dual reports came just hours after President Bush ordered
U.S. fighters into action to provide air cover for two Philippine
air bases and help defend the Aquino government against a coup
attempt.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who joined Sheafer at the
briefing, said, ``no U.S. planes have fired any shots or
intercepted any rebel aircraft.''
   The administration source said that the CIA relayed an
assessment during the early morning hours to Washington that was
based on the judgments of some senior Philippine officials.
   The report ``questioned whether the Philippine military ... will
fight effectively'' on Mrs. Aquino's behalf because of low morale
among the troops, the source said.
   The official said the assessment did not detail exactly how
widespread the discontent might be in the Philippine military, but
that it did note that the loyalty of the Marine Corps, in
particular, ``is in question.''
   Besides unrest within the military, public discontent with the
Aquino government has been growing because of rising prices, a
shortage of electricity and allegations of corruption.
   The administration source said the CIA analysis also made
mention of other areas of unrest in the Philippines.
   The report said that U.S. Embassy officials in Manila had
reported to the State Department that they had been informed by
senior Philippine military officials that the Mactan air base at
Cebu in the south had ``gone over to the rebels,'' the source said.
   The report to the State Department also noted that Gov. Rudolfo
Aguinaldo of Cagayan province ``is supporting the coup,'' the
source said.
   In a radio interview, the governor has stated that soldiers in
his northern Luzon area supported the mutiny and ``we are bringing
in artillery and armor.''

   For the first time since his family fled the
Nazis in 1933, Minnesota Sen. Rudy Boschwitz will return to his
native Germany to look for his birthplace in East Berlin.
   Boschwitz, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee
on European affairs, will stop in Berlin next spring before going
on to Poland with a group of Minnesota farmers for what an aide
describes as a ``Peace Corps-type'' visit to offer help to the
primitive Polish dairy industry.
   The senator's office did not announce any dates for the trip.
   Boschwitz knows the address of his childhood home, which he
believes to be in East Berlin, but doesn't really remember it since
he was 2 when his Jewish family left Germany, he said Friday.
   ``I've seen a picture of it that is very much different than how
I remember it,'' he said. ``I really don't have any recollection.''
   Boschwitz's parents, left Berlin with him and his sister six
months after Adolf Hitler came to power. They arrived in the United
States when he was 5.
   ``My father was very perceptive. ... (He) came home the day
Hitler came to power and said we would leave Germany,'' Boschwitz
said.
   Boschwitz has no family left there and acknowledges having mixed
feelings about returning.
   ``For the first time, when he was sitting watching the
television pictures from Berlin and East Germany ... he felt the
real urge to go back,'' said Boschwitz' press secretary, Tim
Droogsma.
   Boschwitz will be accompanied on the trip by 12 Polish-speaking
dairy farmers he hopes can give some ``hands-on'' help to their
Polish counterparts. Cattle are still milked by hand in parts of
Poland.
   ``It's certainly going to take more than one visit, but first
you've got a sense of where they are,'' he said.

   A military policeman found with 11 homemade
bombs in his car trunk was facing court-martial and had concocted
an escape plot in which he planned to lob the bombs at ``anyone in
his way,'' investigators said today.
   Senior Airman James Wilcox, 22, of Griffiss Air Force Base, was
arrested at the Park Inn motel in Rome Thursday night, police
officer Mike Dunn said.
   Wilcox was arrested after police were tipped that the airman had
homemade bombs in his car trunk, investigator James Masucci said.
   The bombs were made from carbon dioxide cartridges and were
``very dangerous,'' Masucci said. He would not be more specific.
   Wilcox was scheduled to be court-martialed Saturday on larceny
and house-breaking charges, said Griffiss spokesman Carl Sahre. The
airman told police he had planned to escape if he was found guilty,
Masucci said.
   The bombs were strapped to a bandoleer that Wilcox apparently
planned to wear so he could throw the explosives ``at patrol cars,
military police, civilians or anyone in his way,'' Masucci said.
   ``He had it right down to a science,'' the investigator said.
The bombs were stored in Wilcox's car along with a police scanner
and survival gear that would allow him to live in the woods and
evade searchers, Masucci said.
   ``I can't imagine why he would go through all this,'' Sahre
said. ``I can't see why he wouldn't just go AWOL if he was that
worried abut the court-martial.''
   Wilcox was put on limited duty as a base security officer after
his arrest on the theft charges in May, Sahre said. He was not
confined to quarters and was allowed to leave the base, he said.
   ``He could have taken off any time,'' Sahre said.
   The court-martial would go ahead as planned if Griffiss
officials can arrange to have Wilcox brought back to the base from
the Oneida County Jail, where he was being held, Sahre said.
   If convicted in the court martial, Wilcox could be confined at
Griffiss or sent to the military prison in Leavenworth, Kan., he
said.
   His arraignment on charges of criminal possession of dangerous
weapons was postponed from this morning until Monday.

   About 70 demonstrators were arrested today
after they sat down on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White
House to protest what they called the government's lack of
leadership in the AIDS epidemic.
   Those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200
people who attended a rally marking World AIDS Day.
   ``We're here because we're angry at our country and our
administration's response to this epidemic,'' said Urvashi Vaid of
the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   The demonstration came a day after President Bush declared that
education is the nation's best weapon against AIDS.
   ``Our hearts go out to those afflicted, as our heads work toward
finding solutions,'' Bush said in a statement Thursday before
leaving for the Malta summit. ``In the meantime, we must continue
to educate those around us regarding the prevention of this
terrible disease.''
   ``Where are you, George?'' asked Ms. Vaid, leading the crowd in
Lafayette Park in a chant of ``Where is George? Where is George?''
   Paul Boneberg, executive director of Mobilization Against AIDS,
a San Francisco group, said, ``We do not have the resources in our
groups to meet this challenge. We see people who need treatment but
who are denied treatment....We see discrimination still across the
country, and there's no government response. It's shameful.''
   The groups said they would issue a ``report card'' giving Bush
failing grades for his response.
   Bush has failed to provide a national AIDS strategy, has not
pushed for adequate funding for prevention, care, research and
treatment and has not responded to the growing burden AIDS is
placing on the nation's health care system, said Rene Durazzo,
spokesman for more than a dozen groups, including the National
Association of People With AIDS and the AIDS Action Council.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said World
AIDS Day will provide an opportunity to reinforce preventive
measures and show compassion for those infected.
   More than 112,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, and more than 66,000 have died, Sullivan said.
   ``This is only the tip of the iceberg'' because the Public
Health Services estimates that about 1 million Americans may have
already been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, that causes AIDS, Sullivan said.
   Though there is no cure, new treatments that can prolong the
lives of those infected make it more important those at risk get
tested, Sullivan said.
   ``AIDS and HIV will be with us for years to come,'' Sullivan
said. ``But each one of us can combat its further spread by making
wise choices about personal behavior _ choices based on the fact
that HIV is transmitted by having sex or sharing needles with an
infected partner.
   ``And, secure in the knowledge that HIV is not spread by casual,
non-sexual contact, each one of us can help lessen the impact of
AIDS by giving practical and compassionate help to those who have
been infected by HIV or who live with AIDS itself.''
   Bush, in his statement, acknowledged that though the AIDS
problem ``is great, and taxing our health care system now, far
greater difficulties await us in terms of human suffering and
provision of health care.''
   ``We have committed resources at an unprecedented rate to
HIV-related research of all kinds,'' he said, promising ``we will
continue the most vigorous research efforts.''
   ``At the same time, we must also educate and prevent. The
disease is spread through known ways, and it is clear that
education on the facts is our best means of combating AIDS at this
time,'' he said.

   Five men were executed in northeastern China on
Friday for stealing equipment that resulted in power outages and
crop damage, an official report said.
   Zhou Mingyu and Liu Gang of Sulan county in Jilin province
destroyed seven transformers and stole 3,500 yards of wire in 1988,
the Xinhua News Agency said.
   That caused damage worth $5,400, cut power to 400 households in
six villages and interfered with the irrigation of 296 acres of
rice paddies, the report said.
   Three others _ an unidentified man and his two sons _ stole 19
transformers and 6,400 yards of cable and wire worth $11,000 in
1988, leaving 340 households without power and interrupting
irrigation of 500 acres of rice paddies, Xinhua said.
   The five were executed with the approval of the Jilin City
Municipal Court and Jilin province's higher court, according to the
report.

<TEXT>
   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who fled her
homeland for Hungary earlier this week, traveled to the United
States today after being granted political asylum, U.S. officials
said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Ms. Comaneci, a
former Olympic star, had been granted refugee status and was ``in
the air on her way to this country.''
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Ms.
Comaneci, who complained of repression in her homeland, was granted
refugee status by U.S. consular officers in Europe.
   The officials said Ms. Comaneci, 28, was en route to New York
from Vienna.
   Ms. Comaneci and six other Romanians crossed the border into
Hungary on Tuesday and went into hiding.
   The officials had no information on where Ms. Comaneci made her
request to come to the United States. As a refugee, she is
considered by U.S. officials to have a well-founded fear of
persecution if she returns to her homeland, whose hard-line Marxist
government has rejected the reformist tide sweeping other East
European countries.
   The officials said Ms. Comaneci will be eligible to apply for
permanent resident status in the United States in one year.
   At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, she earned the first
perfect score ever given to a gymnast. She won three gold medals at
Montreal and two gold and two silver medals four years later in the
Moscow games.
   At one point after Ms. Comaneci's flight to Hungary, it was
thought she would eventually make her way to the United States with
her former coach, Bela Karolyi, who defected to America in 1981.
Karolyi was in Stuttgart, West Germany, coaching the U.S. women's
gymnasts in a meet.
   ``Bela's kids are competing tomorrow and Sunday,'' U.S.
Gymnastics Federation spokesperson Patti Auer said Friday, ``so he
is not coming back with her. That much we know.''
   Because of her achievements, Ms. Comaneci was named a ``Hero of
Socialist Labor'' by President Nicolae Ceausescu, the hard-line
Romanian leader.
   Ms. Comaneci won a total of 21 gold medals in Olympic and other
international meets during her career, which won her a life of
privilege in a country that has endured chronic shortages of
consumer goods for most of this decade.

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has
refused visas to a 20-member delegation appointed by President Bush
to observe next year's general election, saying such a panel would
not be impartial.
   ``From the point of view of his credibility before us, the very
fact that Mr. Bush has been the one to appoint this commission is
enough for it to be totally discredited,'' said a ministry
communique issued late Thursday.
   The communique said the vote Wednesday in the U.S. Congress to
continue non-lethal aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels, known as
Contras, ``will allow the Contras to keep infiltrating their bands
into Nicaragua to assassinate our people and create confusion in
the electoral process.''
   The general election is scheduled for Feb. 25.
   The Foreign Ministry also complained about $9 million approved
by Congress in October to aid the campaign of presidential
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the United National
Opposition.
   UNO, as the 14-party bloc is known in English, is the strongest
challenger to the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   ``There exists a clear incompatilibity between pretending to buy
the election of a candidate while at the same time pretending to be
accepted as impartial observers in our elections,'' the communique
said.
   Scores of international observers have been invited to supervise
the elections, including teams from the United Nations, the
Organization of American States and the European Parliament.
   The communique said that the organizations and individuals
invited by the government of Nicaragua are experienced, honest and
impartial.
   ``The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of President Bush,
nor, therefore, of any commission appointed by him to observe the
elections in Nicaragua,'' the communique said.
   It said there are many ``genuine democrats'' in Congress and
``we trust in their capacity to understand that these declarations
are not in any way directed at them as individuals.''

   Mother Teresa underwent surgery Friday to
receive a pacemaker, and hundreds of nuns of her Missionaries of
Charity prayed for her recovery.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who had suffered a heart
attack in September, was reported to be resting comfortably after
the operation.
   ``The permanent pacemaker is working fine,'' said Dr. Rajen
Watts, her personal physician.
   ``Mother Teresa had a mild bout of fever in the afternoon, but
now it is under control,'' Watts said. ``She is under constant
observation, but we can say that she is fine now.''
   Several hundred nuns held special prayers for Mother Teresa at
the Missionaries of Charity, the headquarters of her worldwide
charity that cares for the destitute and the dying on six
continents.
   Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her
work among the poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5, and suffered a heart
attack three days later.
   Her condition worsened until a temporary pacemaker stabilized
her heart. Doctors attributed the illness to her hectic schedule at
the Missionaries of Charity.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the charity in October 1959. The
order, which was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, has
3,000 nuns in 87 countries.

<TEXT>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., sold
14 paintings worth a total of $18.9 million at five sales in London
in the past two weeks, auctioneers said.
   The Getty works sold by Sotheby's were a mixed lot by
impressionist and 19th century artists. Only one failed to sell: a
dreary brown landscape by Edgar Degas.
   The top price was $6.8 million paid by the Japanese conglomerate
Aksa International for Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy
in a landscape.
   Aksa also paid $68,600 for an 1895 landscape by Gustave Loiseau
that Getty himself bought in 1957 from the Paris dealer,
Durand-Ruel.
   An anonymous Japanese buyer paid $3 million for a picture of the
cliffs at Pourville in Normandy by Claude Monet.
   Unidentified buyers paid $3.6 million for a picture of three
ballet dancers by Edgar Degas and $3.4 million for a standing
female nude by Pierre Bonnard.
   The only other identified buyer was London's Mathaf Gallery
which bought an orientalist painting of a Nubian guard by Ludwig
Deutsch for $163,000.
   The museum has sold paintings before and said it would use the
proceeds from the latest sales to acquire other works better suited
to its collection and to public display.
   During Getty's lifetime, the 15 paintings hung at Sutton Place,
his Tudor mansion in England where he died in 1976.

<HEAD>U.S.-Philippine Alliance: A Century of Military Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines have a unique link to the
United States that began in the Spanish-American War in 1898, when
Adm. George Dewey sailed into Manila Bay, defeated the Spanish navy
and accepted the surrender of Spain's only Asian colony.
   This week, nearly a century later, the military ties were
reinforced when the Bush administration ordered F-4 Phantom jets to
make a show of force to help Corazon Aquino's government defend
itself against an attempted coup.
   The flights over rebel-held basst evidence of a
continuing strong American relationship with the one-time U.S.
colony that is now home to the two largest U.S. foreign military
installations.
   President Bush authorized the U.S. military support early Friday
while en route to Maltes were the latea for the U.S.-Soviet summit.
   Besides air cover from U.S. fighter jets over the rebel-held air
bases, a contingent of about 100 Marines was sent to Manila to help
guard the U.S. Embassy compound there, a Pentagon official said.
   The attempt to oust Aquino was the most serious since she was
swept to power in a civilian-military uprising in February 1986
that forced the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.
   Just a few weeks ago, Mrs. Aquino visited Wasuss the
future of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller
installations. The future of American military bases is considered
the most important and most controversial issue facing the two
countries.
   Some Filipinos view a continued U.S. military presence as an
infringement on Philippine sovereignty and an unwanted leftover
from the former U.S. colonial administration.
   But U.S. officials regard the bases as vital for projecting
American military power throughout Southeast Asian sea lanes and
for stability in the Pacific. The U.S. bases serve as a
counterpoint to Soviet naval forces based in Vietnam.
   The bases are officially under Philippine command but, in
effect, are run by the United States. The Military Bases Agreement
was signed in 1947, the year after the Philippines became
independent, and come up for renewal every five years.
   More than 60,000 Filipinos are employed at the bases, where
about 40,000 U.S. troops and their dependents are stationed.
   The United States has been the Philippine military's main arms
supplier in its 20-year-old battle with communist rebels.
   In October, Vice President Dan Quayle said the administration
might ask Congress to let the Philippines use U.S. foreign aid to
bolster internal security against communist insurgents. Quayle's
comments came after two American military base workers were
ambushed and killed by communist rebels.
   Two years ago, three Americans were killed by communist rebels
near Clark Air Base. Rebels have threatened more attacks because of
U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino's counterinsurgency campaign.
   During Mrs. Aquino's recent visit, U.S. and Philippine officials
signed a $25 million aid agreement to lay the groundwork for
transportation and other infrastructure projects.
   When Mrs. Aquino visited the United States after first taking
office, Congress rushed through a $200 million aid package for the
Philippines. Now, however, some lawmakers believe economic reform
and increased trade would do more to improve Filipinos' living
standards than increased economic aid would.
   The U.S.-Philippine relationship has not been without acrimony
and even bloodshed.
   The Americans forged the alliance with Filipino rebels led by
Emilio Aguinaldo, who had declared independence from Spain two
months earlier. However, pressure mounted in the United States on
President William McKinley to annex the Philippines as a colony and
deny Philippine independence.
   On Feb. 6, 1899, with just a vote to spare, the U.S. Senate
ratified a treaty formally ending the Spanish-American War and
ceding the Philippines to the United States.
   That triggered the Philippine Insurrections, a bloody,
three-year conflict in which, according to Philippine records,
250,000 U.S. troops slaughtered 1 million Filipinos.
   The United States granted The Philippines independence July 4,
1946.

   Five astronauts scheduled to orbit
the Earth on Christmas climbed aboard space shuttle Columbia on
Friday for the final two hours of a successful practice countdown.
   The test, which began Thursday, covered the final 24 hours of an

astronauts, who checked spacecraft communications circuits and
other systems just as they will on launch day.
   ``Everything proceeded smoothly during today's terminal

   Columbia is scheduled to be launched Dec. 18, but officials
report the schedule is tight and liftoff might have to be delayed a
day or two. Shuttle managers will select a launch date next Tuesday
after a two-day flight readiness review.
   During the 10-day mission, the astronauts are to release a Navy

return to Earth a science satellite that has been orbiting the
globe for nearly six years.
   Once the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite is secure in

<HEAD>Court Drops Illinois Abortion Case Pending Formal Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday dropped a
much-watched Illinois abortion dispute from its schedule of cases
to be argued next week.
   An out-of-court settlement was announced in Chicago last week,
eliminating the case that had been viewed as the high court's most
likely opportunity to alter its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   As anticipated, the justices granted a request from both sides
that Supreme Court arguments be deferred pending a formal
settlement. The argument session had been scheduled for Tuesday.
   The settlement must be approved by a federal judge before it
becomes final. The case will remain on the Supreme Court docket, in
limbo, until the judge acts and both sides then ask the justices to
dismiss the case.
   The key issue in the Illinois dispute is a set of strict
regulations imposed on abortion clinics, where most early-pregnancy
abortions are performed. The regulations could have severely
restricted the availability of abortions in that state.
   A federal judge struck down many of the state regulations, and
that ruling was upheld by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan's appeal to the Supreme
Court was accepted for review last July 3 _ the same day the
justices announced, in a Missouri case, a decision giving states
far greater authority to regulate abortions.
   But Hartigan, a Democratic candidate for governor in 1990, later
sought a settlement in which Illinois women would be guaranteed
continued access to abortions.
   The case is Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790.

<TEXT>
   The state House began debate today after a one-day
delay on a tax package intended to raise more than a billion
dollars to fend off deficits resulting from the fizzling of the
``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   Speaker George Keverian lobbied all day Thursday without getting
enough votes to pass the package of sales, capital gains and
gasoline tax increases.
   The first amendment offered today was a proposal to strip a
capital gains tax increase worth $100 million a year from the bill,
which originally totaled $1.2 billion.
   ``This debate is the unfortunate, but inevitable conclusion of
not weeks, not months, but years of actions and inactions that
brought the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this House to this
point,'' Republican leader Steven Pierce said in urging defeat of
the package. Pierce supported the amendment.
   The original House Ways and Means Committee package would have
raised the sales tax from 5 percent to 7 percent, increased the gas
tax by 10 cents over the next two years and hiked the capital gains
tax from 5 percent to 7.5 percent.
   Keverian said Democratic legislative leaders were considering
increasing the sales tax to 6 percent. He said the compromise would
cost $190 million in new revenue this fiscal year and about $400
million next year.
   Most increases would take effect Jan. 1, 1990, but the capital
gains tax hike would be retroactive to last January.
   Keverian said the loss would be made up with additional cuts and
possibly some additional revenue in the tax package. He would not
predict the outcome of a vote on an amendment he expects some House
members to offer to remove the capital-gains tax hike from the bill.
   The tax proposal was attached to a $45 million ``survival
package'' that would restore funds to social service and education
programs.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis indicated he had some reservations about
the package, but urged lawmakers to approve it.
   Dukakis captured the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination in
part by touting his state's economic ``miracle.'' After the
election, Massachusetts' fiscal fortunes plummeted, partly because
of the end of a boom caused by the nation's military buildup.
   He said Thursday he realized taxes were unpopular, but urged
elected officials to take a tough stand and not make only the
popular votes.
   ``If there's anything we've got to have now it's fiscal
stability,'' Dukakis said. ``And that's what this package is going
to bring.''
   Keverian had told several committee chairmen they should resign
if they could not support it. Tax foes, including the House's
Republican minority, decried what they said were strong-arm tactics.
   Several lawmakers said the changes in the tax package were
needed to win support from a majority of the 160-member House.
   ``I think it is clear as the package stands, we are short of the
81 votes needed to pass it,'' said Rep. Marjorie Clapprood, a
supporter of the package.
   News of the package sent taxpayers to their telephones. One of
two switchboard operators at the Statehouse said she was handling
more than 100 calls every 15 minutes.
   Clapprood suggested shutting off the Statehouse switchboard and
locking lawmakers in the House chamber to get the tax bill passed.

<HEAD>Mobil Pleads No Contest In Pipeline Spill Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. pleaded no contest to
misdemeanor charges stemming from two pipeline ruptures that poured
more than 130,000 gallons of crude oil into the Los Angeles River
and the city's sewers.
   The pleas were entered Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court
on two violations of a state Fish and Game code section prohibiting
the release of petroleum or petroleum residue into state waters.
   Mobil attorney Ernest J. Getto said the pleas ``just mean we're
not going to contest the charges.''
   ``It's not at all tantamount to a guilty plea,'' he said.
   The maximum fine for each violation is $1,000. However, City
Attorney James Hahn said he would ask at Mobil's Jan. 4 sentencing
hearing that the company be ordered to pay $100,000 in cleanup
costs.
   ``We asked for the sentencing hearing to be delayed ... in order
to give the various agencies involved in the cleanup of spills the
time to prepare presentations for restitution from Mobil,'' Hahn
said in a prepared statement.
   Agencies involved in the cleanup were the U.S. Coast Guard,
state Department of Fish and Game, Los Angeles Police Department
and Los Angeles Fire Department.
   The first pipeline break occurred Sept. 10, 1988, in the
suburban Encino area and sent 90,000 gallons of crude oil onto city
streets. The oil eventually flowed into the sewers and the Los
Angeles River.
   The second occurred 17 days later as the pipeline was being
repaired.
   The line carries 2.6 million gallons of oil a day from Kern
County oil fields to Mobil's Torrance refinery.
   Temperature changes in the oil caused the pipeline to corrode
and rupture the first time, said Deputy City Attorney Vincent B.
Sato. He said there was no indication of negligence.
   Getto said the company has since revised its monitoring
procedures and has begun replacing older sections of the pipeline.

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state agriculture investigator could
tell by taste that a product marketed as pure maple syrup was
nothing more than corn syrup and helped officials crack a
nationwide scam.
   Bruce Martell, the Vermont Department of Agriculture consumer
assurance supervisor, flew to California last summer to buy
products labeled as maple syrup. Upon returning to Vermont, the
products were tested and found to be 98 percent corn syrup.
   ``This definitely tasted like corn syrup,'' Martell said. ``If
you knew good maple, you would be able to tell right away.''
   Martell passed the information to U.S. Food and Drug
Administration officials. They arrested Nathan Pilgrim, 66, of
DeKalb, Miss., on 12 felony counts of using corn syrup and other
ingredients in products labeled as maple syrup, honey, sorghum
molasses and ribbon cane syrup.
   Pilgrim was arraigned Thursday in Mississippi federal court on
two counts of falsely labeling foods with intent to defraud and
mislead, and 10 counts of shipping falsely labeled foods in
interstate commerce.
   Each charge carries maximum penalties of three years in jail and
$250,000 in fines. Pilgrim was released earlier this week on $1,000
bond.
   The indictment alleged Pilgrim distributed the doctored products
under the name ``Nathan Pilgrim Syrup Farm'' between 1985 and 1988.
The California products bore the name ``Sleepy Hollow Packing Co.''
   Martell said Pilgrim did a ``significant amount of business''
nationwide. Fake products were also found on store shelves in
Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina,
Oregon, Virginia and Washington.
   Martell said Thursday that he flew to California at the urging
of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association and the North
American Maple Syrup Council. The groups also paid for the trip.
   Wilson Clark, president of the 700-member Vermont Sugar Makers,
said Thursday the groups began receiving reports of the doctored
products in 1987. A similar scam was discovered in the early 1980s.
   ``It was all over the place out there, like measles,'' Clark
said. ``There's still a lot of it out there that hasn't been
recalled.''
   Vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the United
States. This year, the industry will produce about 400,000 gallons
of the syrup and generate between $40 million and $50 million,
Clark said.
   Clark said the fake maple syrup hurts both the image and
pocketbooks of Vermont syrup makers. The doctored syrup probably
contained no maple syrup and was being sold for about half the
price of real maple syrup, he said.
   Martell said a product must contain 100 percent maple syrup to
be labeled as ``pure.'' A smaller percentage requires the label to
say ``blended,'' ``flavored,'' or ``sweetened'' and to list the
percentage of maple syrup in its ingredients.

<HEAD>Tom Stoppard's `Artist Descending a Staircase' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 4 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</HEAD>

   Imagine a story that begins at the end and ends
at the beginning.
   That is the tricky dramatic framework Tom Stoppard has devised
for ``Artist Descending a Staircase,'' an intriguing 85-minute
entertainment that arrived Thursday at Broadway's Helen Hayes
Theater.
   The play is small in scale but superbly crafted, down to the
most minute production detail, particularly Tony Straiges'
intricate, Rube Goldberg-like settings. Although it doesn't have
the scope or characterizations of such major Stoppard efforts as
``The Real Thing'' or ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,''
it's a richly rewarding piece of theater.
   The evening is divided into 11 scenes which go from the present
to the past and then back again to the present. Stoppard wrote
``Artist Descending a Staircase'' for the radio 17 years ago, but
it was staged last year at a pub in North London and later in the
West End before making the trek to Broadway.
   ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' is a play about perception.
How three men _ all of them artists _ look at life, love and art.
And their views are just as fractured as the nude in Marcel
Duchamp's famous painting.
   ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' is also a mystery. Who did in
one of the artists, found dead at the bottom of the stairs as the
play opens? The riddle is eventually solved but not before Stoppard
examines the lives of the three men.
   Donner (John McMartin) is a born-again romantic, a one-time
member of the avant-garde who once carved edible sugar sculptures _
``It will give cubism a new lease on life,'' says one of the other
artists _ but who now has returned to more traditional forms of
portrait painting. Beauchamp (Harold Gould) is a ``sound'' artist,
tape recording the noises of everyday life. Martello (Paxton
Whitehead) concentrates on completing a hideous statue of a
long-dead girlfriend, using fake pearls for teeth and pears for
breasts.
   In his journey backward in time, Stoppard also puts the aging
artists' younger selves on stage. They are all infatuated with
Sophie, a blind girl who died in 1922 after falling out of a
window. She was in love with one of them. But which one? Reality is
quite different from belief, Stoppard says.
   The playwright has great fun making fun of artistic pretensions.
``Skill without imagination is craftsmanship,'' sniffs Donner.
``Imagination without skill gives us modern art.''
   McMartin, Gould and Whitehead are an appealing trio of cranky
old artists, particularly Whitehead, who turns Martello's
moroseness into high comic art. Their younger counterparts are
played by Michael Winther, Michael Cumpsty and Jim Fyfe. Their
resemblance to the older men is remarkable. And Stephanie Roth is
appealing as the tragic Sophie, the muse for most of these artists'
careers.
   Tim Luscombe has directed the play with astonishing skill.
Despite the complicated time sequence, it is always clear where and
when the characters are. Straiges' best set is the aging artists'
studio, an almost surreal room filled with old paintings, bicycle
wheels and assorted junk from creating 50 years of art.
   Special mention should go to Tharon Musser's lighting, which
makes the scene changes all the more dazzling, and the music and
sound effects by Kevin Malpass, which are an important part of the
story.
   Stoppard has called the play a love story, but it is more than
that. ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' is a memory play in which
the playwright swirls together the peculiar _ and very different _
memories of three friends and fellow artists. It makes for a heady
mixture, often witty and just a little bit sad.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York York Times: I don't have to tell you
that Mr. Stoppard is clever. In this 85-minute work, that
cleverness is not harnessed to a major play but to an often
stimulating, sporadically funny and, at one uncharacteristic
juncture, genuinely moving investigation of the nature of
perception, memory and art.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' ...
is like a Faberge egg; it is very much an artifact fashioned for
aristocratic temperaments. Its glittering surfaces reflect one
another gracefully, precisely, giving off glints of brilliant
color, hinting at unsuspected depths.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: ... a play of shining wit, gleaming
intelligence and glintingly metallic heart.

   A twin-engine Army plane with four
crew members and a civilian on board crashed into the Patuxent
River today, and no survivors had been found several hours later,
authorities said.
   The CASA-212 aircraft was headed to Patuxent Naval Air Station
from Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia when it crashed about 9:20
a.m., Army spokesman John Ooley said.
   The plane was lying in 45 feet of water early this afternoon
about 50 feet offshore from the air station, Ooley said.
   ``There were rescue boats and helicopters on the scene and
they've not brought anything up yet,'' Ooley said. He would not
identify those aboard until their families had been notified.
   The airplane was assigned to Davison Army Air Field at Fort
Belvoir, said John Romer, Naval Air Station deputy public affairs
officer.

<HEAD>Belzberg, First City Lose Ashland Oil Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that
First City Financial Corp. and businessman Marc Belzberg violated
securities law and must turn over $2.7 million in profits from the
attempted takeover of Ashland Oil Co.
   In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a lower
court decision that the Canadian company founded by the Belzberg
family deliberately evaded federal reporting requirements when
First City purchased Ashland stock.
   Anyone who buys more than 5 percent of a company's securities
must disclose that fact within 10 days to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   On March 4, 1986, Belzberg, a First City vice president,
telephoned Alan Greenberg, chief executive officer of Bear Stearns,
a Wall Street brokerage firm, and discussed buying Ashland stock.
The SEC contended Belzberg asked Greenberg to make the purchase for
First City's account. Belzberg said he intended for Greenberg to
buy Ashland for the brokerage company's own account.
   Greenberg interpreted Belzberg's call as an order to buy Ashland
stock for First City. First City filed the required disclosure
statement on March 26, 12 days after the deadline.
   ``During the period before it unveiled its takeover plan, First
City ... took pains to keep its interest in Ashland secret,'' said
the appeals court. ``The very last thing Belzberg would do in light
of those efforts would be to tout Ashland'' to the Bear Stearns
officer.
   If Belzberg's purpose had been to induce others to buy Ashland,
``he presumably would have contacted more than just Bear Stearns;
he would have openly disclosed his interest in a possible takeover
of Ashland to all of Wall Street,'' said the opinion by appeals
court Judge Laurence Silberman.
   The appeals court said First City must surrender $2.7 million,
representing the company's profits on the shares of Ashland stock
it purchased during the 12 days before it filed the disclosure
statement.
   The lower court reasoned that First City was able to buy its
shares at an artificially low price because the company hadn't
disclosed its stake in Ashland Oil.

<TEXT>
   The family of former kidnap victim Steven
Stayner has filed a $5 million claim against Merced County alleging
negligence in Stayner's fatal accident.
   The claim, filed by San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli, alleges
that Stayner died because the county and the public works
department failed to properly maintain the road where 24-year-old
Stayner was killed when he ran into a stalled car with his
motorcycle in September.
   The county was negligent for not providing warning devices to
caution drivers of the road surface, the claim said. It also said
the road was in an unsafe condition.
   The claim, filed on behalf of Stayner's widow, Jody, and the
couple's two children, was received Monday by the Board of
Supervisors. County Counsel Dennis Myers had no comment.
   Stayner became well known when he was returned to his family at
age 14 after seven years as a kidnap victim.
   The driver of the car Stayner hit has been charged with felony
hit-run driving. Other charges were dropped after it was determined
that a faulty carburetor caused the car to stall.

   President Bush urged Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on the eve of their superpower summit Friday to help mold
``a future free of both tyranny and fear.'' The Soviet leader
concluded a historic Vatican visit with a pledge of new religious
freedoms back home.
   ``Our meeting here off Malta will last two days but the freedoms
that we seek must last for generations,'' the president said in
anticipation of his first summit session with the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev addressed Pope John Paul II as ``your Holiness''
during their meeting. He said people ``have a right to satisfy
their spiritual needs,'' and pledged swift adoption of a new
religious law guaranteeing freedom of worship.
   Bush was the first to arrive for the two days of shipboard
summit talks. But his last-minute summit preparations were
interrupted by an attempted coup in the Philippines, which he
sought to snuff out by committing U.S. air support to forces loyal
to President Corazon Aquino.
   Gorbachev arranged an evening arrival for the summit, taking
place against a backdrop of stunning change in Eastern Europe that
has swept hard-line regimes from power. The two men are also
expected to discuss arms control, trade relations and conflicts
such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua as well.
   Gray clouds, cold weather and choppy seas set the scene for the
talks, being conducted on U.S. and Soviet warships anchored in the
harbor off the coast of this Mediterranean island. Malta's entire
1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police were out in force
to protect the superpower leaders.
   U.S. and Maltese patrol boats circled and frogmen checked the
waters as Bush landed by helicopter on the American guided-missile
cruiser USS Belknap, his command post and the meeting site Sunday
for the summit. The summit will open Saturday morning on the Soviet
guided missile cruiser Slava.
   Beyond promising religious tolerance, Gorbachev said the Kremlin
will establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican. He invited the
Pope to pay a visit to the Soviet Union _ officially an atheist
nation _ although no date was announced.
   Bush talked of the Philippines as well as the summit.
   ``I strongly support Mrs. Aquino and she knows it,'' he said. He
said the situation in Manila ``sounds maybe a little better but ...
hard to tell.''
   During a brief visit to the American aircraft carrier, the USS
Forrestal,
   Bush called Gorbachev ``a dynamic new Soviet leader willing ...
to think anew.
   ``And we want him to succeed,'' the president said. ``Because we
do admire the people in the Soviet Union. And we know that ours is
an historic opportunity to foster the peace.'' Bush expressed hope
that ``ours can be a future free of both tyranny and fear.''
   He presented the Forrestal's crew with a piece of the crumbling
Berlin Wall as ``a symbol of the peace we seek.''
   He watched a demonstration of warplanes being catapulted off the
deck and screeching into the sky. A thunderous sonic boom from an
F-14 caught him by surprise, and Bush's knees buckled and he
ducked. He recovered quickly with a sheepish grin and a funny face
for cameras.
   Gorbachev delivered his promise of religious freedom as he
joined the pope at a news conference in the Vatican.
   ``People of many confessions, including Christians, Moslems,
Jews, Buddhists and others live in the Soviet Union,'' the Kremlin
leader said. ``All of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual
needs.''
   He said a freedom of conscience law would be adopted soon.
   The pope called the meeting a ``promise-filled sign for the
future'' and pledged support for Gorbachev's efforts to overhaul
Soviet society.
   The Malta summit is the first superpower meeting since Gorbachev
met then President Ronald Reagan in New York last December. Bush
attended that meeting as vice president.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III will lead a
six-person U.S. delegation, while Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will lead the eight-person Soviet team.
   Bush, who is expected to make the opening presentation Saturday,
convened a meeting in the Belknap wardroom of senior U.S. advisers,
focusing on issues ``which will demonstrate the U.S. desire for
progress and improvement in East-West relations,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   For his quarters, Bush took over the admiral's three-room suite,
furnished with deep blue carpeting, leather furniture and a
mahogany desk with U.S. and Soviet flags in a holder. A new brass
plaque was on the door, reading, ``President Bush.''
   Echoing statements by U.S. officials, a top Soviet spokesman
said Friday he doubted that any agreements would be signed during
the summit.
   ``I think President Bush is right when he says there will be no
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting,'' said
Valentin Falin, head of the International Department of the Soviet
Communist Party.
   But Falin, an architect of Soviet policy toward Europe, hinted
that Gorbachev would press Bush toward accords on banning nuclear
weapons from the Mediterranean Sea, which the United States
opposes, and for coping with political changes sweeping Eastern
Europe.

   America's NATO allies are keeping a
wary watch on this weekend's summit at Malta, concerned it might
produce a secret superpower agreement on Europe despite President
Bush's promise of ``no surprises.''
   Allies in Western Europe are worried the superpowers could cut a
deal that would include a hefty reduction of U.S. troops from
Europe, say diplomats and analysts.
   ``There's always apprehension among some allies when the big
kids get together,'' said Jane Sharp, senior researcher at the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.
   Added one senior NATO official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity: ``We're in such a critical historical period that
apprehension is running high regardless of what happens. (People)
just don't know what's coming.''
   U.S. allies would be quite content, in fact, to see Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's shipboard summit be a quiet
one, with no dramatic agreements.
   But, while U.S. officials have sought to minimize chances of a
superpower agreement, a top Kremlin official in Malta hinted Friday
that Gorbachev might use the weekend summit to try to nudge Bush
toward accords on the shape of Eastern Europe and on banning
nuclear weapons in the Mediterranean.
   ``The importance of achieving preliminary agreements on a host
of issues, including the Mediterranean and Europe, is of course
great and that is precisely the reason for our meeting,'' said
Valentin Falin, the head of the International Department of the
Soviet Communist Party.
   Bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms control
and that he would not spring any suprises on U.S. allies. The
president also has said he will not discuss Eastern Eurpopean
boundaries with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, however, is known for his unpredictability.
   Compounding the concern to U.S. allies is the memory of the 1986
summit in Reykjavik, when the Soviet leader caught then-President
Reagan off guard by unveilling sweeping arms control proposals. The
talks broke down over the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known
as Star Wars, but not until Reagan and Gorbachev had flirted with a
deal to do away with all nuclear weapons.
   The allies were furious such discussions took place without
consultations.
   ``Everything has been done to prevent that sort of horror
scenario,'' said a senior Dutch official at NATO, who demanded
anonymity.
   The weekend talks in the Mediterranean occur against a backdrop
of momentous political and economic change in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe. The crumbling of hardline regimes in East Germany,
Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, combined with the earlier reforms in
Poland and Hungary, mean the military threat from the East has been
reduced dramatically. At the same time, the question of reshaping
borders and alliances has been raised.
   Wanting to make sure their voices weren't ignored, leaders of
the 12 nations of the European Community called an emergency summit
to discuss the changes in Eastern Europe.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a quick trip to
the United States to talk to Bush. Afterward, she said she did not
expect ``great or unusual pronouncements'' from Malta.
   Added French President Francois Mitterrand: ``It is normal and
desirable that they meet (but) I don't expect them to decide
(anything) in our place.''
   Bush will meet Monday in Brussels with other leaders of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to fill them in on his
talks.
   One NATO diplomat, demanding anonymity, said some Europeans were
concerned that a far-reaching ``kind of mindset or framework or
understanding'' would come out of the superpower summit and lead to
significant cuts in the number of American soldiers on the
continent.
   He said the allies were worried about trimming U.S. forces
beyond the levels under negotiation at conventional arms talks in
Vienna.
   The United States wants to wrap up an accord on conventional
armed forces in Europe by June. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has
raised the possibility of a second set of negotiations to reduce
arms further.
   The Vienna bargaining between NATO and the Warsaw Pact is
designed to reduce the East's overwhelming superiority in tanks and
other conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe. Both sides
would be brought down to equal levels under proposals on the table.
   As part of the talks, Bush suggested that the United States and
the Soviet Union pare their forces in Europe to 275,000 on each
side. That would require the Soviets to pull out 300,000 troops and
the United States 30,000.
   But Cheney left no doubt at a meeting this week of NATO defense
ministers that the United States, under heavy budget pressures,
would like to bring even more soldiers home.

   For sale: Used 12-wheel truck, with trailer. Army
green. Maximum speed 25 mph. Weight 62,000 pounds. Previously used
only for hauling nuclear missiles.
   That was one of the offerings Friday at an unusual Red Tag Sale
put on by the Soviet Ministry of Defense and several semi-public
organizations to recoup some of the cold cash spent in the Cold War.
   The sale items were military support equipment for the
medium-range nuclear missiles destroyed under a 1987 U.S.-Soviet
agreement, and they were on the market as part of the Soviet drive
to reorient its economy from military to domestic needs.
   Items as small as rolls of cable, for as little as $1.85, and as
big as the 12-wheel monster MAZ547-B truck for $49,600 were packed
into an exhibition hall in Moscow's Sokolniki Park, to be sold to
whomever comes up with the most money the fastest.
   ``We want to learn how this equipment can be used in the
national economy,'' said Yuri Vorontsov, a spokesman for the sale.
   One of the sale's organizers, Elvin Kalinin, said more and
different equipment might be offered at later sales, depending on
the success of this first one. In the future, the organizers might
also offer after-sales service, he said.
   As many as 100 potential buyers milled around the drafty
exhibition hall, among them Gennady Gritsevsky, a departmental
director for the government environmental commission, Goskompriroda.
   Gritsevsky was looking for a vehicle to turn into a mobile
environmental laboratory to take to chemical factories, dumps, and
elsewhere. He was facing down another green truck, this one with a
cabin built onto its flatbed.
   The starting price was $21,700, but that's not what was
bothering Gritsevsky. It was just too big, even with modifications
that the government agency figured it could make on its own.
   ``You can't use it on the street,'' he said, and then huddled
with one of the organizers who said the Ministry of Defense might
have something more suitable that it would be willing to sell.
   Another organizer who declined to give his name said they could
get several hundred such trucks from the Defense Ministry if they
could sell them.
   One of the biggest headaches has been pricing the equipment,
Vorontsov said. Although military equipment is very specific and
expensive to manufacture, many of the costs are hidden in the
Soviet economy.
   They hope demand will drive up the minimum prices marked on
white cards by each piece of equipment.
   Kalinin said that under the 1987 agreement with the United
States scrapping both sides' medium-range nuclear missiles, the
Soviet Union is abiding by its agreement to destroy the actual
weapons and other equipment.
   Trucks, electrical generating equipment, voltage regulators, and
a bewildering array of other equipment did not have to be
destroyed. But they are specific enough that the military could not
find another use for it.
   Organizers of the sale believe collective and state farms,
government groups and even foreigners might be willing to lay down
their cash and take it all away. The equipment will be there until
Dec. 10, when the organizers will decide what to do next.
   Money from the sale will be divided between the national
treasury, the Defense Ministry to improve living conditions for
soldiers and help some of the 500,000 who are being mustered out
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's military reductions. A small
portion of the money will go into a fund to help young scientists.
   One of the groups in the exhibition hall was a small delegation
from Tanzania. Just looking, they said.

   President Bush, from his shipboard
summit headquarters, kept a close watch Friday on an attempted coup
in the Philippines after sending U.S. jet fighters into action to
help beseiged President Corazon Aquino.
   Bush ordered F-4 fighters from Clark Air Force Base to provide
air support and to prevent aircraft from taking off from two
Philippine air bases held by rebels. A contingent of 100 Marines
was also sent from a U.S. base in the Philippines to help protect
the U.S. embassy compound in Manila.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that no
U.S. planes had ``fired any shots or intercepted any rebel
aircraft.'' Rear Adm. Edward Sheafer of the Defense Intelligence
Agency said ``the goverment forces seem to be prevailing'' in the
struggle with the rebels.
   ``We are hopeful the situation will be contained,'' Bush told
reporters soon after arriving here for his weekend summit with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretary
of State James A. Baker III added. ``We have provided some air
support, air cover.'' He sa id that what the Aquino government had
asked for.
   Bush ordered the air support to help protect the Aquino
government during his overnight flight here from Washington aboard
Air Force One. The quick help came in response to a request from
Aquino, who spoke by telephone with Vice President Dan Quayle in
Washington.
   The president received updates on the situation from his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Bush was told
government forces had retaken one air field and that trouble spots
were being cleaned up, but the coup attempt was still in progress,
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   The president's decision to grant U.S. military aid came
quickly, just hours after rebels bombed the presidential palace in
Manila in the most serious effort to oust Aquino since she came to
power in 1986. Bush had come under some criticism _ principally
from Democrats in Congress _ for not acting more decisively in
taking advantage of September's failed coup attempt against
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush's
decision to intervene was twofold: ``A democratic government has
asked for assistance; We have American lives to protect.'' He said
Aquino was ``in a safe place'' but he wouldn't say where, and that
the U.S. planes were still flying into the early morning hours in
the Philippines.
   Bush's decision won strong bipartisan support from members of
Congress. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called
it ``prudent and in our national interest.''
   The president looked tired, and while he told reporters he was
ready for the weekend summit with Gorbachev, the threat to the
friendly government in Manila appeared to dampen his spirits on a
rainy day.
   Before a session with Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami,
Bush said that Mrs. Aquino ``sounded fine'' when she took a
telephone call from Quayle in Washington.
   Still, even limited U.S. military intervention could damage the
complaint Bush planned to lodge with Gorbachev about a continuing
flow of Soviet weapons to rebels in El Salvador.
   The United States charges delivery of the arms, including
anti-aircraft launchers, by Cuba and Nicaragua are only one example
of Soviet mischief-making in the Third World.
   Arkady Maslennikov, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet,
criticized Bush's decision to order air support. ``We are against
such an interference. Any interference in internal developments,
especially by outside powers, is destructive and leads toi
deterioratio of the situation.''
   ``In any event, the best thing is to allow the Filipios
themselves to sort it out,'' he said.
   Fitzwater indirectly acknowledged that the U.S. actions amounted
to intervention. He said: ``If the tide is turning and the coup is
beginning to die out there would be no need for further
intervention.''
   Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said U.S. forces
``were not in the thick of anything. They are simply providing air
cover. That's all we have been requested to do.''
   In a statement issued from Air Force One as Bush flew to this
island nation, Fitzwater said Mrs. Aquino had requested the U.S.
military assistance.
   ``This assistance is intended to allow the democratically
elected government of the Philippines to restore order. The
president also is determined to protect the lives of Americans in
the Philippines,'' his statement said.
   Mrs. Aquino, in Manila, said, ``Even now, U.S. fighters are
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops. Once
more, two Pacific democracies stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the
defense of freedom.''
   A Bush administration official said the U.S. fighters were
authorized to fire ``only if (rebel) planes are attempting to take
off from these two bases, but that would be only after repeated
warnings.''
   The Reagan and Bush administrations gradually increased U.S.
assistance to the Philippines as a means of bolstering Mrs. Aquino
in a country beset by grinding poverty. The United States maintains
two bases in the Philippines, the vast Subic Bay naval base and
Clark air base.
   Meanwhile, the CIA has reported that some senior Philippine
officials are worried that entire segments of their armed forces
supposedly loyal to Aquino will fail to ``fight effectively'' in
fending off the rebels attempting to topple her government, an
administration source reported today.
   The Central Intelligence Agency, in its daily intellgence
summary prepared for top U.S. officials, reported on Friday that
the situation in the Philippines was ``quite uncertain,'' said the
official, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.

   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, the
mild-mannered poet and painter who engineered the fall of the
modern world's oldest political dynasty, was born to be king.
   Instead, he'll be India's next prime minister.
   For more than two years, Singh stalked the dusty backroads of
India, fiercely campaigning against corruption he said had
overwhelmed daily life and derailed effective government.
   Wherever he went, he was cheered and embraced as the``'Rajah
Sahib,'' or ``king, sir.''
   And even though he said he really didn't want the job, Singh on
Friday was named prime minister and chosen to lead the National
Front, the opposition alliance that ousted Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
   The process to choose a leader was long, at times bitter and
included serious challenges. But Singh said that's the way it
should be.
   ``When India became independent, it became a democracy in name
only,'' Singh said during the monthlong campaign that preceded the
Nov. 22-26 elections.
   ``The government went to the Nehru-Gandhi family and it has
remained a dynasty,'' he said, referring to Jawaharlal Nehru,
Gandhi's grandfather and India's first prime minister. ``The
government won't belong to me. I will belong to the government and
the people.''
   Singh, 58, has been part of Indian politics since the early
1970s, but political analysts say he changes his ideological color
so often and with such deftness that it has become almost
impossible to put him in a category.
   A man who jealously guards his private life, Singh lives a
simple life _ driving around in a chugging, belching Ambassador
sedan and wearing traditional white cotton tunic-pajama suits.
   He does not project the commanding presence of India's former
leaders and seems to disappear in the crowds who swarm around him.
   But image isn't important, he said.
   ``I have always taken the stand that we have to shift from
personal appeal to issues. That is the way a democracy matures,''
he said.
   When Singh was 5, his father, the Rajah of Daiya, gave him to
the childless Rajah of Manda. He grew up in one of the most
palatial outposts in northern Uttar Pradesh state, but childhood
was lonely.
   Not allowed to see his real family for years, the shy young boy
turned to poetry and painting.
   After his adoptive father died six years later, a bitter legal
battle ensued over the estate, and Singh was escorted everywhere _
even to school _ by armed guards. He eventually inherited the
estate, becoming the king of tiny Manda.
   Singh gave away his small kingdom to members of the lower castes
long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971 by Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   He entered politics and became a loyal member of the Congress
Party, handpicked and groomed by Mrs. Gandhi for public service.
   When a young, idealistic and politically inexperienced Rajiv
Gandhi became prime minister in December 1984 two months after his
mother's assassination, Singh was his first choice for finance
minister.
   Singh immediately initiated sweeping economic reforms, allowing
foreign investment into India and overseeing a new awakening of the
Indian economy. His efforts have helped the country's once stagnant
economy grow about 5 percent a year.
   He also launched a series of highly publicized tax raids against
powerful businessmen, winning a reputation as a crusading avenger
but causing trouble for Gandhi.
   The prime minister removed Singh as finance minister and named
him defense minister in 1987 _ a step many saw as Gandhi's
surrender to influential businessmen who contributed to Congress
Party coffers.
   The change also came at a time when some of Gandhi's closest and
most trusted advisers and ministers either resigned or were forced
out of government and out of the Congress Party.
   When Singh resigned and was expelled from the party later that
year, his departure proved to be the most damaging.
   Shortly afterward, Swedish and Indian newspaper and radio
reports disclosed the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid as
much as $50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a $1.4
billion contract to supply the Indian army with artillery guns.
   Gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing, and the charges have never
been proved, but they raised serious questions about the integrity
of a prime minister once hailed as ``Mr. Clean.''
   After leaving office, Singh continued to call Gandhi his trusted
friend and leader. But gradually he became Gandhi's harshest
critic, his main challenger and the Congress Party's principle
tormentor.
   He was embraced by opposition parties as their savior and
eventually he did what most thought impossible _ unite the
fractious opposition parties into one cohesive fighting machine.

   The new chairwoman of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Friday that the government had more than
doubled recalls and other actions against dangerous toys and
children's products in this year.
   Delivering the CPSC's annual toy safety advisory, chairwoman
Jacqueline Jones-Smith said 254 toys and 119 children's products
had been the targets of recalls or corrective actions this year,
compared to 111 toys and 39 children's products in 1988.
   The commission made no recommendations against purchasing any
specific toys but advised people buying gifts for children to be
``mindful of the developmental level of the child'' in making their
selections.
   The agency offered theese tips for selecting and using toys:
   _Before buying a riding toy, be sure there is a safe place for
the child to ride it.
   _Keep games with small parts _ including marbles and balls _
away from young children, especially youngsters who tend to put
things in their mouths.
   _Don't allow unsupervised children to play with uninflated or
broken balloons, which could slip down a child's throat and choke
him.
   _Remove crib gyms and attached mobiles from a baby's crib as
soon as the youngster is five months old or can push up on his or
her hands and knees.
   Jones-Smith also said that more than a million ``unsafe toys
never made it to retail shelves'' because they had been seized in a
joint CPSC-Customs Service program.
   She noted the commission's nearly year-long lack of a quorum,
for which critics have chided the Bush Administration, and told
reporters:
   ``We are here today at full strength, energized and ready to
move. Reports of the commission's death were not premature _ they
were wrong.''
   Last week, the Consumer Affairs Committee of the Americans for
Democratic Action declared the CPSC ``officially dead'' because of
the ten-month lack of a quorum, which ended when Jones-Smith was
sworn in.
   Ending her first week on the job, Jones-Smith said the CPSC ``is
indeed alive and well and moving forward to enforce product safety
laws.''
   She acknowledged, however, that she had not developed priority
issues or programs for the commission to pursue.
   Commissioner Carol Dawson said the CPSC ``will act quickly to
dispose of pending business before it.''
   That includes a staff evaluation and recommendations on a
petition to ban crib gyms and developing methods to test the safety
of disposable cigarette lighters around children.
   The agency announced three toy recalls Friday.
   Two bicycles _ the Mountain Jr. 16-inch sidewalk model 1615,
imported from Taiwan by California-based Ming Ta Supply U.S.A., and
the BMX sidewalk models 121 and 124, manufactured by Texas-based
Sante Fe Trading, Inc., were recalled. Several safety features
missing from both bikes make them hazardous to young children, the
commission said.
   Also recalled were more than 8,000 eight-shot and 12-shot ring
caps manufactured by texas-based Daisy Manufacturing Co. and
distributed through Wal-Mart stores nationwide since October. The
agency said the caps may ignite prematurely from friction or if
dropped.

   Queen Elizabeth II, who prides
herself on being punctual, apologized to guests kept waiting for 25
minutes in the cold for the opening of an army regimental museum.
   But she had a good excuse.
   ``I came through fire, frost and fog to get here,'' she said.
   The queen, who is colonel in chief of the Royal Green Jackets,
was in Winchester, Hampshire, to open the regiment's newly extended
and refurbished museum.
   The royal car had to be diverted in west London because of a
fire and was then further delayed by fog on the M3 motorway.
   In her speech outside the museum, the queen recalled this was
the second time she had been invited to speak to the regiment
outdoors on a wintry morning, and said: ``It's a tribute to the
hardiness of the Green Jackets.''

   Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, whose new album, ``A
Crescent City Christmas Card,'' highlights his New Orleans'
beginnings, scoffs at artists who scout the world in search of
musical roots or influences.
   ``That's fake,'' Marsalis said in the Dec. 1-3 issue of USA
Weekend. ``Most of that stuff is based on racial exploitation. In
order to deal with the music of another culture, you have to be
that. You know, I could listen to some Chinese music and give you a
facsimile of it, but it's not going to have the soul of that
music.''
   In the same issue, Branford Marsalis blamed the media for
reports of a rift between him and his brother when he quit Wynton
Marsalis' band to play with Sting in 1985.
   ``The press tries to trip you up. Wynton just doesn't answer and
I answer with a joke, so he's arrogant and I'm the fun-loving
one,'' Branford Marsalis said. For the record, he added, ``I'm more
arrogant and opinionated than him.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor is finding that crime doesn't
pay.
   The actress got more publicity from her notorious cop-slapping
trial in Beverly Hills than from any entertainment projects in
years, but book, movie and TV offers don't appear to be flooding in.
   Miss Gabor, a onetime Hungarian beauty queen, was sentenced to
serve three days in jail and perform court-ordered community
service after she was found guilty of slapping a police officer
trying to issue her a traffic citation.
   A videotape documenting her trial, which was punctuated by
frequent outbursts from the actress, hasn't been a hot seller, said
Tower Records video sales clerk Mark Elliott. ``From what I can
see, nobody's buying it.''
   ``Who wants to run Zsa Zsa pictures now?'' said celebrity
photographer Peter Borsari. ``I even couldn't sell one of Milton
Berle putting his hand over her mouth that was taken at Sidney
Sheldon's party at Jimmy's.''
   A publicist for Miss Gabor, Phil Paladino, said sales of the
face cream and cubic zirconia gift set bearing her name have
slumped.
   Miss Gabor is to appear in two movies, said agent Cal Ross, but
the parts were signed before the trial. A deal for an
autobiography, negotiated before her arrest, is in limbo because of
editorial differences, Ross said.

   Luciano Pavarotti's need for sleep
silenced a noisy construction project in Portland this week.
   The tenor arrived Tuesday in Portland, two days before he was to
sing for a benefit concert for the Portland Opera. At a news
conference shortly after his arrival, Pavarotti said that sleep was
important to protect his voice.
   The Oregonian newspaper reported that the manager for the
Heathman Hotel, where Pavarotti was staying, was so concerned about
his sleep that she got a pile-driver to stop operating near the
building.
   The paper said hotel manager Mary Arnstad called the owner of
the Hoffman Construction Co., which is building a 23-story building
across from the hotel, and asked that crews quit using the
pile-driver from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday and Thursday,
and the owner agreed.

   Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas were so into
their roles as a quarreling couple in ``War of the Roses'' that
they had to make up daily.
   ``We made a point of saying to each other at the end of the day,
`It's OK, I still like you,'' Turner said in an interview in the

   Douglas and Turner, first paired in ``Romancing the Stone,''
play an unsympathetic divorcing couple in ``Roses.''
   While the two say they are friends, things were not so cozy when
Turner first refused to do ``Jewel of the Nile,'' the sequel to
``Stone.''
   The two stars met to work out differences.
   ``We got drunk and said we hated each other, that we would never
agree on this but that it was fine,'' said Turner, who made the
sequel. ``And obviously we resolved it because here we are.''

   A bet on a diet turned into an all-star

it scares me,'' Lasorda said.
   His ``Tommy Lasorda Grand Slam Variety Show'' at the Grand Ole

   They offered to donate $10,000 each to his favorite charity if
Lasorda could lose 30 pounds by the All-Star break in July. The
Dodger manager ended up losing 40 pounds and decided to help the

   Kitty Dukakis put her own troubles behind her when
she was honored as New England Woman of the Year in recognition of
the help she has given homeless people and refugees.
   The wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis appeared Thursday night at
her second public engagement in as many days since her
hospitalization last month after drinking rubbing alcohol.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, accompanied by her husband, said her work and
the experiences of those she's helped ``illustrate how lives can be
changed when we work together. Facing life's challenges can be
difficult and extremely stressful.''
   In 1983, Dukakis named his wife to head his committee on
homelessness. She was instrumental in pushing for a statewide
network of community-based family shelters. In January 1983, there
was only one family shelter statewide; today there are more than
100.

   Maltese, old and young, skipped
work and cut school Friday to catch a glimpse of the American
president they hoped would focus the world's attention on their
tiny island nation,
   Maltese security kept the crowds away from the airport hanger
area when Bush arrived during a cold rain. But several thousand
lined the streets near the Auberge Castile, the 16th Century palace
where Bush talked with Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami. Some
cheered, some shouted his name and a few stood singing the Maltese
national anthem as Bush emerged from the palace and waved to the
crowd.
   Hundreds of other people gathered along the shoreline or on
roads along the cliffs that overlook the bay where Bush will meet
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev aboard Soviet and American
warships over the weekend.
   ``I can't believe he is coming to here, to Malta. He is such a
big man, an important man. We are so lucky,'' said Marika Galea, a
22-year-old Maltese housewife.
   ``This is very important because we are a small island and now
all over the world, because of television and newspapers, everyone
in the world will know what Malta is,'' she said.
   Bush was greeted at the airport by Maltese President Vincent
Tabone, Prime Minister Fenech Adami and a military band and honor
guard that stood in the rain for more than an hour in their full
dress uniform while waiting for the American leader.
   After the brief ceremony, Bush left by helicopter for the
meeting at the Auberge Castile and then to the aircraft carrier USS
Forrestal in the Mediterranean.
   Aboard the carrier Bush dined with the enlisted men in their
mess and watched flight operations from an outdoor platform high
above the flight deck. Bush had been waving to the crew and
standing at mock attention when a jet crossed low in front of the
carrier at supersonic speed.
   The enormous sonic boom startled the president. He ducked, his
knees buckled and then he turned and smiled at the TV cameras with
a sheepish grin.
   From the carrier, Bush flew directly to Marsaxlokk Bay and the
USS Belknap, the guided missile cruiser where Bush will host the
Kremlin leader for talks and a state dinner Saturday night.
   Two Maltese patrol boats kept small boats away from the Belknap
and the Soviet missile cruiser Slava, which is anchored a few
hundred yards in front of the American ship. Navy frogmen dove
beneath the Belknap or motored around a few hundred yards away in
small rubber boats.
   Maltese soldiers armed with automatic rifles patrolled the
shoreline and cliffs above the bay. Two sharpshooters stood atop a
16th Century watchtower that looks out over the bay from a cliff
that marks the closest point of land to the warships.
   ``This is something we may never see again,'' said Mansel
Cappell of Liverpool, England, as the president's helicopter landed
on the Belknap. He said he and his wife spent two hours taking two
city buses to reach a fishing village by the bay.
   ``We came to see this great day and to take a picture,'' he
said. ``Then, when we go home we can say we were here in Malta.''
   ``I'll keep this in my mind, I'll never forget,'' said Mrs.
Galea as she strained through binoculars to see the president
aboard the warship.
   Others at Marsaxlokk took a more commercial view of the summit.
One man hawked summit T-shirts from the back of a van in front of
the watch tower and others sold sandwiches, cold drinks and donuts.
   One enterprising Maltese, John Itso, did a brisk business
selling white china plates emblazoned with a picture of either the
Slava or the Belknap. Before the president arrived, he sold 400 of
the 500 plates he brought to Marsaxlokk on Friday.
   ``We worked all night to get these out,'' said Itso, ``but we've
had quite a good sale.''

   The union representing Boeing Co.'s engineers and
technical workers will give its members a chance to vote on a
company contract offer, though it won't recommend passage or
rejection, a spokesman said today.
   Dan Mahoney, general counsel for the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, said negotiations concluded
Thursday night between Boeing's second-largest union and the
company, which is the world's biggest commercial aircraft
manufacturer.
   He said negotiators agreed ``to transmit the company's offer to
the membership'' without endorsement.
   Mahoney would not give details of the contract other than to say
it contains ``a lot of significant improvements.''
   The engineers' union represents nearly 28,000 Boeing workers,
with nearly all its members in the Seattle area. It has been in
talks to reach a new three-year contract since Oct. 17.
   ``What the negotiators did was to virtually rewrite two very
long and complex collective bargaining agreements,'' said Walt
Baer, the union's executive director and chief negotiator.
   One agreement, he said, covers more than 15,000 engineers and
scientists, and the second affects more than 12,000 technical
employees.
   Members of Boeing's largest union, the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, ratified a three-year contract
on Nov. 20, ending a 48-day strike.
   The Machinists' new contract included annual wage increases of 4
percent the first year, 3 percent the second and 3 percent the
third, a cost-of-living formula to account for virtually all
inflation, plus bonuses of 10 percent the first year, 5 percent the
second and 4 percent the third.
   Engineers' union negotiators agreed to the vote at about 9 p.m.
Thursday, three hours before the contract was to expire.
   The union originally sought a 35 percent salary boost over three
years, but later scaled back demands.
   Neither the union nor Boeing released details of the offer.
   ``The only thing I can give you is that the talks concluded,''
Boeing corporate spokesman Paul Binder said. ``We are pleased that
they have reached a conclusion and we look forward to a favorable
vote by the membership.''
   Mahoney said the union was going to try to withhold release of
details until a Dec. 10 membership meeting at the Seattle Coliseum.
The union will vote by mail on the contract offer, with ballots to
be counted Dec. 18, he said.
   The union has never struck Boeing. Under its contract, its
members were required to continue working through the machinists'
strike.

<HEAD>Hrawi Tries to Avoid Showdown Between Aoun and Syrians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's new president, has
asked the United States, Soviet Union and France to convince Gen.
Michel Aoun to avoid another battle with Syrian forces, a source
close to Hrawi said Friday.
   He said Hrawi said he was ``trying to avoid a military showdown,
but at the same time, he is determined to regain control of all
government institutions in the Christian area.''
   Hrawi sent letters to President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and French President Francois Mitterrand, asking that
they urge Aoun to leave the presidential palace, the government
source said.
   ``The president was elected to supervise implementation of a
peace plan, not to declare war,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Aoun, who opposes the peace plan, wants
war.''
   He was referring to a peace accord worked out by Lebanese
lawmakers in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October. Aoun rejected it
because it did not include a specific timetable for withdrawal of
the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in Lebanon.
   An-Nahar, an independent newspaper, said France had asked the
United States and Soviet Union to ``exert relentless efforts to
prevent a new military collision in Lebanon.'' France governed
Lebanon under mandate for more than 20 years until independence in
1943.
   Young Christians maintained a human shield Friday around the
presidential palace, where Aoun has his living quarters and command
post in a bunker.
   Aoun led a Christian government in competition with a Moslem
cabinet while Lebanon was without a president for 14 months. He
refused to leave the palace in Baabda, a Christian surburb east of
Beirut, after Hrawi was elected by Parliament and dismissed him as
army commander.
   Other Christians in cars demonstrated in the Ashrafiyeh district
of east Beirut to support Samir Geagea, who has pledged the 6,000
men of his Lebanese Forces militia to help Aoubn defend the
310-square-mile Christian enclave against a Syrian attack.
   About 20,000 Christian troopers of the Lebanese army followed
the general in a six-month artillery war with the Syrians that
killed nearly 1,000 people, nearly all of them civilians.
   The youths at the palace sang Lebanon's national anthem and
waved placards with such slogans as ``Syrians go home'' and ``The
general is our only leader.''
   Geagea's supporters carried placards reading ``The leader of
free Lebanon.''
   The militia leader, whose group is the largest Christian
fighting force outside the army, said he was against armed conflict
and told supporters at an east Beirut school: ``With dialogue we
can solve any problem.''
   In Jerusalem, military and political leaders said Friday a
Syrian buildup in Lebanon over the past several days did not
threaten Israel and a Syrian attack on Christian forces was not
likely to bring an Israeli response.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said: ``Israel will
not act as long as its essential interests are not threatened. At
this stage, they are not.''
   Hrawi, a Christian the Syrians support, was elected a week ago
and formed a national reconciliation government led by Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, to implement the peace plan.
He dismissed Aoun as armed forces commander Tuesday and replaced
him with Adm. Emile Lahoud.
   Aoun contends that Hrawi's election was unconstitutional and has
refused to accept his decisions.
   Syria has sent thousands more soldiers into Lebanon, along with
tanks and artillery, apparently getting ready for a showdown with
Aoun. The Syrians have been in Lebanon since 1976, the year after
Lebanon's sectarian civil war began, under a peacekeeping mandate
from the Arab League.

<TEXT>
   Maltese, old and young, skipped
work and cut school Friday to catch a glimpse of the American
president they hoped would focus the world's attention on their
tiny island nation,
   Maltese security kept the crowds away from the airport hanger
area when Bush arrived during a cold rain. But several thousand
lined the streets near the Auberge Castile, the 16th Century palace
where Bush talked with Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami. Some
cheered, some shouted his name and a few stood singing the Maltese
national anthem as Bush emerged from the palace and waved to the
crowd.
   Hundreds of other people gathered along the shoreline or on
roads along the cliffs that overlook the bay where Bush will meet
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev aboard Soviet and American
warships over the weekend.
   ``I can't believe he is coming to here, to Malta. He is such a
big man, an important man. We are so lucky,'' said Marika Galea, a
22-year-old Maltese housewife.
   ``This is very important because we are a small island and now
all over the world, because of television and newspapers, everyone
in the world will know what Malta is,'' she said.
   Bush was greeted at the airport by Maltese President Vincent
Tabone, Prime Minister Fenech Adami and a military band and honor
guard that stood in the rain for more than an hour in their full
dress uniform while waiting for the American leader.
   After the brief ceremony, Bush left by helicopter for the
meeting at the Auberge Castile and then to the aircraft carrier USS
Forrestal in the Mediterranean.
   Aboard the carrier Bush dined with the enlisted men in their
mess and watched flight operations from an outdoor platform high
above the flight deck. Bush had been waving to the crew and
standing at mock attention when a jet crossed low in front of the
carrier at supersonic speed.
   The enormous sonic boom startled the president. He ducked, his
knees buckled and then he turned and smiled at the TV cameras with
a sheepish grin.
   From the carrier, Bush flew directly to Marsaxlokk Bay and the
USS Belknap, the guided missile cruiser where Bush will host the
Kremlin leader for talks and a state dinner Saturday night.
   Two Maltese patrol boats kept small boats away from the Belknap
and the Soviet missile cruiser Slava, which is anchored a few
hundred yards in front of the American ship. Navy frogmen dove
beneath the Belknap or motored around a few hundred yards away in
small rubber boats.
   Maltese soldiers armed with automatic rifles patrolled the
shoreline and cliffs above the bay. Two sharpshooters stood atop a
16th Century watchtower that looks out over the bay from a cliff
that marks the closest point of land to the warships.
   ``This is something we may never see again,'' said Mansel
Cappell of Liverpool, England, as the president's helicopter landed
on the Belknap. He said he and his wife spent two hours taking two
city buses to reach a fishing village by the bay.
   ``We came to see this great day and to take a picture,'' he
said. ``Then, when we go home we can say we were here in Malta.''
   ``I'll keep this in my mind, I'll never forget,'' said Mrs.
Galea as she strained through binoculars to see the president
aboard the warship.
   Others at Marsaxlokk took a more commercial view of the summit.
One man hawked summit T-shirts from the back of a van in front of
the watch tower and others sold sandwiches, cold drinks and donuts.
   One enterprising Maltese, John Itso, did a brisk business
selling white china plates emblazoned with a picture of either the
Slava or the Belknap. Before the president arrived, he sold 400 of
the 500 plates he brought to Marsaxlokk on Friday.
   ``We worked all night to get these out,'' said Itso, ``but we've
had quite a good sale.''

<HEAD>Suspended Tribal Leader's Son Surrenders to Court Appearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of suspended Navajo Chairman
Peter MacDonald pleaded innocent Friday to two conspiracy counts in
tribal court after failing to appear for two arraignments last
month.
   The appearance of Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. came one day
after special prosecutors hired by the tribe asked the tribal
District Court for an arrest warrant to have young MacDonald
returned to the reservation. The prosecutors were hired to
investigate alleged wrongdoing in the 1987 Navajo purchase of an
Arizona ranch and other matters.
   Rocky MacDonald's attorney, Donald Benally, told tribal District
Judge Robert Yazzie that the younger MacDonald's failure to appear
before was ``based on a misunderstanding.''
   Benally previously asked the court to dismiss charges against
Rocky MacDonald, saying that the tribe had no jurisdiction over him
because the younger MacDonald has lived in Phoenix and San Jose,
Calif., off the reservation.
   Special prosecutor Mark Donatelli called Rocky MacDonald's
appearance Friday ``too little too late'' and ``deceptive military
tactics.''
   Yazzie released Rocky MacDonald on his own personal recognizance
but ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer. That
requirement was requested by Donatelli.
   Rocky MacDonald also agreed to sign an extradition waiver
agreeing to not challenge extradition in the future by the Navajo
courts.
   He declined to comment.
   The conspiracy charges are related to some of the 107 counts
filed Oct. 11 by special prosecutors against his father, Peter
MacDonald. The elder MacDonald was charged by special prosecutors
with conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law
violations.
   Most of the criminal charges against Peter MacDonald focus on
the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch from non-Indian
middlemen who made a $7.2 million profit on the property.
   Peter MacDonald pleaded innocent Wednesday, and a Jan. 29
pretrial hearing was scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Despite having his plays banned
from the Communist stage for 20 years, Vaclav Havel has proved he's
still able to bring down the house, with crowds roaring for the
author.
   Now he wants to go quietly back to work.
   Havel thundered with such passion before 300,000 countrymen at
Wenceslas Square on Nov. 23 that his voice was a harsh rasp when he
reached his climax: ``We will never return to the old system of
totalitarian rule.''
   But a principal question facing Czechoslovakia is whether the
53-year-old playwright and dissident, the Civic Forum's leading
symbol of change, will veer off into politics.
   ``Absolutely not, he wants to remain in the background and
write,'' said Ivo Niederle, an actor who has known Havel since he
was a young stagehand banned from higher study because of his
bourgeois roots.
   Havel himself shuns interviews and public statements about his
plans, playing a role as negotiator of reform with a government
which earlier this year put him in jail for ``anti-Socialist
activities.''
   But he was lionized on his release from jail, swamped with
well-wishers. A gigantic party at his posh apartment overlooking
the Vltava River marked a turning point for intellectuals who
shaped the Civic Forum, the nation's leading opposition movement.
   For those who know Havel, the enigmatic double role _ fiery
reformer and retiring artist _ is only normal.
   He is shy, given to bowing his head when overwhelmed by
admirers. Unfailingly polite, he focuses attention on anyone who
sits down with him. He is short, with a shaggy ginger mustache,
partial to black jeans and sober jackets.
   But the chain-smoking and rum-drinking playwright can be
flamboyant, carousing in Prague's lively pubs or at the modest
country house he calls ``Hradecek,'' _ little castle. Havel
recently exchanged his silver Volkswagen for a white Mercedes, with
``Civic Forum'' emblazoned on the door.
   By Czechoslovakian standards, Havel is wealthy from foreign
royalties. ``Largo Desolato'' opened at the Bristol Old Vic in
London and played all over the world, and other plays appear
regularly.
   Havel has won the Olof Palme Prize in Sweden for perpetuating
the late Swedish leader's ideals, Holland's prestigious Erasmus
Prize for his contribution to European culture and the Frankfurt
Book Fair award.
   He is a leading contender for the Nobel Prize, as an author but
also as one of Eastern Europe's most eloquent philosophers on the
moral failings of Communism.
   In the 1950s, Havel first clashed with Stalinist Communists who
were suspicious of his background. Engineers in his family built
some beautiful buildings in prewar Prague. Havel's uncle owned the
Barrandov film studios.
   Barred from higher education, he got his diploma at night
school, working in a chemical laboratory by day.
   His first plays, subtle but pointed, made authorities squirm
only slightly. ``Memorandum,'' a witty mix of the Kafkaesque and
theater of the absurd, invented a whole new language for a building
full of rigid thinkers.
   In the 1960s, Havel was active in the Czech Writers' Union, a
driving force behind the ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 which, though
heady and filled with promise, was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   Since then, none of his plays has been seen in Czechoslovakia.
   In 1977, Havel helped found Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldest
human rights group. He served a brief period in jail then, and was
imprisoned for four and a half years beginning in 1979.
   He agonized over the ordeal in his ``Letters to Olga,'' his wife
since 1964.
   After his last release, he said, ``Probably in the West I would
be poor and less famous, but I could just write.''

<TEXT>
   Bill Pinkney wants to sail the world on winds
that carry dreams of hope back to school children in some of
Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. But months after his scheduled
departure, the boat he'll sail remains at dock.
   ``The worst seas I'll face are the ones I'm facing right now,
being this close and having it not happen,'' said Pinkney, 54, who
hopes to become the first black to sail solo round-the-world via
the treacherous waters off the Cape of Good Hope.
   ``If the boat breaks at sea, that's something that can be
calculated. Kids can understand that,'' he said. ``It's hard to
explain to a kid why something like this trip can't happen.''
   After three years of fundraising, Pinkney is $250,000 short of
an estimated $350,000 needed for the 11-month trip _ an
instructional voyage that has the blessing of Chicago's schools.
   By telephone and computer link-up from sea, Pinkney plans to
give lessons ranging from simple geography to trigonometry. The
instruction would include ``the science of why things float _ and
more complicated matters: how boats are built, why boats sail,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   ``He came to see me ... when he had put together his plan,''
said Margaret Harrigan, who heads the Chicago Board of Education's
office of instructional support. ``I thought it would be a
marvelous boost for our education program.''
   ``We could find relevance in all areas of the curriculum _
science, geography, literature,'' subjects that could become more
meaningful because of their association ``with a real live Chicago
hero.''
   Pinkney grew up in a single-parent family in a poor neighborhood
to become a marketing representative for Johnson Products Co., one
of the nation's largest black-owned businesses. He now devotes
himself full-time to the sail, supporting himself through a
commercial bakery he owns with his wife.
   He has managed to attract funds from, among others, the
MacArthur Foundation and Motorola Inc., but he's far short of the
$240,000 price of the boat plus expense money for his trip. He is
presently leasing the 47-foot cutter, ``Commitment,'' a
single-masted sailing ship with two foresails.
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Pinkney, who has the
``Commitment'' in storage. ``What I'm talking about is so little
money in the scheme of things. A television commercial costs
$250,000.''
   Ted Seymour, a black American, circumnavigated the globe by sail
in 1987. Pinkney, who has been sailing 26 years, said he would be
the first black to accomplish the feat by way of the Cape of Good
Hope, at Africa's southern tip.
   For some children he's approached, the delay seems unfathomable.
   At a South Side school in the shadow of some of the nation's
largest housing projects, some students ``think we have our
priorities wrong,'' said science teacher Joan Preer.
   ``The kids think: we have money to spend for everything except
for the things that would be truly important to American
citizens,'' said Preer, who teaches the seventh grade at the
Beasley Academic Center, a public school.
   ``The kids have asked me, but I haven't been able to give them
any answers as to why he hasn't left yet.''
   Pinkney recently attended a convention of the National Black
School Educators, hoping to attract districts across the nation. He
hopes that the more schools he signs up to participate in the
ship-to-shore classroom, the easier it will be to attract sponsors.
   He has interested some more affluent schools, but basically, it
is impoverished minority children who ``need to see that someone
that has a similar background to them ... can rise above it,'' he
said.
   Pinkney, who originally hoped to sail in October, now aims to
launch ``Commitment'' from New York this spring.
   He admits the planned departure time for the 10,000 mile trip is
optimisitic, ``but it was optimistic to start with zero and get
this far.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in
his clearest endorsement yet of the changes in Eastern Europe, said
Friday the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement of 1968 was ``right at
that time and is right now.''
   But he stopped short of an apology for the Warsaw Pact invasion
of Czechoslovakia that put down the reform movement in 1968. He
said it must be viewed in the context of an accelerating arms race
and an ideological struggle between East and West at that time.
   ``Not only myself but many people in the Soviet leadership
entirely accept that at that time it (the reform movement) was a
process of democratization, of renewal of society and that was
important and right at that time and is right now.''
   He added that ``political methods were not fully used'' in the
Kremlin's dealing with the situation and that led to a ``not quite
appropriate response.''
   Gorbachev spoke at a news conference in this business center at
the end of his three-day state visit to Italy and on the eve of his
summit meeting off Malta with President Bush.
   He said his call Thursday for convening of another 35-nation
Helsinki Conference next year was prompted by the ``pace of change
in Europe and the world.''
   ``The time has come for all of us to sit down together to
discuss approaches and criteria on which we should further develop
the Helsinki process'' for security and cooperation in Europe.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, who joined Gorbachev at the news
conference at the Sforzesco Castle, said he attributed Gorbachev's
extraordinary popularity in Italy to the Soviet leader's efforts to
end what the Italian called a decades-long nightmare.
   ``For decades we have lived in a nightmare, not only a nuclear
nightmare but of distrust and suspicion that either side might blow
up the world.''
   In wishing Gorbachev well in his shipboard summit with Bush, he
said, ``the whole world now is taking a deep breath.''
   Gorbachev repeated his concern about a possible reunification of
East and West Germany.
   He said the existence of two German states is recognized by the
United Nations and is based on a fundamental principle that ``every
nation is sovereign in deciding its borders.''
   He said the present events in opening the border between the two
Germanys ``opens many opportunities for contact.''
   But he added ``let history decide'' whether the two eventually
will become one.
   ``Let us not push or force the processes that are not yet
mature.''
   The news conference ended abruptly when Andreotti announced that
one of Milan's airports was closed by fog and the other might be
soon. He urged Gorbachev's entourage to leave quickly in order to
be on time for the shipboard meeting with Bush.

   Dozens of AIDS activists shouting ``Where is
George?'' were arrested Friday after they sat in the street in
front of the White House to protest what they say is President
Bush's lack of leadership.
   Many of the 78 arrested are directors and top officials of AIDS
groups from across the country who say their organizations need
more money for prevention efforts and to continue providing health
and social services to a growing number of people with AIDS.
   ``Rhetoric is not what we need. Action is what we need,'' said
Tim Sweeney of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York told about
200 protesters who gathered in Lafayette Park across from the White
House at a rally marking World AIDS Day.
   ``We do not have the resources in our groups to meet this
challenge,'' said Paul Boneberg, executive director of Mobilization
Against AIDS, a San Francisco group. ``We see people who need
treatment but who are denied treatment ... We see discrimination
still across the country, and there's no government response. It's
shameful.''
   Speakers at the rally mocked Bush's statement, issued Thursday
for World AIDS Day, in which he expressed compassion for people
with AIDS and said the government is committed to continuing
virorous research efforts.
   Protesters shouted, ``Lies, lies, lies.''
   Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council,
graded Bush's efforts to fight the AIDS epidemic, giving him an
``F.'' She said he failed to increase access to new treatments that
can prolong the lives of people with AIDS and did not provide
enough money for prevention and education as well as research and
health care for people with the disease.
   ``All you can give him is an `F' for a national AIDS strategy,''
she said. ``Moving into this second decade, there is no excuse not
to have one.''
   More than 112,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States since the first cases were identified in 1981, and more than
66,000 have died. No one is known to have recovered from the
disease, which is spread primarily through sex and needles shared
with infected partners.
   The Public Health Service has estimated that more than 1 million
Americans may have already been infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   AIDS activists say the growing number of people with AIDS is
already straining health care services and that this burden is
guaranteed to get worse in the 1990s as more of those infected with
HIV become sick with AIDS.
   ``If your compassion doesn't move you, let your calculator move
you,'' Sweeney said.
   After the rally, demonstrators walked to Pennsylvania Avenue,
which had been blocked off by police, where some protesters used
chalk to draw the outlines of bodies in the street. They then sat
down, joined in chanting with the rest of the crowd lining the
street and waited to be arrested.
   Police who made the arrests wore rubber gloves, a standard
precaution District of Columbia police have taken in any mass
arrest since a 1987 AIDS demonstration, as they handcuffed the
protesters, some of whom had to be dragged to waiting buses.
   Police said 78 people were charged with blocking a public
roadway, the maximum penalty for which is 90 days in jail and a
$250 fine.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court is being asked again
to strike down rules that on Jan. 1 will give local TV stations the
right to stop cable TV systems from carrying some syndicated shows,
an attorney said Friday.
   John Cole, who is representing Tulsa, Okla.-based United Video
Inc., said he had petitioned the U.S. Appeals Court for the
District of Columbia to stay the implementation of new syndicated
exclusivity, or syndex, rules, which opponents claim will cause
massive headaches for cable operators and reduce the opportunities
for viewers to watch some of their favorite TV shows.
   A three-judge panel of the court in October denied an earlier
request for a stay, and then on Nov. 17 denied the overall
challenge to the rules. Cole said he was seeking a review by the
panel or by the full court on First Amendment grounds.
   He claimed the panel's reasoning was ``unique in the annals of
this court as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, and indeed
contradicts the consistent constitutional precedent of each.''
   He claimed the rules, which the Federal Communications
Commission in 1988 decided to reimpose after an eight-year lapse,
violate cable operators' First Amendment rights.
   Officials for two other parties in the original challenge,
Tribune Broadcasting and the Community Antenna Television
Association, said Friday they were admitting defeat and were not
appealing.
   United Video relays by satellite Chicago ``superstation'' WGN to
cable television systems nationwide. Other TV stations also are
distributed to cable systems nationally or regionally.
   In some cases that means a cable system may be showing its
subscribers ``Green Acres,'' for instance, from both the distant
and local TV stations. The new rules would let the local stations
claim exclusive rights to a syndicated program, therefore forcing
companies like United Video or cable operators to black out
portions of the distant signals.
   Opponents say many cable systems, rather than incurring the
expense of blacking out programs, will drop the distant stations
entirely.
   ``The subscribing public is the one that's going to get hurt
most on this,'' CATA President Stephen Effros said. He saw no
chance for a successful appeal given the court's 3-0 vote on Nov.
17.
   Broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences
and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less
incentive to develop syndicated programming.
   The opponents claimed that the FCC does not have the authority
to impose the new rules under the 1976 Copyright and 1984 Cable
acts, and that the rules violate cable's First Amendment rights.
   But Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald said the cable companies were
``claiming that they have a First Amendment right to express
themselves using the copyrighted materials of others.''
   Cole, however, said the court had cited no precedent for
government to ``restrict communicative transmissions, whatever the
subject matter, without minimally inviting the traditional scrutiny
of the First Amendment.''

<HEAD>Judge Suggests Clearer Guidelines in Subway Panhandling Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday that a rule banning
panhandling in the subway system is too vague and suggested it be
rewritten.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand made the statement during a
hearing in a lawsuit that challenges the prohibition on begging as
a violation of the constitutional rights of homeless and needy
people.
   Sand reserved decision on a request for an injunction barring
the Transit Authority from enforcing the regulation.
   At issue in the lawsuit is a provision that bans ``solicitation
of alms'' but allows solicitation in certain areas of the subway
system for charitable, religious and political causes.
   The judge said he was bothered by the distinction between the
solicitation of alms and solicitation of charitable contributions.
   ``One is a synonym of the other,'' he said. ``Perhaps clearer
guidelines are needed here so each transit officer doesn't have to
be a First Amendment expert.''
   After the judge's comments, Susan Weiner, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority's deputy general counsel, agreed to stop
distribution of posters and pamphlets that say panhandling in the
subway system is illegal.
   Thousands of the posters and pamphlets were distributed after
the TA began its ``Operation Enforcement'' in October. The program
calls for the enforcement old and new regulations and has been
criticized by advocates for the homeless as an effort to sweep the
homeless out of the subways.
   The judge said he wanted the MTA to discuss a possible
compromise with the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which
brought the class-action lawsuit.
   Sand asked the parties to submit more written legal arguments.
No new court date was set.

   Members of Congress and senior government
executives are getting a hefty raise from a new ethics law that
will also bar members of the House _ but not senators _ from
accepting fees for speeches starting in 1991.
   President Bush signed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 Thursday
evening before leaving the White House for Malta and the weekend
summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush said in a statement that the new law ``contains important
reforms that strengthen federal ethical standards'' and generally
hews to the principles he spelled out soon after his inauguration.
   It also creates different pay scales and standards for senators
and members of the House. Senators can keep making speeches for up
to $2,000 per appearance, but they won't get the big pay raise of
$24,000-plus that members of the House voted for themselves in 1991.
   The legislation will raise top government salaries by 35 percent
over the next 13 months, with House salaries jumping from $89,500
to $96,600 in 1990 and to more than $120,000 in 1991, plus a
cost-of-living adjustment. The 435 members of the House will be
barred from accepting outside speaking fees starting in 1991.
   Senate salaries would climb in 1990 from $89,500 to $98,400, but
there will be no automatic increase in 1991.
   Federal judges and top executive branch officials also would get
an immediate 4.1 percent raise and 3.6 percent compounded on that
on Feb. 1, 1990, as a catchup for two years without a cost of
living adjustment.
   At a minimum, even if there were no inflation in the next year,
House salaries would rise to $120,700 on Jan. 1, 1991. Assuming a
COLA of about 3 percent, House salaries would be $124,400 _ 39
percent above current levels.
   After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be
made automatically based on the government's index of
private-sector wages and salaries.
   House employees and other top federal executive and judicial
officials would be barred from accepting speech fees beginning in
1991. Currently, House members are limited to earning speech fees
equivalent to 30 percent of their salary; senators may make up to
40 percent.
   Income earned outside the House by members and top staff would
be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991.
Officials could not receive directors' fees, legal fees or other
income for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt
from the limits.
   The new legislation also creates conflict of interest rules for
congressional staff and imposes new limits on gifts that members
and staff may receive. They generally will be barred from accepting
gifts costing more than $200 a year from anyone outside their
family.
   The legislation also abolishes in 1993 a clause that allowed
House members in office by 1980 to keep leftover campaign
contributions when they retire. Some House veterans have hundreds
of thousands of dollars in campaign chests.
   Bush said the legislation goes ``far to carry out the ... ethics
reform principles I set forth in January.''
   He said the federal ethics standards had to be ``exacting enough
to assure that public officials act with the utmost integrity and
warrant the public's confidence; fair, objective and consistent
with common sense; equitable all across the three branches of the
federal government; and not unreasonably restrictive so as to
discourage able citizens from entering public service.''

   Raisa Gorbachev on Friday switched from a
red dress that raised eyebrows at the Vatican to a green one as she
flew to Milan, one of Europe's fashion capitals.
   The Soviet first lady, normally known for her fashionable
clothes, surprised Italians with her austere look and few changes
of clothes during a three-day state visit to Italy.
   Contrary to the hopes of many Milanese designers, Mrs. Gorbachev
did not go shopping in Via della Spiga, Milan's fashion boulevard.
Shopping in the luxury, downtown street of this northern city was
not part of her official program but had been considered likely.
   Instead, the enthusiasm of swelling crowds, which slowed down an
crowded schedule for Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife in Italy's
economic capital, forced her to cut short her private tour.
   Mrs. Gorbachev joined her husband for his historic meeting with
Pope John Paul II at the Vatican wearing a red dress and going
against normal protocol of dressing in black. She changed,
apparently on the flight to Milan, into a business-like green
outfit.
   Hundreds of Milanese, including city art superintendent Rosalba
Tardito, waited in vain for Mrs. Gorbachev in chilly weather
outside Santa Maria delle Grazie church, in whose refectory
Leonardo da Vinci painted ``The Last Supper.''
   The visit to the fresco was canceled at the last minute because
Mrs. Gorbachev had been running behind the schedule after paying
homage to the Milanese home of the late Soviet artist Nicola Benois.
   About 300 people shouted ``Raisa! Raisa!'' when Mrs. Gorbachev
laid a bouquet of flowers below a marble plaque dedicated to
Benois, who had worked for several years with Milan's La Scala
opera house after leaving his native country.

<DATELINE>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African President F.W. de
Klerk was greeted by hundreds of children singing ``Long live
dialogue!'' before he met Friday with President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny.
   Houphouet-Boigny met de Klerk as he stepped off the plane in the
95 degree heat in Yamoussoukro, the president's native village, for
the talks.
   South Africa and the Ivory Coast don't have formal diplomatic
relations, but they do have close trade ties. South African
Airways, barred from flying over most of the continent, is
permitted one flight a week to Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory
Coast.
   A front-page editorial in Friday's government-controlled daily
Fraternite Matin appeared to rule out closer diplomatic relations
for now.
   It said South Africa would not be able to normalize relations
with other African nations until it frees imprisoned black
nationalist Nelson Mandela, lifts the country's state of emergency,
and begins talks with legitimate representatives of the black
majority.
   The newspaper said Houphouet-Boigny would urge de Klerk to
``advance resolutely on the path of reforms already undertaken and
whose echo has already begun to shake the citadel of apartheid.''
   ``Everthing depends on de Klerk. ... Does he have the means to
follow through on this policy? Apparently yes,'' the newspaper said.
   Houphouet-Boigny has long advocated talks with South Africa to
dismantle that nation's legal system of racial separation known as
apartheid. But he also opposes sanctions to force South Africa into
giving equal rights to blacks.
   The newspaper said South Africa's strong economy and
technological base can help the continent. South Africa already has
supplied Ivory Coast with animals for a national park, a project
close to the heart of Houphouet-Boigny.
   The Ivory Coast's economy has been near collapse because of the
fall in prices for its main exports, cocoa and coffee, and needs
substantial aid.
   Thousands of people lined the wide avenues of Yamoussoukro to
welcome de Klerk on what was called the first official visit by a
South African head of state since the early 1970s. Buses brought
many to the town, 120 miles north of Abidjan.
   Houphouet-Boigny wants to make the village the nation's capital.
He already has built several large, ornate buildings, and workers
recently completed construction of a basilica that rivals St.
Peter's in the Vatican in size.
   De Klerk was scheduled to leave Saturday morning.

<HEAD>Rebels Took Over Homes of 3 U.S. Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas took over
the homes of two U.S. Embassy officials during their invasion of
San Salvador's affluent neighborhoods this week, diplomatic sources
said Friday.
   They also occupied the house of a former U.S. defense attache
who now works for the Salvadoran military, the sources said.
   The U.S. embassy believes that, in the case of one of the
diplomats and the former attache, the rebels stormed and occupied
the houses at random, as they did with more than two dozen other
homes in the wealthy districts invaded before dawn Wednesday.
   But they suspect the third house, described as that of a
``high-ranking official,'' was a specific target.
   They would not identify the resident of the sprawling home in
the San Benito neighborhood, a half-mile from the residence of U.S.
Ambassador William Walker. The house was a charred shell after
combat in and around it between leftist rebels and government
forces.
   Diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
residents of the home retreated to a ``safe haven'' in the house
when they realized it was under attack. They said the residents
were never in rebel hands and that government forces forced the
guerrillas to retreat and then rescued the Americans.
   It was unclear if the retreating rebels set the house afire or
if it caught fire as a result of the combat.
   Journalists who inspected the burned house after the fire was
put out Wednesday found mail on the floor addressed to a person
with the surname Hultslander.
   Embassy spokespeople refused to confirm that a person of that
name lived in the house, or even worked at the embassy.
   Because the resident was described as a high-ranking embassy
official and because no journalist, even those in El Salvador for
years, knew that an embassy official lived there or knew of an
official named Hultslander, the suspicion was that the house was
that of a high-ranking officer of the CIA or another intelligence
branch.
   In Escalon, an affluent neighborhood next to San Benito, rebels
before dawn Wednesday took over the houses of midranking political
officer Vince Carver and George Maynes, a retired U.S. Army colonel
and former U.S. defense attache here.
   Both men left their homes shortly after 6 a.m. Thursday during a
truce declared by the rebels to permit evacuation.
   Carver identified himself as a U.S. diplomat when the rebels
broke in. He was allowed to take refuge with the maid in her room
at the rear of the house, where they stayed most of the next 26
hours. Street fighting outside was fierce at times.
   The burned hulk of a light tank destroyed by a rebel rocket sat
just down the street from Carver's house. The facade of the
diplomat's house, like most houses on the street, was scarred with
bullet holes, and the door appeared to have been blown open.
   Guerrillas had abandoned the house by the time Carver and his
maid left Thursday morning.
   Maynes' wife, Rosy, told The Associated Press on Thursday that
when she and her husband emerged from their home guerrillas
remained in the rear of the house and were treating some wounded
there.
   Diplomatic sources said the rebels apparently never knew that
Maynes, a New Mexico native who speaks fluent Spanish and who has
spent many years in Central America, was a retired U.S. Army
officer or former attache.
   Maynes teaches at the Salvadoran armed forces School of Military
Studies.

<HEAD>Defense Attorneys File Complaint Against Prosecutor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys have filed a complaint with
the Justice Department against an assistant U.S. attorney who
prosecuted a Texas company in a scandal involving the U.S. Postal
Service.
   The complaint, submitted Thursday to the Office of Professional
Responsibility, accuses prosecutor Joseph Valder of misconduct in
the investigation and prosecution of Recognition Equipment Inc. and
two of its former executives, sources familiar with the matter said
Friday.
   If the director of the Justice Department office, Michael
Shaheen, decides an inquiry is warranted, it could result in a
recommendation to the attorney general that Valder be fired or
reprimanded.
   U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb acquitted the
defendants Nov. 20 midway through a criminal trial, saying the
government had failed to show that REI and the accused executives
knew about a 1985 payoff scheme involving Peter Voss, then vice
chairman of the postal service's Board of Governors.
   Based on a recommendation from Voss, REI hired Michigan
consultant John Gnau while the Dallas, Texas, firm was competing
for a $400 million mail-sorting equipment contract. Gnau then made
payoffs to Voss. After an investigation by postal inspectors, Gnau
and Voss both pleaded guilty in 1986 to participating in the scheme
and were sent to prison.
   According to the sources, the complaint by lawyers for REI and
the executives, William Moore and Robert Reedy, alleges that Valder
never allowed government witnesses to inform a grand jury that they
had not told REI executives about the payoffs to Voss. Moore was
the company's chief executive officer and Reedy was marketing vice
president. The allegations were first contained in a motion filed
by the defense attorneys Nov. 2 in U.S. District Court. The motion
sought dismissal of the indictment on grounds of prosecutorial
misconduct.
   A copy of the Nov. 2 motion was attached to the complaint sent
to the Justice Department, said the sources, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   The complaint to the Justice Department agency, according to the
sources, also raises questions as to whether Valder told his
superiors _ U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens and criminal division
officials at the Justice Department _ that REI executives had not
been told of the payoffs. The defense attorneys met with Stephens
and Justice Department officials last year in an attempt to stave
off indictment.
   Justice Department spokesman Joseph Krovisky declined to comment
and said Shaheen would neither confirm nor deny that a complaint
had been received.
   Defense attorneys Robert Bennett, Charles Stillman and John
Cooney alleged in their motion that Valder gave witnesses in the
case access to the grand jury testimony of other witnesses, a
violation of federal rules of criminal procedure.
   The government denied the allegations, calling them
``meritless'' and asserting that there was no unauthorized
disclosure of grand jury material.
   The judge acquitted the defendants and never ruled on the motion
concerning prosecutorial misconduct.
   Although the criminal case against REI is over, the firm has at
least nine lawsuits pending against it seeking more than $100
million in damages in connection with the scandal involving Voss.
Class-action civil suits filed by various shareholders allege the
company violated securities and racketeering laws in its efforts to
get the mail-sorting equipment contract.

<HEAD>Nude Sunbathing Lobby Gets Cold Shoulder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal that the Tennessee Valley
Authority set aside some land for nude sunbathing is getting a
chilly reception from the federal utility.
   The American Sunbathing Association of Kissimmee, Fla., which
boasts about 35,000 members nationwide, has launched a drive to
open up federal land for sunbathing in the buff.
   The group has hired a lobbyist for $65,000 and even established
a political action committee called NUDEPAC to carry the nudist
case to Washington, D.C.
   ``We feel that federal land can easily be divided between nude
sections and non-nude sections, which it already is in practice in
some areas,'' said Arne Erikson, the group's head. ``This is
already very common in Europe.''
   One of the agencies the group wants to talk to is TVA, which has
more than 400,000 acres available for public use.
   But David Pack, manager of operations and maintenance for TVA's
public lands, said the agency isn't ready to allow nude sunbathing
on any of it. ``We view such activity as in violation of local
ordinances and take the proper steps to get local authorities to
correct it.''
   Actually, said Pack, ``we've not had any real problem with this
and we've not ever been approached by any nudists requesting any
areas be set aside for them.''
   Erikson said nude sunbathing is legal at several state parks in
Oregon and Texas and the National Park Service already allows such
activity at several parks.
   ``We're trying to do what we can to convince these agencies to
recognize that nude sunbathing is neither a moral nor a social
problem and it can be properly managed,'' said Erikson.
   Representatives of the group plan to meet with National Park
Service officials next week to ask that beach areas be reserved for
nude sunbathers.
   ``There are no federal laws that prohibit this activity, but we
do adhere to local ordinances,'' said George Berklacy, director of
public affairs for the park service.
   The only exception to the government's hands-off policy,
Berklacy said, came in 1985 when the park service banned nude
sunbathing at a Cape Cod beach ``for environmental purposes''
because people trampled the dunes trying to peek at the nudists.
   ``The naked truth is that we don't intend to write regulations
permitting nude sunbathing,'' Berklacy said.

<TEXT>
   Museums and galleries across the nation dimmed their lights,
draped sculptures in black and stripped their walls of modern art
masterpieces Friday to mourn the artists lost to AIDS and the
contributions they might have made.
   ``Our aims are to honor and recognize friends and colleagues who
have died or are dying, and to seek greater support and
understanding from an ill-informed and sometimes hostile public,''
said Thomas Sokolowski, director of the Grey Art Gallery in New
York and a member of Visual AIDS, which organized ``A Day Without
Art'' to coincide with the World Health Organization's second AIDS
Awareness Day.
   Hundreds of art institutions participated in the observance
across the country, organizers said. They hoped the focus on the
artistic contribution of AIDS victims would emphasize that AIDS is
not just a disease of minorities and drug addicts.
   In New York, numerous art galleries closed for the day or
temporarily darkened their halls. At the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Picasso's ``Portrait of Gertrude Stein'' was removed and a
placard was put in its place to explain the loss the art community
is experiencing because of AIDS.
   Elizabeth Taylor, chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, told reporters at the Museum of Modern Art that the day
``draws attention to the terrible loss in the artistic world.''
   She said the observance, however, was just a small reminder of
the plague, ``and everybody in this world needs to be reminded time
and time again.''
   ``The point of `A Day Without Art' is to refer metaphorically to
loss and to try to get more people as concerned with the loss from
AIDS as it is often, with, say, earthquakes and other tragedies
that occur,'' said Philip Yenawine, director of education at the
museum and co-chairman of the nationwide project.
   Subway riders found a colorful downtown mural covered with black
paper.
   ``The original mural is full of life and dancing and colorful
figures, and now it's covered in black paper,'' said the mural's
artist, Ross Lewis. ``People have come in and affixed names of dead
friends on index cards.''
   In Malibu, Calif., the J. Paul Getty Museum honored Samuel
Wagstaff Jr., a collector and curator with close ties to the museum
who died of AIDS in 1987.
   The museum darkened its photo exhibit and instead set up a wall
display featuring a photograph of Wagstaff with a sign asking
patrons to ``contribute your time or other resources to
organizations in your community involved in research, education and
care for people with AIDS.''
   ``There was a lot of staff sentiment that we should do
something,'' said Getty spokeswoman Deborah Gribbon. ``We wanted to
make a serious statement and one that had a special connection to
us.''
   Wagstaff also was mourned at the Detroit Institute of Arts,
where he was its curator of contemporary art from 1968 to 1971. A
sculpture obtained by Wagstaff was draped in black.
   In Washington, about 70 demonstrators were arrested Friday after
they sat down on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House to
protest what they called the government's lack of leadership in the
AIDS epidemic.
   Those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200
people who attended a rally marking World AIDS Awareness Day. The
demonstration came a day after President Bush declared that
education is the nation's best weapon against AIDS.
   Elsewhere, the AIDS Project Los Angeles planned to gather with
blue candles and lights Friday evening. David Willers, national
director of the Blue Lights campaign, said Dec. 1 marks his first
birthday without his twin brother, who died of AIDS.
   ``I was always impressed with blue lights,'' said Willers. ``At
airports, blue lights guide planes down. True blue is a loyalty
color. When I was in the navy during the Vietnam War, the blue
color meant that it was a safe harbor for a ship to pull into. Blue
is a healing color.''
   Similar observances were held in Atlanta, where The Arts
Exchange gallery was closed; in Pittsburgh, where lights were
dimmed for 10 minutes at The Carnegie Museum of Art; in Seattle,
where large black shrouds were hung over many downtown sculptures;
and in Los Angeles, where visitors to the Museum of Contemporary
Art and the County Museum of Art found the usual admission fees
waived and were asked instead to donate to the AIDS Project Los
Angeles.
   In New Orleans, the NO-AIDS task force displayed children's
artistic conception of AIDS. One simply had the word ``choose''
between the words ``AIDS'' and ``life,'' said Lisa Lee, a member of
the task force.
   As of the end of October 1989, the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had recorded a total of 112,241 cases of AIDS in
the United States, with 66,493 deaths.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II
swept away decades of hostility between Rome and Moscow on Friday,
with the Soviet leader promising religious freedom at home,
agreeing to diplomatic ties with the Vatican and inviting the
pontiff to visit.
   The first meeting between a Kremlin chief and a pope was rich in
both symbolism and concrete results. Gorbachev obtained a pledge
from John Paul to support his perestroika reform policies.
   Both men were beaming throughout most of the two-hour visit,
clearly aware of what Gorbachev called a ``truly extraordinary
event'' and the Polish-born pope ``a sign of the times ... that is
rich in promise.''
   Gorbachev heightened the drama of the events by departing from
his prepared text to disclose he had invited the pope to the Soviet
Union, a country which historically has disparaged religion.
   ``I want to announce that we discussed a future visit of the
Roman pontiff to the Soviet Union,'' he said in Russian following
the lengthy 70 minutes of private talks at an oak desk beneath a
religious painting in John Paul's library.
   The pope did not mention the trip in his public remarks. But a
Vatican communique said he thanked Gorbachev for the invitation and
voiced hope that developments would allow him to go.
   John Paul has frequently spoken of his desire to travel to the
Soviet Union, but on condition he could visit his flock throughout
the country. He has disclosed on two occasions he had been barred
from going to Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the
Soviet Union.
   A Soviet trip has also been linked to the pope's ability to
visit the Ukraine, where the Ukrainian Catholic Church was
suppressed by Josef Stalin in 1946 and forcibly merged with the
Russian Orthodox Church.
   There are more than 4 million Catholics in the Ukraine who until
recently practiced their faith clandestinely.
   A major step toward legalizing the Ukrainian Church was
announced Friday by a top local official in the Ukraine. Nikolai
Kolesnik of the Soviet republic's Council on Religious Affairs said
from Kiev that regional officials have decided Ukrainian Catholics
could register with authorities like other religious groups.
   The Vatican statement said the pope told Gorbachev he hopes
Ukrainian Catholics would be granted full religious freedom.
   ``I don't know when, but certainly the pope will be going some
day to the Soviet Union,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
``The situation must evolve in such a way that the pope could go to
the different places he wants to go, the places where there are
Catholics.''
   The Vatican estimates there are up to 10 million Catholics in
the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev and the Vatican statement said the two men agreed to
establish official ties at a level to be worked out by diplomats.
The Holy See had diplomatic relations with Czarist Russia but they
were broken after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said Moscow is addressing church issues
``in a spirit of democracy and humanism and within the framework of
perestroika'' and that all confessions ``have a right to satisfy
their spiritual needs.''
   He pledged that a new religious law guaranteeing freedom of
worship will be adopted shortly.
   At a news conference later in Milan before departing for Malta,
Gorbachev said religious freedom should become ``a fundamental part
of perestroika.''
   He said he and the pope stressed the importance of moral values
and often used the same words and expressions in talking of their
vision of the world.
   ``We spoke of perestroika and I heard words of support from the
pope for what our people are doing now,'' he said. ``This
understanding is obviously important.''
   John Paul referred to the ``painful trials'' that Soviet
believers have suffered in past decades. But he said Gorbachev's
visit was a ``promise-filled sign for the future'' for all
believers in the Soviet Union.
   ``On their behalf _ whether they be of the Latin, Byzantine or
Armenian rite _ I express the fervent hope that they be able to
practice freely their religious life,'' he said.
   Once the Catholics are free, the pope said, they could work for
better relations with the Russian Orthodox.
   The Orthodox have opposed the legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, partly because they stand to lose hundreds of
churches and thousands of followers they gained after the 1946
persecution.
   In a cautious response to Friday's meeting, Rome-based Ukrainian
Catholic leader Myroslav Lubachivsky said he hoped the church's
demands for full religious freedom would be met and he offered to
cooperate with the Russian Orthodox.
   The pope, in a speech partly in Russian and the rest in Italian,
said he is wishing for the success of Gorbachev's reforms and said
the Vatican is ready to support ``every initiative'' to protect the
rights of people and ensure peace.
   He said he was praying that Gorbachev's weekend summit with
President Bush will ``lead to a new understanding, one based upon a
careful heeding of the needs and aspirations of peoples.''
   Gorbachev, who addressed the pope as ``Your Holiness,'' wore a
dark pin-striped suit for the visit, that began with a greeting
from bemedaled Vatican dignitaries and a heel-clicking salute from
a detachment of Swiss Guards, the pope's ceremonial army.
   In the closed-door talks, the two men were alone for the first
five minutes, speaking in Russian, and then were joined by
interpreters. The pope switched to Polish and Italian at times,
while Gorbachev continued in Russian, Vatican officials said.
   As reported by Navarro, Gorbachev told the pontiff after the
private discussions, ``We realize we are talking with the highest
religious figure in the world, but one who is also a Slav.''
   The spokesman reported the pope laughed and said, ``Yes, the
first Slavic pope. But I think it was Providence that prepared the
way for our meeting.''
   Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, wore a red dress that raised eyebrows
as Vatican protocol normally calls for women to wear black. But she
appeared at ease as she viewed Vatican artworks while her husband
talked with the pope.
   Later, the pope gave her a gold rosary and presented her husband
with a reproduction of a mosaic of Christ on the tomb of St. Peter.
Gorbachev gave the pope two 14th century volumes of the Psalms from
Kiev.

   Princess Diana chatted and joked with AIDS victims
Friday as she opened a new ward at St. Mary's Hospital on World
AIDS Day.
   ``She was so visibly concerned, and she gave enormous confidence
to people who otherwise feel alienated and cast aside,'' said Dr.
Anthony Pinching, a clinical immunologist at the hospital.
   ``A handshake from her is worth 100,000 words from us,'' he said.
   The ward has 20 beds, 16 for people with AIDS or the virus that
leads to AIDS, and was designed after consultations with AIDS
patients.
   Diana sat on patients' beds, clasped their hands and listened to
their stories.
   She commented on the brightly colored shorts worn by one
patient, a 28-year-old barman with badly scarred and bandaged legs.
When he said they were his ``daywear,'' the princess replied, ``God
knows what you wear at night.''
   Full-page advertisements warning that thousands of people in
Britain don't know they are infected with the AIDS virus appeared
in newspapers Friday.
   ``We know of 11,218 people in the U.K. who have been infected
with the virus that leads to AIDS. It's the number we don't know
that is even more worrying,'' said the ad, placed by the
government's Health Education Authority.
   Experts have estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people in
Britain are infected with the virus.

   An attorney asked a court Friday
to allow U.S. Embassy officials to meet with his American client
who is accused of possessing 16.74 ounces of marijuana and faces
the death sentence if convicted.
   Kerrey Lane Wiley of Sacramento, Calif., is being held on the
tentative charge at Pudu Prison in Kuala Lumpur.
   Under Malaysian law, a person can be tentatively charged until a
firm charge has been drawn up, working out details such as what
section of the law allegedly was violated.
   Karpal also sought permission to meet privately with Wiley and
to allow a psychologist to examine him.
   Karpal made the same request at the magistrates court here where
Wiley appeared Thursday. The magistrate turned him down.
   Wiley, 37, teaches computer programming at a college in Hawaii.
He was passing through Malaysia and visiting a friend when he was
arrested Nov. 4.
   No date was set for the higher court to hear Karpal's appeal,
but Wiley's next court appearance was scheduled Dec. 28.
   Karpal said he hoped by then the attorney general would have
decided whether to charge Wiley with trafficking, which mandates
the death penalty, or another law that carries a lighter sentence.
   In Malaysia there is no need to prove trafficking. Mere
possession of 200 grams, or 7.05 ounces, of marijuana is deemed to
be trafficking.
   The stringent law was introduced in 1975. Since then, 244 people
have been sentenced to death. Of these 81 have been hanged,
including two Australians and a Briton. The others are awaiting
dates for hanging or appeals.
   Wiley was the first American to be charged under the law.

<HEAD>Pancreatic Cancer Again Strikes Former President's Family</HEAD>

   A cancer researcher said Friday he is concerned
about Jimmy Carter's health now that the former president's last
surviving sibling is reported ill with pancreatic cancer, the same
disease that killed his father, a brother and a sister.
   ``We recommend a CAT scan of the pancreas or an ultrasound for
people who are at very high risk, such as Jimmy,'' said Dr. Henry
P. Lynch, a professor of medicine at Creighton University School of
Medicine in Omaha, Neb.
   While only about 6 percent of pancreatic cancer victims have a
family history of the disease, those who do have it in the family
are several times more likely to get it than the general
population, said Lynch, who recently completed a study of 18
families with 47 members having pancreatic cancer.
   Further studies are needed for scientists to pinpoint if the
tumors found in family members are similar and if there is a gene
that makes those family members get cancer from a common
environmental factor, Lynch said.
   Gloria Carter Spann, Carter's sister, was released Friday from
Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the 62-year-old Plains
resident had been diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer, said a
statement from Dr. Martin York.
   Lynch said he was interested in studying the Carter family
because the former president's father and all three siblings have
had the disease.
   ``Maybe the family differs genetically so far as the way they
metabolize common factors in the environment. They may have a
unique susceptibility to cancer due to such common factors that
don't affect others but may uniquely affect them.''
   Mrs. Spann said in a statement Friday through the Carter
Presidential Center that she was not feeling any symptoms from the
disease, which was diagnosed during routine testing.
   She was ``feeling great,'' said center spokeswoman Casie Hughes.
``In fact, she and her husband Walter are planning to ride their
motorcycles to Florida for the weekend.''
   Carter's brother, Billy, died of pancreatic cancer in September
1988 at age 51. His evangelist sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton, was
54 when she died of the disease in September 1983. Carter's father,
James Earl Carter Sr., who ran a peanut warehouse, died of the
disease in 1953.
   Carter's mother, ``Miss Lillian'' Carter, had breast cancer that
had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died
in October 1983 at age 85.
   Researchers have found that pancreatic cancer is almost always
fatal, Lynch said.
   ``In spite of advances in chemotherapy, radiation therapy and
surgery, most patients with pancreatic cancer do not survive more
than a year,'' he said.
   Mrs. Spann was given her treatment options while at Emory and
has not yet decided which course to pursue, the hospital said.
   Lynch said he wrote the former president about two years ago,
while brother Billy Carter was ill with the disease, because ``I'm
very concerned about him.'' He said he recommended screening for
the former president and the rest of the family.
   The researcher said he would contact the Carter family again in
the wake of Mrs. Spann's diagnosis.
   Lynch said research has shown that the Carter family children
could have a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer, a
disease that has its onset after the late 40s.
   Part of the problem with screening for the cancer is that ``we
don't know enough about the basic history of the pancreas,'' he
said, and that, ``when the cancer produces symptoms, it may have
been there growing more subtly for five or 10 years. That's why I
recommend screening be started earlier than the average age of
cancer occurrence.''

   People are dying from hunger in
Ethiopia's Tigre province, and a famine as deadly as that of the
mid-1980s is possible, a Tigrean rebel relief official said Friday.
   Information reaching Khartoum indicates an average of two people
succumb every day to hunger or malnutrition, adding to a toll in
recent weeks that at last report was 115.
   The figures are minuscule compared with those of the 1984-85
drought in which the United Nations says up to 1 million people
died in the rebellion-torn province of northwestern Ethiopia.
   But Chekol Kidane, who heads the relief agency of the Tigre
People's Liberation Front, said that without food and medical
supplies, conditions for about 2.2 million people ``will get worse
in the coming few weeks.''
   ``The health situation there is very bad indeed'' and is
worsening because the province's three hospitals have no more
medical supplies and too few personnel, Kidane said in an interview.
   Malnutrition is rampant especially among children, and ``chest
diseases like tuberculosis will be spreading among the
malnourished,'' he said.
   He said that the French relief organization Medicine Without
Borders has sent a team to Khartoum, which is to leave for Tigre in
a few days. ``But they will not be able to remedy the situation in
time,'' he added.
   A disaster as bad as the mid-1980s famine is possible, Kidane
said.
   His estimate of the number of people facing starvation in Tigre
is much lower than the 4 million forecast last month by officials
of the U.N. World Food Program but higher than the Ethiopian
government's prediction of 1.85 million.
   Ethiopian officials in Addis Ababa sounded their own alarm about
famine in the region Friday and blamed the Liberation Front.
   In a statement published in that city's newspapers, the Ministry
of Information said more fighting could lead to a mass exodus of
civilians and increased famine.
   The ministry said the ``root cause of hunger in northern
Ethiopia'' is a civil war ``to dismember the country.'' It said the
Liberation Front ``is spreading hunger and famine'' to neighboring
provinces.
   The worst-hit areas are in eastern Tigre, with the drought
causing crop failures of up to 90 percent, and some people are
selling their cattle to buy food, Kidane said.
   The famine is causing people in eastern Tigre to migrate west
toward the border with Sudan, he said.
   In the 1984-85 famine, thousands died in similar treks westward
in search of food. About 200,000 were thought to have crossed into
Sudan, equally saddled with an anti-government rebellion and food
shortages in the south.
   Kidane estimated that 346,000 tons of supplies are needed to
prevent a repetition of the '84-85 disaster in Tigre.
   The Ethiopian government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission
last week appealed to international donors for 377,400 tons of
relief food.
   ``We are requesting logistical assistance, as we have only 220
trucks while we badly need 494 trucks and 50 trailers,'' he said.
   Norway on Friday approved $324,000 in special food and medical
aid to Ethiopia.
   David Morton, operations director of the U.N. World Food
Program, said in Nairobi, Kenya, last week that satellite
photographs and other evidence indicated the brunt of the famine
would be felt next year.
   Northern Ethiopia is a drought-prone region where the normally
fragile agriculture has been disrupted by civil war in the
northernmost province of Eritrea and south of it in Tigre and Wollo
provinces.
   Kidane's rebel group, the Tigre People's Liberation Front,
controls all of Tigre and is fighting in neighboring Wollo.

<HEAD>More Corn, Soybean Meal Sold to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The department said 100,000 tons of soybean meal also were sold
to the Soviet Union for 1989-90 delivery.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total about 10.3 million tons of corn, 160,700 tons of
soybeans, 705,000 tons of soybean meal and 7,100 tons of barley.
   The sales, on the heels of orders announced Thursday for 1.4
million tons of corn and 150,000 tons of soybean meal, come as U.S.
and Soviet officials prepare to huddle next week in Moscow on grain
trade between the two countries.
   Department officials said the meetings will be held Tuesday and
Wednesday and will include discussions of ``a potential new
long-term grain agreement'' to succeed the current pact, which is
due to expire Dec. 31, 1990.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 298,700 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 800,000 tons of
corn would be about 31.5 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or other details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.25 per bushel at the
farm, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $1.8 million.
   The soybean meal, at around $200 per ton at processing plants,
would have a value of about $20 million.

   An estimated 60,000 joyful
demonstrators Friday celebrated the two-week anniversary of the
start of ``the quickest revolution in Europe.''
   The crowd packed ancient Namestie Square and beyond in this
capital of the Slovak republic, braving freezing temperatures for
2{ hours to cheer speakers invoking the need for unity in achieving
democracy in Czechoslovakia.
   It was the bloody police crackdown on a peaceful Nov. 17 student
demonstration in the capital of Prague that sparked the nationwide
protests powering what has become known as ``the gentle
revolution.''
   Waving red, white and blue Czechoslovak flags and Christmas
sparklers, the Friday night crowd applauded a procession of
speakers.
   Politicians from neighboring Austria, including Mayor Helmut
Zilk of Vienna and Culture Minister Erhard Busek, also addressed
the crowd, praising the people's will for change. Well-known folk
singers also appeared.
   Sounding a main theme of the last two weeks, actor Milan Knazko,
invoked ``the happy character'' _ the lack of violence _ at the
dozens of democracy demonstrations across Czechoslovakia.
   Knazko, a driving revolutionary force among the country's 5
million Slovaks, asked the crowd to observe a moment of silence to
show their will for peaceful change.
   In a gesture of reconciliation, he intoduced the mother and
sister of a student killed Aug. 21, 1968, when Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact troops crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and introduced 21
repressive years of Communist rule.
   ``The mother and sister symbolically forgive the guilty ones of
Aug. 21, 1968. Let us forgive,'' he intoned, and the crowd murmured
in unison: ``Let us forgive. Let us forgive.''
   Leading activist Jan Budaj, an academic forced to work as a
stoker because of his independent Catholic beliefs, took the
speakers' platform and called the events of the last two weeks
``the quickest revolution in Europe.''
   In response, a woman in the crowd shouted happily: ``We can't
keep track of things anymore because more happens in an hour than
used to happen in a year.''
   Since Czechs in the north and Slovaks in the south took to the
streets in mid-November, the ruling Communists have lost much of
their once undisputed grip on power.
   They have agreed in principle to the need for free elections,
and the newly independent Parliament on Wednesday voted unanimously
to strike from the Constitution the words that enshrined the
Communists' leading role in society.
   In further concessions to the opposition, the Communist Party on
Friday admitted that the Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968 was wrong,
and agreed to relinquish direct control of its armed Workers'
Militia.
   As the crowd began gathering, Kamil Prochazka of the Public For
Non-Violence _ the Slovak equivalent of the Civic Forum opposition
group active in the Czech-dominated north _ said more
demonstrations were needed to force other demands, including a free
press, freedom of assembly and an end to all pervasive communist
ideology.
   ``Democracy is created here only if the people as a whole are
for it,'' he said in an interview. ``You are nothing against
oppression if you're alone.''

   Miami police Officer William Lozano took ill
Friday, a day after he testified, forcing postponement of his
manslaughter trial until Monday.
   Lozano, 31, has been suffering from a mild kidney infection and
doubled over in pain Friday as he entered the courthouse parking
lot, said court officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
has been ordered to rest.
   Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina announced in court only that
the trial would not resume because of illness. The case is expected
to go to final arguments next week.
   Lozano, charged with manslaughter in the deaths of a black
motorcyclist and his passenger on Jan. 16, testified Thursday he
shot in self-defense as the bike was about to run him over.
   On cross-examination, prosecutors pointed out discrepancies
between his initial statements to investigators and his later
testimony.
   The state contends he fired his gun unnecessarily as the
motorcycle roared past him in the opposite traffic lane.

   Premier Miklos Nemeth said Friday his
country would reduce its military strength by 20 percent to 25
percent by 1991, the state MTI news agency reported.
   Nemeth told Defense Ministry officials and army commanders that
Hungary would continue to coordinate its defense with its allies in
the Wasaw Pact alliance ``as long as the two military blocs
exist,'' MTI said.
   Nemeth's announcement came two days after the defense ministers
of the seven Warsaw Pact nations ended a regular meeting in
Budapest.
   Nemeth said Hungary's unilateral decision to reduce its army
strength by 20 percent to 25 percent was designed to promote
success at East-West negotiations under way in Vienna on
conventional arms reduction.
   Nemeth also said mandatory military service would be reduced
starting in 1991 from 18 months to 12 months, MTI reported.
   Last week, a chief military officer was quoted as saying the
Hungarian troop level was to be cut by 9 percent by the end of 1990.
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing some if its troops in Hungary
in April as part of a disarmament plan announced by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the unilateral withdrawal of
500,000 troops by the end of 1990.
   That is to include 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks from
Eastern Europe.
   Jozsef Biro, head of the tactical staff of the army general
staff, told the the Esti Hirlap daily newspaper: ``The stationing
of Soviet troops on Hungarian soil ... no longer has domestic
reasons.''
   ``Now their being stationed here has to do with maintaining the
strategic balance,'' he said.
   He said the Soviet Union has already withdrawn more than 10,000
troops of its estimated 62,000 troops, 470 tanks and 270 artillery
weapons.

   The city erected a memorial Friday to the
wife of a New Jersey mayor killed a year ago when a train carrying
her and her husband was derailed by saboteurs.
   Anna Cucci was killed and her husband, then-Mayor Anthony Cucci
of Jersey City, N.J., was injured when the rail car they were
riding in tumbled down a 250-foot ravine near Cuzco, 355 miles
southeast of Lima in the Andes Mountains.
   The monument christened Friday also commemorates the wife of
Cuzco's mayor, Doris Mayorga de Chacon, who also was killed. The
monument was erected in the Plaza of American Brotherhood in
downtown Cuzco.
   The rail car was derailed when it hit a 10-inch steel rod wedged
into the tracks. Authorities said the rod probably was placed by
leftist rebels or striking rail workers. No one has been charged in
the deaths.
   The Cuccis were visiting Cuzco to sign a sister city accord
between Jersey City and Cuzco. Six other people were injured when
the car derailed on its way to the ancient Incan citadel of Machu
Picchu, located 60 miles northwest of Cuzco.
   Mayor Carlos Chacon, who was injured in the derailment, presided
at a ceremony unveiling the two plaques, one in English and one in
Spanish. Chacon called the two women ``martyrs of American
brotherhood.''

   A man accused of shooting his estranged
wife and raping two teachers in front of a classroom full of
kindergarten pupils will be arraigned Monday, officials said.
   Larry Bates, 35, a carpenter with a criminal record including
burglary and assault convictions, is charged with aggravated
assault, two counts of capital rape, two counts of sexual battery,
possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and 22 counts of
kidnapping stemming from Thursday's incident at Northside Primary
School.
   Only eight of the 19 children in the classroom during the
attacks were back in school Friday, and half the 560 pupils at the
school were absent, said Carol Brown, the school's public relations
director.
   ``They're just really upset and concerned and in a state of
shock for the most part,'' Brown said.
   She said the Natchez-Adams County School District's
psychologist, Ann Marion, her staff, guidance counselors from other
schools and about 25 private pyschologists were at the school
Friday and were to talk with the pupils who witnessed the shooting
and rapes as well as the other children.
   Brown said the counselors also had scheduled a meeting with
parents to discuss their fears.
   Bates' wife, Adria Bates, 40, a teacher aide at the school,
suffered gunshot wounds to the scalp and back. She remained in
stable condition at Jefferson Davis Memorial Hospital.
   ``It was humiliating to the children and to the other staff,''
Mrs. Bates said from her hospital bed.
   She said she recently filed for divorce and that Bates had
``been hearing a lot of untrue rumors.'' She didn't elaborate.
   The two teachers who were raped and beaten also were taken to
Jefferson Davis Hospital for treatment.
   Assistant Police Chief George Rutherford said officers received
a report of a man on the campus about 1:30 p.m.
   Bates was arrested after an instructor grabbed a .38-caliber
revolver from him as he was holding the children and teachers
hostage, he said. Two shots were fired in the classroom.
   Rutherford said Bates had lined the 5- and 6-year-old children
in front of windows _ between himself and police.
   There were four teachers and aides in the classroom when the
incident began, Rutherford said.

<HEAD>Arab Nations Postpone UN Vote on PLO Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab nations on Friday postponed a General
Assembly vote on recognizing the PLO as the government of Palestine
just two hours before it was scheduled.
   One Western diplomat, speaking privately, said a rift has
developed between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Farouk Khaddoumi,
the PLO foreign secretary who heads the Palestinian U.N. delegation.
   Khaddoumi has been trying to line up the votes for the
resolution, while Arafat believes the effort is counterproductive
and has ordered a halt, the source said.
   The State Department has said it will cut off all U.S. funds to
the United Nations if the resolution passes. The United States is
assessed $216 million annually, a quarter of the U.N budget.
   After the 22-nation Arab League held a private meeting, its
ambassador, Clovis Maksoud, announced the resolution would instead
be put to a vote Monday.
   ``This is final, categorical and unequivocal,'' said Maksoud.
   The delay is intended to allow non-aligned nations to receive
voting instructions, he said. Diplomats said it would also give the
Palestine Liberation Organization more time to lobby its allies for
support.
   However, Western diplomats said the delay actually helps the
United States, 12 European Community nations and Nordic countries
that are trying to derail the resolution.
   As a member of the 102-member Non-Aligned Movement, the PLO
theoretically has more than enough votes to prevail on a majority
vote in the 159-member General Assembly.
   Western diplomats, however, say any vote will be extremely close
and refuse to predict whether the resolution will pass.
   Maksoud acknowledged the United States has had some success
fighting the resolution.
   ``The United States has put us in a serious dilemma, with
threatening to cut the budget to stifle debate,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union opposes the resolution, and Egypt and Morocco
have not yet endorsed it.
   John Bolton, the State Department undersecretary for
International Organizations, said Friday, ``We continue to oppose
this resolution and believe it should be withdrawn.
   ``We are maintaining intensive efforts to insure that this is
not adopted,'' he said. He reiterated the threat to cut off all
U.N. funding.
   ``A number of other countries are also working in this
direction,'' Bolton said.
   The proposed resolution says the PLO ``has the powers and
responsibilities of the Provisional Government of the State of
Palestine.''
   It also says the PLO ``shall be construed, within the United
Nations, as the State of Palestine.''
   That designation would elevate the PLO from its current status
as a non-voting observer nation. Also holding such status are North
and South Korea, Switzerland, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican.
   Last year, the PLO declared the state of Palestine in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but did not define any
borders. Khaddoumi says more than 80 nations have formally
recognized Palestine.

   The nation of Finland will be able to
hold the 35-nation summit next year as proposed by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the foreign minister said Friday.
   Provided that the nations in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe agree, ``Finland would have the technical
capability of hosting the summit next year,'' said Foreign Minister
Pertti Paasio.
   Paasio said a joint declaration issued during Gorbachev's state
visit to Finland in October called on Finland to stage a summit in
conjunction with the opening of the Helsinki follow-up meeting in
1992.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev proposed that such a summit be brought
forward to next year because of the swift developments in Eastern
Europe. He did not specify Helsinki as a venue.
   The last conference resulted in the 1975 Helsinki accords on
human rights and confidence-building measures between East and West.
   The countries that signed the 1975 Helsinki accords are the
Soviet Union, the United States, Canada and all the European
nations except Albania.

affair with his girlfriend, wounded the woman and then fatally shot
himself, it was reported.
   Despite the shootings, other doctors continued working on young
patient, removing his appendix, the news agency AGI said.
   The anesthetist, Vincenzo Parisi, entered the operating room at
Victor Emmanuel Hospital, pulled out a pistol and killed Giovanni
Cutaia, whom he suspected of being romantically involved with his

   Vice President Dan Quayle convened National
Security Council members, telephoned Corazon Aquino and briefed
members of Congress as he oversaw U.S. action in the Philippines
Thursday night and Friday, White House officials said.
   In the absence of the summit-bound President Bush, Quayle was
the administration's point man in Washington on the Philippines
developments.
   The timing of the coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino gave him a
chance to break out of the sidekick role that generally keeps him
in the White House background.
   He canceled a Florida speechmaking trip Friday and spoke
frequently by telephone to Bush and other U.S. officials as they
flew to Malta and after they arrived, according to Quayle aides.
   Bush left for his summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev just as the coup attempt was breaking out Thursday
against the U.S.-backed Aquino regime.
   Quayle stayed overnight Thursday in the White House situation
room, and ``was constantly facilitating the conversation, asking
questions and keeping the flow of information going'' among U.S.
military and policy officials who were analyzing courses of action,
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   The coup attempt appeared to falter, as U.S. war planes flew
menacingly over strongholds of the mutinous military forces.
However officials at the Pentagon said late Friday that the
fighting was not over.
   Quayle ``ran effective meetings, asked the right questions,
pushed people for their recommendations and understood that his was
not the role of the decision maker,'' but rather one who
transmitted recommendations to Bush, said one administration
official involved.
   The all-night discussions took place with some participants in
the situation room and others at their own agencies via two-way
television, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   With Bush out of the country, Quayle believed it was important
for him to be present, said another official, adding, ``We do not
want to see the Al Haig situation.''
   The comment was in reference to the scene at the White House
after the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan when
then-Vice President Bush was out of town. Then-Secretary of State
Alexander Haig sternly announced that he was ``in charge here,''
pending Bush's return from Texas.
   The comment was seen as an attempt to usurp authority rather
than an indication that everything was under control.
   On Thursday evening, as the Philippines mutineers gained ground,
Quayle was at the vice presidential residence, keeping abreast by
telephone.
   As the situation deteriorated, meetings were held in the White
House involving deputies from agencies including the Pentagon,
National Security Council, State Department and CIA. They discussed
possible options for U.S. action as they monitored developments in
Manila.
   Quayle received a call from Deputy National Security Adviser
Robert Gates just after 10 p.m. informing him that Mrs. Aquino, who
was talking frequently by telephone to U.S. Ambassador Nicholas
Platt, had asked for U.S. assistance.
   After consulting with Gates, Quayle called an 11:30 p.m. meeting
of the NSC principals who were not traveling with Bush, in
accordance with NSC procedures, said David Beckwith, Quayle's press
secretary.
   By the time they met, Mrs. Aquino specifically asked for air
support over the two bases held by the rebels.
   Just before the meeting started, Quayle and Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney spoke by telephone with Bush.
   ``He said he would await their recommendation,'' said Beckwith.
   After a 45-minute discussion, the group unanimously recommended
approving Mrs. Aquino's request, and Bush sent the F-4 fighters
from Clark Air Base in Manila.
   Quayle telephoned her to tell her of the decision. He then
called House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell to tell them what was happening, said Beckwith.
   Quayle went home around 5:30 a.m., then returned to the White
House around 9:30.
   He told Bush in a midday telephone conversation that he would
inform appropriate congressional leaders of the state of affairs.
He called several members, his office said.
   He sent his wife Marilyn in his place to make the appearances in
Florida.

<HEAD>Opera Director Goran Jarvefelt Dead at Age 42</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goran Jarvefelt, one of Sweden's
youngest and most promising opera directors, has died of cancer at
the age of 42.
   Jarvefelt, who was suffering from a brain tumor, died Thursday.
   He had established himself at leading world operas, including
the New York Metropolitan Opera, the Paris Opera and Komische Oper
in East Berlin. He worked with both classical and contemporary
themes.
   ``He avoided the easy solutions. He always sought new paths to
approach the core of the work,'' said Swedish opera star Sylvia
Lindenstrand.
   Jarvefelt was born in Bollnas, in central Sweden. He began as an
actor but changed careers after becoming fascinated by opera.
   He studied under successful directors abroad such as Walter
Felsenstein at Komische Oper. He was especially impressed by Gotz
Friedrich and worked as an assistant to Swedish director Ingmar
Bergman.
   In 1974, he successfully directed his first opera in Vadstena in
southern Sweden. He worked in Gelsenkirchen in West Germany and in
1977 he made his debut at the Stockholm Opera, which was a critical
success.
   At the time of his death, he was working with an opera by
Richard Strauss in Antwerp, Belgium, and the first performance of
Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara's opera ``Vincent'' in
Helsinki.

   Israeli soldiers disguised as Arabs killed four
members of a Palestinian gang Friday in a barber shop shootout in
Nablus, the occupied West Bank's largest city, Arab journalists
reported.
   The army confirmed soldiers killed four members of an
organization known as the Black Panthers and wounded three, who
were captured. It said there were no casualties among the soldiers.
   Street battles broke out after the shooting and the army barred
Jewish settlers from the area, according to witnesses and police
reports. Hospital officials said five Palestinians were wounded in
the clashes.
   Israeli soldiers or settlers have killed at least 623
Palestinians since an uprising began two years ago in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 42 Israelis have died. At least 154
alleged collaborators with the Israelis have been killed by other
Palestinians.
   Friday's army raid was the second on radical Palestinian groups
in Nablus in less than a month. It followed warnings by military
officials of a campaign against gangs blamed for killing alleged
collaborators.
   Israel radio said the head of Israel's Shin Bet security service
told officials 500 Palestinian guerrilla squads had been counted
during the uprising.
   It said the Shin Bet chief, whose name is an official secret,
gave the assessment Thursday. He was quoted as saying 170 of the
groups were linked to the Fatah faction of Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat and were uncovered since Arafat
publicly renounced terrorism a year ago.
   Witnesses in Nablus said soldiers wearing Arab robes and
Palestinian headscarves arrived at the entrance to the Old City in
a red Mercedes with West Bank license plates.
   Seven men got out and fired into a barber shop about 40 yards
from the Ajaj Mosque, said a witness who identified himself only as
Nezar.
   He said soldiers later carried several bodies out of the shop on
stretchers. An Arab journalist said hundreds of shots were heard.
   An official army statement said soldiers confronted Palestinians
armed with an M-16 assault rifle and several pistols, and opened
fire.
   An Arab doctor who arrived with an ambulance to pick up the
injured said an Israeli army officer told him: ``You are not going
to take any casualties. ... I killed all the Black Panthers.''
   Palestinian sources identified two victims as Black Panther
members Imad Nasser, Hani Tayem and Omar Arafat _ all 22. The name
of the other victim was not available.
   According to the army, the Black Panthers have killed 16
Palestinians on suspicion of cooperation with Israel.
   Although the group once was linked to Fatah, it is said to have
carried out killings in violation of Arafat's orders.
   Members of the group were seen in Nablus minutes after the Nov.
23 shooting death of a 35-year-old woman as a suspected
collaborator. One showed a reporter a bulging grayish-green bag and
said it contained an M-16.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus and nearby refugee camps
Friday, ordering about 120,000 residents to stay indoors.
   On two major West Bank road junctions leading to Nablus,
soldiers and police stopped hundreds of vehicles carrying Jewish
settlers home and told them the roads were not safe, according to
police reports.
   Israeli journalists said Palestinians built stone barricades and
hurled firebombs and rocks on many roads around Nablus.
   It was the most serious confrontation in Nablus since Nov. 9,
when soldiers killed a youth said to be a leader of a gang called
the Red Eagles, and captured four of its members.
   In an interview from prison on Israel television, one of the
captured Red Eagles said he murdered collaborators ``to purify''
Palestinian society.
   Jabber Hawash, 17, said he participated in eight murders,
including the axing of his cousin, a middle-aged woman.
   He said the Red Eagles interrogated 140 suspects, sometimes
beating Arabs who refused t answer questions.
   The interrogations and slayings, he said, were sometimes in
defiance of PLO orders to end the killings.
   ``If we stop the killing, what can we do here, just sit
around?'' he said. Israel radio said the latest collaborator killed
was Nimer Abu Rabiya, 33, of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip. It said
he was found dead in Ketziot prison Friday and a 23-year-old
Palestinian inmate said he killed Rabiya because the victim was an
informer, the radio said.

<HEAD>Texas Congressman To Retire Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Marvin Leath, a six-term Texas
congressman and influential member of the House Armed Services
Committee, announced Friday he would not seek re-election next year.
   Leath, 58, said he ``really can't explain'' his reasons for
retiring after a dozen years in Congress. He said he would like to
write a book and perhaps a syndicated column, while pursuing a
country music career.
   ``Though it was the most agonizing decision of my life, I
believe it is time to move along _ time for someone else to take up
the mantle; time for another citizen to accept that
responsibility,'' said Leath, a former small-town banker and high
school football coach who first won the seat in 1978.
   Leath, of Waco, is one of the Texas congressional delegation's
wealthiest members, having listed the minimum value of his assets
at $1.3 million. His decision to retire in 1990 would allow him to
convert to personal use the remaining cash in his campaign
treasury, which totaled $487,535 at the end of September, according
to records at the Federal Election Commission.
   Under ethics reform legislation just approved by Congress,
members elected before 1980 have until 1993 to retire or lose the
right to convert the cash to personal use. Leath said the new law,
however, had nothing to do with his decision to retire.
   Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Insitute said he was
disappointed by Leath's decision ``because there are few more
interesting or nicer people on Capitol Hill. ...''
   Ornstein said Leath has a reputation for ``providing a lot of
the glue'' that has kept the Democratic Party together, serving as
a bridge between liberal and conservative factions on defense and
budget issues.
   Now, Leath says, he wants to write continue writing country
music and approach singer Willie Nelson and say: ``Willie, it's
time these two old Waco boys did an album, and let's call it
`Willie and His Congressman.'''

<HEAD>ACT Asks FTC to Halt `Deceptive' Ads Aimed at Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer advocacy organization for children
asked the government Friday to stop television stations and several
toy manufacturers from broadcasting during children's programs
advertisements the group said are deceptive.
   In a petition to halt commercials by six toy manufacturers,
Action for Children's Television asked the Federal Trade Commission
to initiate an inquiry and regulations regarding television
advertising practices aimed at children.
   ACT accused three independent New York-area television stations
and six toy manufacturers of ``engaging in unfair and deceptive
trade practices in their presentation of product advertisements for
children's toys ... which misrepresent the nature and performance
of such products.''
   ``These things are so deceptive they could deceive adults,''
Peggy Charren, the president of ACT, said in a telephone interview.
   ``Too often we do our worst advertising and direct it at kids,''
she said.
   Charren began ACT in 1968 to encourage informative children's
television programming and to monitor advertising aimed at
children. The group is funded by its 10,000 members nationwide and
other private donations.
   Charren said the group had seen vast improvements in children's
ads during the 1970s but began to see a recurrence of earlier
problems in the 1980s because of the deregulatory policies of the
Reagan adminstration and the rapid advancement of television
production technology.
   Named in the petition were WPIX-TV, WNYW-TV and New Jersey-based
WWOR-TV.
   Spokesmen for the stations said they had not been contacted by
the FTC concerning ACT's petition.
   However, Ted Faraone of WNYW said his station ``does screen
commercials very carefully, particularly those aimed at children to
screen out anything which is deceptive.''
   ``It's the kind of thing that we are very sensitive to,'' said
Ellen Morgenstern of WWOR-TV.
   ``It is not a problem that is unique to these stations,'' said
Peggy Charren, the president of ACT, in a telephone interview.
   But Charren said she was encouraged because any rules or
policies the government applied to the stations named in the
petition would apply to all stations.
   Toy commercials cited by ACT include: Ring Raiders by Matchbox
Toys, Galoob Toys' Micro Machine Service City, Mattel's Food
Fighters, Hasbro's Pogo Ball, Toy Biz's Flip Ball and Milton
Bradley's Guess Who game.
   The Ring Raiders commercial ``shows airplanes flying free when
in fact they stay attached to a child's hand'' and the Galoob spot
``shows a city complete with cars and trucks, when in fact the
product includes no vehicles,'' ACT said.
   The group acknowledged that Galoob includes a disclaimer saying
vehicles are sold separately but said ``this message is totally
ineffective with children who cannot read.''
   The Ring Raiders and Micro Machine Service City spots also are
critcized in a Consumer Reports television special on children's
advertising scheduled to air next week on Home Box Office.
   ``We do not believe the commercials are deceptive in any way,''
said Steve Klein, executive vice president and general counsel for
Galoob.
   Galoob has sold more than 55 million Micro Machine vehicles and
playsets in the three years since they hit the market, said Klein,
adding that none of the toys had been returned because of consumer
dissatisfaction due to deceptive advertising.
   Klein also said a survey conducted by an independent company
using a Micro Machine commercial similar to the one ACT finds
objectionable showed the ad ``was cleary understood by children.''
   ``There was no confusion. The filming techniques were fully
comprehended,'' Klein said of the group of boys aged 6-10 who
participated in the survey.
   Michele Litzky, a spokeswoman for Matchbox, said the firm's
advertising is produced in accordance with guidelines of the
Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau.
   Glenn Bozart, spokesman for Mattel, said the company could not
respond because officials had not seen details of the petition.
   Efforts to reach other manufacturers cited by ACT were
unsuccessful.

<HEAD>U.S. Calls Nicaragua's Refusal of Visas `Insult'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Friday denounced
as an ``insult'' Nicaragua's refusal to grant visas to a 20-member
delegation appointed by President Bush to observe the Feb. 25
general elections.
   The Foreign Ministry said in a communique Thursday that such a
delegation would not be impartial, declaring:
   ``From the point of view of his credibility before us, the very
fact that Mr. Bush has been the one to appoint this commission is
enough for it to be totally discredited.''
   State Department Deputy Spokesman Richard Boucher replied Friday:
   ``The denial of visas ... is merely one more illustration of
what the Sandinistas say and what they do. Refusing visas to this
prestigious delegation co-chaired by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
and Rep. Tony Beilenson, D-Calif., is an insult to their
integrity.''
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government invited dozens of
world observers to supervise the elections, including delegations
from the United Nations, the Organization of American States and
the European Parliament.
   The ministry said these organizations and individuals are
experienced, honest and impartial, but ``the same, unfortunately,
cannot be said of President Bush, nor, therefore, of any commission
appointed by him to observe the elections in Nicaragua.''
   It said a U.S. congressional vote Wednesday to continue
non-lethal aid to Nicaraguan rebels ``will allow the Contras to
keep infiltrating ... into Nicaragua to assassinate our people and
create confusion in the electoral process.''
   It complained about $9 million approved by Congress in October
to aid the campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
presidential candidate of the 14-party United National Opposition,
the strongest challenger to the governing Sandinista National
Liberation Front.
   The communique said, ``There exists a clear incompatibility
between pretending to buy the election of a candidate while at the
same time pretending to be accepted as impartial observers in our
elections.''
   Boucher said in Washington:
   ``Just two weeks ago the ... Foreign Ministry indicated to the
administration that the government of Nicaragua welcomed the
establishment of this delegation and that it intended to issue the
visas.
   ``The government of Nicaragua raised no question of linkage
between their visas and other issues.''
   He complained that Nicaragua ``professes to support Esquipulas
and the Tela accords'' _ regional peace agreements signed by
Nicaragua and other Central American nations _ ``but it provides
arms to El Salvador's FMLN, including advanced surface-to-air
missiles.''
   A small plane carrying 25 surface-to-air missiles crashed
Saturday in El Salvador. El Salvador said the plane and its four
crew, all of whom died, were Nicaraguan, and broke diplomatic
relations with Managua. It said the missiles were for the rebel
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   Boucher said that while Nicaragua promises an open and fair
election and talks peace, it ``suspended the cease-fire and stepped
up the intimidation of voters in addition to denying access to some
observers ... and has increased its troop buildup along the
Honduran border.''
   ``The Sandinistas can't have it both ways. The U.S. continues to
believe that the holding of free and fair elections under
international monitoring is an important opportunity to resolve the
conflict in Nicaragua and to improve relations with the United
States.''
   He said the decision to the visas ``certainly raises questions
about whether ... Nicaragua shares this belief.
   ``Moreover, the United States has made it clear that if the
elections are deemed free and fair it will recognize and respect
the outcome.''

   President Bush, from his shipboard
summit headquarters, kept a close watch Friday on an attempted coup
in the Philippines after sending U.S. jet fighters into action to
help beseiged President Corazon Aquino.
   Bush ordered F-4 fighters from Clark Air Force Base to provide
air support and to prevent aircraft from taking off from two
Philippine air bases held by rebels. A contingent of 100 Marines
was also sent from a U.S. base in the Philippines to help protect
the U.S. Embassy compound in Manila.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that no
U.S. planes had ``fired any shots or intercepted any rebel
aircraft.'' Rear Adm. Edward Sheafer of the Defense Intelligence
Agency said ``the goverment forces seem to be prevailing'' in the
struggle with the rebels.
   Late Friday, a senior defense official said that ``trends
generally favor the government'' but that fighting was continuing
as daylight approached in Manila.
   ``We are hopeful the situation will be contained,'' Bush told
reporters soon after arriving here for his weekend summit with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is fair to say that the situation is serious,'' Secretary
of State James A. Baker III added. ``We have provided some air
support, air cover.'' He sa id that what the Aquino government had
asked for.
   Bush ordered the air support to help protect the Aquino
government during his overnight flight here from Washington aboard
Air Force One. The quick help came in response to a request from
Aquino, who spoke by telephone with Vice President Dan Quayle in
Washington.
   The president received updates on the situation from his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Bush was told
government forces had retaken one air field and that trouble spots
were being cleaned up, but the coup attempt was still in progress,
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   The president's decision to grant U.S. military aid came
quickly, just hours after rebels bombed the presidential palace in
Manila in the most serious effort to oust Aquino since she came to
power in 1986. Bush had come under some criticism _ principally
from Democrats in Congress _ for not acting more decisively in
taking advantage of September's failed coup attempt against
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush's
decision to intervene was twofold: ``A democratic government has
asked for assistance; We have American lives to protect.'' He said
Aquino was ``in a safe place'' but he wouldn't say where, and that
the U.S. planes were still flying into the early morning hours in
the Philippines.
   Bush's decision won strong bipartisan support from members of
Congress. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called
it ``prudent and in our national interest.''
   The president looked tired, and while he told reporters he was
ready for the weekend summit with Gorbachev, the threat to the
friendly government in Manila appeared to dampen his spirits on a
rainy day.
   Before a session with Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami,
Bush said that Mrs. Aquino ``sounded fine'' when she took a
telephone call from Quayle in Washington.
   Still, even limited U.S. military intervention could damage the
complaint Bush planned to lodge with Gorbachev about a continuing
flow of Soviet weapons to rebels in El Salvador.
   The United States charges delivery of the arms, including
anti-aircraft launchers, by Cuba and Nicaragua are only one example
of Soviet mischief-making in the Third World.
   Arkady Maslennikov, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet,
criticized Bush's decision to order air support. ``We are against
such an interference. Any interference in internal developments,
especially by outside powers, is destructive and leads to
deterioration of the situation.''
   ``In any event, the best thing is to allow the Filipinos
themselves to sort it out,'' he said.
   Fitzwater indirectly acknowledged that the U.S. actions amounted
to intervention. He said: ``If the tide is turning and the coup is
beginning to die out there would be no need for further
intervention.''
   Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said U.S. forces
``were not in the thick of anything. They are simply providing air
cover. That's all we have been requested to do.''
   In a statement issued from Air Force One as Bush flew to this
island nation, Fitzwater said Mrs. Aquino had requested the U.S.
military assistance.
   ``This assistance is intended to allow the democratically
elected government of the Philippines to restore order. The
president also is determined to protect the lives of Americans in
the Philippines,'' his statement said.
   Mrs. Aquino, in Manila, said, ``Even now, U.S. fighters are
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops. Once
more, two Pacific democracies stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the
defense of freedom.''
   A Bush administration official said the U.S. fighters were
authorized to fire ``only if (rebel) planes are attempting to take
off from these two bases, but that would be only after repeated
warnings.''
   The Reagan and Bush administrations gradually increased U.S.
assistance to the Philippines as a means of bolstering Mrs. Aquino
in a country beset by grinding poverty. The United States maintains
two bases in the Philippines, the vast Subic Bay naval base and
Clark air base.
   Meanwhile, the CIA has reported that some senior Philippine
officials are worried that entire segments of their armed forces
supposedly loyal to Aquino will fail to ``fight effectively'' in
fending off the rebels attempting to topple her government, an
administration source reported today.
   The Central Intelligence Agency, in its daily intelligence
summary prepared for top U.S. officials, reported on Friday that
the situation in the Philippines was ``quite uncertain,'' said the
official, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.

   The Communist Party admitted
Friday the Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring''
reforms of 1968 was a mistake, in effect apologizing for 21 years
of repression.
   ``We are of the opinion that the intervention of five countries
in 1968 was not justified and the decision to do it was wrong,''
Politburo member Vasil Mohorita said, referring to a new ``Action
Program'' the party has drafted.
   His statement opened the way for a reassessment by the Kremlin
and the four other participants in the invasion that ended the
reforms, possibly at a Warsaw Pact meeting next week in Moscow.
   Of the invading countries, Poland, Hungary and East Germany have
said the invasion was wrong. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have not.
   Mohorita made concessions to an opposition demand for
dissolution of the People's Militia, the party army, but did not
agree to abolish it.
   Frantisek Pitra, a senior official, met with Vaclav Havel,
leader of the reform movement, for continuing negotiations on
forming a new government that includes non-Communists.
   Party chief Karel Urbanek told a turbulent farmers' congress he
supported the decision to reassess the reforms instituted a
generation ago by Alexander Dubcek, then leader of Communist Party.
   In scenes shown live on state TV, he also was seen applauded
conservative farmers who attacked the opposition and, at one point,
rose to chant in unison: ``Long Live The Army!''
   The invasion in August 1968 by all other Warsaw Pact nations
except Romania was the largest military action in Europe since
World War II and dealt a blow to hopes that communism could embrace
democratic reform.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev became the Soviet leader in 1985 and
started introducing reforms similar to those Dubcek pursued, the
official view of the ``Prague Spring'' and the invasion has been
expected to change.
   Gorbachev has insisted, however, that a re-evaluation by the
Warsaw Pact could take place only if Czechoslovakia requested it.
   Mohorita said the ``Action Program'' approved Friday by the
ruling Politburo contains a re-examination of official policy,
which had called the 1968 reforms worthless, and sets a new reform
course for the party.
   He also told a news conference the ``People's Militia will no
longer be under the command of the Communist Party, but will be
turned over to the state as is the case in many other countries.''
   No decision has been made on an opposition demand that direct
Communist Party control of the workplace be ended, but the party
promises it ``will not interfere with the media,'' Mohorita said.
   A ``new attitude toward former leaders'' must develop, he said,
but did not specify whether that referred to Dubcek or the
hard-liners who cracked down after the invasion.
   Eleven days of mass protest forced the dismissal of those
leaders last week and caused the party to change course radically
toward the reform movement sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Mohorita said the draft program outlines the party's ``new
position'' after Parliament voted on Wednesday to remove
constitutional guarantees of its supremacy.
   It now is ``one of many political parties'' that must seek
support from the people, he said, and ``we will all have to get
accustomed to this.''
   In order to become official, the ``Action Program'' must be
approved by the party Central Committee and be adopted by an
special party congress tentatively scheduled for Jan. 26. Mohorita
said the Central Committee will meet Dec. 14 and might decided to
hold the congress sooner.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party newspaper, said Friday the
Politburo had ordered a special commission appointed to re-evaluate
the 1968 reforms and ``the circumstances under which the armies of
five Socialist countries entered Czechoslovakia.''
   At the news conference, Mohorita said the commission report
would augment the decision already made by the Politburo.
   On Thursday, Czechoslovakia announced two other reversals of
previous policy: removal of barriers on the border with Austria and
an end to virtually all restrictions on travel to the West.
   The Interior Ministry said Friday that work on dismantling
barbed wire, watchtowers and sensing devices probably would begin
in the second half of December.
   A separate statement on the 1968 invasion by the party
ideological body, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, said it had
been a mistake for Czechoslovak Communists and Warsaw Pact leaders
to say Czechoslovakia was threatened by counterrevolution in 1968.
The statement was published Friday in Rude Pravo.
   On Wednesday, Premier Ladislav Adamec became the first
Czechoslovak leader in 20 years to say a new official look should
be taken at 1968. He also said he hoped to negotiate withdrawal of
an estimated 80,000 Soviet soldiers who have been stationed in
Czechoslovakia since the invasion.

   Police asked a court Friday to approve
the seizure of 15 bags of clothing by Scottish detectives
investigating the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 nearly a year ago.
   The clothing was taken Monday from the home of Mohammed Abo
Talb, a Palestinian being tried on charges related to bombings in
Scandinavia and Holland in 1985 and 1986.
   Seven Swedish policemen and three Scottish investigators
stripped the apartment of clothing, emptying the closets of Abo
Talb's entire family, said his ex-wife, who still lives with him.
   Abo Talb, a member of the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, was
linked to Flight 103 when he was found to have been in Malta two
months before the bombing Dec. 21, 1988.
   Reports say investigators traced clothing bought in Malta to the
suitcase containing the bomb that blew the jetliner apart over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
   Detectives searched Abo Talb's apartment in Uppsala for clothing
purchased in Malta that could link him to the disaster.
   In a 15-minute hearing, Prosecutor Ulf Forsberg asked the court
to declare confiscation of the clothing legal. Foreign police
cannot seize evidence from a resident of Swedish without court
approval, and must prove its value to their investigation.
   The judge said he would decide by Monday. He asked reporters not
to give his name, because ``we don't want to be prey on the
streets.''
   Forsberg said in the hearing that Abo Talb was ``a suspect in
another case in another country,'' but the Lockerbie crash was not
mentioned specifically.
   Abo Talb was brought from a Stockholm jail to Uppsala, 40 miles
to the north, for a closed hearing that followed the open session.
   Jamila Mograbi, Abo Talb's former wife, told reporters she was
questioned for an hour during the search by the 10 Swedish and
Scottish policemen on Monday, and was called to the police station
Wednesday for four hours of further interrogation.
   She said the officers took away 15 large plastic bags of
clothing, and her family had to borrow clothes from friends.
Although she is divorced from Abo Talb, she is pregnant with their
third child.
   Ms. Mograbi said Abo Talb had not left Sweden in November or
December of 1988 and she could prove his whereabouts on at least
several days during those months.
   According to his passport, Abo Talb was in Malta for a week in
October 1988. He told his lawyer he went there on business.
   His ex-wife, the sister of two other defendants in Abo Talb's
bombing trial, said he went to Malta to recover from a knife wound.
She did not say how he was wounded.
   ABC television reported Thursday the Flight 103 bomb was built
by three terrorists who had spent nine years in Israeli prisons for
an unsuccessful attempt to blow up an Israeli El Al airliner in
Nairobi, Kenya.
   It said they were recruited by Ahmed Jibril, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   Abo Talb's Popular Struggle Front and Jibril's group belong to
the so-called rejectionist front opposing Yasser Arafat, chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   The White House on Friday officially announced
that Houston will be the site of a seven-nation economic summit
meeting July 9-11.
   The international gathering of the world's seven richest
industrial states is held annually, with the location rotated among
Canada, Japan, Great Britain, France, United States, Germany and
Italy.
   President Bush assigned Fred Malek, an official in his 1988
presidential campaign and the manager of his operation at last
year's Republican National Convention, to be director of the summit.
   Malek is president of Northwest Airlines and co-chairman of the
Coldwell Banker Commercial Group.
   The White House said Richard T. McCormack, the undersecretary of
state for economic and agricultural affairs, will be Bush's
personal representative for policy at the summit.
   Bush had said earlier that he wanted the summit to be in his
adoptive home state of Texas and that the decision was between San
Antonio and Houston.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh proposed
regulations Friday to impose civil fines of up to $10,000 for
possessing small amounts of marijuana and other illegal drugs for
personal use.
   The regulations, called for in the anti-drug law passed last
year by Congress, provide an alternative to prosecuting individuals
in federal court for simple possession of small amounts of the
drugs.
   Relatively few defendants are prosecuted under federal law for
simple possession of small amounts of drugs, said spokesman David
Runkel. Most of the possession cases are brought in connection with
other federal criminal charges, he said.
   Federal criminal law provides a one-year sentence and a fine of
up to $5,000 for simple drug possession, although a defendant
already convicted of another crime could receive sentence of up to
two years and be fined up to $10,000.
   Under the civil regulations proposed by Thornburgh, the attorney
general could cite individuals for drug possession and impose a
fine of up to $10,000. The citation could be challenged at a
hearing before an administrative law judge.
   An individual could also appeal the civil citation in federal
court, which would conduct a jury trial, according to the
regulations.
   The civil penalties would be invoked on individuals possessing
no more than a gram of heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine or an
ounce of marijuana and smaller amounts of PCP and LSD.
   The civil penalties would not apply to individuals previously
convicted of possessing the same drug or those who have been twice
cited for civil violations under the regulations.
   Civil proceedings could not be invoked as an alternative to
criminal prosecution if investigators found evidence of an
intention to sell or distribute drugs.
   Don Fiedler, national director of the National Organization for
Reform of Marijuana Laws, called the regulations an ``end run
around the Constitution'' because the probable-cause standard in
criminal law would not apply in the civil proceedings.
   Fiedler said the regulations raised many questions about how a
person cited for drug violations could challenge the legality of a
search, predicting they would ``create a tremendous amount of
litigation.''
   ``If you go to civil proceedings, there is no basis of authority
to come in with a motion to suppress the search based on
constitutional grounds,'' Fiedler said.
   The regulations will be published in the Federal Register and
put out for public comment for 30 days.
   Fiedler, whose group advocates the decriminalization of
marijuana, said the regulations effectively accomplish that goal.
But he acknowledged that a $10,000 fine is a significant deterrent
to possessing illegal drugs, even in small amounts.

   A New Jersey company is recalling a malaria
drug because some of the bottles contain an animal diuretic
instead, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
   The recall by Biocraft Laboratories of Elmwood, N.J., applies to
Goldline brand 250 milligram chloroquine phosphate tablets packaged
in 100-tablet bottles labeled as lot number 14311, the FDA said.
   The FDA said the recall began after a pharmacist found a
chloroquine phosphate bottle containing the animal diuretic, a drug
that steps up production of urine. But no injuries or deaths have
been reported.
   Bottles containing the wrong drug have been found in California,
Utah, Arizona and Oregon.
   Using tablets from the erroneously labeled bottles would not
protect against or treat malaria, which can be life-threatening,
and large amounts of diuretics can lead to irregular heartbeat, low
blood pressure and general weakness, the agency said.
   The chloroquine phosphate tablets are round and white embossed
with the code ``BL'' on one side of the tablet and ``38'' on the
other side, the FDA said.
   The tablets of forosemide, an animal diuretic, are oval,
off-white and embossed with the code ``BL'' on one side and ``54''
on the other side.
   The FDA said anyone who has a bottle or prescription of the
recalled tablets should return the bottle to the pharmacy and
consult a physician.
   The agency is also asking pharmacists that may have received the
recalled product to search their prescription files and notify
patients immediately.
   The FDA said 1,000 bottles of the product may still be on
pharmacy shelves or in home medicine cabinets.

   The government of the northern
republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia, in the south and
east, is attempting to ``oust us from Yugoslavia.''
   The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia's
decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with
Slovenia.
   Liberal, prosperous Slovenia and the hard-line communist
leadership of Serbia have been feuding for years. But the Serbian
action Tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the Yugoslav
federation since the death of the nation's post-World War II leader
Josip Broz Tito in 1980.
   Earlier Friday 13 people were arrested when police dispersed a
crowd of about 100 gathered for a pro-Serbian rally in Ljubljana
that had been prohibited by Slovenian authorities. Slovenia issued
an order Tuesday banning the rally and Serbia reacted by severing
relations with Slovenia.
   In its statement, Slovenia's collective presidency called
Serbia's action ``a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal
and civilized norms.''
   ``We shall never permit anyone to drive us away or oust us from
Yugoslavia,'' it said.
   ``Yugoslavia is our country. We have the right to be citizens of
the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and also to be different. Those
who do not acknowledge this separate themselves from the federal
state.''
   It denounced the Serbian communist leadership, saying, ``We do
not accept a comprehensive control of a single truth, of political
uniformity, authoritarianism and intolerance, of ideologic
monolithism.''
   Serbia is the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Aleksandar Prlja, Serbia's secretary for foreign affairs, told
The Associated Press that Slovenia's ``banning of the peaceful
rally was deeply humiliating for the Serbian people.
   ``This is irreconcilable with joint existence in a federal
state.''
   Slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by Serbian
politicians trying to oust the Slovenian leadership.
   Economic decline has brought increased friction between the
republics with their different ethnic populations, and the
Slovenian Serbian conflict also involves liberal vs. conservative
communist leaders. Slovenia advocates regional autonomy and has
legalized opposition groups that will contest the region's first
multi-party balloting in elections next spring. Serbia insists on a
centralized federtion with the Communist Party the only official
party.
   The Serbian news media on Friday accused Slovenia of
``fascist-like'' behavior and called for the resignation of
Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene.
   Delo, Ljubljana's major newspeper, said Friday's rally was ``an
integral part of a plan to alter by force the Yugoslav federation.
It was yet another attempt to bring Slovenia to its knees.''
   It called Serbia's imposition of an economic boycott a
``declaration of war'' and said Slovenia would respond by ``opening
itself to the world, introducing greater democracy and by holding
free elections.''

   The Soviet Union rejects parallels
between this weekend's Malta summit and the 1945 Yalta Conference
that decided Europe's postwar fate, a senior Soviet policymaker
said Friday.
   Despite the breadth of changes sweeping Europe, Valetin Falin,
chief of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's
international department, said his country sees no possibility at
present for German reunification.
   Nor does it foresee any East European countries abandoning the
Warsaw Pact military alliance, he said.
   Falin's comments came as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
prepared to meet President Bush in superpower summitry at a unique
historical moment.
   The Soviet and U.S. ``spheres of influence'' that have divided
Europe since 1945 are attributed to a series of allied meetings
held toward the end of the war.
   One of the key meetings _ including meeting of Josef Stalin,
Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill _ was held at Yalta, a
Black Sea port in the Soviet Crimea, in February 1945.
   The demands by Eastern Europeans for free elections and their
rejection of monopolistic communist parties are the most widespread
challenges to the system imposed in the region under Soviet
dominance since the war.
   In their first meeting as heads of state, Bush and Gorbachev
must address what the breakdown of that old order would mean for
their relations and for the future of Europe.
   But that does not mean drafting a new Yalta agreement, said
Falin.
   ``We should refrain from drawing historical parallels between
events that in reality have very little in common,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   ``Yalta solved its problems for its times,'' while Bush and
Gorbachev ``will be looking at the problems of their times,'' he
said.
   But unlike Yalta, Falin said, ``They will be looking at the
problems within their own jurisdictions and that will be ...
without any right to influence the decisions of other countries or
third parties.''
   The accords reached at Yalta, Potsdam, Germany and elsewhere
carved up Germany and redrew frontiers in Eastern Europe.
   The postwar division of Europe into spheres of influence _
roughly corresponding with the position of allied forces at the end
of the war _ have profoundly affected millions of East Europeans
without their having a voice in the decision.
   For many Poles, Czechoslovaks, Yugoslavs and others, it amounted
to abandonment by the West despite wartime sacrifices on behalf of
the allies, a memory that still arouses bitterness.
   Falin said neither superpower wants to impose its will on the
smaller countries of Europe today.
   ``The Soviet Union _ and we believe the United States _ does not
believe it has the right to dictate hegemony on the world or in any
form having its views accepted by third parties,'' he said.
   The policy of ``the right to self-determination to make one's
own decisions ... will play a very important role'' in the
Bush-Gorbachev meeting, he said.
   But Falin also said the Soviet Union does not see that
self-determination translating at present into the possibility of
one or more East bloc countries leaving the Warsaw Pact or of the
two Germanys reuniting.
   ``The question of the new reunification of Germany in practical
terms does not exist at the moment,'' he said. ``That is a question
that will be solved by history and how it is solved is something
that most likely not we, but our children, will know about.''
   Noting that Germany was divided according to an agreement among
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, he said
that agreement remains in force.
   ``It is a political and legal reality that no one can ignore and
no one can pretend does not exist.''
   As far as the chance that Hungary or Poland might want to bolt
the Soviet-dominated military alliance, Falin seemed to contradict
a statement to reporters earlier in the day by Soviet Lt. Gen.
Viktor Staradodubov, who said ``any Warsaw Pact country has that
right and can exercise that right.''
   ``Either the statement was not absolutely exact or the
translation was not correct,'' Falin said.
   ``Both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw
Pact are serious organizations, the members of which have different
duties. It is questionable whether one can talk about (giving up)
those duties in such a light-handed manner,'' he said.
   Besides, Falin added, no member of the Warsaw Pact _ comprising
the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Bulgaria and East Germany _ has made any move to leave it so far.
   ``Anything about such a question is pure speculation,'' he said.

   President Bush's decision to commit
U.S. air power on behalf of Corazon Aquino upset the rebels'
timetable and deprived them of the advantage they had sought
unsuccessfully in previous coup attempts.
   U.S. warplanes provided air cover for loyal forces and appeared
Friday to have turned the tide against mutinous soldiers who had
seemed close to toppling the nearly 4-year-old administration of
President Aquino.
   In attempts to overthrow the government in January 1987 and
again the following August, mutineers tried to seize Villamor Air
Base and the naval air station at Sangley Point. They failed. This
time, they succeeded.
   Seizing those two installations gave the mutineers access to
aircraft, enabling them to rocket and strafe the presidential
palace and two major military targets and to knock out the only
government television station that was broadcasting Friday.
   With an airfield, the rebels could also fly their own
reinforcements quickly from areas of southeastern Luzon and
Mindanao, where opposition to the government is strong.
   By noon, the rebels had blasted Malacanang Palace twice and Camp
Crame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, and Camp
Aguinaldo, headquarters of the armed forces, a total of six times.
   The psychological impact was great. Presidential staff members
contacted by telephone panicked. The attacks cut Mrs. Aquino off
from her people. One attack knocked off the air the only operating
TV station, depriving her of her conduit to the people.
   Rebel sources, contacted at the height of the attacks, said they
were convinced of victory and were simply waiting for Mrs. Aquino
to resign. All that changed with U.S. intervention.
   Mrs. Aquino said the government decided to ask for U.S. military
support by noon, when her situation appeared desperate. The
presence of U.S. Air Force F-4 fighter-bombers put an end to rebel
air raids.
   During the lull, Philippine F-5 jets raided Sangley Point and
destroyed the planes that had attacked the palace.
   The halt in air operations also gave the government time to rush
in reinforcements from nearby regions of central and southern Luzon
Island, where commanders were loyal to Mrs. Aquino.
   When the coup attempt was launched early Friday, it appeared
that the government could count on relatively few troops based in
the capital.
   Reporters saw few pro-government checkpoints or patrols on the
streets during the crucial, early hours of the coup attempt, when
the rebels were rushing units into the capital.
   At Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of the Philippine army, military
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the situation was a
``standoff,'' with pro- and anti-government units equally matched.
   Philippine marines, on the other hand, spearheaded the rebel
takeover of Villamor. Ironically, the marine detachment was
reinforced after the August 1987 coup attempt because the command
doubted the loyalty of the army. It brought additional marine units
from the southern Philippines because of their supposed discipline.
   But the appearance of U.S. warplanes in the skies upset the
mutineers' timetable. Rebel units heading for the capital stopped
for hours, apparently confused over the implications of
Washington's action.
   By the time they resumed heading for Manila, the government had
reinforced its garrison with loyal troops.
   Late Friday, a rebel spokesman condemned the American move as
``an act of aggression against the sovereign Filipino people.''

<TEXT>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP _ A defense consultant was sentenced Friday
to serve six months in a work-release facility for selling
confidential bid information on a $100 million Pentagon contract to
Unisys Corp.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va., ordered
William J. Sanda to serve the six-month sentence in a community
facility where he would be released each day to go to work.
   Sanda, 53, was also ordered to serve two years of supervised
probation following completion of the six-month term for conspiring
to defraud the government.
   Sanda pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge Sept. 2, admitting
that he sold confidential bid information on a $100 million Marine
Corps electronics contract to Unisys Corp. for $24,750 and split
the proceeds with a fellow consultant.
   Sanda, who was president Strategic Systems Institute of
Rockville, Md., is now cooperating with the Justice Department's
continuing investigation of defense procurement fraud that is
nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   In pleading guilty earlier this fall, Sanda admitted that in
March 1987 he agreed to serve as ``front man'' for fellow
consultant William Parkin. Sanda and Parkin shared the proceeds of
the fees Unisys paid for the information obtained from the Pentagon.
   Parkin, 65, has been sentenced to 26 months in prison and fined
$25,000.
   Parkin is also cooperating with the investigation.

<HEAD>Swedes Call for Legalizing Homosexual Marriage to Combat AIDS</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish authorities observed World AIDS Day on Friday with a
call for legal homosexual marriage, and other countries introduced
weapons against the disease that ranged from free syringes to a
cartoon series.
   In Geneva, the World Health Organization, which was sponsoring
the day to raise awareness of the epidemic, displayed a patchwork
quilt at its headquarters carrying names of victims claimed by the
disease.
   Claes Ortendahl, director of Sweden's Social Welfare Board, said
legalizing of homosexual marriage would help suppress the disease
by discouraging promiscuity.
   Homosexuals and intravenous drug users are among the
highest-risk groups for AIDS, which destroys the body's ability to
fight infection.
   Cyprus began a weeklong series of television cartoons presenting
information about AIDS and how to prevent it.
   ``The campaign is dedicated to the island's youth, because they
are most vulnerable to the deadly disease,'' said Dr. Haris Fessas
of the island's National AIDS Committee.
   A Gallup poll released Friday found 73 percent of Canadian
teen-agers interviewed and 64 percent of adults believe condom
dispensing machines should be installed in high schools to protect
schoolchildren.
   ``The potential for the movement of the AIDS epidemic into the
youth population is very high,'' said Robert Burr, the Canadian
health association's communications director.
   Soviet lawmaker Boris Yeltsin, on a six-day unofficial visit to
Greece, announced he would give 1 million disposable syringes to
Soviet children's hospitals.
   Yeltsin said most Soviet hospitals have re-usable syringes,
increasing the risk of contracting AIDS.
   Full-page newspaper advertisements in Britain pointed out that
it is impossible to say exactly how many people are infected
because a person can carry the AIDS virus for years without showing
symptoms.
   ``We know of 11,218 people in the United Kingdom who have been
infected with the virus that leads to AIDS. It's the number we
don't know that is even more worrying,'' said the advertisements
paid for by the British Health Education Authority.
   Many countries do not report figures of AIDS victims because of
poor reporting facilities or for fear of losing face and suffering
bad publicity that could damage tourism.
   In Vietnam, state radio said authorities found no one carrying
the AIDS virus when they tested 6,500 people from high-risk groups
in Hanoi and three other cities.
   Vietnam, China and many other nations consider AIDS a foreign
threat.
   In Sydney, Australia, the Morning Herald newspaper said the
disease had claimed the lives of 10 ``great artists' from Australia
and published their photographs under the headline ``The Killer
that is Gathering In Our Best and Our Brightest.''
   ``Today, with the (death) toll well over 800, and 10,000
Australians known to be infected, artists and performers fear we
are going the same way as the United States,'' the newspaper said.
   Updating its AIDS report Friday, the World Health Organization
said 11,000 new cases were registered by last month, bringing the
total reported 198,165.
   The United States has reported more than 110,000 of the cases.
More than 66,000 people have died of AIDS in the United States.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Halts Plutonium Production Indefinitely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said Friday
that plutonium operations will be halted indefinitely at the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant until all safety concerns are met.
   Watkins also announced a major management shakeup at the plant,
and said the new management structure will make the plant more
responsive to safety concerns.
   Among the questions to be addressed, Watkins said, was whether
stray plutonium dust at the plant has accumulated in enough
quantity to cause a nuclear reaction.
   ``Although no major hardware problems were identified by the
Department of Energy team, conduct of operations, standards of
performance, engineering support and management structure remain
deficient,'' he said at a news conference after touring the plant.
   The weapons plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons, already has scaled back plutonium operations 20 percent
and soon will stop them altogether, Watkins said. Rocky Flats
processes plutonium to make triggers for nuclear weapons, the only
government facility to do so.
   He said the plutonium operations will remain shut down until he
and EG&amp;G Inc., which will operate the plant for DOE starting Jan.
1, are satisfied the safety concerns are met. Among the safety
concerns mentioned by Watkins on Friday was accumulation of
plutonium dust in ductwork at the plant.
   Under the new management structure, there will be a waste
management division and a production division with equal authority,
Watkins said.
   Watkins also addressed recent reports about plutonium dust being
found in alarming quantities in ductwork at Rocky Flats. Initial
reports indicated there was enough plutonium present to cause
``criticality,'' or a nuclear reaction, but another study found
there was less plutonium present in the ducts than originally
thought. Both reports said there was no evidence a reaction had
occurred.
   Watkins said the criticality issue is serious, but does not pose
a public safety threat.
   ``Nevertheless, because it is an important safety issue, I am
asking EG&amp;G to independently review the report's findings and
produce their own action plan,'' he said. ``This is an important
enough issue that we will not resume plutonium operations until we
have taken action to address plutonium criticality.''
   Gov. Roy Romer, who also was present at Watkins' news
conference, said the decision to halt all plutonium processing
shows a new commitment by DOE to safety issues, but said with the
department's record of past safety violations, he wants to see
proof.
   Romer said it was a mistake to build the nuclear weapons plant
so close to a metropolitan area, 16 miles northwest of Denver, but
said it will take 15 years to move it.
   ``It's obvious that the proof is in the pudding, and it's my job
as governor of Colorado to make sure the citizens are safe,'' Romer
said.
   Watkins admitted that DOE made major mistakes at Rocky Flats.
   ``We did not bring our management into the modern world and
we're going to do that now,'' he said.
   He said poor management at the facility had made it difficult
for workers to do their job properly, and that would have to
change. He said it also is necessary to gain the public's respect.
   ``Of course we have a credibility problem. What we are trying to
do now is regain it,'' he said.
   Watkins said the plant would shut down plutonium operations for
inventory during the holiday period anyway.
   He said the recent transfer of control from Rockwell
International to EG&amp;G provided an excellent time to change
management and attitudes at Rocky Flats. It could be mid-January
before operations resume, he said.
   However, Watkins acknowledged that any long-term shutdown could
seriously affect American's nuclear weapons capability. The plant
is the only one of its kind in the United States that makes
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   He said operations will resume on a building-by-building basis,
with new criteria set up for resuming operations.
   Among the criteria are the development of system drawings,
verification that all alarm systems are operational, verifying that
required maintenance has been completed, and that workers are
properly traine

<DATELINE>WUERZBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Army helicopter on night
maneuvers crashed in a field near here, killing the pilot and
injuring the other crewman aboard, the Army said Friday.
   The accident occurred late Thursday while the OH-58C helicopter
was on a training exercise, according to the 3rd Infantry Division
based in Wuerzburg.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said in Washington that the Army informed him
the crash took place during a night-vision goggles mission.
   ``I am convinced that these tragic accidents will continue until
Army officials admit that they have a problem and totally rewrite
their night-vision goggles program,'' McCloskey said in a statement.
   McCloskey, who favors a temporary suspension of the goggles, has
called for a coordinated Pentagon investigation and a review of the
military use of the goggles, which amplify low light.
   Critics have questioned whether the goggles work adequately when
there is no moon or when cloudy weather obscures stars.
   The Army said the helicopter struck a cable attached to a
high-tension wire pylon and crashed in a field about six miles
northeast of Wuerzburg.
   Both crewmembers were flown to the 60th Evacuation Hospital in
Wuerzburg, where the pilot was pronounced dead. The other crewman
was taken to the University Hospital in Wuerzburg, where he was
listed in fair condition, the statement said.
   Neither was identified.
   The helicopter was assigned to the 4th Brigade (Aviation) at
Giebelstadt Army Airfield, the statement said.
   Wuerzburg is about 75 miles southeast of Frankfurt. Giebelstadt
is just south of Wuerzburg.
   The Orange County Register newspaper in California reported last
March that since 1978, 37 of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which
night goggles were used occurred when there was not enough
moonlight for the devices to amplify. It said those crashes killed
65 soldiers.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Agree to Return to Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikers at the largest coal mine in the Vorkuta
region of the Soviet Arctic agreed Friday to go back to work after
wresting a promise of independence from outside authorities, Tass
reported.
   The decision to return to work ends a five-week-long strike
across 13 mines in the northern region. The strikers were demanding
the government make good on pledges it offered to end a nationwide
coal strike last summer.
   The workers at the Vorgashorskaya mine were the last still on
strike. They will return to work Saturday, the official Tass news
agency said.
   They made the decision after a copy of new regulations granting
them independence from regional authority was approved by the Coal
Minister Mikhail Shchadov and sent to the Vorkuta mine, Tass said.
   Tass said the new rules grant the mine ``full independence.'' It
said the mine can even ``terminate its subordination'' to the
official coal association, provided it keeps fulfilling state
orders for delivery of coal to consumers.
   Miners began the walkout at the 13 shafts around Vorkuta, 950
miles northeast of Moscow, on Oct. 25 to press demands that the
government fulfill promised increases in pensions and wage
differentials for hazardous working conditions. They also sought
pledged improvements in living conditions.
   The government made the promises to end strikes that gripped
nearly all the country's coal fields in July.
   Miners' representatives met in the Kremlin with Premier Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov on Nov. 17 to discuss their grievances. Ryzhkov was
reported to have said pension increases and longer vacations were
provided for in legislation making its way through the Soviet
legislature.
   Tass said coal supplies were still down, even though other mines
had begun operating normally. It gave no figures.

<HEAD>Report Says Guyana Replaces Haiti as Hemisphere's Poorest Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team that assessed Guyana's economy
said the former British colony has replaced Haiti as the poorest
nation in the Western Hemisphere.
   The team was led by Alister Mcintyre, secretary-general of the
Caribbean Community. In a 32-page report relesed Thursday, it said
Guyana should try to attract foreign investment through joint
ventures and by selling state companies.
   Mcintyre's group generally agreed with austerity measures
required by the International Monetary Fund, including a recent
devaluation of the Guyana dollar, now worth 3 cents U.S. cents; a
cut in government spending, and efforts to reduce the $2 billion
foreign debt.
   The IMF required the actions as conditions for financing a $1
billion recovery program aimed at reorganizing the stagnant,
state-dominated economy, which has shown no growth in 10 years.
   According to the report, bauxite, sugar, rice and other exports
have fallen 20 percent below levels in the 1970s and ``Guyana is
now ranked below Haiti as the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere.''
   ``Productive assets are in a state of disrepair,'' it said.
``Nutrition and health standards have fallen sharply.'' The
investigators, who spent a week in the country on South America's
northeastern shoulder, said the gross national product had declined
6 percent a year since 1980.
   Skilled professionals have emigrated to North America and the
Caribbean at an alarming rate because of the decline, the report
said.
   ``Recent estimates put emigration at 1,000 per month, or about 3
percent of the working age population per annum,'' it said.

   A bomb exploded Friday night in an
apartment building housing some workers for the state oil company,
wounding at least 11 people, security officials reported.
   No one asserted responsibility for the attack, but investigators
suspected U.S.-backed rebels fighting the Marxist government.
   Security officials said the bomb went off in a four-story
building in Luanda, the capital.
   ANGOP, the government news agency, said the bomb was placed
under the main stairway of the building that has apartments for
employees of the Sonangol state oil company.
   It said two of 11 people injured were in serious condition.
   Witnesses said they believed some people were injured by jumping
from windows on uppor floors because the stairway was destroyed by
the blast.
   The explosion was the fourth in Luanda in a year. Previous
targets were the state airline TAAG, U.S. and French oil companies
and a military supply center.
   The rebels claimed responsibility for two of the bombings.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting to force the government to share power since
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and Marxist forces
emerged victorious from a brief civil war.

   The Justice Department said Friday it had
obtained a court order stripping U.S. citizenship from a former
Ohio man accused of serving as a Nazi SS guard at World War II
concentration camps.
   A federal judge here issued a default order that stripped Jakob
Frank Denzinger, 65, formerly of Akron, Ohio, of his U.S.
citizenship, the department said.
   U.S. District Judge John Pratt issued the order last Monday
after the attorney for Denzinger told the government his client did
not plan to respond to the charges.
   Denzinger, who had been a successful businessman in Akron, fled
the country before the Justice Department filed its complaint last
summer.
   He is believed to be in West Germany, the department said.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations
charged in a complaint filed last summer that Denzinger had served
as a guard at five concentration camps, including Auschwitz from
May 1943 through March of 1945.
   Denzinger, who came to this country in 1956 as a refugee, was
also accused of persecuting concentration camp inmates when he was
a guard.
   The complaint also charged that Denzinger concealed his service
as a member of the Nazi Waffen SS Death's Head Battalions when he
applied for U.S. citizenship in 1972.

   Thousands of people watched the
conflict Friday between rebels and loyal troops, and many cheered
when mutinous pilots attacked the presidential palace.
   Hundreds of spectators gathered on the South Superhighway
overpass as three T-28 aircraft and a Sikorsky helicopter bombarded
the palace. As the aircraft fired, people cheered.
   ``Wow! That was a great shot,'' said cigarette vendor Julio
Torres, pointing toward the palace. ``But it would really be better
if there could be a dogfight later on, just like in the movies.''
   Hours later, Philippine air force F-5 jets chased the renegade
aircraft out of the Manila area and destroyed some on the ground at
an air station in Sangley Point in Cavite province, just across
Manila Bay.
   In the afternoon, American warplanes helped patrol the skies
over the capital, with President Bush's approval, to help President
Corazon Aquino's government the sixth attempted coup. Mrs. Aquino
was not in the presidential palace when it was attacked.
   ``I wish there could be a live gun battle,'' said a 9-year-old
boy on the overpass. ``I haven't seen one, although I've watched a
lot of war movies.''
   Early Friday, rebellious marines from Fort Bonifacio seized
control of the air force headquarters in the suburban Villamor air
base.
   Soon people from squatters' districts outside the two military
compounds rushed to the overpass as rebel troops set up road blocks.
   As the officers issued orders children gathered around the
soldiers, examining their automatic weapons and recoilless rifles.
   Others tapped the sides two armored personnel carriers and two
landing- vehicle tanks and pointed at the machine guns.
   As time passed the onlookers were joined by office and factory
workers. Newspaper boys arrived and sold early editions.
   By midmorning vendors were selling soda, peanuts and boiled duck
eggs.
   Indian businessman Shiv Inder Singh, his wife and daughter posed
for souvenir photographs with rebel soldiers.
   Singh, who plans to establish a garment factory in the
Philippines, said, ``I don't think the coup will affect foreign
investments, if the government acts swiftly.'' His wife said, ``I
think this happens here all the time.''
   There have been at least six attempted coups since Mrs. Aquino
became president after President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a
civilian-military uprising in February 1986.

   Actress Jane Fonda and California
Assemblyman Tom Hayden filed separate divorce petitions on Friday,
both saying the split after 16 years of marriage was amicable.
   Fonda and Hayden reached agreements on financial and property
matters, but details weren't disclosed because of a privacy pact,
their attorneys said.
   The couple separated in December 1988 and the court papers
didn't give a reason for the split. They will share custody of
their 16-year-old son, Troy, their spokesman, Stephen Rivers, said
in a statement.
   ``Tom and Jane wish each other well and look to the future with
enthusiasm and optimism,'' said Rivers.
   Attorneys said it was unusual for both parties in a divorce case
to file separate petitions.
   ``They just wanted to make it very clear that neither side was
initiating this,'' said Hayden's lawyer, Ken Young. ``They just
reached a point where they wanted to move on with their lives.''
   Attorney Dennis Wasser, representing Miss Fonda, said the
divorce would be final in six months.
   Miss Fonda, 52, won best actress Oscars for the 1971 film
``Klute'' and in 1978 for ``Coming Home.''
   Hayden, 50, the one-time Chicago Seven anti-war activist,
represents Santa Monica as a Democrat in the state Assembly.
   The two were married in January 1973.

   The East German Parliament abolished the
Communist Party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy on Friday,
as pro-democracy groups had demanded, reflecting a national fever
for swift and thorough reform.
   The 500-member People's Chamber named a commission to
investigate abuse of office. Commission chairman Heinrich Toeplitz
revealed details of personal enrichment by the elite before Erich
Honecker was forced out as party chief in October.
   Deputies gasped and shook their heads in disgust when Toeplitz
said Honecker and other ousted leaders put $54 billion in Swiss
bank accounts and spent huge sums on hunting lodges, luxury
vacation homes and other indulgences.
   Many lawmakers shouted for justice and compensation. Deputy
Wolfgang Reinhold called the abuses ``degenerate'' behavior that
should be punished.
   East Germany became the second Soviet bloc nation this week to
abolish the Communist monopoly on power. Czechoslovakia's
parliament did it Wednesday.
   Earlier this year, Poland named its first non-Communist
government since World War II and Hungary's Communist Party
transformed itself into a Social Democratic party. Bulgaria also
moved toward reforms.
   While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalization has
led to looser Soviet control over allies, there is no indication
the Communists are ready to relinquish their hold on power in the
Kremlin.
   The official East German news agency ADN said the 163-member
Central Committee would meet Sunday. It could decide to expel
Honecker and other members of the former leadership.
   Former economic chief Guenter Mittag already has been expelled
in the party's effort to win public favor.
   Egon Krenz, who replaced Honecker as party leader, told deputies
Friday the Communist Party was responsible for the nation's severe
economic problems and the excesses.
   ``Gross political errors have been committed by my party,''
Krenz told the session, which was carried live on state television.
``As leader of the Politburo and the Central Committee, I take
responsibility for this.''
   ``Such behavior will never be repeated.''
   Krenz, 52, faces growing challenges from both the opposition and
the party because of his long association with the hard-line
Honecker regime.
   The city council of Plauen called for Krenz's resignation over
his alleged role in faking the results of municipal elections this
summer that gave the Communists an overwhelming majority.
   Parliament, long a rubber-stamp body that translated Communist
Party policy into law, had been scheduled to devote Friday's
session to discussion of new regulations on foreign travel.
   But non-Communist parliament speaker Guenther Maleuda opened the
session by saying the leaders of all parties represented in the
People's Chamber jointly proposed a constitutional revision to
strip the Communists of their guaranteed leading role.
   Without debate, a show of hands was called on the motion to drop
a passage from Article 1 describing East Germany as ``under
leadership of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party.''
   The Communist-dominated chamber broke out into applause after
all but five of the 420 deputies present voted in favor of striking
the Communist power monopoly from the constitution. The five
abstained.
   ``This is the best we could have wished for,'' said Carla Kawalt
of the leading opposition group, New Forum, when told of the
decision. ``We are very happy with this action.''
   She said the constitutional change was necessary to give other
political groups more influence in national affairs. She declined,
however, to characterize the move as a sign the Communist
leadership is committed to democratic principles.
   New Forum activists in Karl-Marx-Stadt called for a two-hour
strike for Wednesday, demanding further reforms such as a
market-oriented economy. National New Forum leader Baerbel Bohley
resisted the call but said she supported the demands.
   Members of the Christian Democratic Union, which like all of the
parties in parliament traditionally has voted along with the
Communists, suggested the designation of East Germany as ``a
socialist state'' also be stricken from the constitution. But that
proposal failed to win the two-thirds majority needed for
constitutional changes, drawing only 112 ``yes'' votes and 20
abstentions.
   The amended article describes East Germany as a ``socialist
state of workers and farmers.''
   East Germans repeatedly have called for an end to Communist
domination during the street protests that have swept the nation
for two months.
   But even among pro-democracy activists, many voices recently
have called for keeping the nation's socialist foundation to stave
off the reunification aims of West Germany.
   Many East Germans fear that their small nation of 16.5 million
would lose its identity in a confederation or in a union with the
wealthy West German state that has more than 61 million people and
is one of the world's strongest economies.
   The Communists retain control of the government, but the change
approved Friday paves the way for a more competitive political
system for the next national elections, expected as early as next
year.
   The legislature also passed a resolution that said East Germany
regretted its participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms. The
resolution apologized to the people of Czechoslovakia and expressed
solidarity with its reforms.
   Special committees also were named to draft a law on free
elections and to consider further constitutional change.
   Deputies also heard warnings from Premier Hans Modrow, Planning
Minister Gerhard Schuerer and others that a long road lies ahead to
economic recovery.
   Trade Minister Manfred Flegel said the hoarding of high-priced
goods such as appliances and electronics has skyrocketed as
citizens have become fearful about the value of their currency,
which is non-convertible and is worth little outside East Germany.

   Nynex telephone workers ratified a contract
Friday after an acrimonious walkout that lasted nearly 4 months,
marking the final settlement of strikes against regional telephone
companies that began in August.
   ``It's over, it's over, it's over,'' said Bob Master, a
spokesman for the Communications Workers of America. ``We're
happy.''
   Eighty-five percent of the union workers approved the contract
in voting that began Monday and ended early Friday. The workers
planned to return to work Monday.
   ``We are very pleased,'' said Nynex spokesman John Bonomo. ``The
settlement is fair for everyone _ customers, employees and
shareholders. We're looking forward to welcoming all our employees
back to work on Monday, and dedicating ourselves to providing the
quality service our customers rely on us for.''
   In August, workers staged walkouts against four of the Baby Bell
companies formed in the break-up of AT&amp;T _ Nynex, Pacific Telesis,
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic. All except Nynex were back at work by
the end of the month.
   At Nynex, the CWA's 40,000 regional members struck subsidiary
New York Telephone on Aug. 6. They were joined at New England
Telephone by 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   A Nynex spokesman did not immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment.
   The rancorous strike left one striker dead after a picket line
confrontation and the telephone companies with a backlog on new
installations.
   The major issue concerned the company's insistence that workers
share part of their health costs. The final settlement did not
include any health-cost sharing.
   The IBEW settled first; its workers returned to work more than
two weeks ago. The CWA reached a tentative agreement on Nov. 22.
However, negotiations with two constituent groups continued until
Wednesday, Master said.

   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, the darling of
the 1976 Olympics with her seven perfect 10s, landed flawlessly in
the United States Friday after her stunning defection three days
earlier.
   ``I wanted to have a free life,'' Comaneci, who was guaranteed
political asylum, said in halting English at a news conference at
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   Asked how long she had thought about defecting, she replied, ``A
long time. I had it in my mind for a few years.''
   The 28-year-old Comaneci arrived on the Pan Am plane ``Liberty
Bell'' from Vienna just before 4:30 p.m., an airline spokesman said.
   Comaneci _ wearing a blue denim jacket, black shirt and jeans _
said she was not thinking about embarrassing her country's
government when she made her decision.
   ``It's not my business,'' she said. The Olympic gold medalist
also said she was looking forward to a change in lifestyle, ``I
know it will be different. I was nine times in the States, I know
the life here.''
   Comaneci was surrounded by Port Authority police as she walked
through the Pan Am terminal about 25 feet away from a horde of
reporters after her arrival. Clutching a bouquet of flowers,
Comaneci kept her head down as she entered a private Pan Am office
where she filled out forms.
   Comaneci appeared pale as she strode briskly through the
terminal, but the gymnast later smiled broadly as she walked toward
an airport lounge for a news conference.
   She was accompanied to her news conference by Konstantin Panit,
a Frenchman who said he was a friend of Comaneci.
   The gymnast was to spend the night in New York at an undisclosed
location, and two people familar with her plans who spoke only on
condition their names not be used said she intended to leave for
Miami on Saturday.
   Her former coach, Bela Karolyi, said earlier her final
destination was Indianapolis, headquarters of the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation. But Patti Auer, spokeswoman for the foundation, said
they had no word of Comaneci coming there.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that
Comaneci, who fled her homeland for Hungary on Tuesday, had been
granted refugee status and was ``in the air on her way to this
country.''
   Comaneci contacted a U.S. Embassy in Europe on Friday morning
and was quickly granted that status, said State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher, adding: ``We certainly welcome Ms.
Comaneci.''
   Refugee status means U.S. officials believe Comaneci has a
well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Romania, where
the hard-line Marxist government has rejected the reformist tide
sweeping other East European countries.
   She would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status in
the U.S. in one year, U.S. officials who requested anonymity said.
   Comaneci has been in hiding since fleeing Romania. She
reportedly told a border guard she was leaving ``for the sake of
freedom.''
   Her whereabouts and plans were unknown until word of her
impending arrival in New York broke Friday. Karolyi had encouraged
Comaneci earlier this week to follow his example and come to the
United States.
   Karolyi defected from Romania in 1981. It was initially believed
Comaneci would return to the United States with Karolyi from
Stuttgart, West Germany.
   Karolyi, who coached the then 14-year-old Comaneci during her
perfect performances at the Montreal Olympics, told U.S. Gymnastics
Federation spokesperson Patti Auer ``it was a big relief'' to know
the gymnast was headed for the United States. Auer spoke Friday
with Karolyi from West Germany.
   ``I was concerned when I heard she left the Hungarian hotel in
an unmarked car, but I was confident that she knows the lesson _
that she needed to go to the American Embassy,'' she quoted Karolyi
as saying.
   Comaneci's defection was a blow to the hard-line government of
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, who had named the 4-foot-11
gymnast a ``Hero of Socialist Labor'' for her accomplishments. She
was held up as a role model for Romanian youth.
   Comaneci won 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international
meets during her career, which won her a life of privilege in a
country that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for
most of this decade.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers fought rebels in two
poor neighborhoods of San Salvador on Friday and in scattered
encounters north and south of the city, the army reported.
   A Salvadoran photographer for Agence France-Presse was killed
and a Red Cross worker with him was wounded in Soyapango, one of
the neighborhoods where the armed forces said fighting took place
overnight.
   President Alfredo Cristiani said the national situation remained
critical but that his 5-month-old government was not in danger.
   A reporter for the French agency said the photographer, Eloy
Guevara; the Red Cross worker, carrying a white flag; and a
Salvadoran radio reporter were at a gas station at the foot of a
hill in an area that saw combat earlier.
   Journalists yards away from Guevara when he was shot said he was
crossing an intersection with three Red Cross workers when a burst
from an assault rifle struck him and ricocheted off a wall.
   Two reporters there agreed that judging from the angle of fire,
the bullets came from the side of the street where air force
paratroopers were in complete control.
   Guevara was the second journalist killed since the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, began an
offensive in the capital three weeks ago.
   The other was David Blundy, 44, a veteran war correspondent who
worked for The Sunday Correspondent of London.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. Southern Command
based in Panama, visited El Salvador on Friday. U.S. Embassy
spokesman Jeff Brown said ``the purpose of the visit was to
reaffirm U.S. support and his personal commitment to the world of
the Salvadoran armed forces.''
   The armed forces press office reported fighting overnight in the
Ciudad Delgado neighborhood, where leftist rebels remained, and
Soyapango. It said the guerrillas had left Soyapango.
   Both neighborhoods were major combat zones in the early days of
the FMLN offensive, which has made thousands of San Salvador
residents homeless.
   The offensive radically changed the decade-old guerrilla war
against U.S.-backed governments, in which more than 71,000 people
have been killed. It brought heavy combat to the capital for the
first time and the guerrillas began using anti-aircraft missiles.
   Pentagon officials in Washington said introduction of the
missiles meant the Salvadoran military, whose air power had faced
little challenge, would have to change its tactics.
   Military officials said Friday nine soldiers and nine guerrillas
had been killed in fighting near Zacatecoluca, 25 miles south of
San Salvador, where rebels fired a Soviet-made SAM-7 surface-to-air
missile Wednesday for the first time. A military source said the
missile missed an A-37 jet fighter.
   Salvador's rightist government accused Nicaragua of supplying
the missiles and suspended relations. The United States filed a
formal protest with the Soviet Union, which arms Nicaragua, and the
issue is on the agenda for the weekend summit off Malta between
President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   One soldier and one guerrilla were reported wounded at
Tonacatepeque, 10 miles north of San Salvador.
   Cristiani said a state of siege imposed after the start of the
offensive would not be lifted until violence subsided. The rules
restrict freedoms, including freedom of the press.
   San Salvador's mayor asked residents to forgo the custom of
setting off fireworks over the Christmas holiday.
   Residents of the exclusive Escalon neighborhood began repairing
houses that were shot up when guerrillas took over about 40 homes
there and in another wealthy district Wednesday. Some residents
closed their homes and went abroad or to visit relatives.
   American citizens were evacuated from the area during a
cease-fire the rebels declared Thursday. More than 200 U.S. Embassy
dependents and private citizens left El Salvador on a charter
flight.
   In Washington, the State Department said two of the damaged
homes were occupied by Americans. No residents were reported hurt.
   Soldiers from El Salvador's toughest battalions patrolled the
streets of Escalon and surrounding neighborhoods.
   Streets were littered with spent cartridges, burned-out luxury
cars and downed power lines. Guerrillas withdrew under cover of
darkness, leaving a few snipers behind.
   Soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion burned a guerrilla's body and
dumped it headfirst into a mesh trash basket outside one of the
fortified mansions in Escalon.
   A crude cardboard sign with a skull and crossbones scrawled on
it was jammed in next to the body. It said the Atlacal does not
take prisoners.
   ``There is no man, no law that holds us back,'' the sign said.
   A soldier said of the guerrilla: ``He thought he'd scare us. We
burned him.''

   On the eve of their superpower
summit, President Bush said Friday he would seek a ``future free of
both tyranny and fear'' while Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised the two
men would strive together toward ``a new world ... a better world.''
   Gorbachev flew to Malta after a historic visit with Pope Paul II
and said recent developments called for a ``more dynamic dialogue''
between the United States and Soviet Union.
   Bush, who arrived at the windswept summit site earlier in the
day, said, ``Our meeting here off Malta will last two days but the
freedoms that we seek must last for generations.''
   The two men sit down on Saturday for the first session of their
shipboard summit, taking place against a backdrop of stunning
change in Eastern Europe that has swept hard-line regimes from
power. In nearly 12 hours of scheduled talks, Gorbachev and Bush
are expected to discuss arms control, trade relations and conflicts
such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua as well as Eastern Europe.
   ``The whole world now is taking a deep breath,'' said Italian
Premier Giulio Andreotti, expressing the anticipation felt
throughout Europe.
   Gray clouds, cold weather and choppy seas set the scene for the
talks, being conducted on U.S. and Soviet warships anchored in the
harbor off the coast of this Mediterranean island. Malta's entire
1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police were out in force
to protect the superpower leaders.
   U.S. and Maltese patrol boats circled and frogmen checked the
waters as Bush landed by helicopter on the American guided-missile
cruiser USS Belknap, his command post and the meeting site Sunday
for the summit.
   Bush's last-minute summit preparations were interrupted by an
attempted coup in the Philippines, which he sought to snuff out by
committing U.S. air support to forces loyal to President Corazon
Aquino.
   ``We will be speaking about peace ... to a new world, to a
better world for the peoples of all continents,'' Gorbachev said at
Luqa Airport on his arrival just before midnight.
   Gorbachev flew from Italy several hours after a historic meeting
with Pope Paul II at the Vatican, where he said Russians ``have a
right to satisfy their spiritual needs,'' and pledged swift
adoption of a new religious law guaranteeing freedom of worship.
   Before leaving Italy, Gorbachev offered his clearest endorsement
yet of the changes in Eastern Europe. He told a news conference in
Milan that the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement of 1968 was
``right at that time and is right now.''
   But he stopped short of an apology for the Warsaw Pact invasion
of Czechoslovakia that put down the reform movement in 1968. He
said it must be viewed in the context of an accelerating arms race
and an ideological struggle between East and West at that time.
   Beyond promising religious tolerance, Gorbachev said the Kremlin
will establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican. He invited the
Pope to pay a visit to the Soviet Union _ officially an atheist
nation _ although no date was announced.
   Bush talked of the Philippines as well as the summit.
   ``I strongly support Mrs. Aquino and she knows it,'' he said. He
said the situation in Manila ``sounds maybe a little better but ...
hard to tell.''
   During a brief visit to the American aircraft carrier, the USS
Forrestal, Bush called Gorbachev ``a dynamic new Soviet leader
willing ... to think anew.
   ``And we want him to succeed,'' the president said. ``Because we
do admire the people in the Soviet Union. And we know that ours is
an historic opportunity to foster the peace.'' Bush expressed hope
that ``ours can be a future free of both tyranny and fear.''
   He presented the Forrestal's crew with a piece of the crumbling
Berlin Wall as ``a symbol of the peace we seek.''
   He watched a demonstration of warplanes being catapulted off the
deck and screeching into the sky. A thunderous sonic boom from an
F-14 caught him by surprise, and Bush's knees buckled and he
ducked. He recovered quickly with a sheepish grin and a funny face
for cameras.
   Gorbachev delivered his promise of religious freedom as he
joined the pope at a news conference in the Vatican.
   ``People of many confessions, including Christians, Moslems,
Jews, Buddhists and others live in the Soviet Union,'' the Kremlin
leader said. ``All of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual
needs.''
   He said a freedom-of-conscience law would be adopted soon.
   The pope called the meeting a ``promise-filled sign for the
future'' and pledged support for Gorbachev's efforts to overhaul
Soviet society.
   The Malta summit is the first superpower meeting since Gorbachev
met then President Ronald Reagan in New York last December. Bush
attended that meeting as vice president.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III will lead a
six-person U.S. delegation, while Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will lead the eight-person Soviet team.
   Bush, who is expected to make the opening presentation Saturday,
convened a meeting in the Belknap wardroom of senior U.S. advisers,
focusing on issues ``which will demonstrate the U.S. desire for
progress and improvement in East-West relations,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   For his quarters, Bush took over the admiral's three-room suite,
furnished with deep blue carpeting, leather furniture and a
mahogany desk with U.S. and Soviet flags in a holder. A new brass
plaque was on the door, reading, ``President Bush.''
   Echoing statements by U.S. officials, a top Soviet spokesman
said Friday he doubted that any agreements would be signed during
the summit.
   ``I think President Bush is right when he says there will be no
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting,'' said
Valentin Falin, head of the International Department of the Soviet
Communist Party.
   But Falin, an architect of Soviet policy toward Europe, hinted
that Gorbachev would press Bush toward accords on banning nuclear
weapons from the Mediterranean Sea, which the United States
opposes, and for coping with political changes sweeping Eastern
Europe.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of police guarded
polling stations Saturday as voters cast ballots in Taiwan's first
election with legal opposition parties.
   There were long lines of voters at polling booths and state
radio predicted a heavy turnout. Results were not expected until
sometime Sunday.
   Voting appeared to be orderly but radio reports said several
people were injured Friday night in clashes at campaign-closing
rallies in the industrial city of Kaohsiung.
   There are 722 candidates running in the legislative, mayoral and
county magistrate elections, which are seen as a major step in
Taiwan's march toward democracy after four decades of rule by the
Nationalist Party.
   It is an important test of the Democratic Progressive Party, the
main opposition. The party was legalized in 1987 following the end
of martial law, under which opposition parties were banned.
   More than 75,000 police guarded about 10,000 polling stations to
prevent sabotage and security forces readied barbed wire and
roadblocks in case of riots. Police have said they received tips
about plans to disrupt the elections with bombs and the use of
chemicals to destroy ballots.
   About 12 million ot Taiwan's 20 million citizens were eligible
to vote.
   Opposition candidates have called for ``the downfall of the
Nationalist Party,'' which has ruled this island nation since it
lost a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland in
1949.
   They accused the Nationalists of buying votes and other unfair
tactics.
   President Lee Teng-hui and his wife cast their ballots in
Taipei. He told reporters, ``Don't forget to vote. The weather is
nice so there will be a big turnout.''
   Nationalist leader James Soong said losses for his party could
cause social unrest and damage the island's prosperous economy.
``Our party has made reforms and brought welfare to the public,''
he said.
   The Nationalists cannot lose all power in the election. The
256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by
elderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in
the late 1940s to support the party's claim to be the legitimate
government of all China.
   The electoral college will choose a president next year.
   In a last-minute move to win support from reform-minded voters,
the Nationalists announced that 34 of the 162 elderly legislators
had agreed to accept handsome pensions and will file for retirement
soon.
   Few legislators took advantage of the retirement program when it
was announced in February by President Lee Teng-hui.
   Opposition leader Kang said his party was handicapped during the
campaign by the Nationalist's domination of the island's economy
and media.
   Taiwan's three government TV stations initially gave almost
exclusive coverage to Nationalist candidates but yielded under
pressure from the public.
   The opposition also says the Nationalists also have been helped
by an immense party machine that mobilized village chiefs and other
politicians to secure votes.
   The Nationalists also have been accused of rampant vote buying
and violence, including sabotaging campaign offices and shooting an
independent candidate. The Nationalists denied the charges, but
financial officials said cash in circulation jumped by $1.1 billion
the past week because of vote-buying.
   ``We have but incomplete democracy,'' said Kang Ning-hsiang, the
leader of the Democratic Progressive Party.
   Although opposition candidates running as independents received
22 percent of the vote in 1986 legislative elections, they only won
12 seats.
   The opposition is expected to win at least 30 percent of the
popular vote. But this year it has chosen to focus on local
elections, especially the five mayorships and 17 county magistrate
seats being contested.
   The party believes that winning grass-roots power can help bring
about more local autonomy and build a stronger power base.
   Most opposition candidates have focused on domestic problems,
including pollution and official corruption.
   The most contentious campaign issue was raised by 32 opposition
candidates who formed an alliance to openly call for an
``independent Taiwan.''
   In a rejection of the Nationalist goal to one day rule over a
reunified China, the alliance called for ``a new country and new
constitution.''
   Such a demand is seditious under the constitution and served as
an indication of Taiwan's increasingly open political debate.
   Many Taiwanese remain skeptical of the movement because of
Communist China's threat to invade the island if it declares
independence.

   Now that he's finally got his career on track,
Paul Carrack would like to thank a special grade school friend from
Sheffield, England.
   ``I remember when I was a little kid I used to stand next to Mr.
Holden, one of the teachers,'' recalled the 38-year-old
singer-keyboardist, whose new album is called ``Groove Approved.''
   ``I could never understand what was going on. This guy was a
music teacher and he used to sing counterpoint to all the hymns.
And I thought, `What's going on here, 'cause he's singing the wrong
tune yet it's all working.'
   ``I used to always try to get near this guy. I'm sure he must be
dead by now, but he was an incredible guy. He wrote this whole
opera for little kids, based on the `Barber of Seville.' He played
fiddle, amd come to think of it, I starred in one of his shows.''
   Love of music has sustained this rock 'n' roll journeyman, a
survivor from England's long forgotten ``pub-rock'' movement of the
mid-1970s whose soulful vocals periodically have appeared on hit
records: ``How Long'' by Ace, Squeeze's ``Tempted,'' Mike and the
Mechanics' ``Silent Running'' and his own Top 10 single, ``Don't
Shed a Tear.''
   In between, the singer admits, have been gray areas, times spent
``between hits'' when Carrack appeared more destined to wind up in
a ``Whatever Happened To'' book rather than Billboard's Hot 100.
   ``I've had some ups and downs, indeed. Some troughs, suffice to
say. But during the troughs I was still hanging in there. I've
never really done anything else apart from this.''
   Set Carrack's career to music and it might sound like this: a
fast start, very fast. Maybe too fast. Soon, the tempo breaks down,
the needle skips over parts of the record and scratches appear. But
just when the song appears over, the pace picks up and steadily
builds.
   That's where he is now, nearly 20 years in the music business
and finally making records with his name on it, his keyboards and
his choice of style.
   ``It's a bit raggedy and I like that. I didn't play a note on
the previous album. Chris (Difford of Squeeze) is the kind of guy
who likes everything in place. You know, precise. I'm not precise.
T-Bone (producer T-Bone Wolk) loves the way I play. it's slightly
dodgy, but that's fine. You know what I'm saying?''
   The 12 songs on ``Groove Approved'' combine rock, pop, soul,
gospel and country. Because Carrack prefers to write with others,
such associates as Wolk, longtime friend and fellow pub-rock
alumnus Nick Lowe and Squeeze member Chris Difford all pitch in.
   ``Love Can Break Your Heart'' was co-written by ex-Doobie
Brother Michael McDonald, whose partnership with Carrack came after
several unsuccessful ``blind dates.''
   ``I was in L.A. and my record company (Chrysalis) was pitching
me songs and pitching me songs and saying, `We think you should get
together with other writers.' I had only written with people like
Nick (Lowe) so they set up a bunch of meetings for me to meet the
old LA tunesmiths.
   ``I'm not knocking these guys, some of them had good
reputations, but it was very, very weird. This one guy, bald as
brass, was sitting by the swimming pool in his hotel, and he's got
a ghetto blaster. He puts on the old backing track and gives me a
whole performance by the swimming pool.''
   To Carrack's astonishment, and the record company's (Anchor) as
well, the first single, ``How Long,'' was a worldwide smash. An
American tour was inevitable _ and disastrous. Gold was already
fading to gray.
   ``We did all the wrong things,'' he said. ``We came over and
opened for Yes on a tour of enormous arenas for three months. That
was very much the wrong thing to do. We were a very low-key band.
We should have done some clubs.
   ``We had three years of a gradual winding down and demise and
went back to England. But the scene had changed drastically. We got
back for the punk era and we didn't fit in at all. So that was very
weird. The songs I was writing were just out of time.''
   He waited it out, playing in local bands and making valuable
friends _ like Lowe and Difford. By the early '80s, punk had burned
out and pop and soul were welcome again.
   The hits with Squeeze and Mike and the Mechanics gave Carrack
enough commercial power to build up his solo career, starting two
years ago with ``One Good Reason,'' and now ``Groove Approved.''
   ``To most people I'm a new artist. For myself as a musician, I
still feel I'm only just scraping the tip of the iceberg in a lot
of ways. Maybe I'm just a slow learner.
   ``I'm 38. I've been drifting around, doing this and that.
Thirty-eight, when most people are finished in this game and I'm
only getting to make what feels like my first bloody record. It's
weird, eh?''

   When the punk rock band ``Old Skull'' began
performing at local clubs, J.P. Toulon's hands were only big enough
to play three chords on the guitar, and the group got paid with
McDonald's happy meals.
   Today, the three prepubescent punksters have a music video on
MTV for their debut LP, ``Get Outta School,'' and practice in
J.P.'s basement on high-tech equipment donated by sponsors. They
even were paid $1,000 for a 30-minute performance in New York.
   ``Old Skull'' _ guitarist J.P. Toulon, 10; his brother, bass
player Jamie, 9, and drummer Jesse Collins-Davies, 10 _ has been
together for three years. The trio is managed by J.P.'s father,
Vern. ``Get Outta School,'' which was recorded more than a year ago
and released last spring, has sold about 30,000 copies.
   ``People will buy your first album because you're young and new
and they think, `Oh, how cute,''' said Jesse, a fifth-grader. ``But
now they want to hear real music and that's what we're trying to
do. Our last record _ we just played anything.''
   On the first album, the band sings, and screams, about such
issues as the homeless and AIDS. In ``Homeless,'' J.P. howls into
the microphone amid screeching guitars and bashing drums.
   ``I hate you Ronald Reagan!'' he shouts at the end, with a look
in his eye that tells you he means it.
   ``Reagan's out, dude,'' Robin Davies, Jesse's father, said at a
recent after-school practice.
   ``I know,'' J.P. responded. ``I still hate him.''
   The band performs fun, silly songs, too.
   ``Hotdog Hell'' gives the audience more than just music for slam
dancing, a popular form of dancing for punk rock enthusiasts.
   ``It's usually our last song,'' said Jamie, a fourth-grader.
``We throw hot dogs into the crowd. It's funny. Then they throw
them back at us and we fight back _ we throw them back again.''
   But the band has gained more popularity on the East and West
coasts than at home in Madison, Davies said. ``On the coasts they
tend to get caught up in the media like L.A. and New York. In
Madison, they don't get caught up in it, which is good, actually,
for the kids. In Madison they're more grounded.''
   The band has received more than 400 fan letters from around the
world, including one from a boy in Greece.
   Both fathers, who also are musicians, insist their children are
treated just like other students at school and have not been
changed by their success.
   ``I know it's crazy, but things are absolutely the same,''
Toulon said. ``If anything, they're sick of it (media attention).
There's been no grown heads.''
   Amid school, soccer, karate and skateboarding, the boys practice
weekly and travel about one weekend a month to Minneapolis,
Milwaukee, Chicago and other nearby cities. They usually play in
bars or nightclubs. The band will make its first international
appearance when the boys, along with their parents, go to Japan to
appear on an audience-participation television show Dec. 8.
   Despite some criticism for allowing their children to play in a
punk band, the fathers said they believe ``Old Skull'' is a
positive aspect in their sons' lives.
   ``It's really opened a lot of doors for J.P.,'' Toulon said.
Although he's never acted before, J.P. has auditioned for the lead
role in ``Motorama,'' an action film from the producers of
``Platoon.''
   J.P. and Jesse also write most of the band's songs.
   ``We write about what we see and feel,'' Jesse said. ``We write
about what we think is important.''
   ``We're trying to be more serious than we are,'' said J.P., a
fifth-grader. ``But it's hard, because we're only kids.''
   What timely topics can we expect ``Old Skull'' to be shrieking
criticism at on the next album?
   ``I wrote a song about the stealth bomber,'' Jesse said. ``It's
called Money Waste.''

<HEAD>When `Bad' News Is Welcome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strange ways of Wall Street were put on
exhibit again last week when a spate of reports from government and
the private sector showed the economy was continuing to weaken.
   Prices rose.
   Or, perhaps it was the strange ways of the Federal Reserve that
were on display because, it can be argued, the Fed also reacted
somewhat strangely to the developing ``bad'' news.
   That news was relentless. Consumer spending, two-thirds of the
gross national product, fell. Automobile sales dropped. Housing
starts were off from a year earlier, helping to bring down spending
on furniture and appliances, too.
   The index of leading economic indicators fell 0.4 percent in
October. The November report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management also suggested contraction in manufacturing.
Initial jobless claims rose.
   News of that sort, piling up as it does, indicates impending
recession. Most recessions are accompanied by strains on corporate
profits, and profit, in in the final analysis, is the basis of
stock prices.
   But the stock market rose on the news.
   There was, however, no mystery to why it rose _ it rose because
the big professional portfolio managers convinced themselves that
all the negative news would force the Federal Reserve to let
interest rates drop.
   Even though the Fed sent a strong signal to the contrary by
propping up the federal funds rate _ the overnight rate for loans
between banks _ it wasn't believed. Eventually, it was reasoned,
the Fed had to let up on restraint.
   Consider some of the other evidence:
   Domestic auto sales since the end of the third quarter were 15
percent below the pace for the first nine months of 1989. Plants
have been shut down and workers have been laid off.
   The growth of U.S. exports has slowed. New orders for durable
goods fell 0.6 percent in October, the fourth decline in six
months. Production of goods such as food, clothing and paper are
off from a year ago.
   The weight of evidence, the market said, demanded action by the
Fed. But so far as can be determined from published statements, Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, hasn't changed his mind about inflation
being his primary concern.
   The market doesn't believe him.
   Early last week, word spread through the big investment centers
that the Fed would force down short-term rates in an effort to slow
or reverse the slump in manufacturing. In fact, the Fed did inject
reserves into the banking system.
   One day later it indicated differently, when it jacked up the
federal funds rate.
   The Fed still has reasons to be concerned. The jobless rate is
low by recent standards and that could force wages higher. And the
0.5 percent rise in the October consumer price index annualizes to
more than 6 percent.
   In the securities markets, however, they discount such data,
contending that the jobless rate will rise and the price index will
soon fall if the Fed doesn't give the economy a lift. Nothing does
it, they say, like lower rates.
   In effect, the market seemed to say, this is as bad as it gets.
But has the market properly assessed the Fed chairman, who is
determined to end inflation, once and for all?

<HEAD>Cookbook Author Has Recipe for Happiness</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a little valley known as Griffin Creek,
Jane Watson Hopping is writing old-time cookbooks that have as much
to say about what has brought her happiness as how to make Uncle
Bud's old-fashioned vinegar pie.
   She and and her husband, Ray, have run what they call a ``sea preserving
a
way of life with which most people seem to be out of touch.
   With a son and daughter grown and much of the farm sold off for
houses, Hopping began a project of writing down for her children
the old family recipes she had learned in her own mother's kitchen
and carried in her head: such things as Denver biscuits, golden egg
bread and Aunt Ida Louise's chocolatey wacky cake with dusted
powdered sugar lace.
   But the recipes didn't get published until Hopping mixed in some
memories of growing up on a farm during the Depression and seasoned
them with poems and pictures gleaned from forgotten
turn-of-the-century books.
   ``The Pioneer Lady's Country Kitchen,'' published last year by
Villard Books, earned warm praise from reviewers. Hopping has come
back this year with ``The Pioneer Lady's Country Christmas'' and is
working on a third book for next year, to be called ``Country
Mothers.''
   She became known as the ``pioneer lady'' in the local schools,
where she taught children how to make deer-fat candles, churn
butter, tan hides and barter three different ways.
   More than anything else, her books are about memories: kitchen
memories, barnyard memories, family memories.
   ``I would tell the children, `Every day of your life you are in
the memory business _ good memories and bad,''' she said. ``You
look on your life and you find that I have lived such a happy and
successful life, and that's because you created every day good
memories. If you created only bad memories, when you look back, you
don't have anything to feel good about.''
   The inspiration for the books came from an old primer from a
school in Eagle Point. The primer contained an etching of a young
girl standing in a barnyard that reminded Hopping of her own
childhood.
   ``I think it released me, in a sense, to tell about my family,
myself,'' she said. ``Maybe prior to that I was trying to do some
kind of writing, but you know, not revealing myself.''
   Also in the primer were poems by James Whitcomb Riley, the
Hoosier poet of Indiana, including ``The Frost Is on the Pumpkin.''
   ``I thought, `Oh, that's what I need for my cookbook to make a
setting like in a ring,''' she said. ``As it turned out, the
setting was equally important to the recipes.''
   At book signings, Hopping hears more about how people enjoyed
her memories than about how they enjoyed the food.
   ``I've had my first fan letter,'' she said. ``A young woman in
California said, `I love your book and I bought one for my sister.'
She said: `We're going to change our life a little bit. We're going
to make pomander balls and have more family picnics.'
   ``She's finding something in there that she thinks would make
their life richer. That's wonderful, for a cookbook.''
   Besides Christmas goodies, ``The Pioneer Lady's Country
Christmas'' is filled with the stories that come out during family
gatherings: how Grandmother nursed neighbors in southwestern
Missouri during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1908, and was
thanked just before Christmas with an anonymous gift of a crate
filled with toys and clothes; how Uncle Will would tie himself to
the barn in a blizzard so he wouldn't get lost while tending to the
animals.
   ``Christmas means family to me,'' said Hopping. ``When I was
growing up, we had an extended family. Then you didn't move around
so much. You had your friends sometimes for 30 or 40 years.
   ``When I look back at Christmas, what I enjoy the most is not
the food. I enjoy fixing the food and all that. That's part of life
for Christmas. But I enjoy the coming together of the family.''
   Though she was born in Kansas in 1929, when her father was
working on a gas pipeline, Hopping proudly traces her roots to
pioneer stock in Missouri.
   During the Depression, the family had spread out looking for
work, leaving her grandfather alone in Missouri.
   ``None of the family could stand this, because this was a very
clannish family,'' she said.
   So they all decided to move to California, where Hopping's
father eventually became foreman at a limestone quarry in the gold
country town of Auburn.
   She grew up knowing the joys of sharing, even in times when
there wasn't much to share. ``In the old days, it was what you were
going to do for your friends,'' she said. ``People would say: `I am
going to sit here and knit collars until everybody in the family
has a lace collar. I'm going to go out in the barn every night
after I worked hard in the fields and I am going to make doll
cradles.'''
   She married Ray Hopping, who gave up his job on the railroad
back in California, and in 1958 they moved to the farm in Griffin
Creek, where they keep the old ways.
   ``In Griffin Creek, we still trade about ourselves,'' she said.
``It's not uncommon to find some apples sitting on your shelf. The
neighbors share back and forth with the work.
   ``I guess that one reason I continue to write about the old days
is because I really kind of live in a time that's not changed that
much.''

<TEXT>
   Munir Bashir is known as the ``emir of the
oud.''
   He uses the pear-shaped stringed instrument to promote Arabic
music around the world, and to bridge a culture gap. But he
believes that one of his biggest tasks in life is to instill a love
of Arabic music among youngsters who have been seduced by Western
rock and disco music and preserve a rich artistic heritage.
   ``It's a shame,'' he said in an interview. ``We have such great
music, but the younger generations never heed it.''
   Bashir, a native of Mosul in northern Iraq, said that for Arabs
to neglect their traditional music is to ignore an important aspect
of their cultural identity.
   ``Music is part of the cultural identity of any people. It's not
something you can borrow from others,'' he said. ``Music is not
just entertainment. It's a source of spiritual and moral
uplifting.''
   Bashir, 59, believes Arabic music is now in a state of crisis,
which he attributes to ``cultural backwardness.''
   As director of musical affairs at the Culture Ministry in
Baghdad, he has devoted 16 years to promoting Arabic music as part
of Iraq's educational system and culture.
   Bashire established a ballet and music school for children to
study and learn to play instruments and the Iraqi Institute of
Melody Studies for teen-agers.
   Three years ago, he formed the al-Bayariq ensemble, a 28-member
youth group, to develop young people's interest in authentic Arabic
music and to help preserve centuries-old songs that have begun to
disappear because of the ``ugly thrust'' of modern music. It is led
by his youngest son, Omer, 20.
   ``It's not just a source of pride, but an investment in our
cultural future,'' Bashir said. ``If we don't encourage young
people to play these instruments, our traditional music will die
and these instruments will only be found in museums.''
   Al-Bayariq brings together the oud, qanun, santur and joza, all
stringed instrumemnts, as well as the tablah, a small drum, and the
riqq, a frame drum with jingles akin to a tambourine.
   The oud is a six-stringed instrument, shaped like a lute. Bashir
believes the oud originated in Iraq. The instrument has been seen
on stone carvings dating back 2,000 years. From Arabia, the oud
made its way to Europe, possibly in the Moorish conquest of Spain,
and from it evolved the lute.
   The qanun is a zither-like instrument. The violin-like joza has
only one string that gives a strong, high pitch. It is played
resting on the leg rather than nestling under the chin. The santure
is something like a qanun, but its strings are played with sticks
rather than a bow.
   The instruments used by the ensemble are specially made for the
group by elderly craftsmen in a workshop set up by Bashir.
   The ensemble has performed in several foreign countries,
including France, and all over the Arab world. In Paris, the
youngsters performed at the Arab World Institute to standing
ovations.
   ``Now we've built a solid base, I hope these kids will stick to
their instruments, pioneering the way for others to follow,''
Bashir said.
   Arabic music has largely been ignored in the West because of its
complex melodies and ornamental flourishes that make it difficult
to grasp. But artists such as Bashir are increasingly bridging the
cultural gap.
   Critics hail him as a creative and supreme master of his
instrument, whose music springs from the authentic tradition of
Arabian music. Foreign critics say Bashir is notable for being able
to project the emotions of Arabic music, often lost to the
occidential ear, to non-Arabs.
   ``He stretches the understanding of music to the limit,'' one
European critic wrote. ``To listen to him takes as much
intellectual energy and attention as listening to the discourse of
a sage.''
   His playing is rooted in classical Arab forms but is largely
improvisational. Some critics have found it resembles progressive
jazz in many ways.
   Bashir has elevated the oud to solo instrument status after
centuries of having been used to accompany Arab singers. For one
thing, he added six more strings, pairing them with the others, to
produce a fuller sound and melodic flexibility.
   He discovered his gift for music when he was 6 years old while
listening to his mother singing lullabies to his younger brothers.
She also played several traditional instruments.
   ``She was my first idol. She breathed the love of music into
me,'' he said.
   His father made ouds and Bashir's brother also plays the
instrument.
   In his ministry office, crowded with musical instruments,
records and tapes, he spends two to three hours a day playing. No
one is allowed to interrupt him.
   ``All telephone calls and appointments have to be put off when
al-istath (the master) is playing, until he finishes his solo
performance in his office,'' said his secretary, Nizar Jawad, who
is also a lyricist and musician.

   Salomon Brothers Inc. filed a $150
million countersuit against West Virginia in federal court as the
state settled for $2 million a claim with a second investment
banker group.
   The separate legal actions involve in over the loss of $279
million in the state's consolidated investment fund in 1987-89,
when the fund's assets were traded on Wall Street.
   The state sued Salomon, County NatWest Government Securities
Inc. and three other firms in October, blaming them for the massive
losses suffered by the fund.
   Salomon Brothers, in a countersuit filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Charleston, said West Virginia wants the
brokerage house to pay for the losses, while giving the state the
profits, which it estimates at $150 million.
   It said in the suit that the state, however, cannot it have both
ways.
   ``This `heads we win, tails you lose' approach to the parties'
long-settled transactions is unconscionable, inequitable and
unjust,'' the suit contended.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins said Salomon's suit is just one
of many countersuits against the state.
   ``All four of those defendants have filed lawsuits against the
state of West Virginia and the Board of Investments... . We're
talking millions and millions of dollars.'' Tompkins said.
   The Board of Investments, which oversees the fund, cleared one
of the defendants from further litigation Thursday.
   It voted to accept a $2 million settlement offer from County
NatWest.
   Tompkins said the settlement is significant because by settling,
County NatWest agreed that it was responsible in part for the
damages.
   ``They were willing to confess they had a problem and pay some
money to get out of this lawsuit,'' Tompkins said.

   Thrill rides through a
laser-filled ``Ghostbusters'' scene and into outer space aboard a
bicycle with ``E.T.: The Extraterrestrial'' are part of a planned
$3 billion MCA Inc. theme park near London.
   The park, described in a planning application submitted to
British authorities Monday, is similar to another MCA amusement
park complex recently proposed for a site outside Paris.
   MCA will develop only one of the European sites. Officials hope
to open the new park in 1994.
   The entertainment company that operates the famed Universal
Studios tour here plans to spend $1 billion to build the park and a
studio, with additional development later to expand and erect a
hotel.
   MCA also is developing studio theme parks in Florida and Japan.
   ``We will choose which of the two to develop in March or April
of next year,'' Anthony Young, president of the MCA Enterprises
International unit, said Thursday in a telephone call from London.
   The MCA proposal adds pressure to negotiations surrounding the
French site and opens a new front in global theme park wars.
   Media conglomerates led by the Disney Co. want to cash in on
worldwide demand for U.S. entertainment at a time when more people
enjoy prosperity and greater leisure time.
   Disney is developing parks in France and Japan and is doubling
the size of its new Disney-MGM Studio Tour in Florida because it is
so popular.
   Kirk Kerkorian, through his MGM Grand Inc., hopes to open a $700
million studio theme park-hotel in Las Vegas in 1992.
   And Warner Bros. has expressed interest in building an
Australian park featuring its cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny
and the Road Runner.

   The stock market opened higher today amid
optimism over the prospects for lower interest rates and ahead of
this weekend's U.S.-Soviet summit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 8.96 points to
2,715.23 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 629 issues up, 333 down and 496
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 26.79 million
shares.
   Analysts said the market was feeling optimistic about this
weekend's summit between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in Malta.
   ``Usually markets do well prior to summits,'' said Larry
Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``I don't
know what the market expects. But there's always a gamble that
something good will come out of it.''
   Investors also felt good about the prospects for lower interest
rates as new economic indictors suggest a slowdown in
fourth-quarter economic growth, observers said.
   The government reported today that its chief economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, fell
0.4 percent in October, the sixth month of declines or no gain this
year.
   Though the October drop was in line with most economists'
expectation, it confirmed other data pointing to sluggish growth.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.73 to 192.03.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
0.55 to 374.39.

<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, which is being acquired by Ford Motor
Co. in a friendly $2.5 billion deal, said Friday its shareholders
have approved lifting a restriction limiting holdings in the
British luxury auto maker to just 15 percent.
   The shareholders approved waiving the restriction by more than
99 percent. The measure required approval of at least 75 percent.
   The approval was widely expected and clears the way for Ford to
buy more Jaguar shares and gain control of its target.
   Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade said from the No. 2 U.S.
automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., that the company was
pleased with the vote.
   He said Ford planned to acquire more than 50 percent of Jaguar
stock by Dec. 8, one week after the shareholders' decision.
Considering the strength of Friday's vote, it appeared likely that
Ford, which currently owns about 13 percent of Jaguar, would reach
that goal.
   In response to the news, Jaguar rose 1.57 cents to $13.13 a
share on London's Stock Exchange. Ford has offered $13.35 a share
for Jaguar.
   At a special shareholders meeting, Jaguar Chairman John Egan
reiterated his belief that the British company has a good future
ahead as a ``strong, autonomous company.''
   Under terms of the agreement with Ford, Jaguar will have a
separate legal identity, its own board of directors, and will
retain its separate dealership network.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley announced on Thursday that the
takeover would not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
   Ford announced the friendly bid on Nov. 2, a day after Ridley
waived the government's ``golden share.''
   The golden share, established when the government privatized the
formerly state-owned Jaguar in 1984, gives the government veto
power over any takeover and was originally designed to protect
Jaguar from being acquired until the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain On Follow-Through, Summit Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting follow-through buying from the previous session and
hopes for expanded trade with the Soviet Union.
   Many players expect this weekend's superpower summit to lead to
more sales of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union, which already is a
major buyer of U.S. corn and soybean meal.
   ``The nervousness and apprehension ahead of that meeting will
keep the bears at bay,'' said Richard Feltes, research director
with Refco Inc., a Chicago-based futures brokerage.
   The soybean market received additional support from news that
the Agriculture Department will donate $20 million worth of soybean
meal to Poland.
   Forecasts for continued dry weather in winter wheat growing
areas of the Great Plains helped to boost wheat prices.
   Gains were limited by the USDA's weekly grain-exports report,
which showed exports of soybeans and soybean meal lagging well
behind last year's pace.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.09} a bushel; corn
was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.37{ a
bushel; oats were { cent to } cent higher with December at $1.43{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with January at
$5.83 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The pork belly market appeared to be
steadying after a three-day collapse linked to lower-than-expected
belly exports.
   Live cattle futures were .02 cent to .20 cent higher with
December at 75.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20
cent higher with January at 82.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .28
cent lower to .13 cent higher with December at 50.57 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .55 cent lower to .80 cent higher with
February at 58 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower Thursday, hogs were higher and pork
bellies were sharply lower.

<HEAD>Guber, Peters Pick Attorney as Chief Operating Officer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie producers Peter Guber and Jon
Peters, the new co-chairmen of Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc., have chosen their longtime lawyer to oversee nearly all
Columbia's operations.
   The attorney, Alan J. Levine, has represented the ``Batman'' and
``Rain Man'' producers for the last decade. Levine has been a
partner in the Armstrong, Hirsch &amp; Levine firm since 1980, handling
major clients in the motion picture and television business.
   Levine's move to Columbia had been widely expected. Sony Corp.
purchased the studio in September for $3.4 billion, then bought
Guber and Peters out of their Warner Bros. production contract in a
settlement that some analysts have valued at up to $500 million.
   Levine will become president and chief operating officer of the
newly formed filmed entertainment group, which includes Columbia
Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, Triumph Releasing, Columbia Pictures
Television, RCA-Columbia Home Video, Merv Griffin Enterprises, and
their various offshoots.
   ``The only thing left out is Loew's,'' the theater chain owned
by Columbia, said Columbia spokesman Ed Russell.
   The naming of Levine underlined the precarious status of
Columbia Pictures president Dawn Steel, brought in to replace David
Puttnam at the helm of the Columbia studio two years ago.
   Steel's departure from Columbia is expected soon, according to
two knowledgeable sources at the studio who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   She no longer is making important decisions; an example was
Columbia's purchase of the script ``Radio Flyer'' for more than $1
million Wednesday in a bidding war with Warner, which was handled
by Peters without her help.
   Steel, who has been offered an independent production contract
at Disney, did not return a call Thursday inquiring about her plans.
   Levine's compensation package was not revealed, but it is
expected to be extremely rich. Among other things, Sony's contract
with Guber and Peters allows them to divide up a $50 million lump
sum payment in five years between themselves and the three top
executives they hire.
   Guber and Peters also have been guaranteed salaries of $14
million over the next five years, a percentage of studio profits
that increases substantially if the profits are big and a stake in
the company's appreciation.
   As part of the deal sending Guber and Peters to Columbia, Warner
Bros. was given Columbia's one-third interest in The Burbank
Studios in exchange for the old MGM lot in Culver City.
   The move to Culver City will involve real estate deals that
Levine will not oversee, and Russell said he would not be involved
in any future deals Columbia undertakes in that area _ a hotel
purchase, for example.
   Levine, 42, of Beverly Hills, graduated from Hollywood High
School in 1964 and received his bachelor's and law degrees from the
University of Southern California.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives of the aggressive
superregional bank NCNB Texas said their plans for the coming years
include making billions of dollars worth of new loans and opening
hundreds of new branches.
   Executives quoted in Friday editions of the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram said the bank plans to open 250 new branches
throughout Texas by 1994, which will more than double the 219
branches the bank currently operates.
   ``We are part of a company that gained its reputation by being a
very aggressive leader in the Southeast,'' said Timothy Hartman,
chairman of NCNB Corp., parent company of the Dallas bank.
   ``We have raised $1.9 billion in new capital since September
1988, with $1.7 billion of that invested in NCNB Texas. That money
will provide the support to grow deposits and make new loans.''
   The bank is committed to making about $1.1 billion in mortgage
loans to about 13,000 Texans in 1990, Hartman said.
   NCNB has been criticized for cutting off credit to many longtime
customers of First RepublicBank Corp. NCNB Texas now owns and
operates First Republic's banks.
   The bank also has been criticized for not making new loans in
Texas.
   ``We think this concept that NCNB is not addressing the credit
side of the market is incorrect,'' said Jeffrey Wentworth, chairman
of the bank's West Texas region.
   ``To be able to show the market that we are in the marketplace,
we need to continue to demonstrate our commitment to making new
loans,'' he added.
   NCNB Texas President Kenneth Lewis said NCNB Texas approved
$1.59 billion in loans during the first nine months of the year,
with most of that increase coming from new commercial loans.
   The company also transferred $930 million in bad loans to its
special asset pool.
   Hartman predicted that NCNB Texas will earn just over $300
million for 1989, with net income of between $290 million and $300
million for 1990.
   The company reported net income of $244.3 million during the
first nine months of this year.

<TEXT>
   Plans to build the nation's largest hog
farm and the waste it may produce are causing a stink between the
billionaire Bass family and two other major financial powers.
   The Bass family of Texas is building the $50 million hog complex
near the South Platte River. The farm is expected to raise 300,000
hogs a year by 1992. And, unlike most hog operations, the owners do
not intend to inject the animals with antibiotics or other drugs.
   Philip Anschutz, owner of the Southern Pacific Transportation
Co., and Peter Coors of the brewing family, who own nearby ranches,
are suing Bass's National Hog Farms to stop the construction,
fearing that waste from the animals will pollute the river.
   They've financed community campaigns against the farm, although
neither will discuss the fight, the New York Times reported.
   Other opposition groups complain that such a large operation
would undercut competition and lower the quality of animals
produced.
   National Hog Farms, a subsidiary of a Kansas City, Mo.,
livestock company, insists that there is no evidence to support
such concerns.
   William O'Hare, manager of the Colorado hog farm, said its
isolation will allow the raising of hogs without drugs, bucking a
common Midwest practice.
   ``This is a brand-new, modern facility that could set new trends
in the industry,'' O'Hare said. ``We fully intend not to use drugs
in these animals if we don't have to.''
   Nonetheless, opponents are suspicious, saying National Hog Farms
has had problems the past 10 years controlling livestock waste in
Holt County, Neb., where three operations produce as many animals
as will the new Colorado farm.
   Nebraska residents have complained about the number of animals
that have died and the manner used to dispose of the carcasses.
Similar concerns have been raised in Colorado.

<HEAD>Population Trends of '90s Should Spur Savings and Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To many optimists on the investment
outlook for the 1990s, the magic word is ``demographics.''
   Whatever the short-term ups and downs of the economy over the
next 10 years, they believe shifting trends in the shape and makeup
of the U.S. population will spur savings and investment.
   That theme was sounded over and over again last week as Wall
Street leaders attending the annual convention of the Securities
Industry Association assessed the outlook for their troubled
business.
   ``The demographics are going with us for the first time in 10 to
15 years,'' declared Robert Goodman, senior economist at the firm
of Putnam Financial Services Inc.
   About 20 years ago, the economy began facing the challenge of
absorbing into the workforce the huge generation, both men and
women, that was born after World War II.
   Once millions of those people found jobs and careers, they
acquired the image _ whether entirely accurate or not _ of big
spenders unconcerned about the long term.
   Though perhaps not for that reason alone, the nation's savings
rate dragged along at what many analysts described as dangerously
low levels.
   In the '90s, however, many baby boomers will be moving into
their 40s and 50s _ traditionally the time of life when people
reach their peak earning power and want to start putting money away
in earnest for their later years.
   Whether this generation wants to do that or not, many observers
say, it is going to feel an increasing sense that it needs to do
so. No outside source, government or private, is likely to have the
means to cover more than a fraction of their retirement needs,
analysts say.
   ``No generation has ever faced this kind of financial
liability,'' said John Steffens, president of Merrill Lynch
Consumer Markets, an arm of the big investment firm.
   ``The requirement for savings, I think, is more compelling than
ever before.''
   In the understandable reasoning of Wall Street's marketing
planners, a greater impulse to save means greater demand for
stocks, mutual funds, tax-sheltered retirement programs,
certificates of deposit _ in short, just about every product and
service the financial-services industry has to sell. Even advice.
   ``People today require more and better advice on financial
matters,'' Steffens said.
   A corollary to this baby-boom theory focuses on the ``baby
bust'' that followed, when birth rates fell sharply in the '60s and
early '70s.
   Barring a huge influx of immigrants, that is expected to mean a
dramatic slowing during the '90s of the growth in the labor force.
   Though that might not be good news for all industries, many
analysts believe it too will be a stimulus to savings and
investment, by increasing demand for labor-saving business
equipment.
   ``Fewer young people will lead to labor shortages and large
capital spending on automation,'' said John Gutfreund, chairman and
chief executive of Salomon Brothers Inc.
   As any experienced demographer readily attests, predicting the
future based on population projections alone is a chancy endeavor.
   Now, in particular, crystal balls of this type are clouded by
the international forces that influence the domestic economy.
   Besides, despite all their clout, it is a lot to expect of the
baby boomers to assure by themselves the health and well-being of
the financial world.
   Granted, the experts say. But they have it within their power to
make a big difference.

   Marion Laboratories Inc. shareholders
gave final approval Friday to a merger with a Dow Chemical Co.
subsidiary that will create the third-largest pharmaceutical
concern in the nation.
   Ewing Kauffman, who founded Marion Labs in the basement of his
home and is co-owner of the Kansas City Royals baseball team, told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting that he would stay on
as chairman emeritus of the merged company.
   Shareholders approved the issuance of 127 million new Marion
shares to Dow, which will merge Cincinnati-based Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc. with Marion. Dow Chemical will retain a 67
percent stake in Marion.
   The new company, Marion Merrell Dow, will be based in Kansas
City. Annual revenues were estimated at $2.4 billion, and about
10,000 people were expected to be employed worldwide, said Fred W.
Lyons Jr., president and chief executive officer of Marion.
   Lyons noted that mid-sized companies were having trouble
competing in the drug industry. He added that the merger will help
Marion ``go into the 90s with a much stronger competititve position
than we went into the 80s.''
   Michael Herman, Marion's chief financial officer, told
stockholders to expect costs in the current quarter related to the
merger.
   Marion and Dow of Midland, Mich., announced merger plans July 17.
   Under the complicated agreement, Marion first sold 39 percent of
its 150 million outstanding shares to Dow at an estimated cost of
$2.2 billion.
   Dow will acquire the newly issued Marion shares by turning
Merrell Dow over to Marion and issuing a new class of securities
that provide for Dow to pay to Marion shareholders at the time
they're cashed in.
   Marion's leading drugs are Cardizem, used to treat angina and
high blood pressure, and the ulcer drug Carafate.
   Merrell Dow's main products are the antihistamine Seldane, an
anti-cholesterol drug Lorelco, the anti-smoking gum Nicorette and
Cepacol mouthwash.

   The stock market staged a sharp broad-based
rally in brisk afternoon trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 47.57 points to
2,753.84 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was 30.50 points
higher at noon.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 2 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 967 issues up, 488 down and 473
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.40 million
shares.
   Analysts said the sharp rally took many observers off guard.
   ``I'm as shocked as anybody,'' said Brad Weeks, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``I think people are
sitting out there with a lot of cash and have chosen this time to
put their money to work.''
   ``The upside is not a surprise, but 50 points certainly is,''
said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko Securities
International.
   Analysts said computerized program strategies was helping fuel
the rally.
   ``I wouldn't say it's leading the rally but it's a definite
factor,'' Walsh said.
   A combination of positive sentiment also boosted prices,
including this weekend's summit between President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Malta.
   The market also got help from economic reports that pointed to a
sluggish fourth-quarter economy, reflecting expectations that the
Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates to stimulate
growth.
   The government reported today that its chief economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, fell
0.4 percent in October, the sixth month of declines or no gain this
year.
   That report was followed by the Purchasing Management
Association's November report showing an unexpected decline in the
group's index to 46.6 percent from 47.6 percent in October. A
reading below 50 percent indicates a contraction in the nation's
manufacturing sector.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.68 to 193.98.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index advanced
1.84 to 375.68.

   British Aerospace PLC and Thomson-CSF, a French
defense contractor, said Friday they were no longer interested in
mounting a joint bid for the British electronics concern Ferranti
International Signal PLC.
   However, Thomson said it would continue to consider its options
regarding making an offer for Ferranti.
   Ferranti's shares fell the equivalent 14 cents Friday to close
at 63 cents on London's Stock Exchange.
   Ferranti has been hit in recent months by the revelation of
fraud connected with International Signal and Control Ltd., a U.S.
defense contractor Ferranti acquired in 1987.
   British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF announced Oct. 10 they were
considering making a joint offer for Ferranti.
   On Friday, British Aerospace said in a statement that ``in
reviewing the information so far made available on the Ferranti
business'' it had decided to withdraw its earlier interest.
   British Aerospace cited Ferranti's recent publication of revised
financial results for the year ending March 31 and British
Aerospace's judgment of its own ``strategic interests.''
   Ferranti revised downward its pre-tax profit for that fiscal
year to $20.6 million from $87.6 million originally reported.
   Ferranti also said it is dipping into capital and reserves in
the amount of $276.3 million after finding fraudulent contracts at
its American subsidiary.
   Earlier Friday, Ferranti announced the sale of $294 million
worth of shares to existing shareholders. The company said it would
hold a special shareholders meeting to vote on the share sale in
February.
   The share sale, which is fully underwritten by investment firms,
``greatly strengthens our financial position,'' said Ferranti
Chairman Derek Alun-Jones.
   On Thursday, Ferranti filed a lawsuit against four former
executives of its U.S. operation and five Panamanian companies
seeking the return of $198.5 million that it said was fraudulently
siphoned off.
   A writ issued in the High Court said the money was part of
$443.6 million paid out by Ferranti's British firms ISC
Technologies Ltd. and ISC London PLC from February 1984 to July
1989 for three allegedly fictitious arms contracts with companies
in Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and China.

<HEAD>Merchant Shipping Industry Alarmed By Bush's Move</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The merchant shipping industry said Friday that
President Bush's decision to bar Panamanian-flag vessels from U.S.
ports could make shipowners pawns in diplomatic disputes.
   The move might interrupt free trade and prove costly and
disruptive to shipowners, industry insiders say.
   Bush's ban, announced Thursday, goes into effect Jan. 31 and is
one of various U.S. economic sanctions already in place against
Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The principle of the thing is worrying,'' said Chris Horrocks,
secretary-general of the London-based International Chamber of
Shipping on Friday. ``Once merchant shipping starts becoming a pawn
in the political game, where will it lead?''
   A shipping executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said,
``Obviously you could get a situation where other countries come
out in a supportive way.''
   Shipowners already are scurrying to change flags because Bush's
move will have a significant impact on their trading abilities, he
said.
   Other countries could press their own grievances with their own
bans, Horrocks said.
   ``Another country might now say they will not accept a
particular flag, then yet another country might object to another
flag,'' he said.
   A country could, for example, decide to ban Liberian-registered
ships because Liberia trades with the United States, he said.
   The International Chamber of Shipping is the industry's
international trade association and is made up of national
shipowners' associations.
   Turkey has banned Cyrpiot-registered ships for about two years,
and countries at war ban typically each other's ships, Horrocks
said.
   ``This is more stark in this case because it involves the
world's major trading nation,'' Horrocks said.
   Bush's move is also unfair, he said, because ships that fly
Panama's flag but don't trade with the Central American country
will be hurt.
   ``We've never been happy with the principle that you use
merchant shipping as a political weapon,'' he said.
   In addition to switching flags, shipowners can reroute tankers.
Both options are time-consuming, inconvenient and costly, Horrocks
said.
   But more importantly, a spread of such bans could interfere with
the movement of goods. ``We've always stood for the principle of
liberalized trade,'' Horrocks said.
   Bush's ban would affect some 1,500 merchant ships of more than
1,000 gross tons that call each year in U.S. ports, according to
State Department estimates.
   Shipowners register under ``flags of convenience'' of Panama,
Liberia and Cyprus to take advantage of cheaper taxes and fees and
looser safety rules and labor laws.
   As of July 1986, more ships above 1,000 gross tons capacity flew
Panama's flag than any other flag for a total of 3,620 ships.
   The Soviet Union was in second place with 2,514 ships, and
Liberia was third with 1,852 vessels. Just 737 ships flew the
American flag.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late, technically
inspired drop.
   Wheat futures finished mixed, supported by rumors that the
Soviet Union had bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices. The Soviets have about 800,000 tons of wheat
left to buy under an allocation granted under the Agriculture
Deparment's Export Enhancement Program.
   Talk of increased Soviet purchases of U.S. grain has dominated
trading ahead of this weekend's meeting between President Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Thursday's weekly USDA export figures showed soybean and soybean
meal shipments running behind last year's pace. But analysts said
that news had been in the market all day and was probably not to
blame for the late dive in soybeans and corn.
   ``Fundamentally, nothing has changed very much to warrant such a
big selloff,'' said Janice Kincheloe, a soybean market analyst in
Chicago with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.08{ a bushel; corn
was } cent to 3} cents lower with December at $2.34{ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $1.43} a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents to 6} cents lower with January at $5.76 a
bushel.

<TEXT>
   Dairy Mart Convenient Stores Inc. has
signed an agreement to buy 141 Stop-N-Go convenience stores in the
Midwest from Sun Co. Inc.
   The purchases, announced Thursday and to be completed in March,
would boost the Dairy Mart 1,200-store chain by more than 10
percent and would include stores in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and
Kentucky, said Charles Nirenberg, Dairy Mart's chairman.
   The price was not disclosed.
   The purchase will be Dairy Mart's third major acquisition in the
past four years, making it the nation's No. 3 convenience store
chain, after 7-Eleven and Circle K, Nirenberg said.
   Sun, the diversified oil company based in Radnor, Pa., recently
announced plans to sell 200 of the 250 stores operated by its
Stop-N-Go subsidiary, which has been hurt by a slump in the
convenience store industry.
   Of the 141 Stop-N-Go stores being purchased by Dairy Mart, 54
have gasoline pumps, Nirenberg said.
   Dairy Mart, founded by Nirenberg in 1958, took over the
700-store Lawson chain in 1985 and the 300-store Convenient Food
Mart chain in 1986.
   Dairy Mart last month abandoned a plan to go private in a
leveraged buyout after its principals had trouble lining up
financing because of the chain's recent sluggish financial
performance.
   Had the company been taken private, Nirenberg said Thursday, the
terms of the financing would have precluded it from acquiring other
stores for at least two years.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge signaled a slowdown in October, but other evidence suggested
lower interest rates will keep the economy from toppling into a
recession.
   The 0.4 percent drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators announced Friday fits in with the
consensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year and
the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best.
   ``The indicators are telling us what they'vebeen telling us for
some time and that is that the economy is continuing to expand, but
at a slow rate,'' said economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association.
   However, he and other analysts said a number of factors
mitigated the unfavorable report. The decline followed two monthly
gains; most of the weakness was concentrated in only two of the
index's 11 forward-looking business statistics.
   And, elements of the index and a separate report on October
construction spending suggest that the Federal Reserve Board's cuts
in interest rates since June are beginning to stimulate the economy.
   Construction activity rose 1 percent in October, bolstered by
the first gain in single-family construction in nine months, the
Commerce Department said.
   Four of the 11 indicators were positive. Building permits
increased 2.8 percent and the nation's money supply, reflecting
lower interest rates, expanded modestly. Other positive signs were
a slight increase in prices of sensitive materials, indicating
increased demand, and an upturn in business capital investment.
   October's overall drop, which was expected by most economists,
followed gains of 0.3 percent in September and 0.6 percent in
August. Both gains were revised in the report to reflect a slightly
better increase than earlier reported.
   For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen five
times, risen four times and remained unchanged in one month.
   The various changes left the index at 144.6 percent of its 1982
base of 100. That represents a 0.4 percent decline at an annual
rate for the year so far, compared with a 3.8 percent gain in the
first 10 months of 1988.
   ``The recent erratic fluctuations in the index are commensurate
with an economy that has slowed substantially but is not headed
over a precipice,'' said economist Gordon Richards of the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   News of the October decline helped spark a stock market rally
that put the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ahead by 41.38
points at closing. Traders took the report as an indication the
Fed, which last nudged interest rates lower in early November,
could move again. Optimism about the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting
also contributed to the rally.
   The two biggest negatives in the index were an increase in
claims for unemployment insurance and a drop in average work week
for factory workers.
   The other weak signs were a drop in unfilled orders at
factories; a decline in a consumer confidence survey; fewer late
deliveries of factory goods, indicating slackening demand, and
fewer new orders for consumer goods.
   Stock prices, despite the Friday-the-13th plunge in October,
were a neutral factor.
   Traditionally, three consecutive monthly declines in the leading
index are a good, but far from foolproof, indication that a
recession is on the way. It has not fallen three times in a row
this year, although it was down in May and June and flat in July.
   Berson said the overall index has probably looked worse than the
condition of the economy would warrant. It overemphasizes
manufacturing, one of the economy's weakest sectors, and
undercounts the service sector, one of the more resilient areas, he
said.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy through a monthly survey of its members, said Friday
the manufacturing economy weakened in November for the seventh
straight month and at a faster pace than in September and October.
   In other economic news, the Office of Thrift Supervision
reported that the nation's savings and loans continue to shrink in
response to tough new financial standards taking effect next week.
Industry assets declined by $15.2 billion in September, breaking
the record of $13.3 billion set in August. Net deposit withdrawals
totaled $8.9 billion, the biggest outflow since February.

<HEAD>Historic Seaplane Service to Keep Flying While Seeking Buyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chalk's International Airlines, the nation's oldest
continuous air passenger service, will keep flying while its owner
seeks a buyer for the seaplane operation.
   Resorts International Inc. announced Thursday it will not close
the 70-year-old business on Dec. 15 as previously planned.
   Resorts, which acquired Chalk's in 1974, last month said
financial losses forced its decision to halt the airline's three
daily flights from Miami to the Bahamian island of Bimini.
   Harold Rivas, an attorney for Chalk's, said Resorts reversed its
decision following a public outcry and a plea from Bahamian
officials seeking to keep the only air service to Bimini.
   No prospective buyer has been named.
   Resorts, which is struggling under mounting debts, operates a
casino and hotel complex on Paradise Island near Nassau. Chalk's
dropped its Paradise Island route last month.
   Resorts' airline operations reported losses of $2.3 million for
the first half of 1989. The Atlantic City, N.J.-based company also
operates Paradise Island Airlines.

   The dollar posted some gains Friday against
other major currencies in relatively uneventful foreign exchange
trading.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
a bid for gold as of 4 p.m. EST at $413.50 a troy ounce, up $2.85
from Thursday's late bid.
   Currency traders in Europe said the dollar was helped by
profit-taking in the West German mark, which has risen steadily
against the dollar over the past month. In the United States,
analysts said many traders decided to buy dollars as a hedge
against potentially market-moving announcements from the weekend
meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``The dollar traded with some strength today,'' said Craig
Sloane, financial futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   He said the dollar got some early support from concerns about
the attempted coup in the Philippines. He said each time the dollar
weakened during the day, it managed to rebound.
   Sloane said the government's report that its leading indicators
fell 0.4 percent in October and the national purchasing manager's
survey that indicated the economy continues to decline had little
impact on the currency markets.
   ``There was nothing in those reports that wasn't anticipated by
the market,'' he said. He described currency trading as light to
moderate.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.08 Japanese yen from
142.90 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it slipped to
143.05 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 143.40 yen from 142.80
yen late Thursday.
   The dollar gained ground against the British pound. In London,
the pound fell to $1.5665 from $1.5700 late Thursday. In New York,
the pound fell to $1.5625 from $1.5700 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7865 West German marks, up from 1.7815;
1.5995 Swiss francs, up from 1.5930; 6.1020 French francs, up from
6.0840; 1,316.50 Italian lire, up from 1,312.25; and 1.6505
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16405.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7825 West German marks, up from 1.7800;
1.5925 Swiss francs, up from 1.5910; 6.0875 French francs, up from
6.0725; 2.0150 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,313.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,311.50; and 1.1662 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1632.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose $2 a troy ounce to $413.60.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $414.00 a troy ounce, up
from $410.60 late Thursday, while it climbed to $415.00 an ounce in
Zurich from $409.50 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $8.39 to
$414.15 an ounce.
   Silver for current delivery slipped 0.5 cents a troy ounce to
$5.663 on New York's Comex. Earlier, silver rose in London to a
late bid of $5.70 a troy ounce, up from $5.64 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers: Manufacturing Continued To Slow in November</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to UPDATE with closing Dow Jones industrial average.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturing sector provided further
evidence of a weakening economy Friday as purchasing executives
reported business slowed again in November at the nation's
industrial companies.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which charts
economic trends with a monthly survey of purchasing executives,
said the economy deteriorated for the seventh straight month as
production levels declined for the fifth straight month.
   The organization's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 46.6
percent from 47.6 in October. A reading above 50 generally means
the manufacturing economy is expanding, while a reading below 50
means it is deteriorating.
   The index stood at 55.9 percent in November 1988.
   The purchasing managers survey is considered a major economic
indicator by financial markets and has affected trading in recent
months. Friday's report contributed to gains in the stock market,
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.38 to 2747.65.
   Wall Street also was influenced by another sign of an economic
slowdown, the Commerce Department's report of a 0.4 percent drop in
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators for October.
   Investors hope a weakening economy means the Federal Reserve
will push interest rates lower to help prevent a recession.
   ``Except for relatively strong growth in New Export Orders,
signs of weakness were confirmed by all indicators,'' said Robert
J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee.
   In their report, the purchasing managers said production
continued to decline in November, but at a slower pace than in
October.
   Nineteen percent of the survey's respondents said production
rose in November, while 56 percent said it was the same and 25
percent said it slowed. That compared with 17 percent who said
production improved in October, 62 percent who said it was the same
and 21 percent who said it was worse.
   New orders fell in November, the fifth drop in six months and
another indication that business was slowing.
   Twenty percent of those responding said new orders were up, 52
percent said they were the same and 28 percent said new orders had
fallen. In October, 21 percent said orders were up, 54 percent said
they were the same and 25 percent said orders were worse.
   Prices fell during November for the sixth consecutive month. Ten
percent of the purchasing managers reported higher prices, 64
percent said they were the same and 26 percent said prices were
lower _ all unchanged from October.
   Employment continued a decline begun in February.
   Twelve percent of those surveyed said employment at their firms
was up in November, 65 percent said it was unchanged and 23 percent
said it was down. In October, 10 percent said employment was up, 70
said it was the same and 20 percent said it was down.
   Vendor deliveries were faster in November, a sign that companies
have fewer orders to fill.
   Five percent of the purchasing managers said deliveries were
slower last month, 75 percent said they were the same and 20
percent said they were faster. In October, 3 percent said
deliveries were slower, 81 percent said they were the same and 16
percent said they were faster.
   Inventories, which have declined since January, continued to
fall last month.
   Thirteen percent of those surveyed said inventories were higher
in November, 53 percent said they were the same and 34 percent said
they were lower. In October, 13 percent reported inventories were
up, 60 percent said they were the same and 27 percent said they had
declined.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is an
education and research organization of purchasing executives. It
polls purchasing managers in more than 300 industrial firms for its
economic survey.

<HEAD>Perot Jumps Into Competition With Former Company After Court Order
Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICE GRAVINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Ross Perot didn't waste any time
Friday jumping into competition with his former company, Electronic
Data Systems Corp., after a three-year non-compete court order
expired.
   Perot said his Perot Systems Inc. sales people were ``out
knocking on doors'' early Friday.
   ``If I've got anybody not out bidding for business for profit
today, then I've got to send them back to training,'' he said.
   Perot and EDS have been battling each other since 1986, when
Perot parted ways with General Motors Corp. Perot had sold EDS to
GM in 1984.
   EDS spokesman Roger Still said, ``I would expect (Perot) to say
that ... Nothing has changed from our standpoint. We'll deal with
them in the marketplace as we would any competitor.''
   Perot formed Perot Systems, based in Vienna, Va., in mid-1988,
after GM paid the outspoken businessman an additional $700 million
for his GM stock and removed him from its board of directors.
   As part of the deal, Perot agreed not to compete with EDS for
profit until Dec. 1, 1989. EDS has complained that Perot violated
that agreement.
   GM sued Perot and Perot Systems, alleging a deal struck between
Perot Systems and the U.S. Postal Service violated the non-compete
clause.
   Perot says his company, which provides computing service under
contract, wasn't making a profit, so it didn't violate the
agreement.
   In April, Fairfax County, Va., Circuit Judge William Plummer
ruled that Perot Systems couldn't compete on a for-profit basis
with EDS until Dec. 1, 1989.
   On Dec. 16, 1988, the Postal Service canceled the contract.
Since then, Perot Systems has grown from 22 employees to 448.
   ``We are delighted to reach this point,'' Perot said. ``In
retrospect, my feeling for General Motors has to be one of
gratitude ... If they had not interfered with the postal contract,
today I would have a very small number of people working for me.
   ``Today I have ... a diversified base of federal business, with
a blue chip, blue ribbon list of clients,'' Perot said. ``And we
got all that business (because) people would read about GM taking
us to court and realize we were in business again.''

<HEAD>Italian Company Signs Deals with Soviets Worth $2.3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferruzzi Finanziaria SPA, one of Italy's largest
companies, announced Friday it has signed cooperative agreements
with the Soviet Union worth a total $2.3 billion.
   Ferruzzi, Italy's leading chemical and agro-industrial company,
signed the three agreements with the Soviet Ministry of Chemicals
and Petroleum Refining. The accords involve joint ventures and
other forms of cooperation, a spokesman for Ferruzzi said. The
investments to be made by Ferruzzi and the Soviets will total 3
trillion Italian lire, or around $2.3 billion.
   Ferruzzi Chairman Raul Gardini and the Soviet minister of
chemicals and petroleum refining, V.N. Lemaev, signed the
agreements in Rome during Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
three-day visit to Italy.
   About $3.3 billion worth of agreements between Italian private
and public industry and the Soviet Union were signed in connection
with Gorbachev's visit, including a joint venture accord with the
Fiat auto giant to produce 300,000 cars a year in the Soviet Union.
   Also this past week, Soviet and U.S. partners signed a joint
venture deal to build and operate a $2 billion petrochemical
complex in western Siberia. The consortium of U.S. companies is led
by Combustion Engineering of Stamford, Conn.
   The first agreement between the Soviets and Ferruzzi, valued at
1.3 trillion lire ($1 billion), involves the production and
distribution of the chemical polypropylene and its derivatives and
of other polyolefinic polymers.
   Plants are expected to be built in the Soviet cities of Tomsk,
Sumgait, Lisiciansk, Ufa and Moscow, representing a combined annual
capacity of 500,000 tons of polypropylene.
   Also in the chemical sector, an international consortium that
includes Montedison SPA and Enimont SPA of Italy, Occidental
Petroleum Corp. of the United States and Marubeni Corp. of Japan,
is expected to continue its negotiations on the Tenghiz
petrochemical complex in the Soviet Union.
   The consortium plans to meet in December with Soviet authorities
in Moscow to finalize the technical, economic and financial
documentation for the project.
   The second accord signed by Ferruzzi and the Soviets calls for
Ferruzzi subsidiary Montedison and the Soviet Ministry of Chemicals
and Petroleum Refining to carry out joint research in various areas
of chemicals and environmental protection.
   The third agreement calls for Ferruzzi to share with the Soviet
Union its experience in the agro-industrial sector.
   With an experimental phase already completed, several hundred
thousand acres in the Soviet Caucasus region will be cultivated for
the production of soybeans, corn and sugar beets.
   Ferruzzi also will assist the region in increasing its meat and
milk production. Investments under this agreement are expected to
total 800 billion lire, or around $600 million, over the next five
years.

<HEAD>Rally Continues in Energy Futures Pits, Cold Weather Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale home heating oil prices continued to
surge ahead Friday on buying inspired by cold weather and technical
market factors.
   Prices of other energy futures, including crude oil and unleaded
gasoline, followed heating oil higher.
   The contract for January delivery of No.2 heating oil spurted
1.10 cents to 62.91 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, bringing its gain over the past two sessions to 2.87
cents. Contracts for delivery during February through April also
finished with strong increases.
   Energy analysts said traders in the heating oil pit took a cue
from enthusiastic buyers overseas, a repeat of Thursday when
strength in London spilled over into U.S. markets. The December
contract that expired Thursday jumped 2.10 cents to 62.71 cents a
gallon.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 0.76
cent to 52.11 cents a gallon after rising 0.71 cent on Thursday.
Contracts for later delivery posted larger gains. The expired
December contract had gone up 0.57 cent to 50.29 cents a gallon on
Thursday.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, added 41 cents to close at $20.30 per
42-gallon barrel, raising its two-day gain to 90 cents. Contracts
for delivery in February through April finished with similarly
sized increases.
   Peter Beutel, who specializes in energy for Elders Futures Inc.,
said heating oil demand has risen as temperatures have dropped.
Colder weather is occurring in the United States and in Europe.
   He said reports that low water levels on the Rhine River are
disrupting shipments and that the Soviet Union is experiencing a
shortage of heating oil sent brokers scrambling to buy futures.
   The buying begat more buying as near-month futures prices swept
past levels considered technically significant, he said. The
thresholds were 62.00 cents a gallon for the January heating oil
contract and $20.00 a barrel for January crude.

   The stock market surged Friday, lifted by a
surprise afternoon rally that drew strength from investor hopes for
lower interest rates and a promising U.S.-Soviet summit this
weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.38 points to
2,747.65, the 10th highest close ever.
   The intensity of the rally, which sent the Dow average up more
than 50 points before it eased back, took many market observers by
surprise.
   ``I'm as shocked as anybody,'' said Brad Weeks, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
990 issues up, 531 down and 475 unchanged.
   ``Usually markets do well prior to summits,'' said Larry
Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``I don't
know what the market expects. But there's always a gamble that
something good will come out of it.''
   A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said
investors may have been encouraged by the outlook for cuts in
government outlays for defense.
   ``These meetings could lead to an easing of the deficits that
would cause interest rates to go down,'' Moore said.
   The market also got help from economic reports that pointed to a
sluggish fourth-quarter economy. The news heightened expectations
that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates to
stimulate growth.
   The government reported that its chief economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, fell 0.4 percent
in October, the sixth month of declines or no gain this year.
   That report was followed by the Purchasing Management
Association's November report showing a decline in the group's
index to 46.6 percent from 47.6 percent in October. A reading below
50 percent indicates a contraction in the nation's manufacturing
sector.
   Wall Street analysts also concluded that cash-heavy
institutional investors decided this was a good time to put their
money to work.
   A sharp rise in UAL stock helped fuel the rally in blue-chip
stocks. The stock was up 12{ to 174 on rumors that a new
employee-led buyout plan was being prepared.
   ``Institutions are looking to get out of the year with a good
performance,'' said Philip Puccio, managing director of equity
trading for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 199.20 million
shares, up from 153.20 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 239.23 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market advanced $36.049 billion, or
1.07 percent, in value from Thursday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
jumped 2.36 to 193.66.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris rose ]
to 42}, Chevron advanced 1} to 70], General Electric added 1\ to
63\, BankAmerica gained { to 26~ and Navistar, the most active
stock, ended unchanged at 4.
   IBM, meanwhile, dropped { to 97[, Ames Department store lost 1{

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.16 to 400.67, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 4.64 to 350.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.01 to 457.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 375.58, up 1.74.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Assets Freeze Against Finacor Anstalt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge extended a court order Friday
freezing the assets of Finacor Anstalt, a Liechtenstein company
accused by U.S. authorities of insider trading in Asea Brown Boveri
Ltd's bid for Combustion Engineering.
   In New York, U.S. District Judge John M. Cannella extended a
temporary restraining order freezing Finacor assets that the
Securities and Exchange Commission alleges may be subject to
disgorgement.
   The SEC, in a lawsuit filed earlier in New York, charged
Finacor, a financial services company, with making $2.8 million in
illegal profits allegedly using inside information about Asea Brown
Boveri's $1.6 billion bid for Combustion Engineering.
   In extending the temporary restraining order he issued last
month, Cannella ordered Finacor to account for all its assets by
next Friday.
   Cannella also ordered Finacor to return any assets transferred
out of the United States or to post a bond of equal amount.
   SEC lawyers had claimed that after they sought the asset freeze
_ but before Cannella granted it _ Finacor was liquidating some of
its assets and transferring them out of the country.
   ``Our client denies any wrongdoing,'' said John Newell, an
attorney for Finacor in New York.
   He was critical of SEC claims that a preliminary injunction was
needed because Finacor had not responded to Cannella's earlier
assets freeze order.
   ``Our clients were given notice of this action by telecopier and
overnight courier,'' said Newell, adding that his firm, Whitman and
Ransom, had ``just been retained, as of yesterday.''
   Cannella gave Finacor's lawyers until next Friday to submit
papers opposing the SEC's injunction request. A hearing is
scheduled for Dec. 20.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose moderately in cautious trading
Friday after two reports indicated the economy continues to weaken.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 5-32 point, or
about $1.56 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls
when the price rises, slipped to 7.87 percent from 7.89 percent
late Thursday.
   The biggest influence on the market was the monthly survey
issued by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which
provided evidence that business continues to slow in the
manufacturing sector, analysts said.
   The organization's Purchasing Managers Index fell a full
percentage point in November to 46.6 percent from 47.6 percent in
October.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., said, ``The weakened index was the principal
thing that the market saw today.''
   The government's report that its chief economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, fell 0.4 percent
in October also boosted bond prices.
   Both reports were seen as indications that the economy is
softening. Traders believe the Federal Reserve is more likely to
relax credit if the economy is weak. Such an action would allow
interest rates to decline and bond prices to rise.
   Ward McCarthy, a principal with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., said the market was cautious despite the economic
reports because of mixed signals from Fed in the last 10 days.
   On Monday, the Fed caught traders by surprise when it took steps
to move interest rates higher. The financial markets had expected
the central bank to ease credit.
   Traders also were wary in advance of this weekend's meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
McCarthy said, adding, ``Who knows what earth-shattering news could
come out of that?''
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities picked up 5-32 point and long-term issues rose 5-32
point to 7-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.21 to 1,196.49.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.76 percent as the
discount dropped 8 basis points to 7.52 percent. Yields on
six-month bills declined to 7.72 percent as the discount fell 5
basis points to 7.34 percent. Yields on one-year bills slipped to
7.64 percent as the discount lost 5 basis points to 7.14 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 15-32 point to 93 13-16. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.23 percent from 7.24 percent late
Thursday.
   The federal funds rate, the interest charge on short-term loans
between banks, was quoted at 8 7-16 percent, down from 8| percent
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Surging Heating-Oil Demand Drives Energy Futures Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rose sharply Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, paced by a surging heating-oil market that
jumped more than 5 percent in the week's last three trading days.
   On other commodity markets Friday, corn and soybean prices fell
while wheat futures were mixed, gold rose, silver fell, cattle
futures advanced and pork futures were mixed.
   Heating oil futures settled .57 cent to 1.32 cents higher in New
York with the contract for delivery in January up 1.10 cents at
62.91 cents a gallon.
   Crude oil finished 37 cents to 44 cents higher with January at
$20.30 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was .65 cent to 1.01 cents
higher with January at 52.11 cents a gallon.
   Heating-oil futures have been climbing since August and have
risen faster with the onset of cold weather, reflecting unusually
tight supplies both in the United States and in Europe.
   The European supply situation is more severe, a result of
disruptions in the movement of heating oil from the Soviet Union, a
major European supplier, and the low level of the Rhine River,
which has further restricted the movement of supplies.
   Meanwhile, early episodes of cold weather in the United States
and in Europe have stirred strong demand for heating oil.
   ``We've had a good, quick start to the winter and we're having
heating oil usage at a very high level,'' said Ray Mazzeo, an
energy futures specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The strength in heating oil has more than offset the bearish
punch of OPEC's agreement to raise its crude-oil production ceiling
to 22 million barrels a day from 20.5 million barrels in the first
half of 1990.
   ``If not for heating oil coming to the rescue there the last
couple days, crude oil could very easily be a dollar lower right
now,'' said James Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and
research at Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area oil distributor.
   Corn and soybean futures fell substantially on the Chicago Board
of Trade in a late, technically inspired drop.
   Wheat futures finished mixed, supported by rumors that the
Soviet Union had bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Talk of increased Soviet purchases of U.S. grain has dominated
trading ahead of this weekend's meeting between President Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   After the close, the USDA announced sales of 800,000 tons of
corn and 100,000 tons of soybean meal to the Soviets, partially
confirming rumors that had supported those markets on Thursday.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with
December at $4.08\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 3} cents lower with
December at $2.34{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents lower
with December at $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 6{
cents lower with January at $5.76\ a bushel.
   Gold futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity Exchange in
quiet trading. Silver finished slightly lower.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2 higher with December at $413.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.7 cent lower with December at
$5.663 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork belly futures fell for the fifth straight day on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, although not as sharply as in the
three previous sessions. The market has collapsed amid
disappointment over the slow pace at which the government is buying
pork bellies to donate to Poland.
   Hog futures closed mixed while cattle futures advanced in a
technical correction after falling along with the belly market for
most of the week.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .35 cent higher with
December at 75.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.23 cent higher with January at 82.85 cents a pound; live hogs were
.30 cent lower to .37 cent higher with December at 50.55 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to 1.05 cents lower with
February at 57.50 cents a pound.

   PacifiCorp offered Friday to acquire
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., three weeks after proposing a buyout
of the company's Arizona Public Service Co., its only profitable
division.
   PacifiCorp, which has interests in electric utilities in seven
Western states, made its offer contingent on the sale of MeraBank,
Pinnacle West's troubled savings bank subsidiary.
   Portland-based PacifiCorp offered to exchange .18 of a share of
its own stock for each outstanding Pinnacle West share. Based on
PacifiCorp's current stock price the offer has an indicated value
of nearly $8 a share, or a total of about $693.7 million, based on
the company's roughly 86.7 million oustanding shares.
   That would be less than the $1.7 billion PacifiCorp offered for
Arizona Public Service on Nov. 8, but the company indicated the
difference was due to concerns over the level of Pinnacle West's
debt.
   However, Dave Bolender, PacifiCorp's president for electric
operations who conducted a news conference in Phoenix, put the
total value of the revised offer at about $2 billion.
   Bolender said the offer includes roughly $500 million in cash or
credit to Pinnacle West for MeraBank, $700 million in stock swaps
and $800 million to assume Pinnacle West's debt.
   He said the offer was revised to provide up-front cash for
Pinnacle West to meet its needs regarding MeraBank and to resolve
possible adverse tax consequences of a stock purchase for cash.
   Trading was halted in both companies' shares Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange and did not resume by the market's close. At
the time, PacifiCorp was trading at $44.37{ a share, up 50 cents
from Thursday's close, and Pinnacle West was unchanged at $5.25 a
share.
   Steve Carr, a spokesman for Pinnacle West, said the company's
board of directors would consider the proposal but he could not say
when that might be. The next scheduled board meeting is later this
month.
   ``At this point it is just an offer and we haven't had any
discussion with PacifiCorp,'' Carr said.
   PacifiCorp President A.M. Gleason issued a statement saying:
``This proposal would provide a significant value to Pinnacle West
shareholders, while maintaining our commitment to limit price
increases for APS customers to 2 percent per year over the next
four years,''
   ``We believe it is in the best interest of your shareholders,
customers and employees for us to discuss this transaction as soon
as possible,'' Gleason wrote in a letter sent to Turley.
   ``The reason we are doing this today is that we have not gotten
a response from Pinnacle West'' on the original offer, said Sandra
McDonough, PacifiCorp's federal affairs manager.
   In making its initial offer, PacifiCorp said a buyout of Arizona
Public Service would benefit consumers in Arizona and states it
already serves because their varying periods of peak demand for
power would lessen the need for new generating plants.
   The new buyout offer was contingent on MeraBank being sold after
receiving a capital infusion of $510 million from Pinnacle and on
other Pinnacle assets having a net value of $300 million, excluding
Arizona Public Service, Gleason said.
   He said any variations would result in an adjusted stock
exchange ratio.
   Todd Parrish, an analyst with the Milwaukee brokerage Blunt,
Ellis &amp; Loewi, speculated the new offer was designed to appeal to
Pinnacle West's shareholders.
   ``The previous offer was very, very attractive to everybody but
the Pinnacle West shareholder,'' he said.
   Parrish said, however, that the $510 million infusion in the
bank appeared to be low. ``We had been hearing upwards of $750
million necessary. Every quarter that goes by the situation seems
to be that much worse,'' he said.
   In addition to its utilities _ which serve customers in Oregon,
Wyoming, Washington, California, Montana, Idaho and Utah _
PacifiCorp has interests in mining, telecommunications and
financial services.
   Besides Arizona Public Service and MeraBank, Pinnacle West owns
a real estate development company, a uranium company and a venture
capital firm.
   Phoenix-based MeraBank, a federal savings bank, has suffered
increasing losses due to the softening Southwest real estate market
and Pinnacle West must pump $180 million into the thrift to meet
federal capital guidelines.
   PacifiCorp has said it would provide Pinnacle West with cash or
interim credit support pending regulatory approval of the merger.
   The revised offer still includes redemption or exchange of
Arizona Public Service stock for PacifiCorp preferred stock and
assumption or repayment of Pinnacle West debt.
   PacifiCorp earlier this year completed acquisition of Utah Power
in the largest U.S. utility merger ever.

   Wall Street leaders declared an end to
their lengthy battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds
business, proposing to junk the law that has governed the nation's
basic banking structure since the Depression.
   Directors of the Securities Industry Association, at the trade
group's annual convention, on Friday endorsed a proposal for new
legislation to let subsidiaries of banks ``engage in a broad range
of securities and securities-related activities.''
   At the same time, the SIA said its plan would let brokers engage
in consumer banking businesses and join banks in having access to
the Federal Reserve's banking system.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge signaled a slowdown in October, but other evidence suggested
that lower interest rates will keep the economy from toppling into
a recession.
   The 0.4 percent drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators reported Friday fits in with the
consensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year and
the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best.
   However, some analysts said a number of factors mitigated the
unfavorable report.

   The manufacturing sector provided further
evidence of a weakening economy as purchasing executives reported
that business slowed again in November at the nation's industrial
companies.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which charts
economic trends with a monthly survey of purchasing executives,
said Friday the economy deteriorated for the seventh straight month
as production levels declined for the fifth straight month.
   The organization's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 46.6
percent from 47.6 in October.

   The first gain in single-family home building
in nine months helped boost construction spending in October, the
government said in a report suggesting lower interest rates are
helping end a construction slump.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that spending rose 1 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $420.1 billion.
   The increase followed no change in September and a 1.5 percent
gain in August. Construction spending fell in July and June.

   The nation's thrift institutions continued to
shrink dramatically in September in preparation for tough new
financial standards taking effect the coming week, the government
said.
   Assets at the nation's 2,903 thrifts shrank by $15.2 billion,
breaking the record set in August of $13.3 billion, the Office of
Thrift Supervision said Friday.
   Meanwhile, a net of $8.9 billion in deposits was withdrawn from
thrifts, the most since February, which marked the second-heaviest
outflow on record. September was the 16th consecutive month of
outflows.

Bush's decision to bar Panamanian-flag vessels from U.S. ports
could make shipowners pawns in diplomatic disputes.
   The move might interrupt free trade and prove costly and
disruptive to shipowners, industry insiders said Friday.
   Bush's ban, announced Thursday, goes into effect Jan. 31 and is
one of various U.S. economic sanctions already in place against
Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
