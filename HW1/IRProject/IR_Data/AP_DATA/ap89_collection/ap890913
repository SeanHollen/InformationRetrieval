   Thirteen-year-old Chantee Charles thought she'd
made the wrong impression. But if she were to do it over again,
she'd still let President Bush have a piece of her mind.
   As it happened, Bush took it in stride when the Arlington, Va.
youngster delivered a surprise lecture against the death penalty
during an anti-drug ceremony at the White House on Wednesday.
   ``To me, killing someone that has committed a very serious crime
is wrong,'' Chantee told the Rose Garden crowd assembled to honor
the Drug Abuse Resistence Education project, DARE. ``It does not
solve anything. All it does is take someone else's life.''
   Bush, a longtime backer of capital punishment and an advocate of
extending the death penalty to drug kingpins, hardly seemed put off
by his youthful critic. Indeed, he complimented Chantee and two
other teenagers who also addressed the gathering for saying ``what's
on your heart'' without worrying ``if people agree with you or not.''
   Chantee said she had formulated her speech without really knowing
that Bush was such a staunch advocate of the death penalty, and,
when first questioned about her speech by reporters ``thought I had
made the wrong impression.'' But White House aides later assured
her, just as the president did himself, that no offense was taken,
she said.
   In any case, she wouldn't have done anything differently, she
added. ``In DARE classes, they teach you not to stoop down to
pressures, to be your own person and not let your friends take you
down,'' she said. ``It's important for me to know that other people
know how I really feel.''
   Her White House surprise was reminiscent of an episode nearly 20
years ago, when a young Madison, Wis., woman, Debra Jean Sweet,
admonished President Nixon for his conduct of the Vietnam war after
he had presented her with a medal for exceptional public service.
   Nixon had drawn her ire when he contrasted her with ``the very
small minority of young Americans who have lost faith in their
country.'' She retorted that ``I cannot believe in your sincerity
until you get us out of Vietnam.'' Later she explained that ``I saw
him using me as a symbol and I refused to become that symbol.''

   El Salvador's leftist rebels opened their
first peace talks in two years with government representatives
Wednesday by offering to end their civil war and reorganize as a
political party in exchange for reforms.
   It was the first time the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front said it would participate in the political process
as part of the path toward peace.
   The rebel plan called for the civil war to end in six months.
   ``There is a very good climate,'' said Gregorio Rosa Chavez,
auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, who is observing the talks. He
said the government also made a proposal, but he refused to discuss
it.
   After Monday's session ended, Salvadoran Justice Minister Oscar
Alfredo Santamaria told a news conference the talks were held in a
positive atmosphere.
   ``We feel satisfied,'' he said of progress made.
   Santamaria said the government proposed it meet rebel
representatives for two days every two months, with the Roman
Catholic Church acting as observer and not as mediator.
   He was reluctant to predict any outcome.
   ``What will happen I don't know,'' Santamaria said.
   Farabundo Marti leaders outlined their plan in a statement before
talks opened to end the decade-old war that has cost more than
70,000 lives. Aside from the political participation offer, little
in it was new.
   The guerrillas demanded that President Alfredo Cristiani's
rightist administration reform the judiciary; prosecute human rights
violators and end all political repression; and undertake
constitutional and land reforms.
   They proposed that ultrarightists be weeded out of the judicial
system and the military, now made up of 56,000 soldiers, be
restructured and cut down.
   They also asked the government to move up the date of El
Salvador's 1991 legislative and municipal elections and allow them
to participate as a party.
   In exchange, the guerrillas said they would agree to a cease-fire
starting no later than Nov. 15 and would begin to integrate
themselves into El Salvador's political life.
   ``We are not negotiating from a position of weakness,'' said
Joaquin Villalobos, a senior guerrilla leader.
   He said the talks will test the Cristiani administration's desire
for peace.
   Cristiani refused to answer questions at a brief public
appearance in San Salvador.
   Miguel Saenz, a rebel spokesman, told reporters the participants
began by discussing procedural matters and an agenda.
   Many rebel demands similar to those made Wednesday were rejected
by the rightist-dominated military in three previous negotiating
sessions from 1984 to 1987.
   Villalobos said Wednesday that the rebels want a quick end to the
war. He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting: ``We are
conscious the war has to end.''
   Many of the victims of the war against a succession of
U.S.-backed governments have been civilians.
   After a cease-fire and government recognition of the rebels as a
political party, a lasting peace would be negotiated with the front
laying down its arms, Villalobos said.
   Cristiani invited the guerrillas to lay down their arms and
engage in peace talks when he succeeded President Jose Napoleon
Duarte for a five-year term June 1.
   Rebel and government called a temporary cease-fire for the
two-day peace talks.
   The government said earlier it will not negotiate a reduction in
the military and that if the rebels want reform, they should pursue
it through the political process.
   The rebels boycotted regular elections since 1982, saying such
elections offer only a veneer of democracy.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Blocks Release of Mexican Millionaire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday blocked a
judge's order setting $200,000 bail for the brother-in-law of
Mexico's former president after prosecutors sought time to appeal
the decision.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal granted a stay on the order
issued Tuesday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Takasugi. The
order would have resulted in freedom for Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, a
Mexican businessman linked by authorities to drug trafficking. He
has been in prison since Aug. 9.
   The appeals court gave prosecutors until Monday to appeal the
release order and gave the defense until Sept. 25 to file responses.
   ``We'll just have to abide by the court's order and wait for the
ruling,'' said Zuno's attorney, Edward Medvene.
   Zuno was charged with perjury before a federal grand jury last
week after spending nearly a month in custody without being charged
with any crime. He was held initially as a material witness in the
1985 torture murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement agent Enrique Camarena.
   Prosecutors contend that Zuno, a millionaire who has vast
business holdings in Mexico, would flee to his native country and
never return if he is freed.
   Zuno's sister is the wife of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria.
   Takasugi, who ruled that Zuno could not be held without bail,
said that the defendant could sign a waiver of extradition and a
promise to return to federal court when he is summoned.
   The government wants Zuno to testify in the trial of a recently
charged defendant in the Camarena case, Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a
former member of the Jailisco State Judicial Police.
   Prosecutors have linked Zuno to the sale of a home in Guadalajara
that was subsequently bought by Mexican drug lord Rafael
Caro-Quintero. Authorities believe Camarena was murdered at the
house.
   Zuno's lawyers say the house was sold through an intermediary and
Zuno knew nothing about the murder.
   Caro, who is accused of orchestrating the murders, is in custody
awaiting trial in Mexico City. Seven more men are charged with
murder and conspiracy in the case.
   Zuno testified before a federal grand jury for two days, and
another judge ruled then that he had little information to offer and
should be released. At that point, immigration officials demanded
his return to San Antonio, Texas, for investigation of whether he
was a narcotics trafficker.
   While in Texas, he was charged with perjury in Los Angeles and
was returned again. He was accused of lying when he said he didn't
know Caro or Ernesto Fonseca Carillo, another key defendant in the
Camarena case.
   Prosecutors have said they consider Zuno ``significant'' in the
Camarena investigation, but have refused to say why.

   People with dreams of wealth and wealthy
people with hopes for more lined up and bought Lotto tickets by the
millions as the jackpot for Wednesday night's drawing reached $55
million.
   ``Everybody wants a winning number. And everybody thinks they
have it when they leave the store,'' said Miles Turnquist, the owner
of a 7-Eleven in Truckee near the north shore of Lake Tahoe about 30
miles west of Reno, Nev.
   Sales for the 7:58 p.m. televised drawing averaged $1.73 million
an hour Wednesday, totaling $12.1 million between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m.
as Californians and a fair number of Nevadans bought chances on the
rollover jackpot that hasn't been won since Aug. 26, Lottery
officials said.
   Sales Tuesday in the Lotto 6-46 game topped $17 million and $9.9
million worth of $1 tickets were purchased Sunday and Monday.
   Players pick six numbers from 1 to 49 in the twice-a-week game.
The winning numbers picked in Wednesday's drawing were 02, 32, 21,
11, 28, 19 and the bonus number, to determine a larger jackpot for
five-of-six winners, was 27. The winner, if any, was to be announced
Thursday.
   The chance of winning: 1 in 14 million. Big winners get their
prizes in 20 annual installments.
   The all-time California jackpot record was $61.98 million on Oct.
29, 1988, with sales that day of $39.8 million, Lottery spokesman
John Schaade said. Holders of three winning tickets split the take.
   The largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever was given away in the
Pennsylvania lottery on April 26, 1989, when $115 million was split
by 14 winning tickets.
   On Wednesday, a ``Lotto Fever Management Team'' tried to make
sure there would be no glitches at the 7,900 retailers around the
state where tickets are sold.
   ``All systems are go so far,'' said Lottery spokeswoman Caroline
Walker, who added, ``Better knock on wood.''
   Many did around the state, from traditional high-volume seller
Wills Fargo Country Store in Baker to specialty shops in affluent
Beverly Hills.
   ``We're midway between Las Vegas and Barstow,'' Steve Zwerner,
general manager of the country store in the Southern California
desert near the Nevada line, said Tuesday. ``You have to go right
through us to get to Vegas. Many of them just came, bought their
tickets and got back to Vegas.''
   Even the rich get Lotto fever, said Beverly Hills tobacconist
Charlie Kornguth.
   Kornguth said he sells $4,000 and $5,000 worth of Lotto tickets
with random, computer-selected numbers to many well-heeled
customers. He said he once issued $11,000 in tickets to ``a man who
won zero, zilch, nothing.''
   John Kaiser, managing partner of the Satellite Mrket in Orange,
said many of his customers eschewed random picks for birthdays,
anniversaries and Los Angeles Dodgers' numbers.
   ``I know one guy who uses the date he got divorced,'' Kaiser said.

   Singer Freddie Jackson has been touring and the
tour has brought him to Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theater through
Sunday. As he says from the stage, he feels much satisfaction
because as a boy in Harlem he expected to be on Broadway only by
attending one of the street's movie theaters.
   Jackson sings contemporary rhythm 'n' blues with an emphasis on
love ballads. There's also an emphasis on an uptempo beat and a
fervent delivery. This is no limpid romantic ballad singing. It's
more sexy than romantic. The band is loud. Not until Jackson sang
``For All We Know'' as a tribute to the late Donny Hathaway, bending
notes and getting fervent with that one, too, could all the words of
a song be heard.
   On the second night of Jackson's ``Up Close and Personal'' show
on Wednesday, the Lunt-Fontanne wasn't full but the audience was
with Jackson all the way. He entered through a white door at the top
of white stairs wearing a white suit, the short jacket edged in gold
braid and gold epaulets widening his shoulders. This didn't hide the
fact that the rest of Jackson is wide, too. But the audience
responded to his dance steps and suggestive swaying with apparent
ecstacy. Women in the front row vied to mop his perspiring brow.
   Jackson did a medley of hits he has had since his first record in
1985. A high point of the show was ``I Do,'' the duet he recorded
with Natalie Cole, sung here with one of his three backup singers.
   The evening began with 20 minutes by comic Michael Winslow, whose
forte is making noises into a microphone _ of door locks, a dog, a
car, an airplane. He's clever, with an engaging manner, and one
would enjoy him more if not worried that one of his shrieks would
pierce an eardrum.
   Regina Belle, a singer in the general style of Anita Baker, had
the middle slot, between the two intermissions. She has the voice,
the range, the vocal stamina and the stage presence to hold and
excite the audience with each song.
   She doesn't yet have what Jackson does, the thread that ties
different songs together and makes each one belong to the singer
who's singing them.

   The former president of a Jewish
students' group at the state University at Binghamton was charged
Wednesday with painting anti-Semitic slurs on the group's
headquarters last year.
   Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen said James
Oppenheim, 20, was charged with fourth-degree criminal mischief and
third-degree falsely reporting an incident.
   Oppenheim, a junior, was president of the Jewish Student Union
when slurs and swastikas _ a symbol used by Nazi Germany _ were
painted on the group's office and sanctuary on Nov. 10, 1988. It was
the eve of the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night Nazi
stormtroopers began their reign of terror against German Jews by
smashing up their stores and homes.
   Oppenheim was quoted at the time as condemning the act as
``horrible'' and ``hurtful.'' He also speculated the vandalism was a
calculated political act.

   An allegedly obsessed fan of Tiffany was
barred by a court order from telephoning, closely observing or
blocking the movements of the 17-year-old singer.
   A Superior Court commissioner also ruled Wednesday that
35-year-old Jeff Deane Turner of Santa Cruz must remain at least 200
yards from Tiffany's home, recording studios and sites of her
concert appearances.
   Turner was arrested in June 1988 in Los Angeles after trying to
present Tiffany, whose full name is Tiffany Darwish, with a bouquet
and a samurai sword.
   ``I had never seen or heard of the defendant prior to that
time,'' the singer said in a sworn statement. ``Apparently, he's an
obsessed fan.''
   In her petition, Tiffany said Turner later appeared at a Northern
California promotion and ``kissed me and walked with his arm around
me. The defendant sent me numerous letters, one of which states God
wants us to be together.''
   The singer said in her statement that Turner obtained her home
address in La Mirada from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the same
way that a man accused of killing Rebecca Schaeffer allegedly
obtained the actress' address.

<HEAD>House Rejects Helms Effort to Restrict Arts Funding</HEAD>

   The House on Thursday rejected a Senate effort
led by Jesse Helms to prohibit federal funds to support sexually
explicit or blasphemous art.
   On a 264-153 vote, the House defeated a motion that would have
committed it to the restrictions Helms wants to impose on the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the endowment's chief supporter in the
House, argued successfully that the arts restrictions would amount
to censorship and lead to the ``lingering death'' of the 25-year-old
agency.
   Endowment critics, upset over the use of federal funds this year
for photography exhibits that included a picture of Christ on a
cross in a jar of urine and photos of homosexual acts, denied there
would be censorship. They said people have a right to demand that
tax dollars not be spent to subsidize art they abhor.
   ``The question is sponsorship, not censorship,`` said freshman
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who led the fight on the House
floor on behalf of Helms' Senate-backed amendment. ``Artists can do
whatever they want on their own time and with their own dime.''
   Democrats united behind Yates, however, voting against accepting
Helms' measure by a margin of 212-37. House Republicans, whose
campaign committee already has used the issue against incumbent
Democrats, supported Helms' measure 116-52.
   ``We're telling Jesse we respect freedom of expression,'' Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., said after the vote.
   The battle is not over, however. Helms succeeded in having the
Senate place the arts restrictions in an overall spending bill for
the endowment and several other agencies.
   The House and Senate have yet to agree on a final version for the
$10 billion bill, and Senate negotiators can still fight for the
arts restrictions when the two sides meet in conference.
   ``The debate now shifts to the hinterland,'' said Rohrabacher,
whose failed motion would have instructed House negotiators to yield
to Helms' language. ``I believe there will be another (House) vote
on this. I believe Sen. Helms has a few rabbits up his sleeve.''
   For more than a month, a coalition of 22 Christian, conservative
and Republican groups have waged a campaign characterizing Yates'
planned maneuver as a ``smoke screen'' and ``sham.''
   Yates said Helms' measure would reach far beyond what the
Democrat said were mistakes by the endowment in awarding grants this
year for promoting the two controversial exhibits.
   ``It establishes a broad and sweeping pattern of censorship,''
Yates said. ``This is the start of George Orwell's big brother; it's
the communist approach to art.''
   Before the vote Wednesday, Democratic leaders thwarted an effort
by supporters of the Helms measure to press their point by
displaying copies of the offending photographs on the House floor.
   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at
the time, denied the request, saying the exhibit would upset the
decorum of the House. The sergeant of arms also was ordered to cover
up a display in the speaker's lobby outside the chamber.
   The controversy began last spring as a small protest against an
indirect $15,000 award by the National Endowment for the Arts to
photographer Andre Serrano, whose exhibited work includes a picture
of Christ on a cross submerged in a jar of urine.
   It then mushroomed when the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington, fearing a cut in its funds from the endowment, in June
canceled a show by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe that
included photos of homosexual acts and nude children.
   The second-ranking officer of the Corcoran and the organizer of
the Mapplethorpe show, Jane Livingston, resigned Wednesday, saying
she planned to complete a book. She said that though she was
``appalled'' at the cancellation, done without consulting her, her
resignation ``very well may have happened now without any of the
otehr events.''
   Yates, who chairs the House subcommittee responsible for the
endowment's annual appropriation, tried to douse the flames two
months ago by cutting its $171.4 million budget for next year by
$45,000 _ the amount of federal grants that went toward the two
controversial exhibits.
   Unappeased, critics turned to Helms, who two weeks later _ and
with no voiced opposition _ attached his amendment to the Senate's
version of the appropriations bill.
   Helms' amendment would prohibit the endowment from awarding any
grants to museums and artists for promoting or producing ``obscene
or indecent material, including ... depicitions of sadomasochism,
homoeroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engaged
in sex acts.''
   It also bans support for art that ``denigrates the objects or
beliefs of ... a particular religion or non-religion or denigrates,
debases or reviles a person, group or class of citizens on the basis
of race, creed, sex, handicap or national origin.''

<TEXT>
   While insisting that its problem with
murderous drug traffickers is due to Americans' craving for cocaine,
Colombia is finding it has a drug abuse problem of its own.
   More than one in 10 Colombians use drugs regularly, and almost 5
percent of children age 12 and younger have tried them, according to
an as yet unreleased government study obtained by The Associated
Press.
   When the drug use study conducted by the Ministry of Education is
made public, it is bound to shock this proud Latin American country.
   Many Colombians are fond of saying that drug abuse, violence and
lust for pornography are problems characterizing Americans.
   Colombian society prides itself on its traditional values such as
family unity and respect for elders.
   President Virgilio Barco, in speeches in Washington and on
nationwide television, has repeated his message tirelessly: United
States drug users are ultimately to blame for drug trafficking in
Colombia.
   The Colombian government does not have a national program to
prevent or treat drug addiction, but it is spending money on
advertising pointing to American addicts.
   An ad being run in current government magazines and picked up by
newspapers shows what is supposed to be a freckle-faced American
woman snorting cocaine through a straw.
   ``Because of her cocaine habit, she is directly supporting the
drug terrorists who are tearing apart our country,'' the ad says.
``She's like thousands of young Americans, rich and poor alike,
addicted to cocaine.''
   The statistics of the Colombian study are based upon lengthy
questionnaires given to 7,513 Colombians from a wide social and
geographic spectrum.
   The study said 4.5 percent of Colombians age 12 and under have
tried drugs and gave these figures for young people of other age
groups:
   _13-15 years old: 20.8 percent.
   _16-18 years old: 47.1 percent.
   _19-21 years old: 59.5 percent.
   The most frequently used drugs in order of use are marijuana,
``basuco,'' cocaine, heroin, hashish, LSD and even hallucinogenic
mushrooms, the study says.
   Basuco is the brown residue scraped from the inside of a
container after preparing cocaine base. It is smoked like crack.
   Cocaine base has not yet been treated with hydrochloric acid for
making pure cocaine and is therefore said to be weaker than crack.
   The results of the Colombian study were so shocking that a
follow-up study was done of 30,000 Colombians age 15 and older to
see how many use drugs on a steady basis, the head of the Education
Ministry study, Gabriel Gutierrez Garcia, told the AP.
   Twelve percent of those questioned use illegal drugs on a regular
basis, the study showed, according to Gutierrez.
   There is no visible federal campaign against drug use in
Colombia. Whatever minor programs there are scattered throughout the
country are supposed to directed and coordinated by Colombia's
National Drug Council.
   However, one of the council's administrators, Maria Mercedes
Sanchez, said she did not know how much the government spends on
drug prevention.
   There is nothing identifiable in the Colombian government's
budget for prevention and treatment of drug addiction.
   AP inquiries about government drug programs that might exist did
not turn up a single program.
   The Health Ministry contributes $2,500 a year to operation of the
country's largest drug rehabilitation clinic, the director of the
clinic in Bogota, Maria Isabel Salagar de Lince, told the AP.
   ``It isn't much, but every little bit helps,'' she said in an
interview about the clinic that treats 1,000 people a year. She said
the Bogota clinic is privately run and non-profit.
   Mrs. Lince said she believes there are 10 other clinics in the
country, but knows nothing about them. She said the National Drug
Council emphasizes drug enforcment rather than prevention and cure.
   The government has no drug rehabiliation centers.
   Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana, elected last year for a two-year
term, has created a corps of 75 psychologists and 25 other workers
to inform teachers and pupils about the dangers of drug addiction,
Gloria Inez Garcia, an administrator with the program, told the AP.
   ``There are no federal programs against drug addicition or for
helping cure people of addiction,'' Miss Garcia said in an interview.
   As for the Bogota mayor's program, it is unlikely it will survive
when Pastrana is replaced next August.
   Colombian mayors, elected every two years, cannot run for
re-election and new mayors almost always wipe out the social
programs of predecessors.
   The most visible nationwide campaign against drug addiction was
by Colombia's privately owned Banco Cafetero _ Coffee Growers Bank _
three years ago. Posters, billboards and radio and television spots
warned people of the dangers of drug addiction.
   On television, an actor portraying a drug addict changed on the
screen from normal-looking to beastly.
   The Colombian government often relies on the private sector to
assume responsibility for such campaigns. Even signs announcing to
drivers that a military base lies ahead often carries accompanying
advertising by the company that paid for the sign.
   Access to drugs in Colombia is literally as easy as buying a
hotdog from a street vendor. It is common knowledge the vendors sell
drugs.
   An AP reporter living here 10 years has seen farmers making
cocaine base in small, open laboratories in the jungle and the high
Andes mountains.
   The operations are widespread, with farmers often testing their
product before sending it by a motorcycle messenger to the nearest
city.
   Drugs are cheap here. A kilo _ 2.2 pounds of cocaine _ costs just
$1,100 in Bogota, compared to $11,000 to $15,000 in Miami.
   In discotheques in wealthy parts of the capital of Bogota, a city
of 6 million people, customers openly buy cocaine and other drugs
from waiters or pay a waiter to have the doorman go out and buy them.
   It is easy and simple to buy drugs on the street without even
knowing anyone. Certain streets are well-known for drug trafficking
and a prospective buyer has only to touch his forehead with his
right hand to signal a horde of drug vendors.

   Many of the kids listening to the president's grandfatherly
advice that ``Saying `no' won't make you a nerd,'' found it just one
more bit of well-meaning advice from an adult far from the front
lines in the drug war.
   ``I don't think it had that much effect because drug dealers are
going to still go out and deal and people are going to still go out
and buy drugs because it's addictive,'' said Jason McNally, a
seventh-grader in Elmhurst, Ill.
   ``It needs a lot more to stop it,'' said 10-year-old Amos Dunn, a
fifth-grader in Boston. The only answer is ``not making any more
drugs,'' he concluded.
   Like Amos, other pupils who watched Bush's televised speech
Tuesday demonstrated intimate awareness of the problem. And many
wondered if anything the president says is goingto make a difference.
   Tres Whitlow, a 12-year-old classmate of Jason's at Carl Sandburg
Junior High in the middle-class Chicago suburb, said warnings from
parents or politicians pale beside pressure teen-agers feel _ from
their peers and from dealers _ to try drugs.
   ``They see drug dealers tell them it's going to make them do
better,'' said Tres, 12.
   From Roosevelt Junior High School in Glendale, Calif., came
comments much like some heard in Congress.
   ``I think he should have been tougher,'' said Katherine Jo,
ninth-grade class president at the suburban Los Angeles school. ``He
doesn't know how bad it is.''
   Some supported the president.
   At Sandburg, 12-year-old Christine Gershak took heart in the
president's message that there are people willing to help youths
resist drugs. ``I think it will make a big impact because the kids
will, like, know what to do, to go for help,'' she said.
   But classmate Tania Durdevic, 12, noted Bush didn't address one
of the causes of drug abuse.
   ``Some kids might take drugs because they have family problems
and think nobody likes them,'' Tania said. ``But, like, my life is
really good, my family _ I know they care about me.''
   Amos and his classmates at Mattahunt Elementary School in
inner-city Boston were all too familiar with the dangers Bush warned
them about. They see it on the streets, and what they learn there
often is embellished with what they get from television.
   ``The white people are supplying it to black people, who are
selling it to black people. Like on TV,'' said Larry Bates, 11. ``It
makes me feel bad seeing black people are using it. I'm black. I'm
not going to be using it.''
   The teacher of the Boston class, Ouida Kalokoh, warns her
students about drugs. But she didn't know the ingredients in crack _
until her pupils filled her in.
   ``I was told everything, and they were fourth-graders,'' she
said, dismay in her voice. ``They knew all about it.''

   High winds and torrential rains
Tuesday killed seven people and left thousands homeless in southern
Brazil, according to Globo television.
   All seven died in Parana state, where flooding, mudslides and
winds also swept away homes and knocked out power lines.
   In the state capital of Curitiba, 520 miles southwest of Rio,
three people drowned. In the outlying provinces, at least four
people died in flooding, said Globo, the nation's largest private
network.
   In the remote town of Aparecida do Oeste, 20 people were hurt
when 65 mph winds toppled a brick and wood church during a morning
service.
   In the neighboring states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul, which border Uruguay and Argentina, high winds and mudslides
leveled houses, knocked out power and blocked roadways.
   Thousands of slum dwellers left homeless in the three states were
sheltered in schools and churches, the network said.

   Reform-minded Communists in
Hungary are gambling that by freeing thousands of East Germans
they'll pick up more Western support than Soviet bloc anger.
   Budapest took the potentially risky step of breaking ranks with
its Soviet bloc allies by opening the doors for East Germans fed up
with the country's antiquated, hard-line leaders.
   The Soviet Union has joined East Germany in crying foul, and
Czechoslovakia has also expressed displeasure.
   But the criticism from Hungary's allies has failed to stop
Premier Miklos Nemeth and his reformist colleagues in Budapest.
   At one level, letting the refugees go shows Hungary's respect for
a cherished Western value, the right to travel as one pleases.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany, almost
on cue, praised Budapest for its ``new way of thinking'' and humane
policies just hours after the exodus began on Monday.
   But much more importantly, Hungary has been looking for greater
backing from the West in solving its economic woes.
   That's the message the Harvard-educated Nemeth and his foreign
minister, Gyula Horn, took to Bonn in a surprise visit Aug. 25 when
the logjam of East Germans waiting in Hungary was reaching a peak.
   While both sides deny any deal was struck, Horn and Nemeth
reportedly told Chancellor Helmut Kohl that they were looking for
more economic support _ and for help in becoming more involved in
the lucrative European Economic Community. In return they would be
willing to risk a Warsaw Pact schism by opening their border to the
East Germans.
   Hungary has been aiming for an associate membership in the EEC, a
step that would represent a milestone for any Eastern European
country. And the country is still basking in the glow of President
Bush's visit in July.
   Now, Hungary appears to be winning its gamble in breaking a
20-year-old agreement with East Germany to prevent such escapes.
   ``We will not forget this demonstration of humaneness,' Kohl told
reporters Sunday evening, hours before the refugees started pouring
into Bavaria.
   Kohl also told nationwide television that West Germany, which has
been rushing to establish greater business ties in Eastern Europe,
will give full backing to the economic reforms in Hungary.
   Not surprisingly, Hungary has been reaping approval in Poland,
the other Soviet bloc nation that's rushing toward Western-style
economic and political systems.
   Foreign Minister Horn is candid about the risks, however.
   ``There is a danger of Hungary becoming isolated in Eastern
Europe as some of the things Hungary is doing irritate our neighbors
and allies,'' he told Hungarian Radio on Aug. 29. ``Altering our
approach, however, would mean curtailing our freedom of action.''
   East Germany publicly has been about as vitriolic as a country
can be toward an ally, calling Hungary's move ``organized
provocation.''
   But Hungary deftly exploited the leadership vacuum caused by East
German leader Erich Honecker's prolonged recovery from gall bladder
surgery. Even Communist Party functionaries are comparing East
Germany to ``a ship without a captain.''
   Late Monday, Prague Radio said Hungary's decision may call into
question ``the future fate'' of other agreements within the Warsaw
Pact countries.
   Significantly, Soviet Politburo hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev
visited East Berlin on Tuesday to discuss the refugee situation _
rather than travel to Budapest to tell the Hungarians to get back in
line.
   Still, the Soviets also have publicly denounced Budapest's
decision.
   The official news agency Tass on Monday criticized what it called
a ``tendentious campaign'' in the West to encourage citizens to
leave East Germany. Tass said the campaign and ``propaganda
hullabaloo'' were conducted to pressure East Germany.
   East Germany ``is an inalienable part of the Warsaw Treaty,''
Tass said, also calling the country ``our true friend and ally.''
   But, as Hungary is showing, there are ever increasingly large
cracks in the alliance that once resorted to tanks to crush dissent
within the ranks.

   There's a certain kind of bar in the tough part
of town, any town, where business goes on pretty much as usual no
matter what happens. If a couple regulars don't show up, no one pays

   Death dropped in at the Blue Banjo one
Sunday, and nobody even noticed.
   Richard O'Bennick and Frank Woodworth lay by the back steps for
more than six hours on a 90-degree day before anyone realized they
weren't asleep.
   Two nights later, the jukebox blared a Johnny Cash song about a
Dallas bordello. A haggard group of men lounged in the alley behind
the Blue Banjo, talking and sharing a jug. On the sidewalk out front
drug deals went down.
   Business as usual.
   Inside, a couple of Mexican farmworkers played pool on a ragged
blue-slate table. A half-dozen men sat at barstools, laughing once
in a while and trading jokes with the bartender.
   A blonde woman with a bandage wrapped around her hand and missing
a front tooth danced a little as she walked from the jukebox to her
table. A man strutted behind her, mimicking. She turned and swiped
him on the shoulder. They laughed.
   O'Bennick and Woodworth used to come in, when they had cash.
   ``They certainly take these fellows' money readily enough and
give them alcohol. They're friends as long as they have money,''
said Roger Phillips, who runs the 100-bed Union Gospel Mission.
   Robert MacLemore, a kitchen worker across town at the Blue Ox
restaurant and O'Bennick's sometime drinking buddy, took a seat at
the orange formica-topped bar. ``He would go up and try to bum for
money, and I got to know him. He would always be glad to see me
coming. He knew I always had money on me, you see.''
   MacLemore last saw O'Bennick the Wednesday before he died, and
gave him all of his bus fare so the transient could buy a quart of
beer. MacLemore walked to work. O'Bennick ``was a nice person, he
really was. But he was lonely. He had something down inside of him
that was eating him away,'' he said.
   O'Bennick ``had a lot of good in him,'' said Phillips, whose
mission was the dead men's last address. He ``always carried a
trombone around and talked about playing it,'' though Phillips never
actually saw him blow a note.
   MacLemore remembered Woodworth as a quiet, heavy-set man who
walked around on crutches and loved to drink wine. ``He was older.
Well, he looked old, but he wasn't as old as I am. He was in his
late 40s, maybe early 50s.''
   After two autopsies and tests for poison, the cause of
O'Bennick's and Woodworth's deaths on Aug. 6 remains a mystery. The
men's bodies sat in the late-summer heat, a jug of Almaden Blush
Chablis between them, long enough to start decomposing before
anybody knew they were dead.
   Yakima County Coroner Leonard Birkenbine wasn't surprised. ``You
go down there, there's always somebody lying down like that.''
   The tavern, with a blue neon sign that's read ``lue Banjo'' as
long as anyone could remember, is in the tough section of Yakima, a
central Washington town of 50,000 that is best known for apples,
cherries and vineyards but is fast developing a reputation as a
rural drug center.
   In a block wedged between a residential district and a restaurant
strip are the Blue Banjo, another tavern and a long-vacant building
with barred doors.
   ``We did have an extensive problem some time ago down there,''
said police Capt. Don Blesio. ``For the most part the problem has
been reduced considerably, but we're suffering from the cocaine and
heroin problems that exist.''
   ``It's tough there, it really is,'' MacLemore said. ``You can get
hurt there. You can get killed there.''
   Bob Briggs, who said he was released from the Washington state
penitentiary in Walla Walla that day after serving eight years for
burglary and auto theft, watched the Blue Banjo scene from the
corner barstool.
   ``I asked where the toughest place in town was, and they told me
the Blue Banjo. So I figured I'd better come try it out,'' he said.
``It couldn't be any tougher than Walla Walla.''
   The bar is a popular spot. Patrons wander in, some for draft beer
at 50 cents a glass, some for the two-for-a-quarter cigarettes. In a
cubbyhole behind the bar two shelves are filled with fortified wines
like Thunderbird, MD 20-20 and jugs of White Port, O'Bennick's
favorite.
   While MacLemore and others talked about O'Bennick and Woodworth,
a young woman walked in and ordered a beer. The bartender asked for
identification and instead of producing a driver's license, she
lifted her shirt and exposed her breasts. She was kicked out.
   ``We get that all the time,'' said the bartender, a burly man
with a gravelly voice who asked that his name not be used. ``I've
got to kick her out or the cops would bust me for promoting
prostitution.''
   Two men staggered in and tried to order beer. They were kicked
out, too.
   ``He was like that,'' the bartender said of O'Bennick as they
lurched out.
   The cash register rang almost constantly after the bartender gave
last call at 11:45 p.m. MacLemore downed one for the road and walked
out through the shifting crowd outside.
   ``Coke? Coca?'' two men asked, making little sniffing motions.
   MacLemore ignored them and walked to the back of the building,
where a lone man rummaged through a trash bin. The homeless
jug-sharers had left. The spot where O'Bennick and Woodworth died
was empty.

<HEAD>Canadians Protest Planned 9 Percent Sales Tax</HEAD>

   The federal government's plan for a 9-percent
sales tax is bringing more than the usual number of protests from
the Canadian grassroots. Some analysts say the tax could cause
tremendous upheaval in the economy.
   ``There has to be a better solution,'' said Gus Karagianis, who
has a placard outside his Fruit King produce stand inviting
passersby to sign a tax-revolt petition.
   He showed off about 3,200 signatures he said he had gathered in
three weeks.
   ``Being a storeowner I'm capable of voicing my opinion,'' he
said. ``Regardless of whether it does any good or not, just voice
your opinion.''
   Petitions, some of them sponsored by newspapers, telephone hot
lines, the inevitable slogan T-shirts and buttons and even a tax
protest song have sprung up since Finance Minister Michael Wilson
announced the details in August of the proposed goods and services
tax that would take effect in 1991.
   The tax would replace an existing, hidden 13.5-percent
manufacturers sales tax that the government says damages the
Canadian economy's ability to compete. The current tax, for example,
applies only to goods manufactured domestically and not to imports.
   Wilson said the new tax would be ``revenue neutral'' for the
government as compared to the current system but would raise the
consumer price index by 2.25 percent in 1991.
   The new tax would be felt by consumers for many goods and
services not now covered, from new houses to restaurant meals and
even postage stamps.
   Basic groceries, virtually all of the items sold in Karagianis'
store, would not be affected, but the 33-year-old shopkeeper said he
believes that any measure that cuts into consumers' spending power
ultimately hurts his business.
   ``You can only tighten the belt so much,'' he said.
   Basic groceries, prescription drugs, health and dental care,
educational services, day care and legal aid would be among the few
categories left untouched by the new tax.
   The Edmonton Sun newspaper in the Western province of Alberta
said it has gathered from readers more than 15,000 tax-protest
coupons addressed to Wilson. ``There are a number of individuals and
organizations who started petitions,'' Managing Editor Randy
McDonald said. ``It's been more of a grassroots thing.''
   Taxes traditionally have been higher in Canada than in the United
States.
   McDonald said tax freedom day, when citizens can stop thinking
that their money is going to the government, already is calculated
for Albertans as July 15 or 16. It was May 4 this year in the United
States.
   ``I think it's just a matter of enough's enough,'' McDonald said.
   The Toronto Sun, the Edmonton's Sun's sister newspaper in
Canada's largest city, said it has taken in 138,000 tax-protest
coupons so far.
   No central place has tabulated the number of Canadians signing
petitions or expressing opposition to the tax plan in other ways.
   But critics of the plan say they hope that evidence of
widespread, visible discontent will persuade the government to alter
or scrap the plan. They note that it won't take effect until 1991,
when the next national election will be on the horizon and unpopular
measures might be harder to take.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party is
in the first year of its second consecutive majority term. Another
election will not have to be called for at least three years.
   ``We are bringing in the new goods and services tax not because
it is easy but because it is right,'' Mulroney told his party's
recent convention.
   Wood Gundy Inc., a prominent investments firm, said in its highly
publicized analysis of the tax plan that the inflationary impact
would lead to higher interest rates and add to the federal budget
deficit.
   It said the Bank of Canada probably would use tight money policy
to control price pressures and that unemployment would rise as a
result, possibly to 10 percent from its current level of 7.5 percent.
   Burns Fry Ltd. said the government should call the proposed tax
``deficit neutral'' rather than ``revenue neutral,'' as Wilson
characterized it.
   The new tax would take in $4.7 billion ($5.5 billion Canadian)
more than is currently received, but the funds would go out for
refundable tax credits for those with income less than $25,500
($30,000 Canadian), which would lower the middle-income tax rate
from 26 percent to 25 percent and pay for administrative costs.
   The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto said in an editorial:
``Both on the visibility and the impact of the tax, the federal
government's projections and hopes appear unrealistic and naive,
asking retailers, consumers and workers to let the system work by
being reasonable.''

<HEAD>Another Battle Colombia Faces: The Coffee War</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's cocaine war has called
attention to another battle _ the coffee war.
   Colombia blames the United States for a nosedive in the price of
coffee, which brought Colombia almost $1.5 billion last year and is
the South American nation's top foreign exchange earner.
   Government officials here complain that what Washington giveth
with one hand _ such as military aid to fight drug traffickers _ the
other hand taketh away, in coffee revenue.
   That is money that could be used for fighting drugs.
   Specifically, Colombia says the United States is to blame for the
collapse of a 74-nation agreement between coffee exporters and
importers that set export quotas and assured Colombians of decent
earnings.
   In July, talks broke down after months of debate among the
members of the International Coffee Accord to renew the agreement.
   The member countries, including suppliers and purchasers,
negotiate prices for one year. The trouble was that some coffee
producers in the pact were selling at cheap prices to non-members,
U.S. officials said.
   The United States said it would not support a new agreement until
it had guarantees that purchasing countries outside the agreement
would not get coffee for less than countries inside the pact.
   A 50 percent drop in coffee prices _ to about 88 cents per pound
_ is the worst slump since the late 1920s. Colombia could lose $200
million in coffee revenue this year.
   In a letter to President Bush, Colombian President Virgilio Barco
said the lack of a new agreement setting export quotas will have
``devastating consequences'' on the Colombian economy.
   ``This is a grave crisis and requires immediate attention,''
Barco told Bush.
   What neither Barco nor any other Colombian official will comment
on is whether slumping cocaine sales also might have devastating
consequences on the economy.
   Since drug trafficking and its earnings are secret by nature, no
one knows to what extent Colombia's economy depends on the cocaine
trade.
   Studies by universities and other independent sources give widely
varying figures. Some say drug money contributes 1.5 percent to 3
percent of the nation's gross national product.
   If the figure is 3 percent, that would be just over $1 billion a
year Colombia would lose if drug traffickers were driven out.
   The nation has launched a vigorous crackdown on the drug trade
since the assassination Aug. 18 of leading presidential candidate
Luis Carlos Galan.
   After three weeks of the crackdown, the Colombian armed forces
have seized more than $200 million in property from drug traffickers.
   Drug barons' investments in real estate in Colombia the last six
years have been as high as $5.5 billion, according to a story this
year in the Bogota daily El Tiempo.
   But unlike coffee earnings, the drug trafficking money that
enters the economy does not generate jobs.
   A U.S. narcotics official in Bogota said recently that the
crackdown on drugs has cut back cocaine shipments substantially, but
he had no idea exactly how much.
   ``Twenty percent, 50 percent? I don't know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Polish- and Jewish-American Groups Call for Removal of Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Polish-American and Jewish-American
groups are calling for a return to a 1987 agreement to move a Roman
Catholic convent from the site of the Auschwitz death camp.
   ``The continuing issue over the Carmelite convent has escalated
in some quarters, causing deep anguish to the point that it both
breeds unnecessary hostility and makes a solution more difficult to
achieve,'' the leaders said in a statement Tuesday.
   It was signed by Edward Moskal, president of the Polish American
Congress; Ira Silverman, executive vice president of the American
Jewish Committee; and Harold Gales and the Rev. Leonard Chrobot,
co-chairmen of the National Polish-American Jewish-American Council.
   The convent just outside the Auschwitz concentration camp is seen
by many Jews and others as an intrusion of Christian symbols at a
place where 2.5 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during World
War II.
   A 1987 accord between Jewish and Roman Catholic representatives
stipulated the convent should be moved by Feb. 22, but the deadline
passed and the convent remained. The Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, has termed the accord ``offensive.''
   The signers of Tuesday's statement called for a return to the
1987 agreement that recognizes both ``the Nazi aim of destroying the
Jewish people in a unique, unthinkable and unspeakable enterprise''
as well as ``the martyrdom of the Polish people during the
totalitarian horror throughout the war of 1939-1945.''
   The statement said the suffering of Poles and ``the murder of
Polish Catholics at Auschwitz has not been adequately recognized or
appreciated.'' An estimated 1.5 million Christians were killed at
Auschwitz.
   At the same time, it said, ``Jewish Americans believe that the
uniqueness of the mass murder of Jews at Auschwitz has not been
understood or appreciated by non-Jews.''

   Prospects for a peaceful settlement
of Ethiopia's 28-year-old civil war ``appear to be dim,'' President
Mengistu Haile Mariam said Tuesday.
   Speaking at a rally marking the 15th anniversary of the Ethiopian
revolution, Mengistu said ``no positive indications'' have emerged
from preliminary peace talks in Atlanta.
   Ethiopian officials are meeting in Atlanta with leaders of the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front in an attempt to map a plan for
more substantive talks. The negotiations are being guided by former
President Carter.
   ``The latest indications from Atlanta are that the opposition
group is not interested in a peaceful solution of the conflict,''
Mengistu said.
   The president said the Eritrean Front ``appears to be
intransigent and adamant on its demands.''
   Mengistu did not elaborate, but in the past the Eritrean Front
has demanded the people of Eritrea be allowed to vote on whether
they want independence, federation with Ethiopia or autonomy.
   The government, which has proposed a greater measure of autonomy
for its northernmost province, has unequivocally ruled out any
referendum.
   Mengistu's assessment of the talks was far more pessimistic than
one given to reporters Sunday by Isaias Afwerki, the head of the
rebel delegation in Atlanta.
   Afwerki said the Eritreans ``have reason to believe they are
getting close to a solution,'' but acknowledged that several points
of contention were prolonging the talks.
   Mengistu's 35-minute speech was one of the shortest he has
delivered on Revolution Day, which marks the anniversary of the
overthrow of the late Emperor Haile Selassie.

   Wanted: Teacher-principal, versed in all
subjects, good at one-on-one instruction. Must like seclusion.
   The island town off Cape Cod is looking for the right person to
run its one-room, one-pupil elementary school.
   ``You kind of have to be a jack-of-all-trades,'' said Berkeley
School Superintendent Russell F. Latham, whose district includes
Gosnold. ``You're even sort of a part-time custodian.''
   Gosnold is the only town on Cuttyhunk island, a 3-by-2-mile
expanse that lies about 15 miles off the mainland and about 10 miles
west of Martha's Vineyard. Though a popular tourist spot in summer,
Cuttyhunk has only about 50 year-round residents.
   Back in the 1930s, as many as 17 students were enrolled in
Gosnold's century-old schoolhouse. But more and more families have
moved. This year, like last, only one youngster is in school.
   ``He's a neat kid, he's in seventh grade and we need a certified
teacher to teach him,'' Latham said. The previous teacher resigned
over the summer.
   ``She was a youngish woman. I guess she decided she had enough
time being on the island.''
   Depending on experience, the new teacher will earn an annual
salary of $20,000 to $25,000, he said. Three finalists will be
interviewed Friday and school officials hope a teacher will start
work next week.
   Whoever is hired ``should understand a little bit about island
life and have an interest in being on the island nine months a
year,'' Latham said.
   For starters, there's only one telephone: a pay phone at the
general store. And there's the Cuttyhunk winter. A ferry to the
mainland runs only on Tuesdays and Fridays in the winter, and a
seaplane that makes regular flights during the rest of the year
doesn't fly when there is ice, Latham said.
   The town has an inn-restaurant, a bakery and deli-style sandwich
shop, and of course, a general store. Beyond that, there are town
offices, the library, the docks, the school _ and not a whole lot
more.
   People who can't live without malls, movie theaters and cocktail
lounges _ Gosnold is a dry town _ would do best to look elsewhere,
Latham said.

   An immigrant who fled Afghanistan by
camel after the Soviet invasion in 1979 can ride in true style after
winning $4.3 million in the state lottery.
   Mohammad Zahir, 51, who works in Jacksonville as an automobile
technician, will receive 20 annual installments of $218,000 for
holding one of three winning tickets in the Sept. 2 lottery, which
had a $13 million jackpot.
   Zahir, who didn't discover he had won until returning home from a
trip to visit relatives in New York, said he enjoys his job and
plans to continue working.
   He also told lottery officials Tuesday he will use part of his
winnings to buy a house and travel. Zahir and his wife, Latifa, have
two grown sons _ both electrical engineers in Jacksonville _ and a
daughter who is a student at Jacksonville University.
   It wasn't the first time Zahir won a lottery game. When he lived
in Afghanistan, he once won five cans of vegetable oil, 150 pounds
of rice and some fabric, he said.
   The other lottery winners turned in their tickets earlier.

   The Duchess of York and Prince Andrew are expecting
a baby that would be their second child and the sixth grandchild of
Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, who is due in March and whose first baby was
born 13 months ago.
   The red-haired duchess known as ``Fergie,'' who will be 30 on
Oct. 15, spoke at a literary luncheon Tuesday hours after the formal
announcement by Buckingham Palace. Her husband, also 29, was on duty
as a Royal Navy lieutenant at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted,'' the duchess said. ``We are absolutely
ecstatic.''
   Television personality David Frost announced the pregnancy to the
300 guests at the luncheon honoring the duchess as the author of two
children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   If the baby is a boy, the British order of succession will put
him ahead of his sister as the fifth in line to the throne, after
Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince Andrew.

University of Pacific's new Pantheon of the Arts.
   Actor Burgess Meredith, a longtime friend of Brubeck's, will be
master of ceremonies for the induction at the independent,

   Brubeck will show his appreciation by presenting a concert Friday
evening with the Stockton Symphony in this city 75 miles east of San
Francisco. Proceeds will go toward a Conservatory of Music-Stockton
Symphony string scholarship.
   Brubeck attended then-College of the Pacific with plans to become

found Brubeck rewriting melodies that wafted through the windows
from the music conservatory that he suggested his young charge
``just go over there.''
   Brubeck did, graduating in 1942 as a music major and going on to
pioneer a style called progressive jazz with compositions such as

   Most 59-year-old women would be content to have
their doctor tell them they look good. But not Mitzi Gaynor.
   ``What do you mean good? Whatever happened to sensational? What's

   The exuberant entertainer was pronounced looking good by a doctor
who examined her before she left on a lengthy tour as star of the
Cole Porter musical ``Anything Goes.''
   She disagreed with the diagnosis after she peeked over his

   Miss Gaynor has appeared in 17 movies, including the film

   Actor Donald Sutherland, who plays a South African
teacher in the film ``A Dry White Season,'' said a movie with a
powerful anti-apartheid message may inflame enough people to take
action.
   ``South Africa is a country that does not care what people in the
rest of the world think,'' Sutherland said Monday at the Toronto
Festival of Festivals.
   ``A Dry White Season,'' which was favorably received by audiences
and critics in its world premiere at the festival, shows how a
once-passive Sutherland responds to a series of revolting events.
   Also in the film are Marlon Brando, who plays a human rights
attorney, and South African actor Zakes Mokae.
   The movie has graphic scenes of police violence and torture in
South Africa. Its producers say it was difficult to get the film
made because some studios shy away from making films with political
messages.
   ``I believe that films can have an effect on social change,''
said director Euzhan Palcy. ``Any little thing can help.'' Palcy
adapted the film from a novel by South African author Andre Brink.
   MGM is slated to release ``A Dry White Season'' in select markets
Sept. 20 before a wider market release.

   Fred Bush has withdrawn himself from
consideration as ambassador to Luxembourg, an administration
official said Tuesday night.
   Bush, no relation to the president, thus became the first
political casualty of the housing influence-peddling scandals.
   Fred Bush earned large fees as a consultant to developers who
hired him to help win approval for their projects by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   He was an aide to George Bush as vice president and chief fund
raiser for the president's successful 1988 campaign.
   His nomination as ambassador languished in the Senate, however,
and in a rare move generally interpreted as indicating the chances
of confirmation were between nil and nothing, the Senate sent the
nomination back to the White House just before the August recess.
   ``It became obvious it wasn't going to be worth the pain and he
withdrew his name,'' said the administration official, who spoke on
condition that he not be identified.
   The official said President Bush had not decided whom to nominate
in Fred Bush's place, or what if any other job to offer him.

   For more than a decade, Edward I. Koch led New
York with a brash, often combative style. When he faced his last
hurrah on Tuesday, he accepted defeat graciously and called his
years in office ``glorious.''
   With his loss to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins in the
Democratic primary, the 64-year-old mayor was denied his goal of
becoming the first four-term mayor in the city's history.
   ``I have had 12 glorious years as mayor,'' Koch declared in his
concession speech. Urging his supporters not to feel sorry for him,
he said ``Believe me, there is a life after the mayoralty.''
   Traditionally, New York's mayor is a national political figure.
But Koch _ with his smart-aleck remarks, his eye for the television
cameras, his zest for his office _ became a worldwide celebrity.
   He wrote a bestseller, ``Mayor,'' and two other books. He
appeared on ``Saturday Night Live.'' He was interviewed in Playboy.
   And he was quoted, ad infinitum. Jimmy Carter's brother, Billy,
was ``a wacko.'' Developer Donald Trump was ``piggy, piggy, piggy.''
Jews would ``have to be crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson.
   That nasal, feisty voice was unknown to most New Yorkers when
Koch ran for mayor in 1977. His name was recognized by only 6
percent of New Yorkers outside of his congressional district.
   Koch, the Bronx-born son of Polish immigrants, had been active in
liberal Democratic politics; in 1963, he defeated party boss Carmine
DeSapio in a race for district leader. He was elected to the City
Council in 1966 and to Congress from Manhattan's Silk Stocking
district in 1968.
   A 1973 campaign for mayor foundered after 45 days for lack of
money, and 1977 did not look much more encouraging: he faced seven
other candidates, including the incumbent, Abe Beame, and the
flamboyant Bella Abzug.
   In the summer of the Son of Sam murders, Koch pounded away at one
issue _ the death penalty. His ads were created by media wizard
David Garth. And he often was seen arm-in-arm with former Miss
America Bess Myerson.
   Coming from nowhere, Koch was the top vote-getter in the primary.
In a runoff, he defeated New York's secretary of state, Mario Cuomo;
in November, he beat Cuomo (who was the Liberal nominee) and two
others.
   In 1981 and 1985, he would win re-election handily, garnering
three-quarters of the vote each time. His only setback was in 1982,
when he lost to Cuomo in a bid for governor of New York.
   Koch was credited with helping the city emerge from its fiscal
crisis of the 1970s. Under his guidance _ and the stern eye of state
watchdogs _ a spendthrift city tightened its belt.
   But in his third term, Koch was besieged by troubles. The suicide
of Queens Borough President Donald Manes heralded a series of
scandals that never stopped. A patronage operation was found to be
operating in the basement of City Hall. Myerson was tried (and
acquitted) on charges she conspired to fix the divorce case of her
lover, Carl Capasso.
   Koch was accused of racial insensitivity when blacks were killed
in altercations with white gangs in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst _
the latter incident occurring weeks prior to Tuesday's primary.
   Problems that were not at issue when Koch was first elected _
crack, AIDS, homelessness _ plagued the city. The mayor's ratings
plunged to under 30 percent. But he fought back, closing Dinkins'
lead.
   ``I've had 12 wonderful years and expect to have four more,''
Koch said early in the day on Tuesday. ``But I have had a
professional life that everybody could envy. I've enjoyed _ with the
pain, occasionally _ every day.''

   Mayor Coleman Young easily outpolled 12 primary
challengers Tuesday and will seek an unprecedented fifth term in a
November runoff against accountant Tom Barrow, who defeated Rep.
John Conyers for the No. 2 spot.
   With 306 of 921 precincts reporting, Young had 31,361 votes, or
48 percent, to 17,281, or 26 percent, for Barrow. Conyers had
10,647, or 16 percent. The other 10 candidates shared the remainder.
   Conyers and Young had been considered the challengers most likely
to advance to the head-to-head Nov. 7 runoff with Young.
   Early voter turnout in the non-partisan election was nearly twice
as heavy as four years ago, apparently reflecting the lively
campaigns waged by some of Young's opponents.
   Election officials predicted that slightly more than 30 percent
of the city's 507,000 registered voters would vote in the nation's
sixth-largest city.
   Young, 71, didn't vote Tuesday, having already cast an absentee
ballot under an option available to senior citizens. Conyers and
Barrow each had an entourage of supporters in tow when they cast
ballots early in the day.

   Young, Detroit's first black mayor, largely steered clear of his
opponents during the primary campaign. Barrow and Conyers said he'd
been in office too long and favored downtown development ahead of
neighborhood services.
   Young rarely returned fire. Instead, he used some of his
estimated $5 million in campaign funds for television and radio
commercials focusing on his 15 years in office. Actor James Earl
Jones narrated several ads over a background of soft blues music.
   Neither of the city's two major daily newspapers endorsed the
mayor. The Detroit News endorsed Barrow and the Detroit Free Press
supported Conyers. Each charged that Young had led a closed
administration and said the mayor's office needed a change.
   Young seemingly anticipated the attacks. When he announced his
bid for a fifth term in May, the mayor said his principal opponent
was the news media, which he said had been out to get him for years.
   His anger was especially piqued by front-page headlines about a
paternity lawsuit filed against him by a former city employee. Young
at first denied and then admitted that he was the father of the
woman's 6-year-old child.

   Political newcomer Mike Dow unseated Mayor
Arthur Outlaw in a bitter mayoral runoff in Alabama's second-largest
city.
   With all votes counted Tuesday night, Dow had 30,444 votes, or 56
percent, to 23,715, or 44 percent, for Outlaw, who is chairman of
the state Republican Party, in the non-partisan race.
   ``What I hope we can accomplish is to keep the people of Mobile
this excited about this city,'' Dow, 42, told several hundred
cheering supporters in his victory speech.
   In conceding, Outlaw, a 63-year-old executive, told supporters,
``I'm not happy about it and I'm not going to lie to you about
that.''
   Dow, who did not declare a party affiliation, had challenged
Outlaw's leadership, particularly his drive for a proposed $40
million waterfront convention center without first seeking voter
approval.
   Although the race was described as non-partisan, some viewed it
as an early test of Republican Gov. Guy Hunt's strength for a 1990
re-election. The Mobile area went heavily for Hunt in 1986 and is
considered GOP territory. Some of Dow's key supporters were aligned
with Attorney General Don Siegelman, who is considered one of Hunt's
potential Democratic opponents.
   In the Aug. 22 general election, 42,272 voters cast ballots for
seven candidates, giving Dow a 1,000-vote edge over Outlaw and
forcing the runoff.

   The judge weighing an unprecedented
divorce custody case over seven frozen embryos is getting plenty of
unsolicited advice, including holding a lottery for the eggs.
   Cards and letters from self-proclaimed prophets and from a woman
identifying herself the ``Queen of the South'' among others have
offered suggestions to Circuit Judge W. Dale Young on how he might
rule.
   ``The right answer is somewhere in there, I'm sure,'' said Young,
who intends to announce his decision Sept. 21 in the court battle
between Junior Lewis Davis and his estranged wife, Mary Sue Davis,
over the fertilized eggs.
   Young said his ruling will be based strictly on the evidence he
heard in his Maryville courtroom in August and from documents
submitted in the case.
   The cards and letters nevertheless have offered him some welcome
relief from writing the decision, he said.
   The woman who dubbed herself a queen predicted in her letter to
Young: ``You will find for man.'' She added: ``A egg is a egg until
it is hatched.''
   Although the case has stirred debate among medical and legal
professionals, a man from Albuquerque, N.M., thinks the outcome
could be ``simple and logical.''
   He said the judge should bring the parties into court and hold a
lottery, deciding by a coin toss whether Junior Davis or Mary Sue
Davis would get the first chance to dra numbered pingpong balls
corresponding to each of the eggs from a large glass jar.
   ``Do not try to define the meaning of life,'' the man said in
suggesting Young limit his decision to one, double-spaced page. ``If
you try, there will be confusion and chaos.''
   Another writer recommended the couple divide the eggs between
them and ``let God decide if the eggs she gets become fertile and
she produces an offspring.''
   A person describing himself as a street preacher sent Young
several postcards urging the judge to make the eggs ``wards of the
state.''
   Meanwhile, a nurse from India living in New York City pleaded
with Young to give her the eggs if he decided Mrs. Davis could not
have them. ``I need those desperately as I want to be a mother,''
the woman wrote.
   Young also has received a gift of empathy from Maryville native
Fred Profitt _ a jar of caviar.
   Profitt said he wanted Young to have some ``uncontested eggs.''

   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins toppled
three-term Mayor Edward I. Koch in a Democratic primary Tuesday,
taking a major step toward becoming the first black mayor of
America's largest city.
   In the Republican race, former federal prosecutor Rudolph
Giuliani overwhelmed cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder.
   With all 5,244 precincts reporting, Dinkins, the Manhattan
borough president, had 537,313 votes, or 51 percent, to 445,816, or
42 percent, for Koch, who lost his bid for an unprecedented fourth
term.
   ``He won the race, and he won it fairly, squarely,'' Koch said in
his concession speech shortly after 11:15 p.m.
   The other two Democratic candidates, former transit chief Richard
Ravitch and Comptroller Harrison Goldin, trailed far behind with
48,289 votes, or 4 percent, and 28,790 votes, or 3 percent,
respectively.
   Three television stations, citing exit polls, had projected
Dinkins would win. WCBS-TV said Dinkins was winning 97 percent of
the black vote and as much as 33 percent of the white vote.
   Giuliani had 75,720 votes, or 67 percent, to 36,905, or 33
percent, for Lauder.
   The former U.S. attorney claimed victory and told cheering
supporters: ``I intend to go on and win in November.''
   Giuliani was popular as a prosecutor, and strategists said he
could mount a serious challenge in the Nov. 7 general election,
despite a 5-1 Democratic edge in voter enrollment.
   Lauder spent a record $12 million on the race, most of it his own
money and much of it for negative television ads.
   Dinkins, 62, and Koch, 64, coaxed voters to the polls earlier in
the day.
   ``Come out and vote,'' Koch said at City Hall. ``There's only one
election, and that's the Democratic primary,'' he said, referring to
the conventional wisdom that the primary winner usually wins in
November.
   Dinkins jokingly politicked for his last vote as his wife stepped
into the voting booth at their Manhattan apartment building.
   ``Joyce, don't forget,'' he said. ``You promised to vote for me.''
   Voters cast ballots in dozens of other races, including the
citywide post of comptroller, City Council seats and judgeships.

   The Democratic race was largely a referendum on Koch, the
ebullient and outspoken mayor who has dominated city politics for
more than a decade. First elected in 1977, he won re-election by
enormous margins in 1981 and 1985.
   Koch quickly rose to national prominence, his brash manner
personifying the quintessential New Yorker. But corruption scandals
erupted in his third term, crime, crack and homelessness soared, and
his popularity dived.
   Koch's backing rose during the summer, partly because of an
aggressive television advertising campaign focusing on his
experience, and partly as voters considered and rejected alternative
choices, particularly Goldin.
   Yet Dinkins' support held steady. Formal, deliberate and
understated, he campaigned as the candidate who could heal New
York's social divisions, schisms that Koch often was accused of
worsening.
   Dinkins' message gained sudden currency late in the campaign,
when the slaying of a black teen-ager by a white gang in Brooklyn
worsened simmering racial tensions.
   Dinkins repeatedly said the killing had exposed an undercurrent
of hatred that had gone unaddressed during the Koch years. In
addition, Koch was criticized for suggesting that marches protesting
the killing could make things worse.
   The issue appeared to energize Dinkins supporters, especially in
the black community. So did appearances for Dinkins late in the
campaign by Jesse Jackson, whom Koch opposed in last year's
Democratic presidential primary. Dinkins also had help from the
city's largest unions.
   Ravitch, 56, and Goldin, 53, were unable to catch voters'
imagination, and languished far back in the polls throughout the
campaign.
   In the GOP race, Lauder never showed substantial support in the
polls. But he attacked relentlessly, producing a barrage of
television ads suggesting Giuliani was too liberal.
   Giuliani focused on the Democrats, particularly Koch, and on
crime, saying he was best equipped to make the streets safe again.
He gained fame as U.S. attorney in Manhattan from 1983 until
January, leading high-profile prosecutions of corrupt municipal
officials, Mafiosi and Wall Street cheats.
   But Giuliani, who never has held elective office, was a stumbling
campaigner in the summer.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Make Biggest Bust Since Bush Crackdown</HEAD>

   Federal agents made the largest cocaine seizure
since President Bush announced his crackdown on drug trafficking,
capturing 2,700 pound of cocaine, a freighter and four other boats.
   The seizure capped a one-year undercover investigation that
tracked a shipment of cocaine from Aruba to the Bahamas.
   Near the Bahamas, a U.S. Coast Guard jet spotted the freighter
and a patrol boat fired dozens of warning shots to capture a
speedboat, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced
Tuesday.
   ``This is a textbook example of what the taxpayers can expect
from a coordinated drug enforcement effort,'' said Tom Cash, special
agent in charge of Miami's DEA office.
   Officials from the Coast Guard, DEA, the Customs Service and
local police participated in the bust, which netted 17 suspects and
cocaine with an estimated street value of $50 million.
   The cocaine is believed to have originated in Medellin, Colombia.
It was loaded onto the freighter Nerma on Aruba, an isalnd off
northern Venezuela, officials said.
   The drug organization supervising the smuggling was based in
Miami and had been under investigation for a year, officials said.
More arrests were expected.
   The 236-foot freighter, the ``mother ship'' of the operation, was
spotted Saturday night near the Bahamas by a Coast Guard
surveillance airplane, authorities said.
   Early Sunday, Customs and Coast Guard officers saw four
speedboats approach the Nerma as the freighter's crew prepared to
unload bales and barrels of cocaine, authorities said.
   After the speedboats met up with a 42-foot fishing boat, a Coast
Guard patrol boat chased one of the speedboats for 22 minutes and
fired 43 warning shots to stop the boat.
   On Monday morning, authorities seized the Nerma and two other
speedboats and recovered a total of 1,172 pounds of cocaine,
authorities said. Fifteen bales of cocaine were floating in the
water near the Nerma.
   An additional 1,540 pounds was confiscated when the fishing boat,
the J.J. Lorick, was seized late Monday at a marina on the Miami
River, authorities said.
   DEA officials believe the cocaine was already ``in the pipeline''
to this country before the Aug. 18 assasination of Colombian
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, which prompted a drug
crackdown in the South American country. Bush announced his battle
against drugs Sept. 5.
   Cash said the bust ``is indicative of the magnitude of the
pipeline.''
   The Nerma's seven Danish crew members were arrested and ordered
held without bond Monday.
   Six other men were arrested aboard the three captured speedboats,
and four more were arrested near the Lorick, including one man
suspected of being the owner of the freighter, Cash said.
   Six of the defendants appeared before a U.S. magistrate. One was
ordered held on $200,000 bond and two were held on $75,000 bond. The
others were ordered held in pretrial detention.
   All 17 defendants face federal charges of possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute.

   A state inspector declared there was no
imminent danger of an earthen dam failing at the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant and causing contamination of suburban water supplies.
   The state Office of Emergency Preparedness on Tuesday canceled an
alert it issued earlier in the day at the plant, which manufactures
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 15 miles northwest of Denver.
   The U.S. Department of Energy, which owns the plant, had
expressed concern about the dam when heavy rainfall filled Holding
Pond C2 to 75 percent of capacity. DOE officials asked the state
Department of Health for permission to release some water without
treating it.
   The health officials refused, saying the pond contains the
herbicide atrazine, a possible carcinogen. The officials said
radiation in the pond was measurable but comparable with other water
sources around the state.

   One of China's most wanted dissident
intellectuals, the author of the controversial ``River Elegy''
television series, has escaped China and says the many people who
aided him are all in ``extreme danger.''
   ``I've been living in terror for the past 100 days,'' journalist
Su Xiaokang said in an interview 100 days after Chinese troops
opened fire on unarmed citizens in Beijing crushing a movement for
freedom.
   ``A lot of my friends have been arrested, a lot. I haven't seen
my wife or my little boy since the massacre. The pressure on me has
been intense.''
   Su said he left China about 10 days ago with several other
dissidents also wanted by the Beijing government.
   His escape contradicts recent reports in Chinese-language
newspapers that the ``underground railroad'' to help dissidents and
students has been cut.
   One activist who helped arrange Su's flight said Chinese security
forces ``have not been able to shut the operation down.''
   So far, the activist said, more than 55 dissidents and student
participants in the movement for freedom have fled China, among them
student leader Wu'er Kaixi, political scientist Yan Jiaqi and
Marxist theoretician Su Shaozhi.
   Most have either gone or intend to go on the United States or to
France, where Su went today. Some are waiting in Hong Kong for
travel papers.
   Still, Chinese authorities have been successful at crushing
several other smaller ``railroads,'' run by Hong Kong-based
activists and students, arresting several Chinese student leaders
and people helping them escape.
   In the interview Tuesday, Su declined to reveal details of his
flight to freedom: ``I was helped by many, many people and they are
all in extreme danger ... Suffice it to say I was trembling every
day.
   ``My nerves are frayed, completely. It's hard going underground
in a country like China. I felt like there were eyes watching me
everywhere,'' he added. ``People are afraid now, everywhere.''
   Su was active in the Beijing pro-democracy movement. On May 14, a
day after a hunger strike began on Tiananmen Square, he and 11 other
well-known liberal intellectuals, including journalist Dai Qing who
has since been arrested, went to the vast expanse to plead with the
students to leave.
   ``We love you,'' he shouted to the crowd of more than 100,000
people. ``The Chinese government in incompetent and it cannot stop
the tide of history.''
   Since the crackdown, Su's works have frequently been criticized
in the state-run press because they allegedly supported the cause of
purged Communist Party boss Zhao Ziyang, who fell from power for
supporting the student movement. Su's writings have been banned in
China.
   Along with Wu'er Kaixi, Su is by far the widest known escapee.
His six-part ``River Elegy'' television series was shown twice in
China in 1988, reaching hundreds of millions of homes.
   The series criticized the Chinese people's fear of authority.
   As it described the Yellow River, which has changed course many
times in its history killing millions of people, the program
questioned Communist China's turbulent history which has itself left
millions dead.
   The program marked the beginning of an almost year-long thaw in
the arts and political debate. That thaw was frozen over in June
when troops invaded Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Since the crackdown began, ``River Elegy'' has been subjected to
a scathing series of attacks, the most recent of which was published
Tuesday.
   An editorial in the Guangming Daily in August said ``River Elegy
tries to obliterate in one stroke 5,000 years of Chinese
civilization.''
   In a prescient essay written for the May issue of Wenhui Monthly,
Su asked, ``Why is it in China, the losers of a political struggle
are always killed or meet some other such horrible fate. What is it
about our system that creates this kind of misery?''
   In another work, Su wrote a fictionalized account of an important
Communist Party meeting in 1958, giving Chinese their first look
behind the scenes at the machinations of power in Beijing.
   In the interview, Su said he still had hopes for his country but
he did not feel confident about making predictions.
   ``I am very confused right now,'' he said. ``I've been
underground for 100 days and really don't know what is going on in
China. I want to go to France and talk with some friends to get a
better understanding.''
   Intellectual dissidents Chen Yizi and Yan Jiaqi, both of whom
escaped by the ``underground railroad,'' are based in Paris. They
and others have formed several groups to push for democracy in
China. Su's participation will add a calm, studied voice to the
movement.

<HEAD>This is `The House' That Orval Built</HEAD>

   The house stretches the length of a
football field, 14,778 square feet of generation-old controversy
that covers an Ozarks mountaintop like its former baron once
dominated Arkansas politics.
   It is The House that Orval built _ and sold for $318,000 this
year.
   And now the Harrington, Del., couple who bought it have borrowed
some memorabilia from Orval E. Faubus' six gubernatorial terms,
added their own antiques and are planning to develop the 65-acre
property.
   Faubus, 79, tried a decade ago to persuade the state to buy ``The
House'' _ as a promotional booklet refers to the wood-and-stone
edifice on Governor's Hill east of town _ as a historic site.
   Upkeep, taxes and debt service had been a financial drain for
years.
   ``I would have been pleased to spend the rest of my life in the
house, but that was not to be,'' said Faubus, who lives in Conway
with his third wife, Jan.
   Faubus said he had $18,678.97 left from the sale, after paying
banks in Little Rock, Jonesboro and Huntsville and the balance on
two cars.
   ``My finances and obligations were in thousands instead of
millions, but they are satisfied,'' Faubus said. ``And I can put on
my tombstone, `His debts were paid.'''
   Faubus moved into The House in July 1967.
   Construction and controversy started in 1965, a year into Faubus'
final two-year term.
   With Faubus' $10,000 annual salary, critics asked, how could he
afford such palatial digs?
   ``It was not terribly complicated,'' recalls James O. Powell, who
spent 25 years directing the Arkansas Gazette's editorials. ``It was
done by a lot of gifts from a great range of friends of his.
   ``There was an open solicitation for funds. As I recall, we
referred to them as `love gifts.' They were large gifts from people
he had done a lot of favors for, and at the time, he was still in a
position to do more favors for them.''
   Faubus said it it was built by contributions from friends as he
was leaving office.
   Some charged the house's cost would soar to hundreds of thousands
of dollars. The new owners say one estimate was $3.5 million.
   ``It was just the baldest kind of conflict of interest to be a
governor in office and receiving gifts, huge gifts, for the
construction of a house,'' Powell said.
   Ken and Lorraine Howell, who bought the house, said they know
little about Faubus' administration, best known for using the
Arkansas National Guard to block nine black students from entering
all-white Little Rock Central High School in 1957. President
Eisenhower ordered soldiers into Little Rock, the first time federal
troops were used to enforce desegregation orders.
   ``We can't defend his politics or that sort of thing because we
weren't there,'' said Mrs. Howell, 32. ``I know him as a nice,
honest, decent person.''
   About their new purchase, 46-year-old Ken Howell said: ``I
understand it was always a controversial home, and at times, we have
had people come in and say, `Boy, I see where my tax money went now'.
   ``But on the other hand, I have had the opportunity to meet a lot
of folks who say, `I donated $2,500,' or, `I donated $10,000,' and
one of the fellows who told me he donated the native stone for the
chimney.''
   Faubus laughs at the suggestion that tax dollars were mingled
with donations to build the house. ``When you are a public figure,
you have to endure a lot,'' he said.
   The Howells have a neon ``OPEN'' sign in a front window, and have
held weddings, a 50th anniversary party and played host to several
hundred guests since they took over Feb. 12.
   Guests may view Faubus' gubernatorial desk, customized chief
executive's license plates and scores of plaques and campaign
materials. An enlarged black-and-white campaign photograph of Faubus
awaits mounting over a fireplace.
   Forty acres are being sold for development, Howell said.
Negotiations are under way with investors who want to build a hotel
on a concrete foundation laid years ago on the remaining 25 acres,
he said.
   ``I would say the home is one of the most well-known homes in the
country,'' Howell said. ``And Governor Faubus told me it always has
been and always will be a very controversial place.
   ``But that does not take away from how I feel about the place.
It's one of a kind.''

   A federal judge promised a quick decision on
whether to release up to 500 misdemeanor offenders from an
overcrowded jail where a mysterious bacterial infection has killed
two prisoners.
   Mark Canfield, chief of epidemiology for the Harris County Health
Department, said Tuesday that the source of an outbreak of flulike
symptoms at the county jail was unknown.
   ``We can expect to be working on it throughout the week. We have
a lot of variables involved,'' he said.
   On Monday, Attorney James Oitzinger asked U.S. District Judge
James DeAnda to force jail officials to relieve overcrowding and to
isolate those at greatest risk of contracting the infection.
   Oitzinger is representing the prisoners in a continuing lawsuit
before DeAnda over jail crowding.
   DeAnda, citing the seriousness of the situation, heard evidence
Tuesday and said he would respond to the request as early as today.
   Late last week, the infection killed inmates Ricky LaBreck, 30,
and Rene Antonio Fuentes, 21. Both had had their spleens removed,
leaving them more susceptible to the infection, doctors said.
   Eighteen inmates, including the two who died, have been treated
at a hospital, and cultures have indicated the presence of the
pneumococcus bacteria in five, Canfield said. One hospitalized
inmate also is without a spleen, he said.
   The others have various flulike symptoms that may be early signs
of the infection or perhaps just effects of a virus, said Nora
Shire, a spokeswoman for Ben Taub Hospital.
   Between 20 and 30 prisoners were being evaluated at the jail
infirmary with similar flulike symptoms, Canfield said.
   Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen testified Tuesday that experts from
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and those from the
county, city and jail do not blame crowding for the deaths.
   Klevenhagen opposes the early releases of the misdemeanor
offenders from the jail, which was designed to house 4,200 inmates,
but has about 8,300.
   Jail officials voluntarily canceled religious services,
recreational activities and classes, and the medical staff screened
inmates for conditions that could put them at greater risk than
healthy people from bacteria.

   The Alexandrov Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble
put together a program clearly intended to win Americans audiences.
It starts with the ``The Star Spangled Banner'' and ends with ``God
Bless America.'' And in between are not only Russian folk songs but
other internationalisms including a soloist who sounds like an Irish
tenor.
   The company opened Tuesday night for eight performances at the
City Center. Next it goes to 29 other American cities.
   The troupe has swashbuckling dancers _ men and women _ in
colorful folk costumes. Crowded behind the dancing space the
orchestra has Russian instruments, including balalaika and dombra,
and Western symphony instruments.
   Most impressive of all, to this member of the audience, was the
male chorus of more than 80 voices. Members of the chorus stood on
four rows of risers at the back of the stage. Their prominent sound
was baritone. When they hummed in harmony, it was glorious.
   Soloists were tenors and baritones. The Russian deep bass voice,
as rich as fertile black soil, that Americans know from opera, was
not to be heard.
   But Barseg Tumanyan, a rich baritone, saved the bass lovers from
disappointment. He sang ``The Toreador Song'' in French and ``I Got
Plenty of Nothin''' in English. He obviously had learned that one
from a recording. Every time he sang ``No use complaining'' the
words had an Italian accent. He got so much applause that he sang
``I Got Plenty of Nothin''' a second time.
   A trumpet soloist revealed that he'd been listening to recordings
by Louis Armstrong.
   These dancers did the kind of things other Russian troupes do but
their impact was heightened by musical numbers between their dances.
They did choreographed swordfights, danced smoothly and fast in
lines, danced in a crouch, did one-hand cartwheels, and did some
storytelling dances with villagers and comic characters.
   Lighting was interesting, giving rows of men in uniform some
variety, as only shoulders were lighted, and shadows made hats
suddenly look like ancient Roman helmets.
   Alexander Alexandrov founded the ensemble in 1928. The group
started for the United States in 1939 but World War II broke out and
the troupe turned back.
   This is its first American tour.
   Capturing the tone of the program, on the back wall of the stage
at City Center, were huge flags of the United States and Soviet
Union side by side.

   Democratic Assemblyman Gary Condit
trounced seven other candidates Tuesday to win the seat given up by
former House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, who resigned under an
ethics cloud.
   With 323 of 397 precincts counted, Condit had 46,420 votes, or 56
percent, to 27,131, or 34 percent, for Republican former state
Agriculture Director Clare Berryhill. Five other Republicans and a
Libertarian divided the remaining vote in the special election for
the San Joaquin Valley's 15th District.
   Condit's majority enabled him to avoid a Nov. 7 runoff with
Berryhill. Under state law, all candidates appear on the same
primary ballot, allowing voters to cross party lines.
   Condit will serve the remainder of Coelho's term, which expires
in 1990.
   Condit, 41, is from Modesto, while Berryhill, 63, is from Ceres.
The other candidates were Republican contractor Cliff Burris of
Merced, GOP farmer Robert Weimer of Atwater, Republican engineer

   Coelho, once a rising star in the Democratic Party, resigned June
15 after failing to report a $50,000 loan from a savings and loan.
   He said there was nothing wrong with the loan, and said it wasn't
reported because of a clerical error.
   But the incident drew greater attention because it coincided with
the downfall of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Coelho said he
resigned because he didn't want to give the Republicans two
prominent targets.
   Despite the circumstances surrounding Coelho's resignation,
Condit stressed his ties to the former House whip in television
commercials and mailings.
   Abortion, highway congestion and agriculture problems were major
issues in the race.
   Berryhill said he opposed abortion except in cases involving
rape, incest and a threat to the life of a mother. Condit said he
also opposed abortion but felt the decision to have one should be
personal.

<HEAD>To Some a Nutty Idea, They See the Great Plains as the Great Empty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Plains are agriculturally obsolete
and bound to revert to the tall grasses and the buffalo, claim two
researchers. The only question left, they say, is whether the
transformation will be eased by government or imposed by brute
market forces.
   Frank J. Popper and Deborah Epstein Popper _ he heads the urban
affairs department at Rutgers, the state university of New Jersey,
and she teaches geography there _ believe that about one more
generation can support itself by farming on the Great Plains before
vast stretches of 10 states are simply abandoned.
   As might be imagined, their view is none too welcome in the area.
``The Nuttiest Ideas Never Seem to Die'' is what a Fargo (N.D.)
Forum editorial said.
   But the Poppers insist it was a mistake to break the sod in the
first place, a historic error fostered by the 1862 Homestead Act,
which gave 160 acres to anyone willing to settle the land and stay
five years.
   The Poppers first spelled out their idea in an article in
Planning magazine, published by the American Planning Association,
and elaborated on it in telephone interviews.
   They wrote:
   ``We believe that over the next generation the Plains will, as a
result of the largest, longest-running agricultural and
environmental miscalculation in America, become almost totally
depopulated.''
   They described the area from the 98th meridian west to the
Rockies as ``endlessly windswept, nearly treeless, semiarid,
austerely beautiful, historically untenable, increasingly empty and
now facing ecological devastation.''
   Ultimately, they predict, about a third to half the land of the
10 states _ most of the Dakotas, the western two-thirds of Nebraska,
the western halves of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the eastern tips
of New Mexico and Colorado, eastern Wyoming and all but westernmost
Montana _ will return to its ``pre-white condition.''
   They figure the process will take 20 to 30 years.
   ``Service center'' cities such as Bismarck, N.D., and Cheyenne,
Wyo., or towns near interstate highways might stay in business. So
would a few locales able to sustain themselves through agriculture,
energy development or tourism, the Poppers say.
   Only government subsidies make farming viable now, and the
subsidies are bound to vanish in an era of budget deficits and farm
surpluses, they say.
   They propose having the government gradually buy back farmland
``and tear down the fences, replant the shortgrass and restock the
animals, including many bison _ creating what we would call the
Buffalo Commons.''
   Although they've met with hostility from the Plains, some find
truth in what they say.
   ``I agree with Frank that it was a miscalculation when the social
engineers put as many people as they did out here through that
Homestead Act,'' says rancher Jim Strain of Rapid City, S.D., who
runs the American Cowman's Association.
   ``I think it was meant to be a vast grasslands for producers of
red-meat animals to graze their herds on. It was a mistake to plow
this land with its limited topsoil and limited moisture.''
   And geographer Bret Wallach of the University of Oklahoma said
the Poppers are ``a bit quixotic in the short term but in the long
run it is an idea whose time will probably come.''
   ``Countries in the Third World are going to be able to take care
of themselves one of these days,'' he says. ``Farm productivity will
keep increasing and markets won't grow indefinitely and so you have
a question of more and more surplus land. In New England they let
the farmland grow back into trees and maybe that is the enlightened
thing to do _ restore it to its virgin use.''
   But Rep. Pat Roberts, a Republican who represents most of west
Kansas, says he's heard it all before.
   Every time the region goes through a period of hard times like
the recent drought, he says, ``you get another think tank effort to
send us back to the buffalo.''
   Told that the Poppers express great affection for the Plains,
Roberts hoots: ``That's damn nice of them.''

<HEAD>Corn Crop Still Lagging, But Better Than 1988 Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 corn crop has been battered here and
there by dry weather, too much rain and other ailments, but the
Agriculture Department says it's fit compared with last year's
drought-pummeled contender.
   According to USDA's latest estimate announced Tuesday, farmers
have begun to harvest an estimated 7.32 billion bushels of corn, up
49 percent from last year's output of 4.92 billion bushels.
   Even so, the new estimate, based on Sept. 1 field surveys, was
down fractionally from the 7.35 billion bushels indicated a month
ago.
   ``At the end of August, crop development was lagging behind
normal in most of the 17 major producing states,'' the report said.
``Harvest of corn for grain is well under way in the southern
states, but progress is slightly behind normal.''
   Corn yields were estimated at 112.4 bushels per acre harvested,
up from 84.6 bushels in 1988 but well below the record of 119.4
bushels per acre in 1987. Yields were forecast in August at 112.8
bushels per acre.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is an essential ingredient for the production of meat,
poultry and dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in
1988, are expected to increase 5 percent to 7 percent this year,
according to USDA economists.
   Soybean production was estimated at 1.89 billion bushels, up 23
percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels. But that
was down 1 percent from 1.91 billion bushels indicated last month.
   Yields were estimated at an average of 32 bushels per acre this
year, compared with 26.8 bushels in 1988 and the August forecast of
32.3 bushels. The record was 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985.
   Although the USDA's soybean estimate was close to what private
grain traders had expected, the corn figure was slightly higher than
some had counted on.
   The revised estimates showed total wheat production at 2.06
billion bushels, up 14 percent from last year and 1 percent more
than the 2.04 billion bushels forecast in August.
   Wheat yields were estimated to average 32.9 bushels per harvested
acre, compared with 34.1 bushels in 1988 and the August forecast of
32.6 bushels. The record was 39.4 bushels in 1983.
   There was no new estimate for winter wheat production, which
accounts for about three-fourths of the total. Previously, USDA put
the 1989 harvest at about 1.47 billion bushels, down 6 percent from
last year.
   Production of durum wheat, which is planted in the spring, was
indicated at 93.6 million bushels, up 109 percent from last year's
drought-ravaged harvest and up 3 percent from the August estimate.
   Other spring wheat was shown at 505 million bushels, up 146
percent from the 1988 harvest and 4 percent more than estimated in
August.
   Cotton production was estimated at 12.3 million bales, down 20
percent from 1988 but up from the August forecast of 11.8 million
bales.
   In a related report on the world's supply and demand situation
for major commodities, analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90
marketing year that began on Sept. 1 is still expected to be around
7.5 billion bushels, including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean
another drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.68 billion bushels
left over by next Sept. 1, down from current inventories estimated
at 1.86 billion bushels.
   The report said corn prices may average in the range of $1.85 to
$2.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $2.55 last
season. That was only a slight change from the August forecast.
   Other 1989 crop estimates based on Sept. 1 indications, compared
with 1988 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 658.9 million bushels and an average yield of 62.6
bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988.
   _Barley, 401.1 million bushels and a yield of 46.9 bushels per
acre, compared with 290.5 million and 38.6.
   _Rice, 152.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,548 pounds
per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511.
   _Peanuts, 4.44 billion pounds and a yield of 2,688 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445.
   _Tobacco, 1.49 billion pounds and a yield of 2,130 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160.
   _Sugarbeets, 26.5 million tons and a yield of 20 tons per acre,
compared with 24.8 million and 19.1.
   _Sugarcane, 30.8 million tons and a yield of 35.7 tons per acre,
compared with 29.9 million and 35.4.

<HEAD>Soviets Urged to Adopt Western Ways Through Monetary Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union should be brought to Western
ways through membership in the International Monetary Fund, two
experts on international affairs proposed in a study published today.
   ``The fund would still run the risk that (Soviet President
Mikhail) Gorbachev could be replaced by hard liners, but since the
Soviet Union would at most be granted 5 to 6 percent of the votes on
the IMF Executive Board, any disruptive tactics could be
contained,'' wrote Catherine Gwin and Richard E. Feinberg.
   Nearly all of the IMF's member governments are devoted to private
enterprise, although China, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia belong.
The Soviet Union does not. The United States has the largest block
of votes with 19.14 percent.
   Gwin is special program adviser at the Rockefeller Foundation.
Feinberg, a former member of the State Department Policy Planning
Staff, is executive vice president of the Overseas Development
Council, a private group financed largely by foundations.
   Their volume is called ``The International Monetary Fund in a
Multipolar World: Pulling Together.''
   The IMF provides loans and other assistance to developing nations.
   Gorbachev has expressed interest in joining the fund, but the
U.S. government has opposed the idea.
   The authors suggested the Soviets could get advice from the fund
as China has done from the IMF's sister organization, the World
Bank. Membership in the fund is a condition for joining the bank and
the two organizations have the same 151 member countries.
   The authors said the Soviets need guidance on money, banking,
price reform and exchange and trade relations.
   As ``confidence-building'' measures, they recommended:
   _Consultations among officials of the fund and the Soviet Union.
   _Provision by the Soviets of data on their aid to the Third World.
   _Soviet co-financing of some World Bank aid projects.
   _Cooperation with the World Bank in some areas such as protection
of the environment.
   Integrating the Soviets into the world economy could give the
fund a central purpose for the 1990s, the writers suggested.
   The IMF has been a failure in the past decade, according to
another writer in the volume, Jeffrey D. Sachs, professor of
international trade at Harvard University.
   Sachs said few of the 39 developing nations the fund has tried to
help this decade have become able to meet their international
obligations without undermining their internal economies.
   ``Most of the problem debtor countries are further away than ever
from renewed creditworthiness.''
   A fund official said there would be no immediate comment from
fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus.

<HEAD>Bush Drug Plan Funding Under Fire from State and Local Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration blueprints for fighting the
drug war are coming under fire from state and local officials who
say the battle would strain their budgets without providing the
money to get the job done.
   ``Almost everyone acknowledges that this is not enough money,''
Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston, S.C., told a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing Tuesday on how the drug plan will affect state and
local budgets.
   Riley praised President Bush and national drug policy director
William Bennett for addressing the problem. But he said the $350
million the strategy envisions sending to state and local
governments to bolster law enforcement would be less than 1 percent
of what they already spend.
   He said there could be a net loss when aid to state and local
governments under the plan is balanced against cuts in federal
grants for juvenile justice programs, community development and
housing.
   Officials appearing as witnesses were virtually unanimous in
saying federal aid under the proposal was insufficient. Several
complained cuts in existing grant programs could actually harm
efforts to solve the drug problem.
   ``It is inconceivable that we would go out to fight a war with $8
billion to solve a problem that we conservatively estimate at $120
billion,'' said John Gustafson, president of the National
Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors. ``You can't
do it with an 8 percent solution.''
   Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he didn't want to
go back to his constituents after passing the measure only to be
told ``you made life worse for us because you increased my taxes or
you didn't increase my taxes but I don't have any bus service
anymore.''
   State Rep. Dan Blue of North Carolina, chairman of the law and
justice committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures,
said states were ``pleased that the national government is joining
our efforts to eradicate drug abuse.''
   ``Unfortunately, development of the national strategy did not
include a sufficient analysis of the potential costs to state and
local governments,'' he said.
   One administration proposal criticized by the officials would
require drug testing of all people arrested, prisoners, parolees and
those released on bond while awaiting trial.
   Biden said that would cost $244 million of the $350 million in
law enforcement aid.

<HEAD>Congressman Questions Reasons for Naval Fuel Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics are questioning whether the Energy
Department is withholding information about the reason for closing a
recently-completed top secret military plant while keeping a
34-year-old twin in operation.
   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., in a letter to Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins on Tuesday, wondered about the truth of the
department's announcement last week that it was putting the Fuel
Materials Facility on ``backup status'' for economic reasons.
   ``If this announcement raises questions in my mind, it
practically begs the media and congressional oversight committees to
maul the Department of Energy again,'' Derrick wrote, adding he
wanted a full explanation from Watkins.
   ``As you know, speculation has it that the Savannah River Site
naval fuel production facility has experienced operational
difficulties resulting from design flaws,'' he wrote.
   The facility, part of the 300-square-mile Savannah River Site
nuclear weapons complex near Aiken, S.C., is one of two plants
producing uranium fuel for naval reactors. Derrick said the
mothballed plant was completed at a cost of $175 million.
   The department said it was halting production at the facility
``because the projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the cost
of operating two facilities.''
   The other production site is at Erwin, Tenn., and is run by
Nuclear Fuel Services Inc. The department said that facility can
meet all naval fuel production needs and is the only manufacturing
site qualified to make all types of fuel for the Navy.
   Derrick said available evidence did not seem to support the
economic explanation, since the Erwin facility is 34 years old and
has suffered operational problems, whereas the South Carolina
facility is new.
   Derrick gave no details of the operational problems at the Erwin
facility except to say it has ``had problems keeping track of
uranium inventories, among other difficulties.''
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, told The Associated
Press he was not able to comment immediately because he had not been
fully briefed on the situation. He added he was not aware of any
operational problems at the South Carolina site.
   Moore said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., had also objected to the
shutdown decision.
   In a telephone interview, Derrick offered no evidence of
operational problems at the Savannah River facility, saying, ``It's
my own speculation.'' He noted the Energy Department as a matter of
policy has declined to publicly discuss the naval fuel facility's
operational record and its specific functions.
   Some environmental groups also have questioned the shutdown
decision. Dan Reicher, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said after last week's Energy Department announcement that
he found it ``curious'' the older Erwin facility would be kept open
instead of the newer plant.
   In a related matter, Watkins came under fire again Tuesday from
environmental groups for his decision to hire Victor Stello, a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission executive, to run the department's
nuclear weapons program.
   Four groups _ Greenpeace USA, the Ralph Nader-founded Public
Citizen, the Government Accountability Project and the Environmental
Policy Institute-Friends of the Earth _ released copies of a report
they termed an ``indictment'' of Stello's tenure at the NRC, which
regulates the civilian nuclear industry.
   The report listed several previously documented incidents in
which some critics of Stello have raised questions about his
commitment to nuclear safety.
   Senate committee hearings on the Stello nomination are expected
to start in October.

<HEAD>Bradley Bill Would Force Schools to Disclose Graduation Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are places like Villanova where all or
practically all of the scholarship basketball players leave with
degrees in their pockets after four or five years.
   But Villanova is an exception.
   At many other schools, less proud to step forward and be counted
publicly, hardly any of the players in high-dollar major sports
programs such as football and basketball get their degrees.
   National Collegiate Athletic Association figures for 1988 show 30
schools had graduation rates of 5 percent or less for basketball
players, and seven with rates of 96 percent or greater.
   Most of the association's 800 member schools fall somewhere in
between.
   That wide disparity would not disappear under Sen. Bill Bradley's
plan to force all colleges to make public the graduation statistics
they already compile and report privately to the NCAA, which
compiles them in an annual composite report.
   ``It doesn't guarantee that (student-athletes) are going to make
it,'' said Bradley, D-N.J., who was a Rhodes Scholar and
professional basketball star before taking up politics. ``Education
requires hard work.''
   But Bradley insisted his ``consumer disclosure'' legislation
would help youngsters interested in getting an education find the
right place to play ball.
   Dr. Patricia Lucas, principal of Southeast High School in
Bradenton, Fla., and a spokeswoman for the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, strongly agreed during a hearing before
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   She said legislation would help those ``whose maturity has not
progressed beyond the stage of dreaming of the glory of college and
professional sports.''
   The Bradley bill would require the individual figures be reported
to the U.S. Department of Education, broken down by sport. Each
institution would have to disclose its rates to prospective athletic
recruits and the figures would be printed on any scholarship papers
signed by the student.
   The head of the NCAA and a college president pleaded for more
time before the federal government steps in with a law, at least
until the NCAA meeting in January.
   ``If we don't pass meaningful legislation, I will personally
lobby for this bill,'' NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz said.
   He argued the 48 percent graduate rate for college athletes at
NCAA member institutions is actually slightly better than the rate
for general student bodies. And he said academic rules for athletes
put into place over the past five years have not had time to show up
in statistics.
   But Bradley said the NCAA was offering ``too little, too late''
and told reporters he intended to press for passage of his bill
before the January NCAA meeting. Bradley introduced similar
legislation last year, but didn't push it.
   Those testifying in favor of the bill included Villanova
basketball coach Rollie Massimino, whose team is a perennial power
and has won one national championship.
   Massimino told the committee that _ which the exception of some
who transferred to other schools or otherwise left Villanova in good
academic standing _ all 52 of his player got their degrees.
   It wasn't always easy, he said, especially in the early part of
his 17-year tenure _ before his reputation was established and
everyone realized he was serious about emphasizing academics. He
said he suffered under the pressure to win before he told himself,
``We're either going to do it or we're not and we're going to do it
my way.''
   Massimino said the result shows a collegiate athletic program can
be run without losing sight of a college's educational mission.

<HEAD>Environmentalists See Small Cost, Large Benefits in Drilling Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group says the fuel lost by
closing off parts of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling
could be more than offset by increasing automobile mileage.
   ``Prohibiting development in the highly ecologically sensitive
areas ... would not remove a significant amount'' of fuel from the
market, Dorene Bolze of the National Audubon Society told a House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee Tuesday.
   The hearing came as several other subcommittee's were making
last-minute adjustments Tuesday to oil spill cleanup legislation
arising from the tanker Exxon Valdez accident that fouled Alaska's
Prince William Sound. Full committee and House action may occur
later this week.
   Supporters of drilling say the risk from offshore drilling is far
less than that from tankers, pointing out there hasn't had a major
spill from offshore drilling since major spills and fires in 1969
and 1970 forced federal attention on the industry.
   But opponents say there are too many environmental hazards
associated with drilling, including destruction of wetlands for
pipelines and facilities, and air and noise pollution. The impact on
domestic fuel production would be relatively small, they say.
   ``Predictions are that offshore areas recommended for off limits
contain only 10 percent of all estimated offshore and gas
resources,'' said Bolze, quoting a private study based on Interior
Department data.
   She said increasing the mileage standards of passenger vehicles
``to currently technically feasible levels would produce oil savings
equal to the amount of undiscovered oil resources estimated to
exist'' in the Outer Continental Shelf.
   Environmentalists want to ban drilling at Georges Bank off New
England, the Florida Keys, Bristol Bay of Alaska, some areas of
northern and southern California, and areas in the Mid-Atlantic.
   A Bush administration task force is studying some of the more
controversial lease sales off Florida and the Gulf Coast and is
expected to make recommendations to President Bush in December.
   Bolze testified at a hearing of the Panama Canal and Outer
Continental Shelf subcommittee, which is examining the environmental
impact of such drilling as a result of the Valdez tanker spill.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said barring offshore drilling would
put the country's shoreline at greater environmental risk from
increased tanker traffic, particularly foreign ships.
   ``Since the average offshore well in the Gulf of Mexico produces
only eight barrels of oil per hour, in order to duplicate the Valdez
spill all the wells in the Gulf of Mexico multiplied by three would
have to simultaneously blow out,'' said Fields.
   ``If we don't move forward with a domestic OCS program, our
country is going to suffer in the future,'' he said.
   Most OCS production is in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean
off California. An administration task force is studying some of the
more controversial lease sales off Florida and the Gulf coast of
Florida and is expected to make recommendations to President Bush in
December.
   Barry A. Williamson, director of minerals management for the
Interior Department, said 8 billion gallons of oil and 75 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas have been produced over the 36 years of
OCS drilling.
   He said that is about one-eighth of U.S. oil production and
one-fourth of natural gas production.

   Rep. Barney Frank says he's eager to refute
``inaccurate charges'' about his relationship with a male prostitute
and will fully cooperate with an ethics committee investigation into
his conduct.
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _ the ethics
committee _ voted Tuesday to begin a preliminary investigation into
the Massachusetts Democrat's activities with prostitute Steve Gobie.
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, has said he originally hired
Gobie for sex and then employed him _ using personal funds _ as a
personal aid from July 1985 through August 1987.
   Frank called the ethics panel ``the best possible forum'' to
resolve conflicting accounts he and Gobie have given on some details
of their relationship.
   Gobie, for instance, said he operated a prostitution ring from
Frank's Capitol Hill apartment with the lawmaker's knowledge, but
Frank insists he was unaware of any such activity.
   According to Gobie, Frank used his congressional immunity to void
parking tickets incurred by Gobie, when the prostitute used the
lawmaker's car to keep appointments for illicit sex. Frank said he
only had tickets waived when the car was used for official business.
   Frank said he requested the ethics investigation several weeks
ago ``when I saw what I believe to be very inaccurate charges
floating around.''
   ``And I welcome the chance to go before the ethics committee with
canceled checks for parking tickets, with the statement of my
landlady, who lived in that house on a day-to-day basis ... with
people on my staff who have evidence to give.''
   Commenting after delivering a speech to a bankers' group, Frank
said the impact on his political future would depend on ``what the
ethics committee decides. Frankly, if some of the accusations that
were made were true, then I think I would be in very serious trouble
and ought to be.''
   Ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the
investigation was prompted by ``the assertions surrounding Barney
Frank's employment of Mr. Steve Gobie.''
   The committee voted in secret, and Dixon would not reveal whether
the vote was unanimous.
   The vote began only the first round of the House's internal
disciplinary process, and will determine whether a more complete
investigation is necessary. The panel can issue subpoenas and take
testimony during the preliminary stage.
   The inquiry could lead to a statement of an alleged violation,
which is similar to an indictment. This could result in a
disciplinary proceeding and a recommendation to the full House for
punishment, which could range from a reprimand to expulsion.
   Dixon also announced the committee accepted the request of panel
member Chester Atkins, D-Mass., to withdraw from consideration of
the Frank case.
   ``Mr. Atkins felt in this particular case he could not be a fair
and impartial person,'' Dixon said. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
appointed former ethics committee Chairman Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, to
replace Atkins on the Frank case, although Atkins will remain active
in other committee investigations.
   In a statement, Atkins said, ``Barney Frank is my friend. I
cannot end our friendship today, and I cannot be sure that my
judgment of this friend would be `impartial and unbiased' as the
House rules require. The public has a right to expect of us no
outright predispositions.''
   Atkins also said his dual role as a panel member and
Massachusetts' Democratic chairman ``would, at the outset, serve to
undermine the committee's standing. If I remain on the ... committee
_ for this case _ I compromise the process. If I recuse myself, I do
much more to uphold the credibility of the process.''

<HEAD>Strategists Unsure of Abortion Impact on State Elections</HEAD>

   Many Democrats say the Supreme Court's ruling
on abortion gives them an opening in the 1989 state elections, but
strategists are cautioning the issue remains a political wildcard
until ballot results are counted.
   Celinda Lake, a pollster for Democratic candidates, said Tuesday
that polling in many states suggests significant numbers of voters
may shift to candidates supporting abortion rights.
   She acknowledged, however, the impact of the court's decision
this summer permitting state's greater regulatory power over
abortion has not been put to the test of a full political campaign.
   ``I think we really don't know what happens when we come into an
election and this issue is getting hammered on,'' she said at a
discussion of abortion politics sponsored by a liberal Democratic
research organization.
   Lake and other political analysts said abortion may prove a
decisive issue in the governor's elections this fall in Virginia and
New Jersey. Democratic candidates in both states have staked out
positions generally in favor of abortion rights.
   A consultant the Virginia Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. L.
Douglas Wilder suggested Wilder plans to launch television
advertising focusing on the abortion issue. He faces Republican
nominee J. Marshall Coleman, who has softened his opposition to
abortion but remains perceived as the anti-abortion candidate, the
analysts said.
   ``Until this year, we always said this is an issue you don't want
to ... pay to put on TV,'' said Frank Greer, a Washington-based
media consultant to the Wilder campaign. ``This year, people are
going to be paying ... and I think that will make it a cutting
issue.''
   But Charles Cook, editor of The Cook Political Report newsletter
and a political analyst, said much of the national polling showing
voters generally in favor of abortion is meaningless because voters
may decide their votes on other issues.
   He said Democratic candidates who push pro-abortion positions
risk alienating older Democratic voters, less educated voters and,
in many states, black voters. For Republicans who oppose abortion,
he said, to push the abortion issue forcefully is to risk losing
younger voters and women.
   ``From a political standpoint I think this is very, very
dangerous for the Democratic Party and it's one that really ought to
be thought through before there is any movement to make the
Democratic Party the pro-choice party and for the Republican Party,
for that matter, to become the pro-life party,'' Cook said.
   The analysts commented at a luncheon sponsored by the Center for
National Policy and held at the National Democratic Club.

<TEXT>
   After months of criticizing President Bush's
proposed capital gains tax cut as a giveaway to the rich, Democratic
leaders are offering an alternative for ``average folks'' _ a return
to tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said allowing all workers to have IRAs would be a better
way to encourage saving than the proposed capital gains cut. House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader George
J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said they agree.
   ``The Senate and the American people now have a clear choice
between competing plans to advance our economy,'' Mitchell said
Tuesday.
   ``Cutting capital gains (taxes) is an investment incentive for a
few, but the problem is broader than that,'' Bentsen said Tuesday in
announcing his proposal. ``With the IRA, we'd have the participation
of a broad spectrum of middle America.''
   All workers were allowed fully deductible IRAs before passage of
the 1986 tax overhaul. That law made them available only to workers
not covered by a company pension, and to covered workers with
incomes under $25,000 and couples under $40,000. Partial deductions
are allowed couples with incomes under $50,000 and single people
under $35,000.
   Under Bentsen's proposal, a person could contribute up to $2,000
a year to an IRA and avoid current taxation on half the sum. The
contribution and the interest earned would not be taxed until the
money was withdrawn for retirement, tuition or making the down
payment on a first home.
   ``This IRA affects average folks,'' Bentsen said. ``It helps
address three of the primary concerns of middle-income Americans,
lower-income Americans: buying that first home, financing a college
education or providing for one's retirement.''
   Bentsen outlined his proposal as the House Ways and Means
Committee struggled to solve the capital gains issue, which has
stalemated the panel for several weeks. The committee's 13
Republicans and six Democrats _ a bare majority of the 37-member
panel _ favor a capital gains cut, which Bush has endorsed.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee chairman, has
blocked a vote on the cut. Although he opposes a capital gains
reduction, he is trying to develop a compromise that could win back
one of the six dissident Democrats.
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that as much as 80
percent of the benefits of the capital gains cut would go to those
with incomes above $100,000 a year.
   Nevertheless, Bush contends, the cut is necessary to encourage
saving and job-creating investments.
   Economists disagree on that argument, just as they disagree on
whether IRAs encourage saving or simply reward those who transfer
money from a taxable savings account into an IRA.
   Bentsen noted a recent study commissioned by Merrill Lynch
Consumer Markets found that 80 percent of IRA contributions were new
saving. That study also found that two-thirds of IRA deductions were
claimed by those with incomes under $50,000.
   In 1986, the last year IRAs were available to all workers, 15.5
million couples and individuals made IRA contributions totaling $38
billion. A year later, 7.4 million taxpayers claimed deductions for
$14 billion in contributions.
   The IRA proposal is the first effort by Democrats to offer an
alternative to the capital gains cut Bush sought during his
campaigned last year. They agreed on the need to encourage saving
but until now only argued that a capital gains cut is not the way to
do it.

   The Senate is sending former CIA agent Donald
Gregg to Seoul as U.S. ambassador to South Korea, dismissing months
of attacks on his credibility and alleged involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The Senate voted 66-33 on Tuesday to confirm President Bush's
nomination of Gregg after opponents said his sworn denials were
``absurd on their face'' and defenders said rejecting him would be
unfair.
   Twenty-one Democrats joined all 45 Senate Republicans in voting
for the nomination. Thirty-three Democrats voted no.
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., played a key role in debate, mounting a
detailed defense of Gregg's conduct during the years he served as
national security adviser to Vice President Bush.
   Robb, who said he supported the nominee out of ``conscience and
conviction,'' said he would vote for Gregg ``in the hope that we can
put the unfortunate experience of executive-legislative distrust
behind us and begin anew in the spirit of a sustainable, bipartisan
foreign policy.''
   Robb said he is convinced Gregg did not lie to Congress. The
record shows not ``a crafty, all-knowing political operative,'' said
Robb, but rather ``a dedicated public servant, concerned with the
issues and setting the record straight.''
   ``When we take time to consider each concern, we find an
explanation ... His biggest sin seems to be that he served in
government when our system broke down,'' he said.
   Bush's nomination of Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul,
has been pending since March.
   In two sessions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Gregg denied, under oath, allegations he was involved in the Reagan
administration's secret and illegal effort to resupply the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   But many of Robb's Democratic colleagues said Gregg's denials
were just not credible.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, who was a member
of the Senate Iran-Contra investigating committee, said he believes
Gregg's explanations ``are so inconsistent with the known facts that
they cannot be believed.''
   ``Mr. Gregg has clearly not been straight with us,'' said Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``Few who have reviewed the record have come
away with any confidence in Mr. Gregg's veracity.''
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., scoffed at Gregg's explanation of why
Bush's agenda for two separate meetings as vice president included
the subject of ``Contra Resupply.''
   Gregg testified the citations were the result of a
misunderstanding of how the agenda topics should be listed. He said
the actual topic was ``Copter Resupply,'' referring to the resupply
of helicopters for the armed forces in El Salvador.
   ``Are we to seriously accept a bald-faced presentation of that
kind?'' Gore asked. ``It's absurd on its face.''
   ``To vote to confirm we have to believe this nominee did not lie
brazenly and repeatedly,'' Gore said. ``It's a little difficult to
swallow.''

   The Bush administration says nine states, with
some of the nation's dirtiest coal-burning power plants, do not
deserve financial help from other parts of the country to cut acid
rain emissions.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said Tuesday he opposed changing the administration's clean
air bill to provide special help to the the nine states.
   He produced figures strongly contradicting the states' assertion
that they would pay a disproportionate share of costs to reduce acid
rain.
   Reilly testified before the House Energy and Commerce energy and
power subcommittee on the acid rain section of the Bush legislation.
Today, the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee is meeting
to amend the bill, a process that could take three weeks. The
legislation would then go to the full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Reilly said the acid rain section is ``fair to those who cleaned
upin the past. It doesn't make them pay to clean up again,'' he
said, referring to electric customers from outside the nine states,
whose utility bills already include the cost of pollution-cutting
moves by utilities in their own areas.
   The administrator sparred often Tuesday with Rep. Philip R.
Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the energy and power panel, who insisted
electric customers in the nine states ``are being asked to do more
than our fair share.''
   The states are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.
   Sharp has demanded that electric ratepayers in those states
receive financial help in paying for power plant reductions of
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, emissions that form the compound
known as acid rain. The nine states have plants that burn high
sulfur coal.
   So-called cost sharing could be accomplished by forcing
non-utility industries to reduce their emissions, or by having
electric ratepayers elsewhere pick up part of the tab through their
bills.
   ``The environment will not know'' where reductions come from,
``but our ratepayers will know,'' Sharp said, contending that some
utility rates could rise by 20 percent in the nine states. But
Reilly said the five hardest-hit states would only see ratepayers
bills increase _ on the average _ a third of a cent per
killowatt-hour by the year 2001.
   Sharp began his hearing Tuesday by citing new figures that
contended the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77
percent of the acid rain emissions, even though they cause only 50
percent of the problem.
   He contended in the initial phase of the program, ratepayers in
the nine states would ``pay for fully 90 percent of the cleanup.''
   But Reilly then presented his own statistics, which said that the
nine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but their
actual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total.
   ``That's as fair as we can possibly make it,'' he said.
   Bush's legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airborne
chemicals, acid rain and ozone. Acid rain consists of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide, substances that unite in the air and travel
hundreds of miles before falling to earth.
   Acid rain destroys lakes, kills trees, makes buildings
deteriorate and causes lung problems.
   The president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons
by the year 2000 based on 1980 levels _ nine million coming from
power plants and one million from industrial emissions already
achieved. There would be an emissions ``cap'' to prevent future
releases from offsetting the reductions.
   Nitrogen oxides from utilities would be cut two million tons from
the projected level in the year 2000. But since these oxides could
increase by three million tons during this period, there could
actually be an increase of one million tons.
   Utilities could decide how to reduce their pollution, with
possibilities including switching to cleaner burning fuels,
employing existing anti-pollution equipment like scrubbers, trying
new methods such as developing technology for cleaner burning of
high-sulfur coal, and conservation.

<HEAD>Trident 2 Fails Senate Test After Failing Firing Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee is slashing President
Bush's budget request for the Trident 2 missile because of two
successive failures in undersea test firings of the
submarine-launched weapon.
   ``It was an obvious necessity,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said
Tuesday after the decision by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee
on defense. ``You can't procure with the shape that missile is in.''
   Without dissent, the subcommittee approved a $288.2 billion
military spending bill that eliminates Bush's request of $1.6
billion for missile purchases in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
and $216 million for purchases further down the road.
   Instead, the subcommittee approved $286 million for research and
development of the missile, a more lethal version of the Trident 1,
which is the heart of the Navy's nuclear deterrent. Bush had asked
for $216 million.
   ``It's time to regroup,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
ranking Republican on the subcommittee. ``It's a matter of caution.
The money's there to use it to get more stability in the test.''
   The action comes almost one month after a Trident 2 missile
exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear submarine
Tennessee about 200 miles off the coast of Florida.
   At $26.5 million each, the Trident is supposed to be deployed in
the 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines, bolstering the
sea-based leg of America's land, sea and air nuclear forces.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, asked at a Pentagon
briefing whether the Navy would meet its operating date for the
Trident 2, said the service will ``continue to try to find out the
cause of the recent failure of the missile.''
   ``There has been no decision to slip the initial operating
capability date of March 1990,'' said Williams.
   The House, in approving its versions of authorization and
appropriations bills, and the Senate, which adopted its
authorization legislation, did not alter Bush's budget request for
the missile. But the two chambers took those steps before the recent
failure of the Trident 2.
   House and Senate conferees will begin meeting this week to hammer
out an authorization bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee is
expected to vote Thursday on the military spending bill with full
Senate action likely next week.
   In other action, the subcommittee left most of Bush's strategic
programs such as the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetman
nuclear missiles relatively intact, as the full Senate did last
month with the authorization bill.
   The panel also approved $255 million for the Marine Corps to test
the V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane, and accepted the
president's decision to kill the Navy's F-14D jet fighter.
   In addition, the subcommittee included $1.05 billion to help
finance the war on drugs, including $300 million in cash and
equipment for the Coast Guard, $62 million to operate surveillance
planes and ships and $118 million for existing Defense Department
education and drug-treatment programs.
   Bush had asked for spending of $132 million in the legislation.
   The panel went slightly beyond the full Senate in trimming funds
for the Star Wars missile shield. The Senate authorization bill put
the Strategic Defense Initiative amount at $4.5 billion, a cut of
$400 million from Bush's budget. The subcommittee cut SD research
and development to $3.7 billion, which, when added to the $355
million in Energy Department money and military construction funds,
is a total of about $4.1 billion.
   In addition to the spending bill of $279.7 billion, the
subcommittee adopted a separate $8.5 billion amendment that includes
$1 billion for four cargo ships and two tankers, $1.3 billion to
replace nuclear power reactors on the carrier Enterprise, $1.7
billion for 174 Apache helicopters and $3.4 billion for modernizing
major military components such as ship radar systems.
   The House last month approved a $286.5 billion military
appropriations bill that slashed nearly $2 billion for Star Wars
from Bush's request, strictly limited the B-2 bomber program and
made drastic cuts in the MX and Midgetman missiles.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a recent letter to the chairmen
of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, said he would
recommend that Bush veto any defense bill that resembles the House
legislation.

<HEAD>Jordan Demands Israel Commit Itself To Yielding West Bank and Gaza</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Crown Prince of Jordan is demanding a
commitment from Israel that it would relinquish the West Bank and
Gaza in exchange for peace.
   In a speech Tuesday night, Prince Hassan accused Israel of trying
to drive a wedge between Palestinian Arabs and the Palestine
Liberation Organization, but he disavowed any Jordanian intention to
represent the Palestinians.
   At a news conference earlier, Hassan dismissed as a ``pipedream''
of some Israeli politicians the idea that Jordan would agree to a
deal to resume control of the West Bank.
   Speaking after meetings with President Bush and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, the prince said Israel and the United
States should accept the PLO as the legitimate representative of the
Palestinians in negotiations.
   He denounced Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for
elections among Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza, saying
``the purpose is to drive a wedge between them and their recognized
leadership.''
   Jordan controlled the West Bank from 1948 until 1967 while Egypt
ran Gaza. The two Arab countries lost the territories to Israel in
the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Shamir's plan, which has U.S. support, is designed to have
elected Palestinians negotiate with Israel five years of local
self-rule for the 1.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. Afterward,
joined by Egypt and Jordan, they would negotiate an overall
settlement.
   But Hassan said an agreement could only be arranged at an
international that includes the PLO and the Soviet Union. ``Jordan
will not represent the Palestinian people at the conference. Nor
will it negotiate the settlement of the Palestinian problem on
behalf of the PLO,'' he said.
   He said Jordan was willing to attend as part of a mixed
delegation with Yasser Arafat's group. In the speech and at the news
conference, he referred to the PLO leader as ``President Arafat.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the State Department gave cautious praise to a
plan by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for Palestinian elections.
But there was no indication whether Israel or the PLO would go along.
   The plan by President Hosni Mubarak includes a demand that Israel
accept the idea it should trade land for peace. Negotiations for an
overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute would be held three
to five years after limited Palestinian self-rule began.
   Israeli Prime Minister Shamir has steered clear of any scheme
that would commit Israel to relinquishing West Bank and Gaza
territory. The PLO, meanwhile, demands nothing less than statehood.
   Baker is sounding out Mideast leaders about Mubarak's ideas. He
met last week with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and on
Tuesday with Hassan. Mubarak is expected here within a few weeks and
Shamir in November.
   ``We continue to encourage all parties to find ways to launch an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue to discuss the Israeli election
initiative,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman. ``To the extent these 10 points can be helpful, in that
regard we welcome Egypt's efforts.''
   Other elements of Mubarak's proposal include permitting
Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem to participate in the
balloting and supervision of the voting by international observers.
   At a news conference later, Hassan called Mubarak's proposal
worthwhile, but said a settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute
required an international peace conference.
   ``We see the Egyptian proposals as a mechanism for holding
elections,'' he said.
   Hassan met with Bush at the White House for about 15 minutes and
told reporters they discussed generalities.
   ``I had the very moving impression of the president's personal
concern toward these developments,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is reinforcing economic
sanctions against Panama but U.S. officials concede the new action
will likely fall short of toppling military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday
Panama will be ineligible to participate in an expansion of the U.S.
quotas for sugar imports.
   In addition, she said the administration is expanding the list of
Panamanian companies and individuals which Americans will not have
permission to deal with.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said they doubted the new
measures were strong enough to dislodge Noriega from power.
   But they said a stronger package of economic sanctions could do
more damage to the Panamanian people than to Noriega, who is under
indictment on drug smuggling charges by two Florida grand juries.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that without the sanction on sugar exports,
Panama would have the authority to export more than 23,000 tons to
the United States under the revised quota.
   The announcement did not come as a surprise since the Reagan
administration had suspended Panama's sugar quota as far back as
December 1987.
   The new action reflected administration displeasure over
Noriega's decision to install a long-time associate as Panama's
unelected president two weeks ago.
   The State Department has accused Noriega of sabotaging elections
last May rather than recognize the victory of the opposition
candidate.

   Fred Bush, a former aide and fund-raiser for
the president, will not fight for his nomination as ambassador to
Luxembourg, according to an administration official.
   Bush, who is no relation to the president, faced stiff opposition
in the Senate to his nomination because of his involvement in
allegations of influence peddling at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   ``It became obvious it wasn't going to be worth the pain and he
withdrew his name,'' said the administration official, who spoke
Tuesday on condition he not be named.
   The official said President Bush had not decided who to nominate
in Fred Bush's place, or whether he would offer him another job.
   Fred Bush earned large fees as a consultant to developers who
hired him to help win approval for projects dependent on HUD grants.
   After one appearance before a House subcommittee investigating
the scandal-plagued agency, Bush was asked to testify a second time
to explain discrepancies that appeared later between his testimony
and other evidence. Subcommittee members also were openly skeptical
of some of Bush's memory lapses when he testified.
   He was an aide to George Bush as vice president and chief
fund-raiser for the president's successful 1988 campaign.
   His nomination as ambassador languished for months in the Senate
before senators sent the nomination back to the White House just
before the August recess.

<HEAD>Scientists Search For Faster Ways Of Testing AIDS Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health experts say research on how fast the
AIDS virus progresses in humans could speed testing of drugs to
combat the disease.
   Such a measure ``will make drug development a lot faster and more
efficient,'' said Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer
Institute and a leading AIDS researcher.
   ``You might be able to make determinations much quicker without
having to let studies go to where there is a deterioration of
clinical status,'' he said.
   About 300 researchers from federal, university and commercial
laboratories met at the National Academy of Science headquarters
Tuesday to discuss what characteristics in the blood of AIDS
patients could be used to gauge how fast the disease infects the
immune system.
   If an agreement is reached and approved by the Food and Drug
Adminstration, it could lead to the use of a laboratory blood test
that would swiftly determine progress of the AIDS virus infection in
a patient, experts said. This would help measure the effects of
drugs to fight the disease.
   Stages of infection by the human immunodeficency virus that
causes AIDS, are now measured by clinical effects, such as
opportunistic infections, or wasting, or chronic lymph node
enlargement. These are called ``clinical endpoints'' and they often
can take months or years to develop.
   A number of investigators believe the progress of AIDS can be
accurately measured by testing the blood for the number of CD4
lymphocyte cells. These cells are part of the immune system and are
the primary target of the AIDS virus.
   Normally, humans have 800 or more CD4 cells per cubic millimeter.
But once the AIDS infection becomes active, this number begins to
drop. CD4 cell counts of less than 200 are thought to reflect an
immune system that is in serious trouble.
   A number of researchers have suggested that tracking the rate of
decline of CD4 cells would be a method of measuring the progress of
the AIDS virus.
   If a candidate drug caused this decline to slow, stop or reverse,
the researchers believe, it would suggest the drug was slowing
progress of the AIDS virus.
   Determining the CD4 cell is a realtively simple laboratory test
that can be quickly performed. Researchers said it would enable them
to plot from week-to-week the precise progress a patient makes while
receiving experimental therapy for AIDS.
   But, some investigators at the meeting said not all patients
respond in the same way to infection by the AIDS virus. Some
patients with CD4 counts well above 500 have developed opportunistic
infections, while others with much lower CD4 counts remain
symptom-free.
   ``A lot of people are in agreement that CD4 is an important
prognostic factor, that is it can predict how you are going to do
over an interval of time,'' said Broder. ``But there is still not an
agreement as to whether you can use CD4 alone. There's no consensus
on that.''

   Ohio Sen. John Glenn and Rep. Mary Rose Oakar
want Congress to look into the Navy's probe of the blast that killed
47 sailors on the USS Iowa.
   After separate briefings Tuesday by Rear Adm. Richard D.
Milligan, who directed the Navy's investigation, Oakar, D-Ohio, said
she was concerned about the ``reputations and families'' of the Iowa
sailors and Glenn, D-Ohio, said, he wanted to make sure such an
explosion wouldn't happen again.
   The Pentagon released a report last week that said
``circumstantial evidence'' indicated gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig
of Cleveland intentionally sparked the April 19 explosion on the
battleship.
   The report called Hartwig the ``principal suspect'' but said it
would be impossible to prove guilose nearby died in
the blast.

<TEXT>
   A 75-year-old man who allegedly told
undercover investigators he sold crack to pay his dying wife's
medical bills pleaded innocent to drug charges.
   Martin Franklin of Santa Rosa was arrested Friday following an
eight-month investigation. He has been held in Sonoma County Jail on
$30,000 bail since the arrest and entered his plea Tuesday.
   ``He's the oldest client I've had charged with selling drugs,''
said L. Stephen Turer, Franklin's lawyer.
   Turer said he hoped to convince Municipal Court Judge Knoel Owen
that his client be freed on supervised probation pending trial
because of on-going problems with his legs.
   ``He's no young man,'' Turer said.
   Police said Franklin sold crack to undercover investigators last
May and June.
   Franklin told investigators he sold the crack to pay for medical
bills accummulated by his 65-year-old wife, who died in July of Lou
Gehrig's disease, said Police Sgt. Ken Knobelauch.
   Police believe Franklin sold crack for a about one year, said
Knobelauch.
   Officers found an unspecified amount of crack in Franklin's truck
and about $1,000 in cash at his home in Santa Rosa when he was
arrested Friday, Knobelauch said.
   Two other men who police believe may have supplied Franklin with
drugs were arrested last week, Knobelauch said.

<HEAD>Utility Rejects Plan to Restart Nuclear Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of the Rancho Seco nuclear
power complex rejected a company's proposal to buy and restart the
plant, apparently ending the possibility that the reactor would be
revived.
   The surprise 5-0 vote by directors of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District was led by Cliff Wilcox, a longtime supporter of
nuclear power and Rancho Seco.
   Wilcox gave a reluctant and emotional rejection of the proposal
from Quadrex Corp., a Campbell-based energy engineering company.
   ``In my estimation it's not a deal that can fly,'' Wilcox said.
He expressed doubts that Quadrex had the expertise or the money to
get the plant going again.
   The municipal utility shut the plant June 7, a day after voters
became the first in the country to order an operating nuclear power
plant to be closed. The reactor had been plagued with problems for
more than a decade and the utility had spent hundreds of millions of
dollars on repairs in recent years.
   Quadrex was the only company to propose reviving Rancho Seco's
nuclear reactor. Other companies have proposed converting the plant
to natural gas.
   Although other proposals to restart the reactor could surface,
any such plan would have to be approved by voters in the utility
district as well as utility directors.
   Just after the directors' vote Monday night, Quadrex chairman
William Derrickson said the utility ``made a giant error, but it's a
free country. They're trading no risk for a lot of risk.''
   But the director of a national anti-nuclear group said he was
delighted with the decision.
   ``This was a triumph of common sense over ideological zealotry
and bravado,'' said Scott Denman of the Safe Energy Communiciations
Council, which is based in Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>East Germans Have Long Had Little Trouble Getting Approval for Hungary
Trips</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Refugees, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germans have long viewed Hungary as an
attractive vacation spot. In recent months, it has also became a
Mecca for thousands hoping for a permanent change of address in the
West.
   Reform-minded Hungary draws tens of thousands of vacationers each
year from from East bloc ally East Germany.
   Traditionally, it has been relatively easy for East Germans to
obtain permission to travel to Hungary, but far more difficult to
get approval for visiting the West.
   In the past, it has usually taken three or four weeks to get
official approval to visit Hungary once an application is filed with
East German police.
   Getting approval to travel to the West can take years, and many
applications are rejected.
   Official figures are not available on the number of East Germans
who file applications to visit Hungary or the West.
   But, according to unofficial estimates, at least 1 million of
East Germany's 16.6 million people want to leave their Communist
homeland for good.
   Hungary has long offered East German vacationers a refreshing
change, even more so since Hungary set out on the road toward major
political reforms.
   A 1969 border agreement between the two countries was an obstacle
to East Germans who might be tempted to try to cross into the West
from Hungary.
   But in May, Hungary began removing its border barriers. At least
6,000 East Germans took advantage of the removals and fled to the
West this summer.
   Then, on Sunday, Budapest announced that any of the 60,000 East
Germans in Hungary who wanted to leave for the West could do so.
   Thousands of those ``vacationers'', many of them having spent
several weeks in refugee camps, headed straight for the Austrian
border and Hungarian officials said thousands more were arriving
from East Germany via Czechoslovakia.

<DATELINE>PASSAU, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bulletin board inside Passau's huge
convention center has become the hub for many East German refugees
trying to catch up with friends and relatives or find jobs and
housing.
   ``To the Drichel family from Coswig. Call Hilda. We've found you
a place to stay,'' reads one note on the board at Niebelungenhalle.
   About 500 of the new arrivals are staying at the center, which
has been filled with bunks and stoves and become a community in
itself.
   Many of the estimated 11,000 refugees who have arrived since
Hungary began letting them flee to the West at midnight Sunday
filled five tent camps near the Austrian border and officials sought
more space in military barracks.
   In Passau, several hundred local residents waited for hours to
greet new arrivals with cheers, tears, hugs and job offers.
   A large banner outside the center said ``Herzlich Willkommen,''
or ``hearfelt greetings.'' Red and silver helium balloons bearing
the same message bobbed among the well-wishers.
   ``This reception is really amazing,'' said Ute Kindl, a young
East German woman. ``I'm really speechless over the warmness and
kindness here.''
   Some said they were deeply grateful to Hungary for opening its
border.
   ``We'll never be able to repay them for this,'' said Heinz
Schmidt.
   Inside Niebelungenhalle, Red Cross and other relief workers
advised the emigres on how to get settled. Local residents donated
hundreds of coats, dresses and other clothes.
   Many refugees roamed the enormous building seeking information
about friends and relatives who had made the trek West.
   One source was the bulletin board.
   ``Hello Michael, I'm at the Wilshofen camp. Your brother,
Andreas,'' said one note, referring to one of several tent
communities for refugees in Bavaria.
   ``Would like to make contact with people from Karl-Marx Stadt (an
East German city). I was born there,'' wrote one woman.
   Another message saids: ``Hello Kirsten! Remember Gabi from
school? Reachable this weekend.'
   The bulletin board also contained offers of jobs ranging from
bakers to nurses and electricians. Many prospective employers have
been accustomed to having difficulty finding skilled craftsmen and
apprentices.
   Hans Klein, chief government spokesman told a news conference
that in Passau alone ``8,000 job offers have been received'' for
emigres.
   While the locals warmly greeted the refugees, elsewhere in West
Germany the flood of emigres _ and ethnic Germans from other parts
of Eastern Europe _ has caused some resentment. A few West Germans
fear the newcomers are taking away jobs and scarce housing.
   Although the emigres were jubilant upon arriving in the West,
some also were worried about possible reprisals against loved ones
left behind in their communist homeland.
   Scores lined up at public telephones to call families in East
Germany and friends and relatives in West Germany.
   ``Our parents still don't know for sure what we have done,'' said
one young man who arrived with his wife from Leipzig. They asked not
to be identified by name to reduce the risk of problems for their
family.
   ``We just hope this won't hurt them. They (East German security
officials) have a way of making life difficult for people whose
relatives have fled to the West,'' the man said.

   The dollar closed marginally lower against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
also declined.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 219.22-point winner
Tuesday, closed at 34,286.94, down 45.94 points or 0.13 percent.
   The dollar closed at 146.70 yen, down 0.03 yen from Tuesday's
close of 146.73 yen. It opened higher at 147.23 yen, and traded
between 146.60 yen and 147.30 yen.
   Currency traders said the dollar, which rose in early trading
following its overnight gains on overseas markets, slipped as market
players in Tokyo sold the currency for position adjustments.
   ``The currency rate was moving very little in Tokyo,'' said Toru
Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   He said trading was mixed, mainly because market players were
reluctant to make major moves prior to U.S. economic reports due out
later this week.
   The United States is to announce a series of economic figures,
including the retail price index for August due out Thursday and
trade figures for July on Friday. Such figures are watched closely
as indicators of U.S. economic performance.
   ``Until then, participants will remain cautious lacking fresh
market-affecting news,'' Kanai said.
   On the stock exchange, the index fell as market players stepped
off to the sidelines, discouraged by the dollar's rebound against
the yen, stock dealers said.
   Participants, mostly institutional investors, sold shipbuilding
and steel issues to take profits from gains the previous day, said a
dealer with a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Gun-Smuggling Case Emerges Into Major Political Issue, Challenge
To Aquino</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple case of gun-running has
emerged as a major national issue, challenging President Corazon
Aquino to deliver on promises to dispense justice and restore ethics
in government regardless of the political cost.
   The episode began Sept. 5 when customs agents at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport found 314 handguns and rifles in baggage
allegedly owned by Rep. Nicanor de Guzman, who had just arrived from
California.
   De Guzman, a member of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino party, denied owning the weapons. Philippine Airlines
claimed he and a Filipino businessman checked in the luggage at Los
Angeles International Airport.
   The incident quickly took on a political dimension. De Guzman, an
obscure lawmaker from Nueva Ecija province, is an associate of Mrs.
Aquino's powerful brother, Rep. Jose ``Peping'' Cojuangco.
   In addition, the incident occurred amid growing discontent over
perceived corruption in government, inaction in Congress, political
favoritism and a breakdown in the criminal justice system.
   De Guzman remains free pending a magistrate's investigation. Last
month, however, Dominique Adams, a 22-year-old Salt Lake City woman,
was jailed after customs found 70 handguns in her luggage.
   She was freed on bail and is awaiting trial.
   Preferential treatment of de Guzman risks charges of political
favoritism similar to what was rampant under ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos. A rush to justice risks undermining the system of
political alliances which has helped keep Mrs. Aquino in power.
   ``What is at stake here is not only the case of one man,'' said
Rep. Oscar Santos. ``This is not for the survival of the political
life of one man but the collective life of Congress itself because
people might no longer believe in us.''
   So much media attention has been generated by the case that even
if de Guzman is innocent and exonerated, many Filipinos will assume
he got off because of political connections.
   ``Almost everything the citizenry detests, hates and abominates
are writ large on this unfortunate affair,'' wrote Mrs. Aquino's
former spokesman Teodoro Benigno in the Philippine Daily Star.
``Unless she (Mrs. Aquino) moves fast and moves dramatically, she
can be overtaken and overpowered by events.''
   Realizing the political risks, presidential advisers moved to
contain the fallout. Through inept handling, they made the situation
worse.
   Two days after the weapons were seized, Mrs. Aquino summoned
reporters and declared there would be ``no white-wash.'' But
reporters' questions centered on rumors that her brother tried to
intercede on de Guzman's behalf.
   ``As soon as I was informed of the discovery of firearms at the
airport, I called up my brother and told him that apparently some
people are dropping your name,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``And definitely,
he has no knowledge of the matter.''
   Mrs. Aquino never fully explained why her first reaction was to
call her brother. Asked why Cojuangco's name was often linked with
political intrigue, Mrs. Aquino delivered a rambling answer which
included the Biblical admonition about those without sin casting the
first stone.
   The next day, headlines in Manila newspapers focused on Mrs.
Aquino's defense of her brother rather than her promise of no
whitewash.
   The de Guzman case also threatens to strain relations between the
administration and the House of Representatives.
   Early today, the House decided to suspend de Guzman for 60 days.
But some congressmen complained the administration wanted to
``sacrifice'' one of their colleagues to boost its image.
   Through a system of alliances forged largely by Cojuangco and
House Speaker Ramon Mitra, the 199-member House had been the more
pro-administration of the two Congressional chambers.
   But relations worsened after the Cabinet announced last month
that firearms imported by House members in 1988 but confiscated by
the military would be publicly burned to show Mrs. Aquino's ``strong
commitment'' to law and order.
   House members were widely criticized for trying to import the
weapons. Many of them felt the Cabinet had revived the embarassing
issue to enhance Mrs. Aquino's reputation at their expense.
   The Cabinet announcement followed a report by a private survey
group, the Social Weather Stations, that Mrs. Aquino's approval rate
among Manila residents had dropped to 35 percent, the lowest of her
administration.

   New York Democrats chose calm, deliberate David Dinkins over
brash Mayor Edward I. Koch, bringing the nation's largest city
closer to electing its first black mayor.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, one of the first blacks to lead a
major U.S. city, savored a big primary victory over a dozen
challengers, and Democrats foiled Republican designs on House seats
in Texas and California that were vacated by Speaker Jim Wright and
Democratic Whip Tony Coelho.
   Tuesday's primary election signaled the end of an era in New
York, although Koch reminded supporters that it wasn't quite up.
   ``You'll have me from now to December 31st,'' he said in a
concession speech. ``I do not intend to keep my mouth shut.''
   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, will face former
federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani in the Nov. 7 election. Giuliani
powdered cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder in an unusually bitter GOP
primary that saw Lauder spend an estimated $12 million on negative
advertising.
   Dinkins won the Democratic nomination by cornering near-unanimous
support from blacks and getting greater-than-expected backing from
whites.
   His theme of uniting the city took on unexpected urgency in
recent weeks after a white mob in Brooklyn attacked and killed a
young black man. Koch angered many blacks with his response to the
killing.
   In a victory speech, Dinkins urged supporters not to savor Koch's
loss. ``We're all together now,'' he said. ``Remember me? I'm the
guy who brings people together.''
   With all the votes counted, Dinkins had 537,313, or 51 percent,
to Koch's 445,816, or 42 percent. Two lesser-known candidates,
former transit chief Richard Ravitch and city Comptroller Harrison
Goldin, split the rest.
   Giuliani had 75,720 votes, or 67 percent, to Lauder's 36,905, or
33 percent. Giuliani will run as the candidate of the Republican,
Liberal and Independent Fusion parties, and said he wanted to be a
mayor in the mold of Fiorello LaGuardia, who served from 1934 to
1945.
   Dinkins was joined at a victory celebration by Jesse Jackson, who
was active in the New York and Detroit mayoral races. Jackson
supported the winner in New York, but wasn't able to rescue the
failed campaign of Rep. John Conyers in Detroit.
   Conyers, a 13-term congressman with a national reputation, was
among the dozen candidates to challenge Young's bid for an
unprecedented fifth term. But accountant Tom Barrow brushed past
Conyers to place second in the primary, giving him the right to go
head-to-head against Young in a November runoff.
   Young steeled his followers for the campaign ahead.
   ``Don't celebrate too long, because the war is not over,'' he
said. ``The victory is not won.''
   With 92 percent of the precincts reporting, Young had 97,618
votes, or 52 percent, to Barrow's 43,230 votes, or 23 percent.
Conyers was third with 33,232, or 18 percent. Ten other candidates
shared the rest.
   With the victories in the two special congressional elections,
Democrats have now won four of six special elections to fill House
vacancies this year. Two more are scheduled.
   In Texas, Democrat Pete Geren narrowly won Wright's Fort Worth
seat, defeating Republican Bob Lanier. With all 223 precincts
reporting, Geren had 40,210 votes, or 51 percent, to 38,590 votes,
or 49 percent, for Lanier.
   ``No one fills the shoes of the speaker of the House,'' said
Geren, a lawyer and former aide to U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. ``It's
going to be a long road back to restoring the clout and the
influence that Fort Worth and Tarrant County have grown used to
having.''
   In California's San Joaquin Valley, Assemblyman Gary Condit
defeated seven candidates, including his main Republican rival,
former Assemblyman Clare Berryhill.
   With all precincts reporting, Condit had 50,527 votes, or 57
percent, to 31,166 for Berryhill, or 35 percent. Five other
Republicans and a Libertarian divided the remainder.
   By getting more than 50 percent, Condit avoided a runoff.
   Several cities besides New York and Detroit held mayoral
primaries:
   _ Buffalo, N.Y., Mayor James Griffin defeated two challengers in
the Democratic primary and ran unopposed on the Republican,
Conservative and Right to Life party ballots.
   _ In New Haven, Conn., where Mayor Biagio DeLieto is retiring,
state Sen. John Daniels defeated former city administrator John
DeStefano Jr. in the Democratic primary, making it virtually certain
that he will become the city's first black mayor.
   _ Minneapolis Mayor Don Fraser easily topped a field of seven
candidates in a non-partisan primary but still must face his leading
challenger, firefighter Jens Peterson, in November. Both ran on the
Democratic Farmer Labor Party label.
   _ In neighboring St. Paul, where Mayor George Latimer is
retiring, City Council President Jim Schneibel, also of the DFL, led
a field of nine candidates. Former City Councilman Bob Fletcher
finished second and will face Schneibel in November.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Pete Geren barely defeated a
Republican for the seat held 34 years by another Democrat _ Rep. Jim
Wright. Then he acknowledged he faced a big job in Washington.
   ``No one fills the shoes of the speaker of the House,'' Geren
said. ``It's going to be a long road back to restoring the clout and
the influence that Fort Worth and Tarrant County have grown used to
having.''
   Geren received 40,210 votes, or 51 percent, to 38,590 ballots, or
49 percent, for television commentator Dr. Bob Lanier in Tuesday's
special election runoff to replace Wright, who resigned during an
ethics investigation.
   The 37-year-old winner, a former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, will serve the remainder of Wright's term, which ends next
year.
   Lanier, who received endorsements from President Bush and former
Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, told supporters not to throw away
campaign signs because he'll probably challenge Geren in 1990 for
the seat.
   ``We don't feel like we really lost that much,'' said the
44-year-old political newcomer. ``I mean, we did better than
anybody's done in this county for this particular party.''
   Lanier led Geren and six other candidates in a special election
Aug. 12, but didn't gain a majority, making the runoff necessary. He
is featured as medical commentator on ``60-Second Housecall,'' a
television spot syndicated to local news broadcasts in more than 40
television markets.
   Republicans had hoped to break the Democrats' grip on the
district, but Geren raised almost twice as much money as Lanier and
had previous experience: a 1986 loss to Republican Joe Barton for a
different congressional district.
   Voters showed little interest in the campaign. About 27 percent
of the 287,000 registered voters turned out.
   Wright resigned in June amid allegations he repeatedly violated
congressional ethics rules involving speaking fees and business
deals.
   During the campaign to succeed Wright, Geren and Lanier
emphasized their endorsements and differing backgrounds.
   Geren, endorsed by Wright and Bentsen, cited his experience as a
legislative aide.
   Lanier said he was in better touch with his constituents'
concerns than his opponent.
   Geren supports sending U.S. troops to Colombia to fight drug
dealers, opposes restrictions on owning semiautomatic weapons and
signed a pledge to vote against any new taxes. He said the war on
drugs will be his first concern on Capitol Hill.

   The last 13 otter pups rounded up after the
Exxon Valdez oil spill six months ago have been shipped from Alaska
to the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium.
   The otters arrived Tuesday and were to spend up to three months
at Point Defiance before being sent to zoos and aquariums around the
United States, said associate zoo director Lily Moore.
   She said the otters cannot be released in the wild because they
have become too accustomed to people.
   A staff paid by Exxon will provide 24-hour care for the otters
until they go to other zoos. They will not be on public display.
   The 13 otters either were rescued from the nation's worst oil
spill or born to mothers who had been brought to animal care centers
in Seward and Valdez, Alaska, after the March 24 spill in Prince
William Sound.
   ``These are orphans of the spill that will go other places,
hopefully to remind people there is a place otters can live in the
wild, and that place is fragile,'' said Bruce Batten of the U.S.
Fish &amp; Wildlife Service in Anchorage.
   The wildlife service said only the Anchorage eagle center and the
Seward bird center still are caring for wildlife harmed by the spill.

<HEAD>BLM Orders Closure of 59 Square Miles of Desert to Protect Tortoise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will close 59 square
miles of the Mojave Desert under an emergency quarantine in hopes of
protecting the endangered desert tortoise.
   ``There is some evidence that some of the users out there are
increasing the stress level in the tortoise,'' said Barbara
Maxfield, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman in Riverside.
   ``Vandalism is the major cause for the decline in the
population.''
   The closure, to begin Oct. 1 and last up to a year, will affect
recreationalists, specifically off-road enthusiasts who drive
all-terrain vehicles through the desert, Mrs. Maxfield said Tuesday.
   Sheep grazing will continue as long as enough forage is left for
the sheep. Sheep ranchers must apply for special permission to set
foot on the land, officials said.
   Gerald Hillier, BLM California Desert district manager, said a
minimum of 350 pounds of food for sheep must be available per acre.
   ``The desert tortoises must have emerged before we will allow the
sheep on public lands,'' Hillier said. ``No more than five bands of
800 animals each will be permitted.''
   He said there were provisions for miners also.
   The quarantine area is north of this desert city, 70 miles north
of Los Angeles.
   It was called so that researchers could monitor the species,
which was placed on the endangered list Aug. 4 by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   Biologists are concerned that a respiratory disease is killing
thousands of the burrowing tortoises, which can live up to 80 years.
Ravens and man's encroachment on the desert also threaten the desert
animals.
   The non-profit Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee estimated last
year that since the 1920s, population has declined from an estimated
1,000 per square mile to as few as 20 per square mile in some parts
of the Mojave in California.
   Designation of the desert tortoise as an endangered species has
disrupted a construction boom in Las Vegas. The gambling city and
several other parties filed suit last month in federal court in
Washington, D.C., claiming restrictions on building should be
confined only to areas where the respiratory disease is a problem.
   Two off-road races scheduled for Sunday in the desert were
canceled by the BLM because of fears the motorcycles and
four-wheel-drive vehicles would upset the species. The American
Motorcyclist Association, which sponsored both races, said the BLM's
decision discriminates against off-road enthusiasts.
   Signs may be posted to warn of the closure and some fencing may
be erected, Mrs. Maxfield said. Ranger patrols will be increased,
she added, saying that those caught in the area would be cited for
trespassing.

   Edward I. Koch's first mayoral campaign lasted
just 45 days, and ended with neither a whimper nor a bang. It ended
in silence _ no one paid attention to this liberal congressman in
1973.
   What was trumpeted as Koch's last campaign for mayor ended
Tuesday with a thumping defeat that altered the political landscape
of the nation's largest city, perhaps forever.
   The man whose feisty, nasal tones came to signify New York for 12
years was defeated by Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, who
became the city's first black mayoral nominee of a major party. And
everybody was paying attention this time.
   ``I want you not to feel sorry for me,'' Koch, 64, told
supporters, saying he had had ``12 glorious years as mayor.''
   ``Believe me, there is a life after the mayoralty,'' he said.
   Koch congratulated Dinkins saying, ``he won it fairly, squarely
and by a large margin _ a substantial victory.''
   Koch lost for many reasons. Among them:
   _Early in his administration, he alienated many blacks by closing
a Harlem hospital after promising to keep it open. He was constantly
accused of racial insensitivity, especially when he suggested Jews
would have to be crazy to vote for presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson in 1988.
   _His third term was besieged by corruption. Queens Borough
President Donald Manes committed suicide as scandals were uncovered.
Indictments followed.
   _Many grew tired of Koch's act. Irish-Americans were infuriated
when he said the British army was a peacekeeping force, not an army
of occupation. Others were offended when he declared war on street
peddlers.
   Twelve years ago, his outspoken behavior charmed many.
   Koch, the Bronx-born son of Polish immigrants, began his
political career as a liberal.
   In 1963, he toppled Democratic Party boss Carmine DeSapio in a
race for district leader. Koch was elected to City Council in 1966
and to Congress from Manhattan's Silk Stocking district two years
later.
   His 1973 campaign for mayor foundered for lack of money, and 1977
did not look much more encouraging. He faced seven other candidates,
including incumbent Abe Beame and the flamboyant Bella Abzug.
   In the summer of the Son of Sam serial killings, Koch pounded
away at one issue _ the death penalty. His ads were created by media
wizard David Garth, he often was seen arm-in-arm with former Miss
America Bess Myerson.
   Coming from nowhere, Koch was the top vote-getter in the primary.
In a runoff, he defeated New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo; in
November, he beat Cuomo, who was the Liberal nominee, and two others.
   He kept his one-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village, though he
grew more accustomed to life in Gracie Mansion. He took the subway
to his inauguration. He rejoiced in cheap wines and Chinese
restaurants.
   Koch had an opinion on just about everything. When President
Carter came to town, Koch greeted him with a letter protesting
administration policy on the Middle East. He called Carter's
brother, Billy, a ``whacko.''
   Koch wrote a best-seller, ``Mayor,'' then ``Politics'' and, in
collaboration with Cardinal John O'Connor, ``His Eminence and
Hizzoner.''
   ``How'm I doin'?'' the mayor asked again and again.
   The answer, for a long time, was positive. Koch was credited with
managing city government well and helping New York emerge from the
fiscal crisis. He was re-elected by an overwhelming margin in 1981.
   His first setback came in 1982. After promising he never would
seek another elective office, he announced his candidacy for
governor. Cuomo beat him.
   In 1985, Koch easily won re-election again. Then things began to
fall apart.
   The scandals erupted. Koch suffered a minor stroke. A patronage
scheme operating out of City Hall was uncovered. The mayor never was
accused of corruption, but the damage had been done.
   Also, two black men died in separate confrontations with white
gangs, the second just weeks before the election.
   Problems that were not issues in 1977 _ drugs, AIDS, homelessness
_ plagued the city. Koch's ratings plunged to under 30 percent. But
he fought back, closing Dinkins' lead.
   ``I've had 12 wonderful years and expect to have four more,''
Koch said earlier Tuesday. ``But I have had a professional life that
everybody could envy. I've enjoyed _ with the pain, occasionally _
every day.''

   A rocket-mounted telescope has provided
the clearest photographs ever taken of a solar flare and the sun's
outer corona, a scientist said.
   With only a 1{-hour launch window on Monday, scientists halted
the countdown two minutes before ignition and waited for signs of a
solar flare before launching the telescope aboard a 50-foot rocket
from White Sands Missile Range.
   Leon Golub, a Harvard University astrophysicist who headed the
project, said he received satellite data indicating an increase in
X-rays associated with solar flares before resuming the countdown.
   The rocket soared to a height of about 200 miles before
parachuting back to Earth with 40 frames of exposed film.
   Solar flares are eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of
the sun, sending waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged
particles out into space. They can disrupt communications and cause
northern lights on Earth.
   The sun currently is at the peak of an 11-year cycle for flare
activity, but even so no more than 10 flares occur each day, Golub
said in a telephone interview late Tuesday from Sunspot, N.M.
   In a photograph released Tuesday, dramatic disturbances are seen
swirling all across the face of the sun, including one peculiar
double-loop flare that Golub said he could not explain.
   Elsewhere, bright loops are all part of the corona, a layer of
ionized gas surrounding the sun, he said.
   ``This picture shows much more detail than has ever been seen
before in the corona,'' Golub said.
   The photo also revealed a small point of bright light on the
sun's surface. One theory suggests that such bright points are
minimal during peak flare periods and increase dramatically as
flares subside. Golub said he hopes to take more photos during a
time of minimum solar activity in about five years to see if there
are more bright points.
   ``This is the first time we've ever really been able to see one
of those little things,'' he said of the small bright spot. ``If we
look again at solar minimum, the sun might actually be covered with
hundreds of those small regions.''
   Golub said his camera improved on earlier models by using a
mirror with multiple coatings that screen out all but one X-ray
wavelength.

   The dollar edged down a fraction against the yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index declined.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had gained
219.22 points Tuesday, closed at 34,286.94. It was down 45.94
points, or 0.13 percent, from Tuesday's finish of 34,332.88 points.
   Volume was estimated at a thin 600 million shares, compared with
a daily average of 1 billion.
   The dollar opened higher at 147.23 yen, and ranged between 146.60
yen and 147.30 yen. It closed at 146.70 yen, down 0.03 yen from

dealers sold the currency or stood aside to await U.S. economic data
due for release later this week.
   ``The currency rate was showing little movement in Tokyo,'' said
Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   He said trading was mixed, mainly because dealers were reluctant
to make major moves before U.S. economic reports due out Thursday
and Friday. They include the retail price index for August and trade
figures for July.
   ``Until then, participants will remain cautious,'' Kanai said.
   On the stock market, the key index fell as investors remained on
the sidelines, discouraged by the little movement in the dollar's
rate, dealers said.

<HEAD>Restaurant Owner Drops No-Blacks Policy for James Brown's Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restaurant owner says he dropped a
longstanding policy of refusing to serve black customers after
enjoying a visit from an attorney for soul singer James Brown.
   Bruce Salter, operator of the Buffalo Room, said he would
continue serving blacks ``as long as they don't come in and tear up
the place.''
   Salter's policy against serving blacks has made the Buffalo Room
the subject of investigations by the FBI, Justice Department civil
rights division and the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission.
   George Hill, a black lawyer whose client Brown is in prison in
Columbia, said Salter let him into the restaurant and bar twice
Tuesday.
   Hill said he had read that Salter claimed to have once kicked
Brown out of his establishment.
   ``I wanted to check it out,'' Hill said.
   Hill said when he knocked on the door early Tuesday afternoon,
Salter slammed the door in his face. Hill waited at the door and
Salter peeped his head out and asked what he wanted.
   ``I told him, `I think you're a nice man,''' Hill said.
   Salter again retreated. About five minutes later he walked out
onto the covered porch and asked Hill what he had meant about being
a nice man.
   ``He was breathing fire when I first came,'' Hill said.
``Eventually he invited me in. We came into the bar first and then
he said `come on in the dining room and sit down, I want to talk to
you some more.' It turned into a 2{ hour visit.''
   Salter said he invited Hill back because Hill is an intelligent
man and he enjoyed talking to him.
   Hill said he believes Salter will continue serving blacks, and
did not invite him in just because the alcohol commission has
scheduled a license revocation hearing for the Buffalo Room on Oct.
12.
   Asked whether admitting Hill had anything to do with the hearing,
Salter said: ``I ain't gong to say nothing. Let them think what they
want.''
   The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis
of race in such public places as restaurants. Conviction carries a
maximum sentence of a $1,000 fine and a year in prison.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incumbent James Griffin defeated two
challengers in a a Democratic primary, bringing him within striking
distance of an unprecedented fourth four-year term.
   Griffin received 28,490 votes, or 41 percent, on Tuesday to
24,568 ballots, or 36 percent, for former city Judge Wilbur Trammell
and 15,971, or 23 percent, for state Assemblyman William Hoyt.
   Trammell had been seeking to become the city's first black mayor.
Hoyt was endorsed by the party.
   The victory gave Griffin four ballot lines in the Nov. 7 general
election. He was unchallenged in the primary as the endorsed
candidate of the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life parties.
   ``I think people realized what we've done over the past 12
years,'' Griffin, 60, said Tuesday night. ``And, I ran a positive
campaign, I think people responded to that.''
   Hoyt, 52, and Trammell, 62, also are expected to be on the
November ballot. Hoyt has the Liberal Party's endoresement and
Trammell is seeking to run as an independent.
   Griffin campaigned mostly on his record, saying he revitalized
downtown and the Lake Erie waterfront, helped restore neighborhoods
and created jobs.
   Trammell received campaign help from former Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and
former Rep. Shirley Chisolm, D-N.Y.

   A judge fined three members of the rap groups
NWA and Too Short $100 each on charges of disorderly conduct, saying
their Riverfront Coliseum concert was lewd and disgraceful.
   Too Short member Todd Shaw, 23, of Hayward, Calif., and NWA
members Osea ``Ice Cube'' Jackson, 20, of Los Angeles, and Lorenzo
Patterson, 22, of Long Beach, Calif., also were ordered to pay $30
each in court costs.
   Two other NWA members also faced municipal court hearings on the
charges. Antoine Carraby, 27, of Compton, Calif., was to appear
today, and Eric ``Eazy-E'' Wright, 25, also of Compton, is scheduled
for a hearing Monday.
   Municipal Judge Harry H. McIlwain on Tuesday rejected a motion to
dismiss the case on grounds the charges violated the performers'
freedom of speech rights. The judge stayed the fines for 30 days to
let the performers appeal.
   ``I want you to appeal, and I just hope the courts don't make the
same kind of mistake with this that they did with the decision to
allow burning the American flag,'' McIlwain told lawyers for the
performers, who didn't appear in court.
   Defense Attorney Louis Sirkin conceded that the performers
repeatedly asked members of the youthful audience to come onto the
stage to engage in sex acts, but said that didn't constitute
disorderly conduct.
   ``What may be offensive to some is entertainment to others,''
Sirkin said.
   Ernest McAdams Jr., assistant city prosecutor, retorted, ``The
First Amendment was not designed to protect people ... from public
obscenity charges.''

<HEAD>CNN to Launch New Hour-Long Newscast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network plans to launch an assault on
the three major broadcast networks next month with an hour-long
dinner-time newscast.
   CNN, which went after the big three TV networks in 1980 with
round-the-clock news, will begin airing the newscast from 6 p.m.-7
p.m. EDT on Oct. 16.
   Because the network's newscasts are carried live in each time
zone, the program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast.
   Currently, CNN runs ``Newswatch'' from 5-6:30 p.m. EDT and shows
the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m. CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said the new plan calls for ``Show Biz
Today'' to air at 5:30 p.m. EDT and ``Newswatch'' to run from 5-5:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   Haworth said the program would be designed to ``go head-to-head
with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of news at 6:30
p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   CNN, which started in June 1980, has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows. But most of its 24-hour schedule is updated news
presentations.

<TEXT>
   Accountant Tom Barrow knocked off 13-term
congressman John Conyers in the city's non-partisan mayoral primary
to win a spot in a runoff against four-term incumbent Coleman Young.
   ``You can run Coleman, but you can't hide,'' Barrow, a nephew of
prizefighter Joe Louis, told frenzied supporters Tuesday night at
his victory rally.
   ``It's time for you to come on out here because we're going to
talk about issues. You're gonna have to explain, Coleman, why it is
that crime is so bad and what you intend to do to stop it.''
   Young, the city's first black mayor and dean of the nation's
black city executives, wouldn't commit to a debate with Barrow, whom
he beat 61 percent to 39 percent in the 1985 election.
   With all precincts reporting, Young had 103,827 votes, or 51
percent, and Barrow had 48,695 votes, or 24 percent. Conyers was
third with 36,247, or 18 percent. Ten other candidates, including
City Council President Erma Henderson in a distant fourth place,
shared the rest of the vote.
   Young, 71, celebrated at a jammed reception where music from
Michael Jackson's ``Bad'' album boomed over a sound system.
   ``Don't celebrate too long, because the war is not over,'' he
said. ``The victory is not won.''
   Conyers, who entered the race a day before the filing deadline in
May, refused to concede during a brief appearance at a reception
Tuesday night.
   Barrow, 40, campaigned practically since losing the 1985 race.
But he has never held office and does not have a well-financed
political machine to match Young's.
   ``I think Barrow unfortunately is not going to be able to
mobilize the kind of organizational structure necessary to unseat
the mayor,'' said Wilbur Rich, an associate professor of political
science at Wayne State University and the author of a Young
biography. ``I think he'll try to replay the 1985 election, which is
not going to be enough to give the mayor serious competition.''
   Barrow campaigned on what he called Young's favoritism of
downtown development over neighborhood renewal. Young, meanwhile,
pointed to jobs and riverfront development created during his 16
years in office.
   Young reported raising $5 million for what he says is his last
election, an unprecedented fifth term. Barrow campaign manager
Geoffrey Garfield said Barrow's grassroots approach can match
Young's media barrage.
   ``We out-organized everybody else, that's why we won,'' Garfield
said. ``It wasn't about the media, the radio or computers. We had
people power and went door to door.
   ``Now that people know that Coleman can be beaten, we expect
fund-raising will pick up. We got this far against a 25-year
congressman that everyone thought was going to wipe us out. It was
the most organized campaign this city has seen in 20 years.''
   Conyers, whose campaign appeared unfocused, was given a slight
edge over Barrow in pre-election polls because of his name
recognition and quarter-century in Congress representing Detroit's
west side.

<HEAD>Competitors Must Pay Procter &amp; Gamble $125 Million For Recipe Ripoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three major cookie manufacturers have
been ordered to pay Procter &amp; Gamble Co. $125 million to settle a
5-year-old patent infringement case.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Longobardi signed a consent
judgment Tuesday, saying Keebler Co. of Elmhurst, Ill., Nabisco
Brands Inc. of East Hanover, N.J., and Frito-Lay Inc. of Dallas,
infringed on Procter &amp; Gamble's patent for homestyle cookies
marketed under the Duncan Hines label.
   The case was scheduled to go to trial in October, but an
agreement among the companies was reached late Monday that says
Procter &amp; Gamble's patents are valid and enforceable, according to
Donald P. Tassone, spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company.
   Keebler is to pay $52.9 million for the Soft Batch cookie it
introduced in 1984; Nabisco will pay $52.9 million for its Almost
Home Brand; and Frito-Lay will pay $19.1 million for its Grandmas
Rich and Chewy product.
   Once the lawsuit was filed, the formulas for the three products
were changed.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said after it test-marketed its soft cookie in
January 1983, the three competitors pirated the formula and beat it
to the market.
   The company sued the three in 1984.
   The competitors countered that the patent was not valid.
   ``It was very frustrating to see our competitors, who were
already in the cookie business, beating us to market in most of the
country with the very product we had developed and patented,'' said
John E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The cookie brand never reached its projected market share,
Tassone said.
   ``The settlement will help, but it will not make up for what we
lost,'' he said.
   Nabisco said it was ``delighted the protracted legal battle was
settled and that the settlement will not hurt parent RJR Nabisco's
earnings.
   Frito-Lay said the settlement will be paid by insurance and will
have no effect on the earnings of its parent company, PepsiCo Inc.
   Stuart L. Greenblatt, spokesman for Keebler, said homestyle
cookies have not been the market blockbuster that was originally
anticipated.
   The cookies' market share began declining ``almost as soon as
they were introduced,'' said Manfredi.
   ``The cookies didn't turn out to be the bonanza expected,'' said
James F. Burnett of Potter, Anderson &amp; Corroon, which represented
Frito-Lay.

   The winner of the first preliminary
swimsuit competition in this year's Miss America Pageant says she
didn't eat the most recommended meal for a young woman about to
parade down a runway.
   ``I had five cookies for dinner,'' Miss Missouri, Debbye Turner,
said after Tuesday's competition. Wearing a blue terry-cloth robe
over her canary yellow swimsuit, she said, ``I don't believe in
starving.''
   Meanwhile, Miss Ohio, Kristin Huffman, won the first preliminary
talent competition with a powerful vocal performance.
   Miss Huffman, who has said she does not want to be known as a
``bible banger,'' could not resist giving thanks to her parents and
the power of their prayer for her victory.
   ``I felt good vibes from them,'' she said of her parents, both
singers, who were in the audience.
   Miss Turner, a 5-foot-7{, 118-pound brunette from Mexico, Mo.,
said she may have even put on a little weight since winning her
state pageant.
   ``I was probably a little smaller three months ago,'' she said.
   However, she said she had worked hard through aerobic
weightlifting to maintain her figure. ``Being on stage in a swimsuit
does motivate one not to have tummy,'' she said.
   The 23-year-old senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia
Veterinary School lists as one of her hobbies collecting ``surgery
souvenirs,'' which include puppy fetuses and cat spines.
   Miss Huffman, a 24-year-old from Canal Winchester, Ohio, sang a
classical piece titled ``Csardas'' to win the talent contest.
   ``My major goal is just to make sure people enjoy it,'' she said.
   She performed her powerful number in a tomato-red sheath trimmed
in gold sequins and a flowing red train, and carried a sequined mask
decorated with red ostrich feathers.
   Miss Huffman, an olive-eyed blonde who hopes to become an opera
singer and teach voice at a college, said she knew she performed
well because ``the heat was coming off me.''
   She recently graduated from Northwestern University with a
master's degree in music. For 21 years, she has performed with her
family's professional singing group for community, business and
church groups.
   Tuesday's competition was the first of three nights of swimsuit,
talent and evening gown rounds. The winners of the evening gown
competitions will be kept secret to heighten the suspense for the
final night.
   The preliminary competitions for the 51 contestants are the first
steps to the live televised Miss America Pageant on Saturday. On
Friday night, the contestants participate in the colorful Miss
America Parade on the resort's Boardwalk.
   The 10 women who accumulate the most points in the preliminary
rounds and interviews with the judges will start all over again
Saturday night for the right to succeed Miss America 1989, Gretchen
Elizabeth Carlson.
   The 63rd annual pageant will air live on NBC-TV at 10 p.m. EDT
Saturday. Gary Collins and Miss America 1971, Phyllis George Brown,
will be the hosts.

<HEAD>Ten Sentenced For March Rioting In Tibet</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Some Tibetans have only one name.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tibetan courts have sentenced 10 people, Buddhist
monks among them, to prison terms of up to life on charges of
rioting and spying for the Dalai Lama during an anti-Chinese
uprising in March, China said today.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said an intermediate court in the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa on sentenced Passang to life imprisonment
for ``beating, smashing, looting and burning'' during the three-day
disturbance in which 16 people were killed by official count.
   Tibetans said between 20 and 30 died.
   Xinhua said Cering Ngoizhu, 57, was given a 12-year prison term
for inciting young people to sing Tibetan independence songs and
participate in the disturbances.
   It said three men were convicted of spying for the ``Dalai Lama
clique,'' a reference to supporters of Tibet's former spiritual
leader who fled to India with the Dalai Lama following a failed 1959
uprising against the Chinese army.
   One man, Ngoizhu, was sentenced to 11 years for spying, and two
others, both former lamas or monks in Lhasa, were given five-year
terms for collecting information about the March uprising for the
Dalai Lama, the agency said.
   Two other monks were sent to prison for four and three years for
hanging the banned Tibetan flag in their monastery and shouting
reactionary slogans during the demonstrations, Xinhua said. Three
more men received sentences of up to eight years for looting and
destruction of property.
   The dispatch said all 10 men were sentenced on Tuesday but did
not say when or where they were convicted.
   In July, the Lhasa Intermediate Court sentenced 10 other men to
lighter terms for ``counterrevolutionary'' activities during the
riots.
   China declared martial law in Lhasa on March 8 and arrested
hundreds of participants in the demonstrations.
   Martial law is still in force and foreign journalists are still
barred from visiting the city. There has been some relaxation on
visits by foreign tourists, a major source of revenue for the
impoverished mountain area, with approved groups of three or more
now allowed into Lhasa.
   The violent clash with Chinese security forces was the fourth
major pro-independence disturbance in Lhasa since September 1987.
Many Tibetans reject Chinese claims that Tibet has been part of
China for 700 years, and are resentful of past suppression of
Tibetan religion and culture.
   The Dalai Lama has suggested that Tibet be granted self-autonomy
in all matters except defense and foreign policy, a proposal the
Beijing government has rejected. More radical Tibetans have called
for the establishment of a sovereign nation under the Dalai Lama.

   Democratic state Assemblyman Gary Condit
won a special election for the seat of former House Democratic Whip
Tony Coelho, who resigned in June rather than face a probe of his
finances.
   Relying heavily on Coelho's loyal supporters and strong political
organization in this agricultural San Joaquin Valley district,
Condit won 57 percent of the vote in Tuesday's primary and easily
avoided a November runoff.
   Clare Berryhill, a 64-year-old Republican rancher, former state
legislator and ex-director of the state agriculture department, was
a distant second.
   With all precincts reporting, Condit had 50,527 votes to
Berryhill's 31,166, or 35 percent. Five other Republicans and a
Libertarian divided the remaining 8 percent.
   Under state law, all candidates appear on the same primary
ballot, allowing voters to cross party lines.
   Coelho left the House following disclosures that he failed to
report a $50,000 loan to finance a junk bond deal. He said there was
nothing improper about the loan and that it was not reported because
of a clerical error.
   But the incident was magnified because it coincided with the
ethics probe and downfall of former House Speaker Jim Wright, and
Coelho said he wanted to avoid giving Republicans two prominent
Democratic targets.
   Though Coelho left Congress under a cloud, Condit and Berryhill
said Tuesday night that Coelho's support was a major factor in the
41-year-old Democrat's victory. Condit will serve the remainder of
Coelho's term, which expires in 1990.
   ``They had Tony Coelho's political machine behind them, so they
were better organized. We were at a disadvantage from the very
beginning,'' Berryhill said.
   Condit said Coelho's resignation was not an issue because ``the
voters in this district respected the way Tony stepped down. He was
a great asset to the district.''
   Instead of keeping his distance, Condit used television ads and
mailings that stressed his ties to Coelho.
   ``I feel fabulous. It's a great victory,'' a jubilant Condit told
about 300 supporters at his victory party.
   Major issues in the race included abortion, highway congestion
and agricultural problems.
   Condit said he personally opposed abortion but saw it as a
``personal decision that one needs to make for one's self.''
Berryhill opposed abortion except in cases involving rape, incest
and a threat to the life of the mother, and he claimed the support
of the California Pro Life Council.
   Robert Weimer, a Republican who fashioned himself as ``the only
full-blown pro-choice candidate,'' drew only 3.3 percent of the vote.

   Showers and thunderstorms drenched parts of the south-central
United States today as central Oklahoma got more than 5 inches of
rain, and precipitation continued from the southern Plains into
western Missouri.
   Flash flood watches were in effect for parts of Texas as well as
Oklahoma.
   Late evening thunderstorms in Oklahoma produced high winds in the
Okemah area, damaging several homes and knocking down trees and
power lines.
   Thunderstorms also struck southern Arizona, producing golf
ball-size hail and 61 mph gusts at Sierra Vista.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed from western North
Carolina to Delaware early this morning.
   Rain fell in the middle Mississippi Valley, and along the
southern Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
   Fair skies prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   In eastern Colorado a snow advisory was posted for the northern
foothills, the Palmer Divide, and the northern and central mountains
where 4 to 7 inches were expected.
   A freeze advisory was in effect this morning for northeastern
Colorado, and central Wyoming, and a frost advisory for northeastern
Minnesota.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from Florida and the Gulf Coast region, the Tennessee and lower
Mississippi Valley to the southern Plains, as well as the central
and southern Appalachians; rain widespread from the central Rockies
across the central Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley into the
upper Great Lakes.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 70s and 80s across
much of the nation.
   Highs likely would be 10 to 20 degrees below normal across the
Central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley.
   Other predicted highs: 60s in northern Maine; 90s from Florida
and southern Georgia across the Gulf Coast region into southern
Texas; and 90 to 105 from the desert Southwest into interior valleys
of California and Oregon.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29 degrees at
Yellowstone Park in Wyoming to 85 at Phoenix.
   Other reports:

<HEAD>Police Arrest Alleged Instigator in Murky Uranium Sale Case</HEAD>

   Police today arrested a man they said organized a
still unexplained effort to sell uranium to the U.S. Embassy in
Tokyo, officials said.
   So far, nine people have been arrested in the case on charges of
illegally handling the radioactive element.
   Japanese law requires special authorization to handle the
element, which can be used in nuclear power generation and to make
nuclear weapons.
   Investigators still have not learned where those involved
obtained the uranium or why they tried to sell it to the embassy for
more than 2,000 times its market price of $275 an ounce, said an
official of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the
last of those arrested as Kouki Tomoda, 51, an antique art dealer
and former underworld gang member from Yamatotakada in Nara
prefecture, southwestern Japan.
   Tomoda, arrested at a Tokyo hotel, had been on a wanted list
since Sunday, when police seized 8.8 pounds of uranium from an
acquaintance of his in Kurume, Fukuoka prefecture, about 560 miles
southwest of Tokyo.
   The acquaintance, a food dealer identified as Masateru Yuwasaki,
41, also has been arrested, the official said.
   He said Tomoda was suspected of having sold a capsule containing
3.6 ounces of refined natural uranium to Masao Kikuchi, 54, a former
veterinarian, for about $55,000 in June. Kikuchi also is among those
arrested.
   Police said the group took this sample to the U.S. Embassy on
Aug. 8 and proposed to sell another 8.8 pounds for $83 million.
   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the embassy would not comment while the case is under investigation.
Earlier, the embassy said in a statement it had cooperated fully
with Japanese authorities.
   Those arrested earlier included a 43-year-old woman who owns
several small companies, a 44-year-old real estate firm owner, the
president of a securities firm in Hong Kong and a shrine employee.
   Uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable
material known as isotope U-235.
   An analysis by the Science and Technology Agency showed the
sample taken to the embassy contained 0.7 percent U-235.
   Nuclear experts say nuclear power generation needs uranium
containing more than 3 percent U-235 and a nuclear bomb needs
uranium that contains more than 90 percent U-235.
   Violation of uranium handling provisions in Japan's nuclear
safety laws carries a penalty of up to a year in prison or a fine of
up to $3,500.

   David Dinkins lost the first office he was
elected to when the Harlem district he represented in the state
Assembly was gerrymandered out of existence.
   Now Dinkins is charting new political territory.
   Tuesday night he became the first black politician ever nominated
by a major party to run for mayor of New York City, defeating Mayor
Edward I. Koch in the Democratic primary. He will face Republican
nominee Rudolph Giuliani in his bid to become the city's first black
mayor.
   ``You, the people of New York, made history today and I promise
you I shall never let you down,'' Dinkins, 62, told supporters at
his victory celebration.
   Koch also had sought to make history _ he was pursuing an
unprecedented fourth term. But Dinkins blamed him for ethnic and
racial tensions and corruption scandals. The fatal shooting of a
black teen-ager confronted by a gang of whites three weeks before
the election heightened the issue of race.
   Racial harmony was a centerpiece of Dinkins' campaign, and he
portrayed himself as a ``healer.''
   ``We're all together now. Remember me? I'm the guy that brings
people together,'' Dinkins said in his victory speech.
   To Dinkins' supporters, such an attitude is typical. They say he
is cautious and thoughtful, a conciliator and consensus-builder.
   They also say he is a gentleman. Even opponents like the
contentious Koch agree Dinkins is ``a very decent guy.''
   But some question whether a nice guy can run a city facing a
myriad of difficult problems, stand up to special interests fighting
over its $27 billion budget and ride herd over its more than 200,000
employees.
   ``He has been careful to the point of timidity and his indecision
sometimes frustrates his colleagues,'' The New York Times said of
Dinkins when it endorsed Koch.
   His friends say that's unfair.
   ``Some people try to be critical of the fact that he gives
reasoned, well thought-out opinions, which should be valued in
public officials,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel.
   A Trenton, N.J., native, he graduated in 1950 from Howard
University with a mathematics degree. He moved to Harlem in 1951 and
was married two years later.
   Dinkins graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1956 and became a
Democratic district leader. In 1965, he won a state Assembly seat
but lost a re-election bid after his district was reapportioned.
   He served as city clerk for 10 years until he was elected
Manhattan borough president in 1985 on his third attempt. He is the
city's highest elected black officeholder.
   He has been outspoken against apartheid in South Africa, yet was
slow to comment on the case of Tawana Brawley, a black teen-ager who
claimed she was sexually assaulted by a group of white men. When he
did he was critical of her advisers. He also has denounced
statements by Louis Farrakhan as anti-Semitic.
   In a display of independence, he supported Jesse Jackson's 1984
presidential bid when other black leaders backed Walter Mondale.
Jackson returned the favor by coming to New York twice to campaign
for Dinkins.
   Dinkins has been haunted by the four years _ 1968-71 _ when he
neglected to pay his state income taxes. The slip was revealed in
1973 and cost him a deputy mayor's post. Dinkins paid $15,000 in
back taxes and admitted his negligence.
   He brushes off questions about that now, saying it was an
oversight that he rectified.
   Of average height and with a slight paunch, Dinkins exudes
confidence and carries himself in a reserved and dignified manner.
He's an avid tennis player with a mean forehand, even though he's a
grandfather.
   ``I've been described as a nice guy, as a gentleman,'' Dinkins
said last February. ``But I'm also an ex-Marine. And I don't intend
for a second to get shoved around in this or any other campaign.''

   Kiko Kawashima and her parents, a college professor
and a housewife, sat down to a private dinner with their future
in-laws _ the emperor and empress of Japan.
   The dinner Tuesday at the Akasaka Palace in central Tokyo capped
a hectic day for the Kawashimas that began with a meeting of top
government officials to discuss whether their daughter was worthy of
marrying into the world's oldest imperial family.
   As the 10-member Imperial Household Council, headed by Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, met at the palace, a battalion of reporters
and cameramen staked out the Kawashimas' small apartment on the
campus of Tokyo's prestigious Gakushuin University.
   By 11 a.m. it was official. The 23-year-old Miss Kawashima was
engaged to marry Prince Aya, the second son of Emperor Akihito and
second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   After announcing the engagement, Shoichi Fujimori, head of the
Imperial Household Agency and a member of the council, said the
decision was unanimous and added that he hoped a date for the
wedding could be set ``as soon as possible.''
   Ceremonies related to the wedding will not be held until after
Jan. 7, end of a one-year mourning period for Aya's grandfather,
Emperor Hirohito, who died at age 87 after a 62-year reign.
   When Prince Aya and his fiance met reporters for a news
conference broadcast live nationwide Tuesday afternoon, Miss
Kawashima, already dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' by the press
for her humble background, spoke hestitantly, often shyly glancing
at her fiance and clearly self-conscious about her future role.
   ``My father told me that it was my life, and a decision that I
should make after careful thought,'' she said. Her father,
Tatsuhiko, teaches economics at Gakushuin, the alma mater of much of
Japan's royalty.
   But Prince Aya said he had proposed to Miss Kawashima on June 26,
1986, a year after they first met at Gakushuin, where they were both
students, and had long awaited the day their romance could be made
public.
   ``I was taking her home after a get-together that evening, and I
asked her while we were stopped for a light at a crosswalk,'' the
prince said.
   Aya is to complete postgraduate studies in zoology at Oxford
University's St. John's College next June, and some palace watchers
have speculated the two may live in England for a short time after
they are wed.
   ``As soon as things settle here, I hope to return to England
because I have much research I hope to do there,'' Aya said.
   Unlike the staid and proper crown prince, Aya is known to the
Japanese for his mustache, yellow Volkswagen ``Beetle'' and gold
bracelet, which he wore to the afternoon conference.
   The engagement of Aya and the ``Apartment Princess'' is being
hailed as another opening of the ``Crysanthemum Curtain'' that has
kept Japanese royalty apart from the public.

   Veteran state Sen. John C. Daniels
defeated a candidate backed by Democratic leaders to become the
party's first black nominee for mayor in this overwhelmingly
Democratic city.
   ``As I campaigned throughout the city, people said it was time
for change,'' Daniels said in claiming victory Tuesday night.
   Unofficial returns showed Daniels capturing 16,012 votes to
11,082 for John DeStefano, a former top official of retiring Mayor
Biagio DiLieto. DeStefano won the Democratic Town Committee's
endorsement and gained automatic entry in the primary with the
support of DiLieto.
   Turnout Tuesday was the highest in 10 years, with 53 percent of
the city's registered Democrats going to the polls.
   Because Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 10-to-1 in this
city, the winner of the Democratic primary is widely expected to win
the Nov. 7 general election.
   The 53-year-old senator will face Alderwoman Robie Pooley, 48.
She defeated attorney Tobin Hitt, a political newcomer, by 1,227 to
728, according to unofficial Republican returns.
   Republicans have not held office in New Haven for 36 years. The
last GOP primary was 31 years ago.
   DeStefano, 34, urged all Democrats to unite behind Daniels.
   ``You know it isn't all bad,'' he told his supporters. ``I came
out of this with a better haircut and a better sense of humor.''
   Both Daniels and DeStefano had sought to keep the issue of race
out of the campaign, and both sought multi-racial, multi-ethnic
support. Blacks represent about 35 percent and Hispanics about 12
percent of the city's 127,000 population.
   Nevertheless, Daniels had described himself as the candidate who
could best bring the city's diverse neighborhoods together.
   A 5-term senator who owns a plumbing business, Daniels once
entered the 1969 mayoral race before withdrawing after several
weeks. He said he finally became a candidate two decades later after
polls showed a minority candidate could win.
   DiLieto's withdrawal made this primary the first in 20 years in
which the incumbent was not seeking re-election.

   Americans are the worst spellers in the
English-speaking world, according to a Gallup spelling quiz.
   Australians who did not go beyond grade school were better
spellers, on average, than American adults, the results released
Tuesday showed.
   The best spellers are in Australia, followed by Canada, the
United Kingdom and then the United States. Americans misspelled, on
average, more than six of the 10 words on the test.
   The Gallup quiz was first given 34 years ago in the United States
and Canada. The same words _ which include magazine, sandwich,
kerosene, calamity, penitentiary, picnicking, deceive, accelerator,
cauliflower and parallel _ were on a test given earlier this year in
both countries as well as in Australia and the United Kingdom.
   Only one in 20 adults in all four countries could spell all 10
words correctly. Among the other findings:
   _Of the 10 words, Americans had the most trouble with
penitentiary.
   _Women were better spellers than men, except in the United
Kingdom, where the sexes had equal ability.
   _In the United States, the best spellers tended to be those ages
34 to 44.
   The test which was paid for by Franklin Computer Corp., a
manufacturer of electronic reference products.
   In a survey of geography knowledge completed last summer for
National Geographic, the United States fared poorly compared with
the six other industrialized nations surveyed _ Japan, France, West
Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Italy.
   Slightly more than half the Americans tested could identify
England on a map of Europe, and one in seven failed to identify the
United States on a world map.

   Hungary said today it will break its Warsaw Pact
commitment and keep open its borders to the West, and an East German
newspaper said it is time to consider why the country's young,
skilled citizens are fleeing.
   In Austria, the Interior Ministry said 12,158 East Germans had
passed through that country en route to West Germany in the two days
that refugees have been taking advantage of Hungary's newly opened
border.
   In Budapest, a government official said today that Hungary has no
intention of reversing its dramatic new pathway to the West and that
it reflects the increasingly liberal Communist nation's new role in
the world.
   ``The Hungarian government's policy of opening the country's
borders will continue,'' said Ferenc Somogyi, the No. 2 official in
the Foreign Ministry.
   He said that as long as a third country is willing to accept
refugees from other East bloc countries, Hungary will allow them to
leave.
   But he said that the current, orchestrated migration was a
``unique step'' that applied only to East German citizens. ``The
East Germans were not treated as refugees and they did not request
asylum as refugees,'' Somogyi said.
   East Germans are automatically considered citizens of West
Germany and therefore technically do not qualify as refugees.
   Somogyi said the country's open-border policy was consistent with
Hungary's status as a signatory of the U.N. Convention on Refugees,
the only East bloc country to have signed it.
   He indicated that such agreements with the West take precedence
over Warsaw Pact commitments Hungary, by allowing citizens of a
Warsaw Pact ally to flee across its borders, violated a 1969 pact
with the rest of the Soviet bloc.
   ``There are agreements with other Warsaw Treaty countries similar
to the one Hungary just suspended with East Germany, and these
agreements are no longer in line with Hungary's newly assumed
international responsibilities, such as our having signed the Geneva
Convention,'' Somogyi said.
   ``We are working to bring these various agreements into harmony
with (our) new foreign policy,'' he added.
   In East Berlin, the Communist Party youth daily Junge Welt said
that East German citizens no longer can avoid the discussion about
why a ``minority'' has fled the country of 16.6 million people.
   ``How do we make this country indisputably the focal point for
dedication and happiness for every individual? How do we make it a
homeland for even more people in which one accepts burdens and from
which one is not lured away just by shop windows full of bananas or
glossy travel guides?'' Junge Welt asked.
   The newspaper often contains important articles and commentaries
reflecting official views.
   The new arrivals have said they were dissatisfied with the
economic situation in their country, and the political oppression at
home. Many of the arrivals are young, skilled craftsmen. They also
said East Germany has failed to adopt political and economic reforms
being tried in other Communist nations.
   The main East German party daily, Neues Deutschland, today
continued its criticism of West Germany, which it contends has
``lured the refugees West.''
   It also criticized Hungary for allowing their ``unsanctioned
departure.''
   The refugees have traveled by car, train and bus through Austria
to their new homeland since midnight Sunday, when Hungary opened its
border completely.
   West German border officials said the number of refugees could
top 15,000.
   The exodus comes at a time of dramatic change in the East bloc.
Poland has installed the bloc's first government led by
non-Communists, and Hungary's leaders are promising free elections.
   West Germany and Hungary have worked together to coordinate free
passage for the East Germans and that has added to the strain in
relations between those countries and East Berlin.
   It is the first time an East bloc nation has assisted in an
exodus to the West of citizens from a Warsaw Pact ally.
   On Tuesday, Yegor Ligachev, a hard-line member of the Soviet
Politburo, arrived in East Berlin and accused West Germany of
``slander, enticement and luring away'' East Germans.
   East German leader Erich Honecker's prolonged recovery from gall
bladder surgery has complicated the situation. Communist Party
officials acknowledge that decision-making in East Berlin is
virtually paralyzed.
   East Germany's state-run news agency, ADN, said Tuesday the
government issued a formal protest to Hungary for its decision to
``unilaterally suspend'' parts of bilateral agreements on border
controls, ADN said.
   An estimated 50,000 East Germans were reported in Hungary Tuesday
on tourist visas, which have traditionally been relatively easy to
obtain.
   However, sources say East Germany police offices are now turning
down many more applications for tourist visas to Hungary than they
are approving. The sources say the offices are filled daily with
applicants.
   Some unofficial estimates say 1 million of East Germany's 16.6
million people desire to emigrate to the West. About 100,000 are
expected to emigrate to the West this year, the largest number since
207,000 fled in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built.
   At a crowded tent city in Tiefenbach, West Germany, bulletin
boards with scores of job notices have been set up. East Germans Uwe
and Norma Koenig scanned a bulletin board on Tuesday and said they
will take their time deciding.
   ``The East German government told us for years what we could and
could not do,'' said Mrs. Koenig. ``Now we're going to do what's
best for us.''
   Romania and Czechoslovakia, which like East Germany have resisted
reforms being carried out in Hungary and Poland, criticized West
Germany but were restrained in their criticism of Budapest.
   In Czechoslvakia, more than half of the 400 East Germans who had
camped outside the West German Embassy in Prague gave up Tuesday on
their efforts to gain passage to the West, and left the compound
after being promised they would not face punishment if they returned
home.

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. says it has recalled batches
of 10 prescription drugs and halted distribution from its plant here
because of record-keeping violations found by federal inspectors.
   The pharmaceutical maker said it is confident there was nothing
wrong with the safety or effectiveness of the drugs, which were
recalled Tuesday from wholesalers and had never reached pharmacies.
   An inpection by the Food and Drug Administration last month found
objectionable conditions in nearly every area of Lilly's
Indianapolis capsule and tablet plant, including failure to have
written standard operating procedures for many tasks and
record-keeping problems.
   ``In nearly every system examined, the available data were found
to be incomplete or inaccurately summarized,'' the FDA said. Results
of that inspection were made public Tuesday.
   In response, Lilly voluntarily recalled 18 batches of drugs and
halted distribution of all products from the plant, which
manufactures a relatively small amount of the company's capsules and
tablets, said spokesman Ed West.
   Distribution will resume when revised procedures have been
established, probably within weeks, West said.
   He said the recall and distribution shutdown would not affect
availability of any major products, and the cost to the company was
negligible.
   Among the medicines recalled were Darvon, a pain reliever;
Tapazole, a thyroid medication; Aventyl, an antidepressant, and
Nalfon, an anti-inflammation drug.
   Acting Director Felix Schneider of the FDA's Midwest office in
Detroit said the agency is looking at other Lilly operations and
will make similar inspections of other drug companies.

<HEAD>Funeral Home Accused of Cremating Bodies in Cardboard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A funeral home has agreed to pay up to $14,200
to settle charges of cremating bodies in cardboard boxes instead of
the wooden caskets bought by grieving families.
   The agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and the former
Eddy's Funeral Home in Winnemucca was filed in federal court on
Tuesday.
   ``This case was just your garden variety one of fraud,'' FTC
attorney Nora Dowd said. ``It is very unusual, though, to sell
someone a casket and say you're going to cremate a body in it and
then use a cardboard box.''
   The funeral home was accused of violating federal regulations by
misleading customers, charging people for goods and services not
provided and not giving them written lists of proposed charges.
   Under a consent decree, the former operators of Eddy's must pay
the government $10,000 in civil fines, one tenth the amount the
funeral home was facing. They also must contact at least 24 people
who might have paid for a wooden casket that never was used in
cremations in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and refund them $175 each.
   The former operators did not admit any wrongdoing under the
consent degree.
   The mortuary has been sold by GMJB of Boise, Idaho, and its name
has been changed. Ms. Dowd wouldn't say what led to the allegations,
but ``usually, information like this comes from consumers, or
workers in the funeral homes and sometimes the competition.''
   Scott Gilligan, a lawyer for GMJB managing partner James
McMurtrey, said the mortuary's former director, Alan Olsen, denied
the allegations.
   ``The funeral home had already been closed by the time the FTC
complained and so we were stuck in a position of not being able to
defend ourselves very well,'' Gilligan said. ``And, frankly, because
the funeral home was closed we didn't have a reputation to protect
anymore so it was easier to settle the case.''

<HEAD>Study: Colleges Face Faculty Shortages if Steps Not Taken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American colleges and universities will
face a shortage of more than 6,000 teachers by the end of the
century if steps are not taken soon, a study says.
   Through 1992, there will be 1.6 candidates available for each
available teaching position, according to the study being published
by Princeton University Press. But by 1997-2002, the study found,
the candidates-to-job ratio will drop to 0.83, with 30,934
candidates to fill an estimated 37,091 positions.
   The greatest shortages will be not in the sciences as previously
believed but in the humanities and social sciences, the study found.
   ``We need to increase overall production of new Ph.D.'s by
two-thirds,'' said William G. Bowen, co-author of the report and
president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. ``In the humanities
and social sciences, we need to double the current numbers.''
   The study by Bowen, a former Princeton president, and Julie Ann
Sosa, a Princeton graduate now studying at Oxford University, was
believed to be the first statistical confirmation of an impending
faculty shortage.
   Faculty retirements will contribute little to the shortage, the
study found, but many new faculty jobs will open to accommodate the
bulge of students now moving through elementary schools. They will
enter college starting in 1997.
   Restoring the candidates-to-job ratio to an ideal 1.3 level would
require a 64 percent increase in new doctorates overall and a 92
percent increase in the humanities and social sciences, the study
estimated.
   From 1997-2002, the study estimated, the ratio would be 0.71 in
the humanities and social sciences, 0.80 in mathematics and the
physical sciences, and 1.13 in the biological sciences and
psychology.
   Bowen said the statistics were projections, not predictions.
   ``Enlightened policies can be adopted to increase the pipeline so
that the shortages we envision do not come to pass,'' he said.
   Bowen suggested universities shorten the time required to obtain
a Ph.D. and increase the number of fellowships and the amount they
pay. It now takes about seven years to earn a Ph.D in mathematics
and more than 12 years in the humanities.

<TEXT>
   Hungary has a new foreign policy that
calls for a bigger role in the world arena, and it takes precedence
over old commitments to the Warsaw Pact, a top Hungarian diplomat
said today.
   Ferenc Somogyi, the No. 2 official in the Foreign Ministry, said
Hungary will keep open its borders to the West.
   Hungary, which has been tacitly allowing East Germans vacationing
in that country to escape into West Germany, on Sunday allowed an
organized exodus of more than 12,000 East Germans to begin pouring
into the West.
   ``The Hungarian government's policy of opening the country's
borders will continue,'' he told The Associated Press.
   He said that as long as there is a third country willing to
accept refugees from other East bloc countries, Hunary will allow
them to leave.
   However, the foreign ministry official emphasized that the
current special measures announced Sunday whereby East Germans
seeking to emigrate to the West may cross legally into Austria was a
``unique step'' that applied only to East German citizens.
   ``The East Germans were not treated as refugees, and they did not
request asylum as refugees,'' Somogyi said.
   East Germans are automatically considered citizens of West
Germany and therefore technically do not qualify as refugees.
   The Hungarian decision to allow East Germans to pass the border
to Austria was made after weeks of negotiations with the East Berlin
leadership proved unsuccesful in finding a solution for the
thousands of East Germans in Hungary who refused to return home.
   Budapest suspended a 1969 agreement with East Germany to allow
the exodus.
   The official made a distinction between the country's refugee
policy and the special measures in force for East Germans.
   Hungary in May became the first Soviet bloc country to literally
begin dismantling the barbed wire fencing and technical barriers
along its western border with Austria, saying they had become
obsolete.
   Somogyi said the country's open-border policy applied to these
measures and Hungary's status as a signatory of the U.N. Convention
on Refugees _ the only East bloc country to have signed it.
   ``There are agreements with other Warsaw Treaty countries similar
to the one Hungary just suspended with East Germany, and these
agreements are no longer in line with Hungary's newly assumed
international responsibilities, such as our having signed the Geneva
Convention,'' Somogyi said.
   ``We are working to bring these various agreements into harmony
with (our) new foreign policy,'' he added.
   As part of major reforms that include free elections planned by
June, the Communist government is drawing up laws giving Hungarian
citizens the right to emigrate freely after more than 40 years of
restrictions.
   Last year, Hungary began accepting refugees from allied Romania,
an unprecedented step in inter-East bloc relations.
   ``Anyone from any European country may apply for refugee status
from the Hungarian authorities,'' Somogyi said.
   ``If the conditions stipulated in the Geneva Convention are met,
then the applicant would receive refugee status. If there is a third
country agreeing to take in that person, there would be no obstacle
raised by Hungary,'' he said.
   Dozens of Romanians have attempted to cross from Hungary into
Austria but have been turned back at the border by Austrian
authorities.
   Somogyi said it was still not decided how long the borders would
remain open for the East Germans. However, he recalled that the
government announcement on the move stipulated that they would
remain open ``as long as there is a country prepared to receive them
or to allow transit.''
   So far, more than 12,000 mostly skilled, young East Germans have
crossed into Austria and the majority have already arrived in West
Germany.

   Forty East Germans left the West
German Embassy today, abandoning their push for freedom in the West
after East Germany said they will not be prosecuted if they return
home.
   On Tuesday, more than 200 others accepted the East German offer,
and the possibility of applying for legal emigration later, and left
the embassy.
   Many of the East Germans had camped out for days or weeks in
hopes of being granted free passage to the West like thousands of
their countrymen in Hungary, who were allowed to flee into West
Germany this week.
   About 150 East Germans remained on the embassy grounds today,
apparently refusing to join their countrymen returning home.
   Wolfgang Vogel, an East Berlin lawyer who has mediated bilateral
German affairs, met with the East Germans at the embassy on Tuesday
and again today, to persuade them to return home. Sources close to
the talks said no more negotiations were planned and that Vogel had
left Prague.
   Witnesses said about 40 people left today, several driving off in
their own cars and 23 boarding a bus.
   One 25-year-old woman said while weeping that she was returing
because, ``I just couldn't take anymore.''
   The West German mission in Prague was closed to the public Aug.
23, after about 140 East Germans were reported to have taken refuge
there, in hopes of being allowed to emigrate to West Germany.
   Scores more continued to arrive at the Prague embassy after that
and giant tents were erected on the grounds to house them.
   West German officials said those who left the embassy for home
had done so of their own free will. It was not clear what the rest
of those still on the embassy grounds would decide to do.

   Senate Democratic leaders were exploring today
whether to accept a White House offer to work out a compromise on
anti-drug legislation.
   The Democrats insist President Bush's $7.9 billion plan is
inadequate, while Republicans say the Democratic alternative
providing $2.2 billion more is too expensive.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Democratic lawmakers
would meet ``to discuss what the best course of action would be'' to
White House requests for a compromise.
   ``One thing clear is the inadequacy of the president's plan, and
the need to improve it to provide substance to the words,''
Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters as partisan maneuvering continued
on the drug issue.
   Mitchell and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, held
talks on the Democratic proposal Tuesday. Further meetings among
lawmakers from both parties were planned today.
   Dole and other top GOP senators also met with top White House
officials, emerging to say Republicans want to make a deal with the
Democrats.
   ``The administration ... is prepared at any time to sit down ...
and see if there is some way to bring it together,'' Dole said.
   The closed-door sessions were held after Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. _ with Mitchell's support _
proposed a $3.9 billion anti-drug program as an amendment to the
$11.9 billion transportation spending bill for next year. Fiscal
1990 begins Oct. 1.
   Meanwhile, Bush went on television Tuesday to ask schoolchildren
across the country to help any friends who use drugs. Rejecting
drugs ``won't make you a nerd,'' Bush said, adding, ``I'm asking you
to find someone who needs you. And offer to help.''
   He said, ``I'll let you in on a secret: We all can succeed. If
you don't use drugs, you can be anything you want to be. ... So
don't blow it.''
   Also, a pair of Senate appropriations subcommittees adopted their
own anti-drug proposals.
   Byrd said his plan would add $3.9 billion to the $6.2 billion
Congress otherwise planned to spend on anti-drug efforts next year.
The $10.1 billion total would be $2.2 billion more than what Bush
has sought.
   But the White House announced that top administration officials
would urge Bush to veto it.
   ``It throws money at the problem rather than providing a plan,''
said a statement by the White House Office of Management and Budget.
   Byrd told reporters he was ``puzzled'' by the White House
statement and referred to the president's televised speech last week
in which he revealed his own drug proposals.
   ``Mr. Bush went on TV the other night and stated in eloquent
fashion ... that the drug war was right here on our streets,'' Byrd
told reporters. ``I believed what he said. This is my way of trying
to develop something that's comprehensive.''
   Byrd's plan would include $1.1 billion for drug and alcohol
treatment and $1 billion for new prisons, and would divide its
resources 53 to 47 percent between law enforcement and treatment
programs. It would be financed by a 0.575 percent cut in defense and
domestic spending, except for Social Security and other benefit
programs.
   Republicans, however, argued that Byrd's plan would provide more
money than can efficiently be spent, provides too little for
enforcement efforts, and would slash an intolerable $1.8 billion out
of defense.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
supports a bipartisan measure approved Tuesday by the Senate
commerce, justice and state subcommittee.
   That provision would slice 0.225 percent from the rest of the
budget, raising $1.8 billion for law enforcement. It would remove
$675 million from the Pentagon.
   Also on Tuesday:
   _The Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee approved a $279.7
billion military spending bill for next year containing $1.05
billion for drug efforts _ eight times the $132 million Bush had
requested.
   _Drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee to expect Bush's drug efforts to cost $50
billion over the next five years.
   _State and local officials contended the Bush anti-drug plan
would strain their budgets without providing the money to get the
job done. Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston, S.C., told the Senate
Judiciary Committee the $350 million proposed to help state and
local governments bolster law enforcement adds up to less than 1
percent of what they already spend.

   If you are one of that rare breed, the New York
City Republican, and you're a member of that even rarer sub-species
that voted for Ronald Lauder for mayor, your vote was not worthless.
   It was worth $352 and change.
   The heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune spent about $13
million in the city's Republican primary, most of it his own money
and most of it negative TV advertising aimed at Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani thrashed him by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
   But Lauder did receive 36,905 votes in Tuesday's primary. If
Lauder spent exactly $13 million _ the bills are still coming in _
that averages out to $352.26 for every man and woman who voted for
him.

   Twenty-five rockets exploded around
Kabul airport today, killing one soldier, injuring three and setting
a Soviet supply plane on fire, witnesses said.
   Also today, a guerrilla commander announced his fighters have
started a northern offensive to cut Soviet supply routes to Kabul.
   In the south, guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1,000-vehicle
army convoy with winter provisions for Afghanistan's second largest
city, Kandahar.
   Workers at Kabul airport said the facility was shut down after
the attack, but air traffic resumed in the afternoon.
   Officials would not confirm the attack.
   The casualties occurred at a military base near the airport, used
by civilian and military aircraft, airport workers said.
   They said a Soviet-made Antonov supply plane was set ablaze by a
rocket as it taxied to the runway. The crew jumped off after the
first rockets fell, witnesses said. Workers and witnesses all
demanded anonymity.
   One missile fell 40 yards from the airport's executive lounge,
blasting out its glass window and forcing officials inside to take
shelter.
   It also just missed a U.N. jet, scattering shrapnel that
punctured holes in the aircraft, the witnesses said. U.N. officials
patched the plane with special metal tape.
   More than 300 people have been killed and more than 700 injured
in almost daily rocket attacks since June by fundamentalist Moslem
guerrillas.
   Reporters waiting downtown for a special flight to Kandahar were
told they could not leave because of ``technical difficulties.''
   In neighboring Pakistan, Western diplomatic sources said a
massive Afghan army convoy of trucks, tanks and armored personnel
carriers from the Soviet Union was turned back from Kandahar by
fierce guerrilla attacks.
   Its original size reportedly was between 1,000 and 1,300 trucks,
tanks and armored personnel carriers, but diplomatic sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the insurgents may have
destroyed more than 110 vehicles.
   Kabul government officials said the convoy is carrying winter
provisions for 200,000 people in besieged Kandahar. It has taken the
column more than two weeks to travel 400 miles south from Torghundi
at the Soviet border.
   Guerrillas destroyed about 80 vehicles at the halfway point near
Shindand, diplomatic sources said. The convoy eventually pushed to
within 36 miles of Kandahar, when guerrillas again destroyed 30
vehicles, they said.
   At latest report, the column had retreated 33 miles and split
into two, with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to Kandahar.
   ``It would take an exceedingly long time for the regime to
transport any significant portion of the convoy's cargo to Kandahar
in this way,'' said one diplomatic source.
   Meanwhile, guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud sent a radio
message to Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, saying his
forces are attacking four areas along the key Salang Highway north
of Kabul, including the communist government's biggest air force
base at Bagram.
   ``His message gave us no details about casualties but he said the
mujahedeen (guerrillas) gained some very big successes, especially
at Salang,'' said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islami
rebel group.
   Masoud is considered the most effective of guerrilla commanders
who have fought 10 years to topple the Soviet-backed government.
   The diplomatic sources said intense fighting continues around the
eastern garrison town of Khost, with high casualties on both sides.
They said guerrillas shot down one transport plane and destroyed
four more on the ground at Khost's military airport between Thursday
and Saturday.
   The guerrillas have failed to capture a major Afghan city since
the last Soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on Feb. 15.

   Tropical Storm Hugo today edged closer to becoming a
hurricane as it began following the path of its predecessor,
Gabrielle.
   The eighth named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season
had sustained winds of 65 mph. At 6 a.m. EDT it was centered near
latitude 12.7 north and longitude 42.0 west, 1,300 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles.
   The storm was headed west at about 20 mph and was expected to
hold its course through today, possibly affecting the Caribbean in
four or five days. Forecasters said Hugo could become a hurricane,
with 74 mph winds, within a day or so.
   ``It's not as big a system (as Gabrielle) and it seems to be
getting better organized,'' said forecaster Gil Clark of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Tropical Storm Gabrielle continued dissolving in the cold water
of the northern Atlantic, about 280 miles south of Cape Race,
Newfoundland.
   The former hurricane's winds today were down to 40 mph, 1 mph
over the minimum for tropical-storm classification, but still
causing 6- to 10-foot swells along Nova Scotia. Swells as high as 16
feet from Gabrielle were blamed for the disappearances of at least
seven people from New York to Maine in the past week.

<HEAD>New Manager Named for Troubled Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said today it was
installing a new manager at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in
Colorado to replace Edward S. Goldberg, who was at the center of a
controversy in July over a possible shutdown of the facility.
   The department said David P. Simonson, a nuclear engineer with 16
years' experience in the federal nuclear weapos program, would take
over for Goldberg later this month.
   Simonson, 46, has been acting deputy manager at Rocky Flats since
July 12. Before that he was deputy director of the Energy
Department's Office of Nuclear Materials Production.
   Goldberg has been acting manager of Rocky Flats, near Denver,
since June. The department said Goldberg would be sent to its
Hanford Operations Office in Washington state, which oversees
operations at the Hanford nuclear weapons site.
   The announcement did not say what position Goldberg would take at
Hanford.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said in a statement he was
pleased Simonson had accepted ``the tough assignment'' of managing
the Rocky Flats site, which produces plutonium triggers used in
nuclear warheads.
   The department said last month that Goldberg in July had
threatened to close Rocky Flats unless the managers there were
granted immunity from prosecution for ongoing violations of
environmental laws.
   As a result of Goldberg's concern about criminal liability, the
department and the Environmental Protection Agency agreed they would
find a solution to the continuing environmental violations by Sept.
15.
   The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of
alleged violations of laws governing disposal and storage of
hazardous and low-level radioactive wastes at the site. The probe
has gone to a grand jury in Colorado, and no charges have resulted
yet.

   Resignations by top West Virginia
officials and the defeat of three amendments proposed by the
governor have dented the credibility of the state's political
leaders, insiders and observers said.
   Four politicians have left office in shame this summer and a
former state Senate president is on trial in federal court on
extortion and racketeering charges.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton won election last November with a campaign
to clean the state's sullied image. He pushed for the three
amendments as essential parts of his reform plans, only to see them
trounced on Saturday. Opponents of the amendments had accused him of
a power grab.
   Some analysts said the rejection showed voters are fed up with
their political leaders.
   ``Historically, West Virginia has had a relatively high tolerance
for corruption in government,'' said Joe McCoy, a political science
professor at Marshall University.
   ``But citizens today are fed up with it and are expressing those
feelings to prosecutors and elected officials. The diligence of
these investigations are because of a heightened consciousness.
Residents want change.''
   Caperton's plan to fix the state's image was foiled almost from
the start when an audit late last year found that West Virginia had
bungled its finances and lost more than $270 million in investments.
An investigation led to the impeachment and resignation of Treasurer
A. James Manchin last July.
   Shortly after the headlines on that story faded, Attorney General
Charlie Brown resigned Aug. 21 as part of an agreement to halt a
probe into his campaign finances and reports that he lied under oath
during a child custody hearing.
   Next, state Sen. Si Boettner resigned after pleading guilty Aug.
30 to income tax evasion. Then, Senate President Larry Tucker
resigned Thursday after agreeing to plead guilty to extortion
charges.
   And last week, former state Senate President Dan Tonkovich went
on trial on extortion and racketeering charges in what prosecutors
say was a deal to influence legislation in return for money.
   In the wake of those scandals, Caperton suffered his first major
setback.
   By a landslide, voters defeated amendments that would have
eliminated three state offices and put their duties under the
governor's control, given the governor greater authority over
education and allowed cities and counties to reorganize.
   ``One of the principles of politics of a new governor is never to
load the voters up with too long an agenda, so that they can digest
it,'' said David Bingham, a political science professor at West
Virginia University.
   Earlier this year, Caperton raised taxes by nearly $400 million
and the Legislature borrowed $135 million to begin paying off a debt
estimated at $300 million to $400 million.
   Since taking office in January, Caperton also has reorganized 150
departments under seven ``super secretaries,'' divided the Board of
Regents into separate entities and created an Ethics Commission to
study conflicts of interest in state and local government.
   Caperton blamed the defeat of his proposed amendments on bad
public relations. But House Speaker Chuck Chambers, a Democrat like
the governor, said the results amounted to a referendum on
Caperton's performance and showed voters were unhappy about the tax
increase.
   Bingham agreed. ``The voters are mad about the taxes and somewhat
mad about the reorganization,'' he said.
   In recent surveys, residents named unemployment and taxes as the
state's most pressing problems. Seventy percent of residents in an
August survey felt Caperton was doing a fair or poor job.
   The Senate turned over a new leaf on Tuesday in electing Keith
Burdette as president to replace Tucker. Burdette, at 34 the
youngest person to hold the job, said his top priority is restoring
credibility to state government.
   ``The job's got to be done. We've got to pick up and go on,''
said Burdette. ``There's no question, we're an institution in
crisis. But you have to believe that the overwhelming majority of
the members of this Legislature are good people who don't have their
hands in somebody else's pocket.''

   Boeing Commercial Airplanes has paid the Federal
Aviation Administration $200,000 to settle charges of failing to
promptly report wiring defects on new jets.
   ``It is the largest fine ever paid at one time by an (airplane)
manufacturer,'' said FAA spokesman Dave Duff.
   Boeing paid the fine Thursday and the settlement was made public
Tuesday. Under the settlement, Boeing did not admit to any
wrongdoing. It also agreed to report safety defects ``in a timely

   The settlement involved miswiring of fire extinguishers in 94
planes and FAA allegations that Boeing had failed to adequately
report such cases. Boeing said the fire protection systems have been
redesigned and never failed in service.

   The Bush administration told Congress today it
wants to accept 50,000 Soviet refugees and an additional 6,500 from
Eastern Europe in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Overall, 125,000 refugees would be admitted, an increase of
almost 8 percent over current quotas, said Jewel S. Lafontant, the
U.S. coordinator for refugee affairs.
   The 50,000 Soviet refugees, at least half of whom are expected to
be Jews, would be a fraction of the 250,000 Soviet citizens the
State Department estimated last week would apply for entry in fiscal
1990.
   Lafontant, testifying before the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration, said 40,000 of the 50,000 Soviet refugees would be
assisted by the U.S. government in paying their transportation and
settlement costs. The 10,000 others would depend on private
organizations, friends and relatives.
   Beyond the refugee program, other would-be immigrants can apply
for admission under a separate so-called parole program which
carries no financial assistance.
   The current combined quota for refugees from the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe is 50,000. The new plan would allocate all 50,000
slots to the Soviet Union to deal with an unprecedented outflow
under President Mikhail Gorbachev, and set up a separate category of
6,500 for Eastern Europe, mostly from Poland and Hungary.
   Other projected quotas include 25,000 for East Asia, 26,500 for
Vietnam, 3,500 for Latin America and the Caribbean and 3,000 for
Africa.
   In fiscal 1988, as emigration from the Soviet Union began to
climb, the combined quota for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
was 15,000.
   An estimated 40,000 Jews are expected to leave the Soviet Union
this year. Currently there is, in addition, a backlog of an
estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Jews who have not left the Soviet Union
or are in Vienna and Rome, seeking entry to the United States.
   Most Soviet Jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in
Israel, but all but a fraction then apply for admission here once
they have left their country.
   According to Jewish sources, who demanded anonymity, the Bush
administration will drastically revise its processing procedures.
Refugees who applied before Oct. 1, the beginning of the 1990 fiscal
year, will be processed in Rome and Vienna.
   But in the future, applications will be handled by a beefed-up
U.S. embassy staff and also by a new office to be set up outside
Washington, sources said.
   The U.S. official, who also asked not to be named, said that
cutoff date was likely, though it might be set for a few months
later.
   While the Soviets seeking admission remain in their country,
their applications would be considered both in Moscow and in the
Washington area office.
   Israel has expressed concern that Jewish refugees from the Soviet
Union were increasingly choosing to settle in the United States once
out of their homeland, depriving Israel of desirable immigrants.
   It was not clear whether the change in procedure would increase
the flow of refugees to Israel.
   The rising exodus from the Soviet Union, which results from U.S.
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by Gorbachev, poses
administrative and financial problems for the Bush administration.
   Eager to reinforce the right of Soviet citizens to travel freely,
U.S. officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open.
But they also emphasize the strain the wave of immigrants imposes on
U.S. funds.
   ``The increased refugee flow brings problems in its wake,''
Lafontant told the House panel. ``But how much better it is to have
to deal with the problems caused by the success of one's policies
than to deal with problems caused by failure.''

<HEAD>Israeli Leaders Discuss Egyptian Plan, Cairo Meeting Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's four top leaders today discussed an
Egyptian plan calling on Israel to trade occupied lands for peace.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's senior aide, however, dismissed
the plan and suggestions for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in
Cairo.
   Also today, a car belonging to U.S. Deputy Counselor David Winn
was set ablaze in front of his house in annexed east Jerusalem.
Police said the car was severely damaged, and blamed Palestinian
``nationalists.''
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, masked Arabs stabbed to death a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel officials,
Palestinian reports said.
   The death of 35-year-old Jibara Abu Taha brings the toll to at
least 114 Palestinians killed as alleged collaborators during the
21-month-old revolt against Israeli rule. During the uprising, 567
Palestinians have been shot in clashes with the Israeli army or
civilians, and 40 Israelis have been killed.
   In Jerusalem, three dailies quoted American and Israeli sources
as saying Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in coordination with the
United States, soon will issue invitations for a peace meeting in
Cairo.
   It would include a Palestinian delegation from the occupied lands
and an Israeli delegation, Haaretz and Davar newspapers said.
American and Soviet officials also would be invited, the
English-language Jerusalem Post said.
   Davar reported the proposal was discussed last week by U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Israel's Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   Davar and Haaretz said the Palestinian delegation would adopt
Mubarak's 10-point peace proposal, while Israel would adhere to its
plan for elections in the occupied lands for negotiators of an
interim settlement with Israel.
   Shamir's office director, Yossi Ben-Aharon, rejected the Egyptian
plan, telling Haaretz the Palestinians must adopt Israel's plan
before any talks.
   Shamir, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, Finance Minister Shimon
Peres and Rabin today discussed the Egyptian plan, but spokesmen
declined to provide details of the talks.
   Israel radio reported Shamir refused to discuss the plan at a
subsequent session of a 12-member inner Cabinet. But it quoted him
as saying he and the other three top leaders Friday will formulate a
stance on the Egyptian plan.
   Of the four leaders, only Peres has supported the Egyptian plan
calling for talks based on the U.S.-backed principle of trading land
for peace and giving voting rights to 140,000 east Jerusalem Arabs.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes territorial concessions
and says giving east Jerusalem Arabs a vote would undermine the
unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Peres' left-leaning Labor
Party accepts both ideas.
   Abba Eban, a senior Labor politician and former foreign minister,
today urged the government to adopt Egypt's proposal.
   ``It would be quite irresponsible to reject the Egyptian peace
initiative. We must understand that Israel's proposal has reached
the deadest of dead ends,'' Eban told Israel radio after returning
home Tuesday night from a meeting with Egyptian officials in Cairo.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat has not
commented on the plan. But one of his main backers, Nablus
businessman Saeed Kenaan, said he favored it. ``It has good points
and I think it can be used as a starting point,'' Kenaan said in an
interview.
   Two radical Marxist PLO factions at odds with Arafat's mainstream
Fatah announced in Syria that they oppose the Egyptian plan.

   Police today rushed to the
site of a bomb scare, recovering ``suspicious materials'' near the
city's soccer stadium hours before the kickoff of a championship
game.
   Police said they arrested several men for questioning after the
bomb scare at City Cemetery, less than 450 feet from Brandywell
Stadium. They refused to elaborate.
   The British domestic news agency, Press Association, said among
the detainees was the vice president of Sinn Finn, the legal
political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The Sinn Fein official, Martin McGuinness, also was arrested for
several hours Tuesday during a visit to the British province by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Roman Catholic
Irish Republic under a leftist administration.
   Police in Belfast said ``suspicious materials'' were recovered
and were being examined. Press Association said a beer keg with
wires attached to it had been found.
   The scare came eight hours before the game between Derry City and
Benfica of Portugal, which is part of Europe's premier soccer
tournament, the European Champions Cup.
   Derry City is based in Londonderry but plays across the border in
the Irish Republic's League of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen attacked a judge's home in the
cocaine center of Medellin, but police guards drove them off,
authorities said today. Troops found caches of grenades and assault
rifles near Bogota.
   One policeman was wounded in the assault Tuesday night on the
house of the federal Judge Laurentino Gallego Gil, a Medellin police
spokesman. The source, who asked not to be named for security
reasons, said in a telephone interview that two police guards
repulsed the attack.
   The assault followed the deployment of more than 500 soldiers and
police Tuesday in Antioquia state, of which Medellin is the capital.
They will bolster the more than 4,000 security force members already
in the northwest region, where drug gangs stage daily bombings,
shootings and arson attacks.
   Hundreds of mourners on Tuesday attended the funeral of former
Medellin Mayor Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez, who tried to rid the city of
drug traffickers. Pelaez was assassinated on his way to work Monday.
   In an army raid on Tuesday just north of Bogota, authorities
found seven Israeli Galil automatic rifles, nine U.S. R-15
semi-utomatic rifles, two Chinese automatic rifles, one Belgian
assault rifle and a British machine gun, said Col. Eduardo Arevalo,
the Defense Ministry spokesman.
   The reliable and well-informed Bogota newspaper El Espectador,
bombed earlier in the month by drug terrorists, said the arms
belonged to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the reputed No. 2 man in the
Medellin cocaine cartel. Arevalo would not confirm that.
   The newspaper, which printed a picture of the captured rifles,
said the weapons cache also contained grenades, pistols, ammunition
and scanner radios for monitoring police and army frequencies.
Arevalo would not confirm that.
   The reinforcements to the Medellin region were believed to be
part of measures adopted by government to combat the traffickers.
The government declared an unprecendented crackdown on the
traffickers after the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Gen. Oscar Botero, the minister of defense, said in announcing
the dispatch of reinforcements to the Medellin area that the
government will sign emergency decrees that will allow sending army
advisers to cities overrun by drug lords.
   Medellin, the country's second-largest city with 2 million
people, is already under a nighttime curfew. Hooded gangs on
motorcycles have been throwing firebombs at government vehicles in
the city and bombings and bomb threats are almost daily occurrences.
   President Virgilio Barco has ordered raids on hundreds of estates
and ranches said to belong to drug dealers and confiscated their
airplanes, helicopters, limousines, satellite dishes, cattle and
exotic pet birds.
   Hundreds of purported traffickers were rounded up, but the top
leaders of the drug cartels escaped and remain at large.
   The cartels supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United
States.
   Authorities say the highest-ranking cartel member seized is
economist Eduardo Martinez Romero, who is accused of laundering more
than $1 billion for the Medellin cartel. He was extradited last week
to Atlanta and pleaded innocent to the charges in federal court.
   Barco has promised to keep extraditing traffickers wanted in the
United States, but no further extraditions have taken place since
Martinez was flown out of Colombia by U.S. drug enforcement agents.

<HEAD>Ex-Salesman Wins $26 Million Against Insurance Giant Hancock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $26.1 million to a
former insurance salesman who claimed he was badmouthed by his
employer and fired for saving his customers money.
   The jury agreed with Clifford Zalay that John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. and one of its general agents libeled and slandered
him.
   Zalay, who was fired in 1979, wept after Tuesday's verdict. ``I
took the position that I don't care how big they are and who they
are, I'm going to fight to regain my integrity _ my good name,'' he
said.
   The Boston-based insurance company, which has nearly $30 billion
in assets, is expected to appeal.
   Zalay, 65, ranked among the top 2 percent in sales when he fell
out of favor with the company. He claimed the company badmouthed him
to clients and made it difficult for him to earn a living.
   He charged his former boss sent a policyholder a copy of a letter
of reprimand accusing Zalay of giving that policyholder erroneous
advice. The former boss, Edward Dooley, also sent copies to the home
office in Boston.
   Zalay's attorney, Elihu Berman, said Zalay never gave the
policyholder any advice.
   Zalay also charged that the company sent investigators who told
his clients he was giving bad advice. He said investigators told
policyholders he was under investigation for ``shady dealings,''
accusations that could not be substantiated.
   Zalay maintained the company wanted him out because he urged
clients to buy new insurance by piggy-backing _ using the dividends
or cash value of their policies to buy more insurance. Zalay said
company officials were upset because they were assuming greater risk
without collecting more money.
   Lawyers for Dooley and John Hancock argued that Zalay was a
difficult, abrasive employee who tried to steal clients from other
agents and threw temper-tantrums in the office.
   The jury award included $25.05 million in punitive damages.

   President Bush shone the White House spotlight
today on a school program that teaches youngsters to resist drugs,
and wound up hearing a tough lecture from a 13-year-old against the
death penalty he favors.
   Chantee Charles of nearby Arlington, Va., one of three youngsters
invited to speak at a Rose Garden ceremony, appeared to take the
president aback with her musings on capital punishment, which she
called murder.
   ``It does not solve anything. ... The guard that turns on the
switch to electrocute the prisoner is just as much a murderer as the
person who has commited the crime,'' the seventh-grader said.
   She added that the executioner ``must feel guilty afterwards, but
I guess they get paid for it.''
   Chantee claimed that ``probably thousands'' of innocent prisoners
have been executed, and argued that death penalty proponents ``miss
the point that the prisoner has a family, too.''
   She told reporters afterwards she did not know of the president's
stance in favor of the death penalty.
   After hearing two other young people talk about the need to
resist peer pressure to use drugs, Bush, who favors the death
penalty for cop-killers and drug kingpins, said, ``My turn.''
   But instead of rebutting Chantee, the president thanked all three
youths and said:
   ``It's not easy to get up in front of a big scary audience like
this and do such a good job, say what's on your heart, not worry if
people agree with you or not, but recognizing that there's a common
theme here that you all did a beautiful job on, and that is turning
your back on drugs.''
   The president then launched into a pitch for the $7.9 billion
anti-drug strategy he announced Sept. 5 and has trumpeted daily in
speeches and ceremonies such as the one today that honored the Los
Angeles-based Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, program.
   Bush recalled that he attended a class last year where a Los
Angeles police officer was teaching the DARE curriculum and ``I know
it works.''
   DARE has spread from its start in 50 Los Angeles classrooms in
1983 to more than 50,000 classrooms across the United States and
abroad, he said.
   ``These kids have dared to excel, and they are succeeding. ... ''
the president said. ``So far so good, and yet so far to go.... Let
us finish the job DARE has started and create an America we can all
be proud of an America free of drugs.''
   Bush also conferred with leaders of more than a dozen major
education groups, including Keith Geiger of the National Education
Association and Albert Shanker of the American Federation of
Teachers. That meeting came two weeks before the president's Sept.
27-28 education summit with the nation's governors in
Charlottesville, Va.
   Former Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson also
visited the White House today to confer with Bush's chief of staff,
John Sununu, on the drug strategy.
   Later, Bush was presiding at another White House event to push
for passage of legislation to help spur adoptions of children born
with disabilities and other special needs.
   On Tuesday the president played principal with a televised
address from his library beamed into schoolhouses across the nation
appealing to youths to resist the overtures of drug peddlers.
   ``I'm asking you not to look the other way,'' said the president
in an address that combined avuncular persuasion with grim warnings
of the consequences of drugs.
   ``Even dabblers in drugs bear responsibility for the blood being
spilled'' in drug warfare across America and in Colombia, Bush said.
Young people risk losing their driver's licenses, their futures and
even their lives from drugs, he warned.
   And in words his audience was sure to understand, he insisted,
``Saying `no' won't make you a nerd. It won't make you a loser.''
   Meanwhile, administration officials and Democrats were
skirmishing over how to fund the proposed $7.9 billion battle
against drugs.
   Bush wants to cut other domestic programs to find the extra $717
million needed for his strategy in fiscal 1990.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration would
``reluctantly support'' a bipartisan plan approved by a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that would cut 0.225 percent from
defense and many domestic programs to raise $1.8 billion for the war
on drugs.
   She said administration officials were continuing to meet with
leaders of Congress to search for a compromise.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater accused Democrats of
playing ``price-tag politics'' with the drug plan after Senate
Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., proposed boosting the
drug package to $10.1 billion and financing it by an
across-the-board 0.575 percent cut in military and other
discretionary programs.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   Sept. 7
   The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, on freedom of expression:
   Boron, Calif., is not alone in its thoroughly un-American crusade
to ban books and thwart freedom of expression. Ugly coalitions of
modern-day book burners are increasingly successful around the
nation in banning a range of books, from classics to innocuous works.
   People for the American Way, in a report called ``Attacks on the
Freedom to Learn,'' has documented 172 incidents of censorship in 42
states in the 1988-89 school year. That these attacks are aimed at
public schools is particularly disturbing: ``A nation at risk'' is
still struggling with children dropping out or graduating without
the ability to read and write.
   All the wrong messages were sent to public schools by a group of
parents in Boron who were successful in prohibiting a high school
teacher from assigning J.D. Salinger's ``A Catcher in the Rye,''
mostly because the word ``goddamn'' appears in the book. A
reasonable American would submit that the remote possibility that a
student would be shocked by that word is outweighed by the benefits
of reading the classic.
   That an adult would discourage a child from picking up a book is
beyond reason when teachers and parents have a difficult enough time
coaxing a generation of couch potatoes near a library. It is as if
an army is fighting to get a child to read, while the enemy tries to
take the child's book away. ...
   As several organizations are primed to insert creationism in
science texts and remove sex education from the classroom, the need
for everyone's involvement becomes ever more dramatic. All must be
alert to this fact: The wave of censorship spreads from a minority
of loud extremists who want to take your child's book away. It's
your job to stop them.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on mass mailings:
   A Senate vote to curb the mass mailings of congressional
newsletters to constituents, and transfer the money saved to the
Bush administration's anti-drug effort, is right on track.
   There is no guarantee the House will also vote to limit mass
mailings. Important details remain to be worked out, notably,
whether postage-free newsletters to households will be eliminated or
just limited to two per year. Still, the Senate action is a start.
   The vote shows that the Senate is serious about doing away with a
costly and needless practice that gives incumbents an unfair
election campaign advantage over challengers. It also shows the
Senate is serious about finding money to fund the war on drugs.

the latter planet until Oct. 2 as it heads out of our solar system

   Philosophically, the space probe points us to the stars, urging
us to expand our horizons and raising the hope that we may

   The Odessa (Texas) American on a private postal service:
   Enough is enough. It's time to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank recently announced that the cost
of mailing a first-class letter likely would rise to between 28 and
32 cents in early 1991. ...
   Meanwhile, service declines. The Postal Service no longer makes
Sunday mail pickups. In the areas where the Postal Service faces
competition _ parcel post and overnight mail _ more than 90 percent
of the business has been taken by competing private firms. ...

enter the new hybrid-information technology fields centering around
computers, fiber-optic telephone lines and faxes. ...
   The Postal Service doesn't need higher rates; it needs the

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on AIDS in the schools:
   The National Association of State Boards of Education has
produced a refreshing and encouraging list of recommendations on how
schools should deal with students and teachers who are afflicted
with the AIDS virus.
   ``Until now,'' according to a booklet published by the
organization, ``many people have been fearful that (AIDS) could be
transmitted at school. We have enough information to stop worrying
about this. What we do need to worry about _ and the place to put
our energy and concern _ is into education.''
   The medical evidence is clear. You don't catch AIDS from casual,
everyday contact at school.
   The next step, according to the NASBE recommendations, is
virtually absolute anonymity for AIDS victims within the schools.
   Vengeful and narrow-minded parents and their children pose a much
higher risk to children who are already the victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome than the risk posed to them by those
victims.

   Las Vegas Review-Journal on Rep. Barney Frank:
   Imagine this scenario: The Washington Post discloses that
archconservative Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina has hired a
streetwalker, convicted felon and child pornographer to be his
personal secretary. Helms does not deny the sordid facts of the
arrangement but claims he was just trying to rehabilitate the woman.
   After the Democrats in Congress and the press got done laughing,
Helms would be served his head on a platter.
   The Helms scenario is fictitious. Barney Frank's case is not.
   In 1987, Frank, the powerful ultraliberal congressman from
Massachusetts, answered a ``sex-wanted'' ad in a gay newspaper. The
creature who placed the ad was Stephen Gobie, a male prostitute and
convicted felon who was on probation for sodomy, selling drugs and
producing obscene material involving teen-agers.
   Frank paid for Gobie's sexual favors, allowed him to move in and
hired him as an ``aide'' for about $20,000 a year. Gobie proceeded
to set up a prostitution ring out of Frank's bachelor pad in
Washington.
   Naturally, the vocal gay lobby has leaped to Frank's defense,
claiming that poor Barney is being persecuted simply because he's
gay. This is pure baloney. No heterosexual congressman or senator
would have the slightest hope of escaping condemnation and the
destruction of his political career if he had carried on the way
Frank did.
   Not at issue, by the way, is Frank's homosexuality. One should
never be persecuted for what one is, only for what one does. And
what Frank did should earn him a roasting before the Ethics
Committee and a one-way ticket back to Michael Dukakisville.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle on POWs and MIAs:
   American servicemen are alive today and being held against their
will in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia (and possibly North Korea).
   Boat people fleeing Vietnam have reported seeing light-skinned
prisoners of war there, and satellite photos have revealed the
existence of jungle camps in Laos that could be prisoner-of-war
camps. ...
   It's critical that these good men who have given their country so
much not be forgotten now that the Vietnam War is starting to fade
from memory.
   The flying of the Prisoner-of-War@Missing-in-Action flag from
governmental institutions throughout the land is one way of ensuring
that. The flag portrays a once-young American, head bowed, with a
prison camp guard tower in the background.

to examine the sun. ...
   Farquhar believes that the probe ... could be built so that at
Jupiter it could split, sending one part back to the (desired path

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on precision flying shows:
   The show went on at the Canadian International Air Show ... after
two Canadian fighter jets touched and tumbled into Lake Ontario,
killing Capt. Shane Antaya and injuring his commander, Maj. Dan
Dempsey. Captain Antaya was only 24 years old.
   It's time for the show to stop.
   Precision flying shows perform three positive functions. They
help recruiters interest young people in military flying. They
provide cheap, usually free, thrills to millions of onlookers. And
they provide work for the people who must build another jet each
time one crashes. ...
   The young men who die in these crashes are told that they are
serving their country. ...
   A moment of reflection of that concept uncovers the deception of
it. Their lives are serving the public relations needs of a giant

World War II. Their lost lives are about as useful as a 60-second

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on South African elections:
   It's hard to find reason for hope in South Africa, but recent
national elections may shine a sliver of light for the future of the
minority white government.
   Gains by the anti-apartheid forces on the left were partially
offset by gains on the racist right. Both gained strength at the
expense of the majority party in the center.
   What that could mean for the future isn't certain. It suggests
that South African whites are becoming more polarized. But that may
be the only way to force the Afrikaner majority to abandon the
stupidity of apartheid, grant blacks a voice in the future, and
rejoin the civilized world.

   Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader on communism:
   So far, it's been a lousy year for communism.
   There has been widespread revolt against the Red Menace in
Poland, which in January elected its first non-Communist government
in about 40 years.
   In China last June, about a million students and workers spent
weeks protesting Communist domination in their country _ a rebellion
that wouldn't quit until the army, on orders from the government,
moved in with tanks and bullets.
   Not long ago, the people of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania started
turning up the heat in their quest to rid themselves of Soviet
domination.
   And on Monday came the latest slap in the face to the
powerbrokers of communism, when 7,000 East Germans fled to freedom.
   Incredibly, they were able to do so because another Communist
country, Hungary, agreed to their passage to Austria and,
eventually, West Germany. ...
   What has prompted this welcome trend? And why now, all of a
sudden? As we see it, several factors are responsible. For one
thing, communism has not delivered on its promises. Instead of
prosperity in its host nations, it has brought economic decline.
Instead of spreading happiness, it has brought grief. Instead of
gaining respect for its followers worldwide, it has brought them
shame.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on illegal aliens in the census count:
   Since the first nationwide count in 1790, the Census Bureau has
tallied the entire population of the United States, as the
Constitution specifies, without regard to individuals' residency
status.
   But there is now a move on Capitol Hill to disregard illegal
immigrants in the 1990 tally.
   The intent of this effort, led by a number of Southern senators
and representatives, is to dilute the congressional representation
of states such as Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico
and Texas, whose populations include large numbers of undocumented
aliens.
   The head count is required by the Constitution every 10 years to
apportion seats in the House of Representatives. Because the total
number of House seats remains constant at 435, states with
fast-growing populations pick up additional seats at the expense of
states where the growth rate is below average.
   Lawmakers should read the Constitution, including the 14th
Amendment, which uses the word ``persons'' as opposed to
``citizens'' in determining electoral apportionment.
   Every census in the past 200 years has counted all persons. To do
otherwise would pretend that literally millions of residents in our
midst simply don't count.

<HEAD>Veterans Groups Split Over Flag Statute, Amendment</HEAD>

   Senators weighing the options of a regular bill
or a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning heard today that
veterans groups aren't united on the issue.
   The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars told the
Senate Judiciary Committee they supported President Bush's position
that a constitutional amendment was the only way to overcome the
Supreme Court ruling that made flag burning a legally protected form
of expression.
   The testimony came a day after the House sent the flag issue back
to the Senate by approving its bill outlawing flag burning by a
380-38 margin.
   ``We believe the only ironclad way to protect our flag is through
a constitutional amendment,'' said Walter G. Hogan, the VFW's
commander-in-chief. Whether any regular statute could pass muster
with the court was doubtful, he said.
   Leaders of the Vietnam Veterans of America and the Paralyzed
Veterans of America said, however, they thought a statute could be
tried first, before tinkering with the Constitution.
   ``Our members share the `fury factor' with other Americans on
this subject, but they are unprepared to sacrifice free speech in
the process of assuring that flag desecration is properly
punished,'' said Mary R. Stout, national president of the Vietnam
veterans group.
   Democrats after Tuesday's House vote that passage of the statute
might weaken the push for a similar constitutional amendment, but
Bush and others vowed to fight for their politically more strident
approach.
   ``I think there are probably enough members now that will vote
against a constitutional amendment that they won't be able to get
the two-thirds required by the Constitution to pass one,'' said Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,
said a constitutional amendment is not necessary to many citizens
and lawmakers who want to protect the flag.
   ``If a statute will do it, fine,'' he said.
   However, Bush and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill contend that
a law cannot overcome the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in June that
burning the flag is a form of free speech protected by the
Constitution.
   Many Democrats say a constitutional amendment would tinker
dangerously with the Bill of Rights.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, predicted the
new version would be approved by the court because it would outlaw
the act of flag-mutilation and not the intent of the offender.
   Republicans, however, say courts would quickly strike it down
again.
   ``We believe that this bill is insufficient to provide the
protections that we seek, and therefore continue to press for a
constitutional amendment,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``This bill is flatly unconstitutional,'' said Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. ``So all passing this bill has done is delay a
vote on a constitutional amendment to protect the flag from
burning,'' he said, acknowledging he was disappointed that only 21
Republicans joined him in voting against it.
   Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., complained that the Democratic bill
was a sham. ``This is the flag-burner protection act of 1989,'' he
said.
   The bill sets penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine for
anyone who knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, or tramples upon a
U.S. flag. It makes an exception for orderly disposal of worn-out
flags, which is usually carried out by veterans groups by burning.
   The legislation, sent to the Senate, also sets a procedure for
expedited court review of its constitutionality the next time a
federal flag-burning case comes along.
   But the Capitol Hill showdown on the constitutional amendment
probably will come before the statute, if enacted, is ever tested.
   To help gain Republican votes for the statute, House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., promised supporters of the constitutional
amendment the House will vote on the proposed amendment after the
Senate acts in October.
   Foley denied that scheduling a vote on the amendment _ a vote
which it appeared earlier he intended to block _ was an
acknowledgement that the Democratic strategy was losing.
   ``It might be taken exactly the opposite way,'' he said, as
``confidence (in) a vote to reject a constitutional amendment.''
   Foley said the House Democratic leadership still believes a
constitutional amendment is unnecessary and such action should be
avoided ``particularly in the sensitive area of the First
Amendment.''
   Bush's presidential campaign included a stop at a flag factory,
and GOP leaders consider the flag burning question a ``wedge issue''
which helps break apart Democratic electoral strength.

   The Bush administration, facing ``tidal waves''
of complaints from the elderly, said today it is exploring with
members of Congress possible ways to replace an unpopular surtax to
finance catastrophic health insurance.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said administration
officials are looking for ways to ``preserve the benefits of the
program and maintain the financial aspects of it as well.''
   ``The administration is ... talking with congressional committee
members about possible changes in the system that would mitigate the
premium costs to certain categories of elder citizens,'' he said,
referring to the highly unpopular surtax that, if dropped without
replacement revenue, would push the federal budget deficit above the
legally set ceiling.
   As the Senate Finance Committee searched Tuesday for last-ditch
ways to prevent repeal of the program, administration officials said
a repeal is unacceptable because of the revenue loss it would cause.
   The administration is ``listening and learning'' to what Congress
proposes in the way of alternatives to finance the insurance
program, said William Diefenderfer III, deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget.
   The surtax, paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of all retirees, is
the chief financing mechanism for the catastrophic insurance program
enacted a year ago as an expansion of Medicare.
   Bush supported the plan during his presidential campaign last
year.
   ``The administration thought it was a good program when it
passed'' during the Reagan administration, said White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   But now, he said, the ``political aspects'' of the program have
become clear.
   ``The elderly complaints are rolling in tidal waves of immense
proportion,'' Fitzwater said. ``We recognize the impact on the
elderly ... We recognize their concern. We're working with Congress
..., searching for a way to mitigate the financial problems and save
the program.''
   Most of the complaints come from middle and upper income retirees
who contend they are bearing most of the cost of the program, and
those who are covered by private insurance plans.
   But Diefenderfer said repeal of the entire program _ and the loss
of its $4 billion to $7 billion in surtax revenue _ probably would
force automatic spending cuts in other federal programs, including
those that benefit the elderly and needy Americans.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said after a closed-door session of the panel Tuesday
that, ``There is no question in my mind that we are going to face an
amendment on the (Senate) floor to repeal catastrophic.''
   He said the committee is working to strip away all but basic
elements of the program to reduce costs to the minimum. This could
lead to elimination of payments for prescription drugs and for
skilled nursing care.
   The House Ways and Means Committee already has voted to reduce
benefits and the two taxes that finance the program.
   Strong sentiment from House members for repeal was conveyed to
Bush on Tuesday in a meeting with GOP congressional leaders.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia said after the
meeting that he had noted ``a dramatic shift'' in the
administration's willingness to amend the program.
   The Senate Finance Committee agreed informally last week that the
surtax would be cut significantly, that the flat monthly premium
would not be changed and that beneficiaries would have to pay a
bigger share of expenses for drugs and doctors' bills before
reimbursement under the catastrophic care program begins.
   Everyone eligible for Medicare is required to pay into the
catastrophic care program. About two-thirds of the costs are paid by
retirees who make enough to pay more than $150 a year in federal
income taxes. Their surtax _ of up to $800 _ is 15 percent of their
income taxes.
   The remaining costs come from a flat $4 monthly premium paid by
all but the poorest of the 33 million people eligible for Medicare.
   When catastrophic illness protection was enacted last year, it
was predicted to cost about $31 billion over five years. The latest
forecasts put that figure at $45 billion or more.

<HEAD>Dukakis Announces Plan to Combat Mortgage Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis outlined a plan today to
fight discrimination in mortgage lending, including stricter
enforcement.
   The plan followed a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
last month that documented racial patterns in lending.
   ``The Federal Reserve Bank study should be the concern of every
fair-minded citizen of Massachusetts,'' Dukakis said. ``The steps
I'm announcing today will help guarantee that credit in the
commonwealth is color blind.''
   The immediate steps announced by Dukakis will target
state-chartered banks in Boston and other urban areas for tougher
evaluation of their compliance with a federal and state statute that
requires banks to meet local credit needs.
   It will also link compliance with the statute, the Community
Reinvestment Act, to all bank applications requiring the state
Banking Division's approval.
   Next week, Dukakis said, he will ask the Legislature to
strengthen the power of state regulators to guard against
discrimination in mortgage lending.
   Among other things, the governor's proposals would mandate
participation by all lenders in a review board process that resolves
disputes over the denial of mortgages, and would add people from
outside the industry to each board. Currently, participation by
lenders is voluntary.
   The legislative package would also place mortgage companies,
brokers and all parties making five or more mortgage loans a year
under the specific licensing and examination powers of the state
division of banks.
   The legislation would also open community-reinvestment
evaluations to the public. Currently, the law requires them to be
kept confidential.
   The Federal Reserve report found that that Boston's black
neighborhoods received 24 percent fewer home loans than white
neighborhoods.

<HEAD>House OKs Nuclear Cleanup in Energy and Water Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved a compromise $18.6
billion spending bill that includes $1.65 billion for cleanup of
environmental damage at Energy Department nuclear weapons plants.
   The 392-27 vote Tuesday represented the House's acceptance of a
compromise energy and water plan that had been agreed to by
congressional negotiators earlier this month.
   The $1.65 billion for cleanup work at the nuclear weapons
facilities is earmarked for the budget year starting Oct. 1. Final
approval by the Senate is necessary before the overall bill goes to
the White House for President Bush's signature.
   Among the funds appropriated for waste cleanup was $27.6 million
to bring the Hanford nuclear reservation, near Richland, Wash., into
compliance with environmental standards, and $29.1 million for a
Hanford ``vitrification'' facility that is designed to treat
radioactive waste by turning it into a glass-like substance.
   The measure also provides $55 million for environmental, health
and safety improvements at the Feed Materials Production Center,
near Fernald, Ohio, which processes uranium for the weapons program
and has been tied to extensive environmental damage.
   An additional $26.7 million was appropriated for unspecified
environmental and safety improvements at other plants.
   Among other energy projects to be financed in the coming budget
year is a modification to the plutonium recovery facility, known as
Building 371, at the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Denver. The bill
appropriates $45 million for that work.
   Another provision of the bill earmarks $225 million for the
superconducting super collider, a massive physics installation at
which scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy.
The facility, expected to cost $5.9 billion, is to be built in Ellis
County, Texas.
   The Bush administration had requested $250 million for the
project for 1990, but Congress reduced the construction funds from
$160 million to $135 million while meeting the administration's
requests for operating expenses and capital equipment.

   With Brown and another grounds crew member in pursuit,
Zlotorzynski ran from the parking lot as Brown yelled to several
policemen directing traffic that the man had just stolen a base.
   Before he could make it to his car, Zlotorzynski was nabbed by
Sgt. John Corning. He was charged with larceny of a $35 base and was

<TEXT>
   President Bush's dealings with the changing
communist world so far reflect a calculated caution, and his
non-meeting meeting with Soviet maverick Boris Yeltsin fits the mold.
   Ever the diplomat, Bush sought to avoid offending Soviet Leader
Mikhail Gorbachev by limiting his contact with the outspoken
Yeltsin, here on a speaking tour of the United States.
   Instead of scheduling a meeting with Yeltsin, well known for his
criticism of Gorbachev's policies, Bush chose instead to ``drop by''
an ongoing meeting at the White House between Yeltsin and Bush's
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
   Furthermore, Bush did it on Tuesday shortly before he was to go
on the air with his televised midday anti-drug speech to U.S.
students.
   That limited the time of Bush's exposure to Yeltsin to about 15
minutes and gave Bush something to talk about with him other than
Gorbachev's shortcomings.
   Thus, the White House was able to put out a statement noting Bush
and Yeltsin agreed ``drugs are major problem that touches on both
American and Soviet societies.''
   Since Yeltsin's objective in coming to Washington was clearly not
to discuss drug policy, the choreographed Bush encounter enabled the
president to wiggle out of getting involved in domestic Soviet
politics.
   The U.S. statement noted tersely that Bush told Yeltsin
U.S.-Soviet relations are ``in good shape,'' that Americans back
reforms in the Soviet Union, and that the White House continues to
enjoy ``a very positive relationship'' with Gorbachev.
   The White House did not allow reporters or photographers to
attend the Bush-Yeltsin session in a further effort to reduce it to
a non-event.
   Today, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater characterize the
discussion as ``very general and philosophical.''
   Asked about Yeltsin's criticism of Gorbachev, Fitzwater said:
``We're sensitive to the progress that's being made'' on the Soviet
president's reform initiatives. ``We don't have any comment on any
speculation on his relative strength.''
   On the decision of communist-led Hungary to open its borders to
allow West Germans to flee to Austria en route to West Germany,
Fitzwater today gave another example of the caution that the
administration has used in dealing with changes in the communist
world.
   ``We want to be supportive, but keep a soft voice,'' the
spokesman said. ``We have been supportive of Hungary's steps to
facilitate the refugees moving from East Germany to West Germany and
other locations.''
   But he indicated the United States did not want to get itself
involved in a policy dispute between Hungary and East Germany on the
matter.
   ``We don't want to speculate on other kinds of consequences. It
might be inflamatory or interpreted as internal meddling,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush also showed extreme caution and efforts at balance in his
earlier decisions and pronouncements on China, the new government in
Poland and East-West arms negotiations.
   In his response to the bloody Chinese government suppression of
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square last spring, Bush, who served as
U.S. envoy to Beijing in the 1970s, took a cautious middle ground.
   While imposing some sanctions, he stopped short of taking trade
actions he said would hurt the Chinese people; and he sought to keep
the lines of communication open with the government even as he
denounced the bloodshed.
   When a Solidarity activist became Poland's new prime minister
last month, leading the first non-communist government in the Soviet
bloc, the president warmly congratulated the new leader, Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   But at the same time, he praised the leader of the old regime,
communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, for his ``statesmanship''
in cooperating with the new leadership.
   And Bush's response to nuclear-arms negotiations with the
Soviets, particularly on the subject of nuclear warheads in Europe,
was also calculated.
   After a long period of study and delay, the president finally
came forth with a compromise proposal he unveiled at last May's NATO
summit in Brussels _ one that eased a rift among NATO allies.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House sought a way to receive Yeltsin that balanced ``the diplomatic
aspects of his visit (with) the political realities of his visit.''
   Fitzwater suggested it would have been hard for Bush to snub the
Soviet visitor.
   After all, the spokesman noted, Gorbachev met in Moscow with Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and other members of the opposition
Democratic Party ``so there is some history, or some precedent, for
a meeting like this.''
   Still, Fitzwater said: ``We didn't want to indicate that we were
trying to provide a platform for dissent, as it were.''

   Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, will
ban ivory imports from Africa next week, the International Trade and
Industry Ministry said Wednesday.
   Masahiko Isono, a ministry official, said the ban will last at
least until the end of the year.
   Japan has been under pressure to ban imports of ivory products to
protect elephants, which are hunted for their ivory tusks.
   The United States, Britain, France and West Germany have banned
   Isono said Japan imported 106 tons of ivory last year, compared
with 143 tons in 1987. In 1983, Japan imported 475 tons, Isono said.

   Police arrested 53 Vietnamese boat people
suspected of robbery, rape and other crimes during unrest on the
island where they had been housed, authorities said Wednesday.
   The arrested Vietnamese were among about 5,000 boat people placed
on Tai A Chau island after sailing into this British colony seeking
refuge from their Communist homeland.
   Violence on the island broke out last month. When police arrived,
they said about 1,000 Vietnamese threw stones at them. The police
fired tear gas to disperse the mob and then left the island.
   Senior police official Gregory Lam told local radio that 17 cases
of rape were reported during the island disturbance. Eight people
were arrested in connection with 12 of the cases, he said.
   Tai A Chau was evacuated earlier this month after a cholera
outbreak.

   A moderate earthquake jolted an area of
northern Iran on Wednesday, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported. There were no reports of damage or injuries.
   IRNA said the quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale and hit
near Gorgan, at the southeast corner of the Caspian Sea.
   The Tehran University Geophysics Center, which measured the
strength of the quake, said it occurred at 10:32 a.m.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion registered on a
seismograph. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freak snowfall and record cold delighted
winter-wheat farmers, delayed airline passengers and threw Denver's
homeless off guard.
   ``The farmers with the dryland winter wheat are just jumping up
and down because this'll take them through the whole season,'' said
Joe Baskin of the National Weather Service. ``The ground was dry for
planting. This could double production.''
   Denver's 2,600 to 3,200 homeless were unprepared for the 2 inches
of wet snow and high of only 39 degrees Tuesday, and neither were
area shelters. The old record for the lowest high temperature for
the date was 46, set in 1974.
   ``We were definitely unprepared. We didn't have a coat to give
out,'' said Roy Chappell, program director for the Salvation Army's
Shelter.
   The earliest snowfall on record in Denver was Sept. 3, 1961, with
4.2 inches.
   Travelers at Stapleton International Airport experienced average
delays of an hour and 45 minutes because of poor visibility, a
spokesman reported. The heavy snow downed power lines and caused
outages throughout the Denver area.
   Greeley tied the record for its earliest snowfall of the year,
set in 1974, said Glen Cobb, meteorologist at the University of
Northern Colorado.
   Weld County, northeast of Denver, got as much as 3 inches of
snow. Evergreen, in the foothills west of Denver, had six.
Strangely, the high temperature in the state was in the mountain
hamlet of Glenwood Springs, with 71.
   Forecasters said the Arctic cold front would start moving out
slowly today, and temperatures were expected to reach the 70s and
80s by the weekend.

   Polished to a high shine by spy fiction but
tarnished by real-life traitors, British intelligence reportedly is
planning to lift its blanket of secrecy.
   If newspaper reports are correct, the security service known as
MI5 is about to go so far down the road of glasnost as to tell the
public who its boss is.
   It might not sound like much in an age when the head of the
Soviet KGB appears on television and assures legislators he's no
longer bugging their homes.
   The KGB went so far Wednesday as to show a film to journalists,
``The KGB Today,'' billed as the first documentary about the
organization and slated for distribution both inside and outside the
Soviet Union.
   The film included looks at the interior of KGB headquarters in
Moscow and scenes of KGB martial arts training and target practice,
along with comments from KGB Chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, who
portrayed the modern secret agent as a well-educated professional
increasingly involved in fighting smuggling, organized crime and
drug trafficking.
   But the changes described in the British press would be a
revolution for MI5, whose very existence was not enshrined in law
until this year. It would mean goodbye to ``C'' and ``M'' and
``Control,'' as Britain's spymasters have become known through the
novels of John le Carre and Ian Fleming.
   According to the newspapers, MI5 wants to advertise openly for
intelligence officers, be listed in the telephone book, and have its
director-general comment on public issues.
   The government response to the reports has been less than
glasnostic.
   ``We never comment on such matters,'' said a spokesman for the
Home Office, the department in charge of MI5, when asked about a
recent front-page report in The Independent newspaper.
   Nevertheless, the news reports have triggered lively debate.
   The Guardian suggested an MI5 job advertisement: ``Wanted:
intelligent men and women to work for the Security Service, commonly
known as MI5. Under new management, MI5 is an equal opportunity
employer...''
   Robert Cecil, a veteran diplomat attached to British intelligence
in World War II, wrote in The Independent that recruiting problems
stem from politicians and journalists ``who persistently denigrate
the secret services.''
   He also blamed fiction writers who portray secret agents ``as
villains, dupes or traitors,'' adding: ``Can we wonder that young
people do not flock to enlist in such ranks?''
   MI5's job is to catch terrorists, subversives and spies operating
in Britain. There has been no suggestion that its sister agency
running overseas intelligence, MI6, also will open its doors.
   However, most spy watchers believe Britain eventually will step
into line with its major English-speaking intelligence partners, the
United States, Australia and Canada.
   A new Security Services Act this year laid out a charter for MI5,
established a complaints tribunal and made wiretapping subject to
ministerial approval. But it stopped short of making the service
accountable to Parliament and made no mention of MI6.
   Cambridge University historian Christopher Andrew, a leading
expert on the secret services, believes things will change only when
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher leaves office.
   He attributes the secrecy more to Victorian taboos than security
considerations.
   ``What is truly un-British is to admit we have spies. And the
present prime minister is so imbued with Victorian principles that
she is no more likely to ask about British spies in public than she
is to raise the subject of sex at dinner parties,'' Andrew said in
an interview.
   The newspapers identified the latest head of MI5 as Patrick
Walker, a career intelligence officer appointed a year ago who
apparently cut his teeth tracking the Irish Republican Army in
Northern Ireland.
   But no pictures have been published. The most detailed
description _ published without attribution in London's Observer
newspaper _ said Walker is in his late 50s, about 6 feet tall,
graying, with a big nose and a not quite upper-class accent. It
didn't say where he went to school, whether he is married, plays
golf or reads James Bond thrillers.
   Walker himself wants a more public stance, the papers say, partly
so that MI5 can claim some credit for its successes, partly to
dispel the public perception that it is right-wing and given to
occasional illegalities.
   The secret services could use better publicity. The names of the
traitors of the 1950s and 1960s _ Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald
Maclean _ linger, and others have followed.

   PTL continued giving Jim Bakker fat
bonuses even while it was losing money, the ministry's former
finance director testified today.
   ``We're spending as if there's no crisis,'' Peter Bailey, the
former finance director, said in a 1984 memo to Bakker and PTL
executive vice president Richard Dortch, who was indicted with
Bakker and pleaded guilty.
   In November 1983, Bailey testified, he told Bakker that
contributions for that month totaled $4.7 million while expenditures
were $6.8 million. Two weeks later, prosecutor Deborah Smith said,
the board voted a $150,000 bonus for Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   Bailey, testifying at Bakker's fraud trial, said he wrote in a
March 1984 memo that ``every day brings us into a deeper crisis''
and that more than $700,000 was needed to meet the payroll. Less
than two weeks later, records showed that Bakker got a $390,000
bonus.
   On Tuesday, a coal miner's wife who gave $1,000 of her husband's
black-lung benefits for lodging at PTL said she was told there was
no room at the inn where Bakker luxuriated in a suite with
gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures.
   ``I expected this to get a vacation every year ... for the rest
of our lives. That was what was sold to us,'' Sarah Combs, who has
13 children and whose family lives on $400 a month, testified at
Bakker's fraud trial.
   Also Tuesday, two former Bakker advisers testified they warned
the PTL founder he was risking legal troubles by taking too much
money from the ministry. High salaries taken by Bakker and his
relatives threatened PTL's tax-exempt status, the former attorney
and former accountant said.
   The attorney, John Yorke, said he sent a memo to his law firm
boss citing concerns about 1983 wages earned by Bakker and his wife,
Tammy.
   ``Together, Jim and Tammy have a monthly income of more than
$30,000,'' he wrote. ``Jim has already received one bonus this year
totaling $390,000. He could possibly earn more than $1 million this
year.''
   Guy Forcucci, a certified public accountant who worked for PTL in
the early 1980s and prepared Bakker's tax returns, testified he had
warned Bakker as early as 1982 about his high salary.
   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million for his
personal benefit from PTL, which kept its tax-exempt status as a
religious organization until 1988, almost a year after Bakker quit
in a sex and money scandal.
   Prosecutors say Bakker used his TV show to sell fraudulent $1,000
``lifetime partnerships'' promising free lodging for a lifetime that
PTL could not provide.
   Asked about Bakker's decision to issue tens of thousands more
partnerships than the 25,000 he first announced, Yorke said he
believes PTL was legally obliged ``to go back to the original 25,000
and tell them they had changed the terms and give them an
opportunity to get their money back.''
   Bakker made no such disclosure or offer, according to previous
testimony in the federal court trial.
   ``Jim didn't like to hear bad news,'' Yorke testified. ``On
several occasions when Eddie got stern with him, he turned around
and wouldn't look at him.''
   Prosecutor Jerry Miller asked how long Bakker would refuse to
look at Knox, Yorke said, ``Until he left.'' PTL hired new attorneys
in 1986.
   Combs, of Spanishburg, W.Va., testified that she and her husband,
who has black lung disease, bought their partnership in 1984 from
her husband's $19,000 disability fund but were unable to get hotel
reservations at Heritage USA.
   ``Every time I called I got somebody different, and they'd give
us a different reason why we couldn't get a reservation,'' she said.
   A glum Bakker listened and scribbled notes as the jury watched a
videotape of a 1986 TV pitch he made describing a lifetime
partnership offer as ``magnificent,'' ``wonderful'' and
``spectacular.''
   Also testifying was interior decorator James Taggart, who was
sentenced to 17 years in prison and fined $500,000 last week for tax
evasion while at PTL.
   Taggart described a videotape showing the 4,000-square-foot suite
often used by Bakker and his family in the Heritage Grand Hotel at
the PTL ministry's Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.
   The decorator described gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures,
antique beds and mirrored walls in the bedroom. He said the suite
included a 10-by-60-foot closet for Mrs. Bakker.
   If convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakker
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5
million.

   The lawyer for U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon
told a Senate impeachment trial committee today that the perjury
case against the judge is ill-founded because the judge never lied
and had no reason to lie.
   ``He is accused of lying to conceal his innocence,'' defense
attorney David Stewart said in his closing statement to the
12-member committee. ``That makes no sense. It did not happen.''
   The case against Nixon, the imprisoned chief federal judge in
Mississippi's southern district, stems from statements he made to
federal investigators and a grand jury about a marijuana-smuggling
case involving the son of a businessman from whom he purchased
lucrative oil properties.
   Nixon said Tuesday that when he spoke to federal authorities and
the grand jury he did not remember the conversations that have led
to his conviction in federal court on perjury charges.
   Stewart said today that even if Nixon had remembered them and
told federal authorities, the talks were not improper and would not
have led to any charges against the judge.
   He said the trial jury came to the wrong conclusion on the
perjury indictments because it was distracted by an illegal-gratuity
charge that had no basis and on which Nixon was acquitted.
   The articles of impeachment accuse Nixon of lying when he said he
did not discuss or influence the case involving Drew Fairchild, the
50-year-old son of wealthy oilman Wiley Fairchild.
   But Stewart said each of the witnesses that went before the
Senate committee denied that the talks they had with Nixon were
``discussions'' about the case.
   And the key witness, county prosecutor Paul ``Bud'' Holmes,
testified that the conversation he had with Nixon did not influence
how he handled the Drew Fairchild case.
   On Tuesday, Nixon said his conversations March 11, 1983 about the
Drew Fairchild case were ``such a nothing thing in my life'' and
that after they were over he immediately forgot about them.
   ``I had no intention to hide anything. There was nothing to
hide,'' said Nixon. ``It has been blown up so much and magnified. It
amounted to nothing. It resulted in nothing.
   ``Everything had been a misunderstanding ... I guess that's why I
didn't remember it.''
   The judge called it ``one little day in my life involving a few
minutes'' that were overshadowed by his docket of 1,400 active
cases, worries over his wife recovering from oral surgery and the
problems of raising seven children.
   Nixon said the conversations he had were not ``discussions'' of
the Fairchild case, but only talk about Fairchild's fear that he was
being blackmailed by the prosecutor _ Holmes _ handling his son's
case.
   ``The thrust of the whole case is that Judge Nixon does not
recall and that is the reason for the statements that he made for
which he is accused of perjury,'' Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., chairman
impeachment trial committee, said Tuesday.
   He said the committee would summarize the evidence for the full
Senate which he expects to hear the case sometime in October.
   Nixon, 60, is serving a five-year prison sentence for perjury.
   Appointed by President Lyndon Johnson, he is the lone Democratic
appointee among nine federal district judges in Mississippi, and
will continue to collect his $89,500 annual salary unless he dies,
resigns or is convicted of the impeachment charges voted unanimously
by the House of Representatives.
   The articles of impeachment approved unanimously by the House
allege that Nixon:
   _Lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do officially
or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never influenced anyone
in the case.
   _Undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and disobeyed the
law by making 14 false or misleading statements during an interview
with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury testimony.

   An English firm could be charged with
cruelty to animals after 79 beagles suffocated on a ferry from
England to Sweden, police said Wednesday.
   Passengers appealed to the ship's crew to find out why the dogs
were crying, but nothing was done.
   Bengt Inaeus, a detective in Sodertalje south of Stockholm, said
100 beagles were put in a van on the ferry from Harwich to the
Swedish port of Goteborg on Sept. 6.
   The Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra planned to use the dogs,
obtained from a kennel in England, to test drugs. Inaeus said when a
kennel worker went to check on the dogs after six hours, 79 were
dead.
   Astra spokesman Staffan Tarnby said the dogs suffocated probably
because of a failure in the van's air supply system.
   Neither Inaeus nor Tarnby would identify the kennel or its
English transport firm.
   ``There were other animals on the ferry, and none of them died,''
Inaeus said. ``So we can't blame the general conditions on the
vessel.''

   Salvadoran rebels today proposed a cease-fire
in their country's decade-old civil war, prosecution of human rights
violators and reduction of the armed forces.
   Rebel leaders made public their proposals at a news conference
moments before renewing talks in Mexico City with representatives of
President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist administration.
   But both sides said they had scant hope of negotiating an early
end to the war, which has cost more than 70,000 lives. Three
previous attempts to negotiate peace from 1984 to 1987 ended in
deadlock.
   Joaquin Villalobos, a top leader of the leftist Faradundo Marti
National Liberation Front guerrillas, and seven other rebel chiefs
distributed a document outlining their proposals, which they said
they will present to the government.
   The rebels called for a negotiated cease-fire by Nov. 15 at the
latest but said it must be accompanied by the reforms. ``This
implies great risks (for the rebels,'' Villalobos said.
   He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting and, ``We are
conscious the war has to end.''
   The proposals called for a U.N. observer team to monitor an end
to political repression, constitutional and land reforms and talks
to advance the 1991 legislative and municipal elections.
   Also proposed was the creation of a new Supreme Court. The rebels
consider the present court dominated by rightists.
   Villalobos said the rebels plan ``to integrate itself into the
country's civil and political life'' gradually, as the reforms are
being carried out.
   There was no immediate public response from the Salvadoran
government.
   The previous negotiations were held during the centrist
administration of Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   When he took office June 1, Cristiani invited the guerrillas to
lay down their arms and engage in talks with his administration. The
rebels and government have called a temporary cease-fire for the
peace talks.
   The rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982, El
Salvador has only a democratic veneer. They say civil liberties are
systematically violated and that citizens risk their lives by
publicly supporting socialism.
   Human rights groups say most victims of the war were killed by
rightist death squads from 1979 to 1984. They say such slayings have
diminished considerably but not ceased.
   Rebels say the 56,000-member armed forces should reduced as the
war ends, and they demand that rightists be weeded out.

the David Letterman TV show, is to join comedian Dan Aykroyd for a
``Blues Brothers'' jam session at groundbreaking ceremonies for The
Great American Pyramid in Memphis.
   The Friday ceremony is to mark the beginning of construction on a
321-foot-tall sports and entertainment arena beside the Mississippi
River at downtown Memphis.
   The Blues Brothers characters were created on ``Saturday Night
Live'' by Aykroyd and the late John Belushi, who also put together a
band and starred in the ``Blues Brothers'' movie.
   Jimmy Ogle, general manager of the city's Mud Island tourist
park, said Shaffer and several members of the Letterman show band
will join Aykroyd's review.

   Teen-age pop star Tiffany has asked the courts
to order a man she says obtained her home address through the state
Department of Motor Vehicles to stay at least 200 yards away from
her.
   The 17-year-old singer, whose last name is Darwish, says Jeff
Deane Turner, 35, of Santa Cruz, has harassed her for more than a
year and has threatened to cause her physical or emotional injury.
   She filed a Superior Court petition Tuesday asking that Turner,
whom she described as an obsessed fan, be ordered away from her.
   ``The defendant has sent me numerous letters, one of which states
that God wants us to be together,'' she said in the petition.
   Two months ago, actress Rebecca Schaeffer was shot to death by a
man police say was an obsessed fan of the 21-year-old co-star of the
series ``My Sister Sam.''
   Other celebrities who have recently reported harassment by fans
include former ``Family Ties'' TV stars Michael J. Fox and Justine
Bateman.
   In June, a state parole board delayed for at least nine months
the release on parole of the man convicted of a nearly fatal knife
attack on Theresa Saldana in 1982.

   American Greg LeMond, winner of this year's Tour de
France and the bicycling world championship, said Wednesday he has
signed a three-year, $5.5-million contract with the French ``Z''
cycling team.
   The contract, the richest ever in cycling, was announced at a
news conference by LeMond and Roger Zannier, president of Z, a
children's clothing manufacturer.
   ``I had the possibility between 7-Eleven, Toshiba and Z. I
analyzed very carefully every team,'' LeMond said.
   LeMond had a contract with the Belgian ADR team in conjunction
with Coors that would have paid him about $500,000 this year, but he
has contended that ADR broke the terms of the contract and owes him
about $350,000.

<HEAD>U.S. Secretary Calls for Urgent Changes in Japan's Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called
Wednesday for structural changes in Japan's economy and fewer trade
barriers to allow the United States to compete with Japan and to
benefit Japanese consumers.
   The plight of Japanese consumers, who pay among the highest
prices in the world for housing and food, results directly from the
country's closed market, Mosbacher said.
   ``All we're doing is asking for the right to come here and
compete,'' he told reporters during a 15-day trip to Asia and
Eastern Europe.
   Aides traveling with Mosbacher said his meetings Wednesday with
officials of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry produced
``non-responses to a number of concerns'' of the United States,
among them access to the market for satellites, digital switching
equipment and optical fibers.
   Mosbacher also joined a government-sponsored meeting of 83
foreign companies doing business in Japan. It was the first in a
series of forums meant to expand imports.
   Hikaru Matsunaga, Japan's minister of international trade and
industry, told the group that imports rose 11.3 percent in the first
half of 1989.
   Mosbacher acknowledged several areas in which Japan voluntarily
has limited its exports to the United States _ steel, textiles,
semiconductors and machine tools. But he said these are the
exception.
   ``The United States is the largest and the most open market in
the world and, unfortunately, Japan is among the most closed,'' he
said.
   He said the $52 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit with Japan
last year was ``still far too high,'' but noted it had declined 32
percent from its peak in the third quarter of 1987.
   Mosbacher said the United States is working to reduce its federal
budget deficit, increase domestic savings to lower the cost of
capital, and emphasize long-term business planning.
   But he asked Japan to produce urgently some ``made in Japan''
solutions to the problems its export-led economic success has caused
the United States. He said, for instance, a less cumbersome
distribution system in Japan would lower prices.
   Japan, which had a June unemployment rate of 2.2 percent, says
paring its distribution system would eliminate many jobs.
   In response to criticism that the United States is pushing Japan
to fundamentally change its way of life to boost U.S.
competitiveness here, Mosbacher said, ``When your culture affects
the rest of the world, it might be time to temper it.''
   ``The individual entrepreneur is part of our genius, but we have
to temper that to some degree because of the challenge of
competition abroad,'' he said. ``Japan might want to consider this
in the same way.''

   France is sending a senior diplomat to Iran to
resume talks on settling long-standing differences with the Islamic
Republic, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
   The ministry's secretary-general, Francois Scheer, will go to
Tehran on Monday ``to take up with Iranian authorities discussions
on the differences between the two countries,'' a spokesman said.
   Paris and Tehran have been negotiating the repayment of $1
billion that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran loaned to France for
a nuclear project.
   France has repaid $630 million but is demanding compensation for
its losses following the Iranian revolution that resulted in the
shah's ouster in 1979.
   The two countries re-established diplomatic ties in June 1988,
nearly six weeks after France's last three hostages in Lebanon were
freed. Ties were broken at the height of a battle of wills over an
Iranian Embassy employee wanted for questioning about terrorist
attacks in Paris.
   Iran also has claimed the former conservative government of
Premier Jacques Chirac promised to free Anis Naccache, the head of a
commando team serving a life sentence for the attempted
assassination in 1980 of the shah's last prime minister, Shahpour
Bakhtiar.
   When French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas visited Tehran in
February, Iran said Paris had not kept promises made in negotiations
for freeing the three French hostages.
   France has denied negotiating for its hostages' freedom, and the
Socialist government of President Francois Mitterrand says it has no
knowledge of any deals.

<HEAD>Residents Love Mill Project At Center of HUD Controversy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wilma Smith is unhappy with the notoriety her
home has gained as a result of the HUD scandals in Washington, and
she has a simple wish.
   ``I hope they finish this thing up with HUD so everyone can get
back to being a happy family,'' says Mrs. Smith, 54, who has lived
for nearly two years at the Durham Hosiery Mill housing project.
   Ella Holeman, another resident, praises her home at the
renovated, turn of the century factory as safe.
   But it isn't questions of security or comfort that interest
investigators in Washington _ it's political influence.
   The mill project has become a symbol of influence peddling at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan era,
and is expected to be discussed prominently Friday when
congressional hearings resume with the scheduled testimony of former
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Pierce in May told Congress he played no major role in HUD
funding decisions. But shortly afterward, a former deputy, Shirley
Wiseman, said her boss personally ordered the North Carolina project
funded over the objections of several agency experts. Ms. Wiseman
also disclosed that the city's then-mayor, who lobbied HUD for the
funding, was a former law partner of Pierce's. Other locally
prominent Republicans became involved in shepherding the project to
approval.
   Since the disclosures, Pierce has been publicly linked to a
number of other HUD funding decisions, all within his legal
authority.
   In an interview published this week, the former secretary
acknowledged approving the $15 million Durham project, which opened
in November 1987.
   ``Occasionally you have to step in an overrule your staff,'' he
told Time magazine. ``That Durham project was a great success.''
   Critics question the wisdom of turning the mill into low-income
housing because it is near railroad tracks and on a site believed to
be contaminated by toxic wastes. But Mrs. Smith and her fellow
tenants agree with Pierce.
   The four buildings of the complex have been connected with
glass-enclosed walkways. All of the apartments are carpeted and
include private bathrooms, kitchens and combination living-dining
areas. The complex also features a recreation room, a reading-TV
room and laundry areas.
   ``I love the environment,'' said Christine Gooch, 50, who has
lived at the project for a year. ``It's convenient to the bus stop,
grocery stores and downtown.''
   ``I like everything about it,'' said Rubin Johnson, 69, who moved
to the Hosiery Mill five months ago. ``I feel very safe here.''
   The mill, built in 1902, employed about 1,000 people in its
owners' heyday as the world's largest supplier of cotton hosiery.
The mill shut down in 1936 and in 1978 was placed on the National
Register of Historic Places.
   HUD records show the mill project, which was developed by John L.
Allen of Myerson-Allen Co. Inc. of Boston, languished in financial
trouble for six years, winning HUD funding only after Allen hired
two Republican consultants.
   One was Lou Kitchin, the southeastern political director for the
Reagan and Bush presidential campaigns. He received $25,000. City
records show Allen also paid $12,000 to GOP state Rep. Harold J.
Brubaker.
   Kitchin said he did not take advantage of his political ties and
only helped Allen put his HUD proposal together. Brubaker said his
role was to bring Allen and Kitchin together and he collected only
airfare and expenses for his work.
   Then-Mayor Charles Markham also lobbied HUD. Markham and Pierce
practiced at the same law firm in the 1960s.
   ``We are not social friends,'' Markham said in a recent
interview. ``My contacts with him in the last 24 years have been
very infrequent and very casual.''
   Markham wrote several letters to HUD and met with Pierce's top
aide, Deborah Gore Dean to seek support for the project.
   ``These conversations were for us to set out why we felt this
project would be good for Durham,'' Markham said. ``I still think
it's a good project.''
   Still, the controversy surrounding the project prompted its
managers to send residents a memo this summer assuring them they
didn't have to worry about it closing.
   ``Our concern is that residents will misunderstand,'' said Janice
Daley, a regional manager for Myerson-Allen. ``We've been kind of
quelling the rumors and doing the best we can. We said, `Nobody is
going to make you move.'''
   Ms. Daley said the complex has been full since spring. The 174
low-income elderly and disabled people occupy one- and two-bedroom
and efficiency apartments.
   Residents don't care about the political controversy. They prefer
to talk about safety and camaraderie.
   ``The living conditions are good,'' said Ms. Holeman. ``If
somebody is not around, we have somebody to check on you. We have a
sick committee.''
   Mrs. Smith still wishes the attention would pass, saying some
residents remain worried about their future.
   ``Some people don't understand what they read,'' said Mrs. Smith,
head of the tenant association. ``I feel like somebody is ballooning
things out of proportion. Please let us live in peace.''

<HEAD>Archeologists Uncover Remains of Capital's Red-Light District</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archeologists digging just three blocks from
the White House have unearthed thousands of relics from Washington's
notorious old red-light district, where Civil War prostitutes earned
their nickname entertaining Gen. Joseph Hooker's troops.
   Shoveling beneath an asphalt parking lot just south of
Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Commerce Department this
summer, investigators found perfume bottles, gaudy buttons, costume
jewelry, garter hooks and a long-forgotten cellar full of whiskey
and beer bottles.
   There was even a tiny, antique Bromo Seltzer bottle for treating
a morning-after malaise.
   Besides these artifacts of the hookers' trade, the investigators
discovered a wide assortment of everyday objects left by common
laborers, immigrants, runaway slaves and other poor folk who once
inhabited the crime-ridden neighborhood known as ``Murder Bay'' in
the mid-19th century.
   The six-week dig was completed just before Labor Day. Experts
have begun the year-long task of cleaning, cataloging and analyzing
the more than 250,000 objects recovered from the downtown site for
clues to the lifestyle of the humble people who lived there more
than a century ago.
   ``Nobody famous lived here. There's no `George Washington Slept
Here','' said Donna Seifert, principal archeologist with John Milner
Associates Inc., a historic preservation firm based in West Chester,
Pa., which conducted the dig.
   ``These were ordinary working folk, and this is one of those rare
opportunities to learn more about what their lives were really
like,'' she said.
   They lived in a hotbed of vice, gambling and rum running in a
squalid community of row houses and alley shanties between 14th and
13th streets, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the National Theater
and some of Washington's fanciest hotels and offices.
   Hooker, the Union commander defending the capital against
Confederate forces, tried to control the army of prostitutes
following his troops by herding the women into Murder Bay, away from
his encampment outside the city. The district became known as
``Hooker's Division,'' and its ladies of the night took the name of
``hookers.''
   A newspaper article from the 1890s, which Ms. Seifert acquired
from the Library of Congress, declared that the area was ``the
plague spot of Washington'' with 109 brothels and 50 saloons.
   ``Grover Cleveland can sit in his bedroom window at the White
House and survey this entire territory,'' the paper said. ``He is
within sight and gunshot of each of these 109 dens which defy the
laws which he is supposed to execute through his commissioners.''
   The prostitutes packed their bags when Congress outlawed brothels
in the District of Columbia in 1914, and the site was razed in the
late 1920s. Plans to build a monumental plaza were abandoned in the
Depression, and the area was paved over in 1931 to create a
1,300-car parking lot.
   Construction is expected to begin in the fall of 1990 on a
multimillion-dollar federal office building and international
cultural and arts center at the site.
   Because government funds are involved, the developer _ the
Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. _ is required by the 1966
National Historic Preservation Act to review the project for its
impact on cultural resources.
   The archeologists hired for the job consulted old maps, census
records and city directories, and began excavating in mid-July in
their search for backyard ``trash pits'' behind the former wooden
and brick rowhouses.
   They uncovered an old cellar from a rooming house whose boarders
included several prostitutes, and salvaged about 200 empty beer and
liquor bottles. Among the popular brands a century ago were Pabst
Milwaukee, Schlitz and ``John Fitzmorris Old Berwick Rye,'' plus
several earthenware jugs of German-brand ginger beer.
   Also found were fish, chicken and steak bones, many dating back
to the Civil War.
   Ms. Seifert says these and other mundane objects uncovered will
yield valuable information about the denizens of the former gambling
dens, saloons, brothels and boarding houses _ what they ate and
drank, what clothing they wore, how they spent their leisure time.
   ``We know how Thomas Jefferson set his table at Monticello and
who his guests were, for example, but we don't know very much about
the everyday dining habits of the ordinary people who lived in
Washington,'' she said.
   ``The documents tell us nothing about how they lived. And these
people did not save and cherish their household items, as the
wealthy did. They were used until they were broken or worn out, and
then thrown away.''

   An ethics probe of Mayor Tom Bradley today
found insufficient evidence he broke any criminal laws. But the
probe cited financial-disclosure violations that could result in a
reported $2.2 million in civil fines.
   City Attorney James Hahn filed a lawsuit containing the
financial-disclosure allegations at the same time he released a
1,600-page report on his five-month probe.
   The investigation was prompted by conflict-of-interest questions
about the mayor's role as a paid adviser to two banks that did
business with the city, Far East National Bank and Valley Federal
Savings and Loan Association.
   ``Either no evidence exists, or insufficient evidence exists,
depending on the particular transaction or interest involved, to
prove actual violations of law by the mayor,'' the city attorney
concluded.
   Nevertheless, Hahn was critical of the five-term mayor's ethical
conduct and his handling of his personal finances.
   ``While the mayor's employment by Far East National Bank may in
and of itself been legal, it nevertheless served to diminish the
prestige of his office. The mayor should be answerable only to the
citizens of the city and to no other employer,'' Hahn said.
   Bradley scheduled a news conference later in the day to respond
to the report.
   Hahn's suit alleges Bradley intentionally or negligently failed
to report six investments involving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in such companies as L.A. Gear, Metromedia Inc. and Trans World
Airlines.
   Violations of state financial-disclosure laws don't carry any
criminal penalties but can result in fines.
   The lawsuit does not specify the penalties sought by the city
attorney. However, the Los Angeles Times today reported that fines
stemming from more than 100 errors in financial disclosure documents
could reach $2.2 million.
   Bradley was paid $18,000 as a consultant to the Far East bank but
returned the money when news media attention fell on the case.
   Hahn said it was apparent that a March telephone call from
Bradley to City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg did influence
Rittenberg to deposit $2 million in city funds with Far East. But
both Bradley and Rittenberg denied any intent to influence, and Hahn
said investigators found insufficient evidence to warrant charges.
   Bradley is still under investigation by the federal government
for his investments and relationship with indicted junk bond king
Michael Milken.
   Anticipating the report, City Councilman Nate Holden said it
should send a strong message regarding the conduct of public
officials.
   ``I would hope City Hall is changed forever,'' said Holden, who
lost a bid to stop Bradley from winning an unprecedented fifth term
earlier this year.

   Seven rail cars loaded with 140,000 gallons
of a flammable mixture of butane and propane jumped the tracks
today, forcing the evacuation of 15 homes, authorities said. No one
was injured.
   One 20,000-gallon tank car leaked some of the liquefied petroleum
gas, or LPG, after the accident, officials said.
   An area within 1,500 feet of the derailment was cordoned off
because of the threat of explosion, said Southern Pacific spokesman
Andy Anderson.
   Emergency crews in goggles worked to drain off the LPG into other
tankers or trucks. The derailed cars were on their sides.
   Anderson said the 33-car train derailed before dawn about 45
miles east of San Francisco, apparently because of a mechanical
problem under one car.

   Nations waging the war on drugs will get a
powerful new weapon if enough countries approve a proposed U.N.
treaty for controlling the flow of illegal narcotics, a U.N.
official said Wednesday.
   The international treaty has been signed by 71 nations, including
the United States, Soviet Union and Colombia, but has been ratified
so far only by the Bahamas and China.
   ``I hope the convention will come into force by early next year,
pending its ratification by at least 20 nations,'' said Margaret J.
Anstee, director-general of the U.N. office in Vienna, where a U.N.
conference on drugs opened Monday.
   The treaty calls for extradition of accused drug traffickers and
the exchange of law enforcement information. It also lifts bank
secrecy provisions to aid authorities in tracking money laundering;
mandates that commercial carriers ensure their cargoes are free of
drugs; and requires supervision of the production and sale of
chemicals used in the manufacture of illegal drugs.
   It also has provisions that allow governments to seize assets of
drug traffickers.
   The legislatures of at least 20 nations must ratify the
convention for it to go into effect. In the United States, the
treaty is pending in the Senate.
   Ms. Anstee said the proposed U.N. Convention Against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which was
signed in Vienna in December, would provide a ``powerful weapon'' to
combat drug abuse.
   ``These countries have to readjust their laws to comply with the
convention's requirements and that takes a little time,'' she said
in an interview during the drug conference.
   The five-day conference has been dominated by developments in
Colombia, where the government is waging a nationwide crackdown on
its powerful cocaine cartels.
   Ms. Anstee said the conference would result in a resolution
supporting the Colombian government. Delegates from nearly 100
nations are attending.

   From the imprint of a kiss to ``Chill Out _
Stop the Violence,'' Americans are adding personal messages of
good-will to a 35-foot-tall greeting card for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Topped by intertwined American and Soviet flags, the card is
addressed to the Soviet leader and his people, and says in Russian:
``We the people of the United States of America wish to express our
gratitude for your contribution toward world peace. Happy New Year!''
   Displayed Tuesday at a shopping mall, the card was attached to a
roll of paper for Americans to sign and add personal notes.
   Craig Goodell, Fairfield, Iowa, an associate of Jim Lawlor, who
conceived the project, said he expects 50 of the 100-foot scrolls to
be sent to the Soviet Union along with the giant card.
   When Gorbachev gets the card he will see the hot-pink lipstick
impression left by Maggie Wright.
   With ``America'' written above her top lip, ``Russia'' below the
bottom lip and a heart around the whole greeting, the 22-year-old
Salt Lake City woman's message of peace and love was clear.
   ``That's what I'd do if I met him _ kiss him or hug him,'' Ms.
Wright said. ``I'm into what's going on there and here, and I want

   To sculptor Frederick Nicholas Trenchard, the pile
of Dole banana boxes was ``Moving the Mountain,'' a
``full-dimensional quadrature'' that proves ``scarcity does not
exist.''
   To the folks running the Arts Festival of Atlanta, it was trash.
   So even though they paid Trenchard $3,000 for his work, festival
officials had it hauled away Tuesday in a city garbage truck.
   Actually, the truck hauled away what was left of the
``quadrature.'' Festival-goers had already kicked some of the boxes
all over the Piedmont Park hill where they sat.
   It was the first time in the festival's 36-year history that a
commissioned site sculpture was removed.
   ``We encourage risk-taking, and sometimes a sculpture will
fail,'' said Pat Gann, the festival's executive director. ``This is
worse.''
   Ms. Gann said the New Orleans artist had proposed an 11,000-pound
mound of rice, which was to be used to feed the hungry after the
festival ends Sunday. Instead, he erected a stack of cardboard boxes
filled with grass clippings and a few dozen bags of rice.
   ``It's their festival,'' the artist said. ``I'm not going to
argue with them.''

   He commissioned what he claims is the state's longest hot dog.
   Brackle won't disclose the exact length of the link _ that's the
subject of a guessing contest among his customers.
   All he'll say is it's longer than the 450-foot frank he ordered
as a publicity stunt in 1984.
   The whopping weiner will be measured Sept. 29, and whoever
guessed closest to the right length will get a $50 gift certificate.
Then the frank will be cut into normal lengths and sold.
   The sausage is a long way from making the record books. The
Guinness Book of World Records says the top dog is a 9.87-mile long
sausage produced in London in 1987.

Mines and Minerals Willard Stanley. She said the accident occurred
between 9:30 and 9:45 a.m. CDT.
   Ms. Toombs said mine rescue teams were working inside the mine.
But she said: ``There's nothing to indicate the walls have collapsed
or we have anyone trapped underground.''
   The mine is about 140 miles southwest of Louisville.
   Pat Donahue, administrator at Union County Hospital in
Morganfield, said one miner had been hospitalized there and more
were expected.

   David Dinkins said today his strong showing among
white voters in a Democratic primary that ended the 12-year era of
brash and combative Ed Koch positions him well to become New York
City's first black mayor.
   The Manhattan borough president will face former federal
prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, who thrashed cosmetics heir Ronald
Lauder in the Republican primary Tuesday.
   ``You, the people of New York, made history today, and I promise
you I shall never let you down,'' Dinkins, the first black to win a
major party nomination in New York City, told cheering supporters.
   Dinkins received 537,313 votes, or 51 percent, to 445,816, or 42
percent, for Koch, in the four-candidate race in this Democratic
stronghold. The victor took more than 90 percent of the black vote,
half the Hispanic vote and about 30 percent of the white vote. By
comparison, the Rev. Jesse Jackson won 17 percent of the white vote
in the 1988 Democratic presidential primary.
   ``I can indeed reach beyond my base,'' Dinkins said this morning
on the CBS program ``This Morning.'' ``Victory with just
African-American and Latinos, that would not be a good thing for the
city.''
   ``He won it fairly, squarely, and by a large margin,'' Koch told
supporters. ``I am ready to serve, to help him become the next
mayor.''
   Giuliani, seeking to become the first Republican elected mayor
since 1965, got 75,720 votes, or 67 percent, to 36,905, or 33
percent, for Lauder, whose record $12 million in campaign spending
went mostly for negative television commercials.
   ``I want to bring new life into New York City _ new blood, new
heart, new people, and make this again the magical city that it once
was,'' said Giuliani, who also will be on the Liberal Party and
Independent Fusion lines.
   Lauder, a former ambassador to Austria, will remain on the Nov. 7
ballot as the Conservative Party's nominee.
   The other Democratic candidates trailed far behind Dinkins and
Koch. Former transit chief Richard Ravitch had 48,289 votes, or 5
percent, and Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin had 28,790, or 3 percent.
   At a City Hall rally today before 3,000 people, Koch called for
Democratic unity against Giuliani.
   ``A new campaign has begun and now is the time for supporters of
David Dinkins, Ed Koch, Dick Ravitch and Jay Goldin to join hands
and join forces in a unified campaign to ensure victory for David
Dinkins this fall,'' Koch said.
   Dinkins asked the crowd, ``Have we scraped and struggled to
survive nine years of reactionary Republican government in
Washington just to hand over our city to the very same forces?''
   ``No!'' the crowd shouted back.
   Koch, the loudmouthed symbol of New York to much of America,
first won election as a long shot in 1977 while the city was in the
throes of a fiscal crisis. He was re-elected twice by huge margins.
   But the city's mood shifted away from his brash style as AIDS,
drugs, homelessness, crime and other urban ills seemed to demand a
milder touch. The calm, deliberative Dinkins projected that image.
   The campaign drama heightened in the last weeks after a black
youth was slain in an attack by a white gang, heating up simmering
racial tensions.
   Dinkins said the killing was an example of the hatred Koch had
not addressed. Koch was criticized for suggesting that marchers
protesting the killings were making things worse.
   Koch, forcing a smile Tuesday night, said ``I've had 12 glorious
years as mayor,'' Koch said.
   But he reminded the crowd, ``You'll have me from now to December
31st. I do not intend to keep my mouth shut.''
   Dinkins quieted his supporters when they booed at the mention of
Koch.
   ``Oh no, oh no _ we're all together now,'' said Dinkins, joined
at the podium by Jesse Jackson. ``Remember me? I'm the guy that
brings people together.
   ``With your help I intend to be a mayor who leads a new era of
change, a mayor who sets and pursues a new standard of integrity,''
Dinkins said. ``I intend to be a mayor who restores a new rule of
law in our streets, in our schools and in our subways.''
   Giuliani gained fame as U.S. attorney by prosecuting Wall Street
cheats, corrupt politicians and mobsters.
   His multiparty candidacy is reminiscent of the city's last
Republican mayor, John Lindsay, but Giuliani preferred to compare
himself to the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia, mayor from 1934 to 1945.
   ``He united all New Yorkers,'' Giuliani said. ``LaGuardia was a
Republican like I am, a Republican who reaches out for the support
of others, of Democrats and Liberals, of Conservatives and
Independents.''

<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 peaceful
protesters sang songs of freedom and waved banners denouncing police
brutality on Wednesday in the biggest anti-government march ever
permitted in this country.
   Police stayed out of sight as marchers _ led by black leaders and
Cape Town's white mayor _ clogged a mile-long route leading from St.
George's Anglican Cathedral to City Hall.
   Organizers described the march as a historic occurrence in this
racially divided nation.
   ``We have scored a great victory for justice and peace,''
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told a crowd of 1,800 black, white
and mixed-race marchers who packed City Hall while thousands of
others stood outside.
   He said acting President F.W. de Klerk should have been present
``to see what this country is going to become ... a technicolor
country.''
   The absence of police contrasted sharply with protest marches two
weeks ago in Cape Town that were broken up by riot squads using
whips, batons and a water cannon that sprayed purple water.
   ``It is important to know we could have this peaceful march
toward our freedom,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general
of the South African Council of Churches. ``Once that has started
today, no one can ever stop it again.''
   Protest demonstrations normally are illegal in South Africa, and
the Cape Town police commander, Maj. Gen. Phillipus Fourie, said
last week he would stop Wednesday's march. But de Klerk announced
Tuesday evening that the protest could proceed because he had been
assured it would be peaceful.
   The far-right Conservative Party, the largest white opposition
group in Parliament, said Wednesday that approval of the march was
``capitulation'' to radicals.
   An anti-apartheid lawyer, Dullah Omar, praised the marchers for
maintaining discipline.
   ``What you have done is to prove that, when the police are not
here, when the batons and the (whips) and the tear gas is not
around, then there is no violence,'' he said.
   After singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' jubilant marchers set off
from St. George's behind Tutu, Mayor Gordon Oliver and the Rev.
Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Youths chanted freedom songs and waved banners that said, ``Peace
In Our City'' and ``Stop Killing Our Pople.''
   At City Hall, those unable to fit inside stood in a parking lot,
waiting for speakers to emerge.
   Tutu and other activists have denounced the use of force against
peaceful protesters during a 6-week-old campaign to defy apartheid
laws that deny the black majority a voice in national affairs. They
have said police were responsible for the deaths of at least 23
people in Cape Town's black and mixed-race townships during protests
of the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which excluded blacks.
   Police defended their actions as necessary to prevent
intimidation of voters. They said 15 people died, most in clashes
not involving policemen.
   Oliver and Tutu received standing ovations inside City Hall, and
youths lauded the mayor in a chant usually used to honor leaders of
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   ``Today, we all have the freedom of the city,'' Oliver said.
   At the close of the rally, Tutu asked the crowd to stand, link
hands and chant, ``We are unstoppable.''
   As the marchers assembled, a new session of Parliament began at
the parliamentary complex near St. George's. The electoral college
controlled by the National Party is expected to elect de Klerk to a
five-year term Thursday.
   Since the election, in which his National Party lost a quarter of
its parliamentary seats, de Klerk has indicated he is prepared to
allow forms of peaceful protest that have been prohibited in the
past.
   He said Tuesday he wants to persuade black leaders to join in
negotiating a new constitution in which blacks would gain political
rights.
   De Klerk expressed sympathy for the families of people killed on
election night but said police had to act because militants were
violently preventing people from voting. He said action would be
taken against policemen found to have used excessive force.
   The government announced Tuesday that Maj. Gen. Jaap Joubert, a
senior police investigator, had been appointed to lead a probe into
the allegations of police violence.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The pilot of an American Airlines jetliner
reported hydraulic-system trouble before the plane skidded off a
runway at O'Hare Airport, but airline officials said today they
don't know if the problem was anything more than a faulty warning
light.
   Two of 113 people aboard Tuesday afternoon suffered minor
injuries while evacuating down emergency chutes, American spokesman
Thomas Stack said.
   Ambulances and firefighting equipment were standing by near the
runway during the landing.
   The plane from Rochester, N.Y., landed normally but then, for
reasons that were not immediately clear, skidded off the runway,
American spokesman Al Becker said today. He said the nose gear
collapsed as the plane left the pavement. There was no fire.
   Before landing, the pilot had ``radioed about a problem. ... He
mentioned hydraulic problems,'' Becker said.
   ``It may have just been a warning light,'' he said. ``We've
really got to investigate today to know.''
   Passenger Andre Ruzycki said passengers applauded the pilot after
the plane came to rest.
   ``It was no worse than any roller-coaster ride, really,'' said
Ruzycki. ``No one was really aware of anything until we touched
down. ... We weren't told anything until we were being evacuated and
told to get off the plane quickly.''
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein said the
FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board would inspect the
plane.
   The plane was a two-engine MD-80, which is essentially a DC-9
redesigned for noise reduction, Edelstein said. Becker didn't know
how old the aircraft is but said the MD-80s are no more than five
years old.
   Edelstein said the plane had been scheduled to fly on to Salt
Lake City after a stop in Chicago.
   ``The pilot reported hydraulic system problems as he was coming
in on approach,'' Edelstein said. ``He was asked if he wanted
emergency vehicles on standby, and he said yes.''
   The crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, on July
19 focused attention on hydraulic system problems. The pilot of that
plane was unable to use the landing gear, and the plane cartwheeled
on landing and burst into flames, killing 112 of 296 people aboard.

<TEXT>
   Colt Firearms Division said a ruling that
it rehire 800 strikers with back pay could cost the gunmaker less
than $16 million, not the $40 million estimated by the union.
   An administrative law judge, Martin Roth, said in a ruling
released Monday that Colt had engaged in dozens of unfair labor
practices during the 3{-year-old strike, and he ordered the workers'
reinstatement.
   The United Auto Workers and Colt said Tuesday it was too early to
say whether they would appeal the ruling to the National Labor
Relations Board.
   Colt Industries spokesman Michael Dunn on Tuesday estimated the
company's total liability at less than $6 million. He declined to
say how the company arrived at the figure.
   Robert Madore, a regional official with the UAW, stuck by his
estimate that the back wages totaled $40 million, or an average of
$50,000 per worker.
   ``I don't know how they come up with their figure,'' Madore said.
``I think they're going to have to sharpen their pencil.''
   Madore speculated that the discrepancy stemmed from a company
offer at some point during the strike to let 50 strikers return to
work. Roth's ruling said the company must pay back wages to strikers
``to the date of a valid offer of reinstatement.''
   ``If they have 50 job openings and they offer 50 jobs to 800
workers, does that stop the back pay? It can't realistically,''
Madore said.

<HEAD>Senators Clash Over Proposed Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tobacco state lawmakers vowed Wednesday to
grind the Senate to a procedural crawl unless attempts to ban
smoking on all airline flights are dropped, but their unbowed
opponents said they welcomed a showdown.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, planned a vote
for Thursday on whether to block a filibuster by cigarette industry
supporters. The filibuster _ unlimited debate in hopes of preventing
a vote _ is aimed at killing legislation by Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., expanding current airline smoking restrictions to all
domestic flights.
   The maneuvering came as outgoing Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
told a congressional hearing that minors should be forbidden from
buying cigarettes from vending machines.
   Koop, who leaves his job this month, said federal legislation was
needed because 43 states have laws banning tobacco sales to minors
but don't enforce them.
   In the Senate fight over airline smoking, tobacco state senators
said they would accept a permanent version of the current smoking
ban on two-hour airline flights. But Mitchell scheduled the vote
after ban opponents said they would try to block the Senate's work
unless advocates of tougher restrictions dropped their efforts.
   Lautenberg said he would press his legislation, saying, ``We
won't succumb to threats.''
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said tobacco senators would accept
language the permanent ban on two-hour flights, which the House
passed Aug. 3. The restriction effects four-fifths of all flights.
   But he said unless smoking opponents accepted his offer, he would
slow consideration of the $11.9 billion transportation spending bill
for next year that contains the cigarette restrictions.
   ``This one will take basically a week to get through,'' he said
of the transportation measure, one of 13 spending bills
congressional leaders want to complete by the Oct. 1 start of fiscal
1990.
   ``There's more at stake here I think than just the question of
smoking on airliners,'' he said. ``It's a question of the budget so
the rest of the world can work.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said any delays would be Lautenberg's
fault for inserting the restrictions into the bill in the first
place.
   ``He may end up rolling us, but he will know that he has been in
a fight,'' he said.
   Helms said his state _ the nation's leading tobacco producer _
has 30,000 tobacco growers ``to whom I have made a commitment that
I'd protect their interests as long as I'm in the United States
Senate, and I'm going to do that.''
   Lautenberg asked his opponents to drop their efforts.
   ``If they have a case to make they ought to make it and let us
vote on it,'' he said. ``But that is not likely to happen. We'll
endure.''
   Airline employees and health groups have pressed for a total
smoking ban on aircraft, claiming that cigarette fumes can cause
cancer and other diseases for everyone aboard a flight.
   Tobacco interests say there's been no proof that the smoke
endangers non-smokers and argue that there are plenty of other
chemicals soiling recirculated aircraft cabin air.
   Across Capitol Hill, Koop told the House Energy and Commerce
transportation subcommittee that giving youngsters easy access to
cigarettes was comparable to letting them purchase alcohol simply
because they had the money in their pockets.
   ``There is no logical reason why we should have a double standard
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol, the two major legal
addicting drugs used in our society,'' he told a congressional
hearing.
   The Tobacco Institute, the cigarette industry's trade group, has
said 80 percent of cigarette machines are located where teen-agers
do not congregate.
   But Koop said that still leaves enough machines to justify
federal action.
   ``Even 20 percent of the 374,000 vending machines in the United
States represents a huge number of sites from which teen-agers can
readily obtain cigarettes illegally,'' Koop said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Eliminates Military Construction Money in Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee on Wednesday approved a
$7.7 billion spending bill that would eliminate President Bush's
request for military construction in the Philippines and make a
drastic cut in funds for South Korea.
   By voice vote, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military
construction approved a spending bill that is $1.3 billion below the
funding level for fiscal 1989 and about $300 million less than
Bush's request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``This is an 18 percent reduction in real terms from last year's
military construction budget,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
chairman of the subcommittee. ``This is appropriate considering the
budget deficit.''
   Specifically, the bill eliminates the $40.8 million Bush
requested for such construction items in the Philippines as
dormitories at Clark Air Base, storage facilities and maintenance
shops.
   The House, in its bill, approved $6.1 million for military
construction in the Philippines.
   The Senate subcommittee, adhering to earlier action in the Senate
authorization bill, also eliminated the $35.4 million for family
housing in the Philippines.
   Bush's request of $86.3 million for military construction in
South Korea was cut by $85.5 million, largely affecting the
facilities at the Osan Air Base. The Senate authorization bill
approved $66.9 million for construction in South Korea while the
House adopted legislation earmarking $74.2 million for Korean
construction.
   ``It's a question of how long military forces will be in Korea,''
Sasser said. ``In the Philippines, there will be a renegotiation of
base rights.''
   Under the Philippines constitution, the country must negotiate a
new agreement with the United States on the location of Clark Air
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base and the continued presence of U.S.
forces.
   While cutting money for overseas projects, the subcommittee added
$250 million to the bill for National Guard and reserves in the
United States. Bush had requested $452.6 million.
   The subcommitte also cut $50 million from the president's request
of $101.5 million for housing the B-2 stealth bomber at the Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri. The reduction mirrors the action taken
in the authorization bill and reflects the delay in the program.
   The full Appropriations committee is expected to vote on the
subcommittee bill on Thursday. Once passed by the full Senate,
members of the House and Senate will meet in conference to hammer
out a final version.

<HEAD>Dukakis Announces Plan To Combat Mortgage Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to fight discrimination in mortgage lending,
including expanded enforcement and new legislation to give
regulators more powers, was announced Wednesday by Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis.
   ``The steps I'm announcing today will help guarantee that credit
in the Commonwealth is color blind,'' he said.
   The plan follows a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
documenting that race has been a factor in home mortgage lending in
Boston. The report said lenders were ``functioning in a way that
hurts black neighborhoods.''
   ``The Federal Reserve Bank study should be the concern of every
fair-minded citizen of Massachusetts,'' Dukakis said.
   The program's first steps will provide tougher evaluations of
state-chartered banks in Boston and other urban areas on their
compliance with the federal Community Reinvestment Act. It also will
link Community Reinvestment Act performance to all bank applications
requiring the state Banking Division's approval.
   Next week, Dukakis said, he will ask the Legislature to approve
several proposals to strengthen the power of state regulators to
assure there is no discrimination in mortgage lending.
   The governor's proposals would require mandatory participation in
a mortgage review board process by all lenders in the state and
expand the size and diversity of the four regional boards by
including a member of the public. The program now is limited to
lenders that voluntarily agree to participate.
   The boards have the authority to review mortgages to make sure
there is no geographic discrimination in lending practices.
   The legislative package would also place mortgage companies,
mortgage brokers and all parties making five or more mortgage loans
a year under the specific licensing and examination powers of the
division of banks.
   Mortgage companies, a fast-growing segment of the financial
services industries, now are not regulated by the state. Consumer
Affairs Secretary Mary Ann Walsh has made their regulation a
priority issue on her legislative agenda.
   The Dukakis legislative package also would make community
reinvestment evaluations public records. Now the law requires them
to be kept confidential.
   In addition, Dukakis said, an interstate banking bill already
pending in the Legislature would require out-of-state banks buying
in-state banks to make available assets to support affordable
housing programs.
   Massachusetts now has a reciprocal agreement with other New
England states on interstate banking, but does not allow other
out-of-state banks to enter the state.
   State Banking Commissioner Andrew J. Calamare said the measures
announced Wednesday would enhance the ability of his division to
assure the credit needs of low and moderate income people are met.
   He said the division in the past 2{ years already has cited 14
Boston state-chartered banks for inadequate performance.
   According to the Banking Division, there are 42 state-chartered
banks in the Boston area, and a total of 294 in the state.

   More people than ever are living in the small
towns, distant suburbs and farms that make up rural America, the
government reported Wednesday.
   About 64.8 million people, or 25 percent of the U.S. population,
lived in rural areas in 1988, an increase of more than 900,000 from
1987. The total included approximately 4.95 million living on farms,
or 2 percent of the population, a decrease of 35,000 from the
previous year.
   The report was prepared by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments using estimates from the Census Bureau's monthly current
population survey.
   Since 1986, when a new system of counting noses in the
countryside began, the rural population has grown more rapidly than
the urban population, averaging 2.64 percent, compared with 1.67
percent.
   ``The 1988 farm population estimate of 4,951,000 is not
significantly different from the 1987 estimate, which may reflect a
leveling off in the long-term decline in the number of farm
residents,'' the report said.
   One of the report's authors, Judith Kalbacher of the USDA's
Economic Research Service, said the rural figures overall have shown
significant changes but cautioned that the growth pattern since 1986
may be illusory.
   ``When the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census, some
of these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``Some of the growing areas are going
to be taken out of rural groups, and that will make it look like
there was less rural growth'' than is now being reported.
   As used in the report, rural areas include open countryside and
place of fewer than 2,500 people that are not in the suburbs of
large cities. Large cities and their suburbs, plus places of 2,500
or more, are considered urban.
   The farm population consists of people living on farms in rural
areas, but does not include the relatively few who live on farms in
urban areas, the report said. A farm is defined as a place that sold
agricultural products worth $1,000 or more in the previous year.
   Kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers to
commute greater distances have been important factors in the rural
growth. Families moving to distant suburbs, for example, have helped
boost the annual counts for rural areas.
   ``It probably means that a lot of the rural growth that we're
seeing in the mid-decade (of the 1980s) is mostly fringe development
around urbanized areas, she said.
   The report said that the largest share of the rural population,
44 percent, is in the South, ``which has been the case since the
first census was taken in 1790.'' Little change in the regional
distribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years.
   The farm population, however, has shown ``marked change'' over
the same period. In 1950, for example, the South accounted for 51.6
percent of farm people, but only 29.6 percent in 1988. The Midwest,
meanwhile, accounted for 50.6 percent last year, compared with 32.3
percent in 1950.
   Other observations in the report included:
   _Farm residents are older, with a median age of 38 years in 1988,

<HEAD>Sharon Advocates ``Removing'' Arafat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Minister of Industry and Trade, Ariel
Sharon, said Wednesday that Israel should ``remove'' PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, just as he said the United States tried to kill
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Sharon, who unsuccessfully sought his Likud bloc's nomination for
prime minister in the past, also said he would like to lead Israel
to a peace agreement with its neighbors but rejected ceding any
captured Arab lands.
   The retired general, in the United States to promote his new book
``The Warrior,'' told reporters at a breakfast meeting that ``there
are certain people whose activities cannot be tolerated by free,
democratic societies. Therefore, they should be removed.''
   President Reagan tried to kill Gadhafi in an air raid in April
1986 because the Libyan strongman had ordered a bomb placed in a
West German discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen, Sharon said.
   ``Arafat is in the same category,'' he added.
   The United States never publicly identified Gadhafi as the target
of its raid but U.S. officials indicated they hoped to shock some of
his supporters into breaking with him. Gadhafi said the aerial
bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi killed his infant adopted daughter.
   Sharon predicted the number of Jewish settlers in the occupied
West Bank would reach 100,000 next year, and said Israel should
grant autonomy to the estimated 1.5 million Palestinians living
there but retain control of the region's defense.
   He rejected the PLO's demand that Israel allow the creation of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank, reiterating his view that there
is already a Palestinian state _ in Jordan, whose population is
predominantly Palestinian.
   He praised King Hussein for his courage and survival in the face
of domestic and foreign enemies, but urged the Jordanian monarch to
reverse his recent decision to allow groups associated with Arafat's
Fatah wing of the PLO to operate in Amman. ``For his own safety he
should expel them,'' Sharon said.
   Sharon, whose recent invitation to visit the Soviet Republic of
Georgia was withdrawn by Soviet authorities, said he hoped to be
able to visit there one day.
   His parents were born in Russia and he still has an aunt in the
city of Tashkent, he said.

   A crowded bus rammed into a truck
and caught fire Wednesday after the bus driver fell asleep at the
wheel, killing 30 people and injuring 14, a police spokeswoman said.
   Eunice Castro, a police official in the city of Belo Horizonte,
told The Associated Press the bus hit the back of the truck, went
into a ditch and burst into flames.
   ``It's a miracle anyone survived,'' she said in a telephone
interview. She said the bus was carrying 48 passengers from the
northeastern city of Bom Jesus da Lapa to Sao Paulo when the
accident occurred near Itatiaiucu, about 250 miles northwest of Rio.
   She said some of the injured were in serious condition.
   The truck's driver, Jose Batista da Silva, said in a television
interview that the bus was traveling about 62 mph. The speed limit
in Brazil is 50 mph.
   Ms. Castro said survivors reported that the bus driver fell
asleep at the wheel seconds before the accident.

<HEAD>Tests Catch Drinking Crew Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 16 tanker crew members have
been stopped from boarding their vessels at the oil shipment
terminal in Valdez since June because they had been drinking,
authorities said Wednesday.
   The alcohol screening program was set up in response to the
grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which hit a reef hours after
it left the terminal, said George Jurkowich, a spokesman for Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co.
   The Exxon Valdez dumped almost 11 million gallons of thick North
Slope crude oil in Prince William Sound on March 24 in the nation's
worst oil spill.
   The captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was tested hours after the
accident and alcohol was found in his system.
   Crew members who go ashore while their tankers are in port pass
through security at the Alyeska terminal before reboarding. They are
given breath tests if it appears to security guards they have been
drinking, Jurkowich said.
   All ships' masters are tested before their vessels leave the
terminal complex, Jurkowich said.
   Between the time the screening system was set up June 1 and
Friday, 1,087 crew members have passed through the terminal, 56 have
been tested and 16 have been foud to have unacceptable levels of
alcohol, Jurkowich said. They were prevented from boarding their
ships.
   ``We think it is a success because we are detecting a small
percentage of people who are under the influence,'' he said. ``If a
crewman leaves his vessel _ leaves the terminal _ when they come
back to the terminal they are required to pass through Alyeska's
security office.''
   Jurkowich said the blood-alcohol level of crew members must be
below .04 percent. That is the Coast Guard's highest allowable level
for operation of a commercial vessel.
   The state of Alaska and many other states consider motorists
drunk if they have a blood-alcohol level of .10.
   If a crew member fails, he must wait an hour and be retested.
   It's up to the ship's owner or agent to determine what happens to
a crew member who isn't allowed aboard the tanker.
   In a related matter, a check of maritime pilots in Portland,
Ore., found six of 57 had their driver's licenses suspended at some
time for drunken driving, a television station reported.
   KATU-TV reported Tuesday the suspensions are listed in Oregon
Department of Motor Vehicles records on the pilots, who board ships
to guide them through the treacherous entrance to the Columbia River.
   Geoff Stone, President fo the Columbia Bar Pilots Association,
responded that there has never been evidence that drinking posed a
safety problem with the pilots. Driving records don't necessarily
have a bearing on a pilot's behavior on the job, he told the station.
   The maritime pilots are licensed and must pass a drug screening
test, he said.
   There are 64 pilots for the port. Seven are residents of
Washington state, where driving records are kept private.

<HEAD>Aid Workers Flee as Cambodia Fighting Intensifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NATE THAYER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   SITE 2, Thailand (AP) _ Western relief workers fled a refugee
camp on the Thai-Cambodian border Wednesday as fighting intensified
between Cambodian factions less than two weeks before Vietnam's
pledged troop pullout from Cambodia.
   Officials from Cambodia's Khmer People's National Liberation
Front blamed the latest clashes on the failure of last month's
Cambodian peace talks in Paris.
   Thai military sources and relief workers said more than 20
mortars fired by troops of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government hit guerrilla positions near the Thai village of Ban
Sangae, a mile from Site 2 refugee camp. No casualties were reported.
   A Western relief official also reported heavy fighting near Nong
Chan, 13 miles north of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.
   ``United Nations and international relief workers were forced to
evacuate Site 2 because of nearby fighting,'' a senior U.N. official
said.
   More than 100 workers from international relief agencies work at
the camp of 140,000 Cambodians. It is the largest on the frontier
and is administered by the Khmer Front and supplied by the United
Nations.
   Another Western official said access to the camp Thursday would
be restricted to essential medical staff.
   On Tuesday, he said, one mortar landed inside the camp but did
not explode.
   Abdul Gaffar, a senior Khmer Front official, said the fighting
has intensified because talks aimed at ending Cambodia's 20-year-old
conflict failed.
   His organization is one of three guerrilla factions opposing the
Phnom Penh government. A Khmer Front official at Site 2 said the
front received 27 truckloads of Chinese weapons and ammunition in
the past week.
   The Paris talks ended without a political settlement largely
because of Phnom Penh's refusal to include the radical communist
Khmer Rouge in a future coalition government.
   The Khmer Rouge, the most powerful opposition faction, killed
hundreds of thousands of civilians in an attempt to build an
agrarian society between 1975 and 1978.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge and
installed a government. It has pledged to withdraw its troops from
Cambodia by the end of September.
   Gen. Manat Thinkulabute, the Thai military officer responsible
for Trat and Chantaburi provinces where several Khmer Rouge
strongholds are located, said he expects fiercer fighting along the
border in the next two to three months.
   The guerrillas responded coolly this week to efforts by
Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan to negotiate a
cease-fire, according to The Nation newspaper of Bangkok.
   Chatichai met guerrilla leaders Monday and Tuesday and is to meet
Cambodia's premier, Hun Sen, in Bangkok at an unspecified date.
   The Nation quoted Kraisak Choonhavan, Chatichai's son and one of
his advisers, as saying the prime minister would continue efforts to
break the deadlock.

   A television station inadvertently aired
several seconds of the final strobe-lit rape scene from the movie
``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' during a morning children's program.
   The scene was broadcast Tuesday on KABB-TV in the middle of
``Real Ghostbusters,'' a program that airs from 7 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.
   Apparently one of KABB's producers was editing the rape scene
last week to air at night while the station was receiving a
satellite feed of the cartoon. A station technician hit the wrong
switch and the scene was edited onto the station's videotape of
``Real Ghostbusters,'' said Sam Bickel, KABB program director.
   ``We try to do a good thing and we wind up doing a bad thing,''
Bickel said. ``It was real quick. But it was a mistake.''
   The station received 15 viewer complaints after the scene was
aired.

<HEAD>Panel, Beginning Work on Bush Bill, Promises Major Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House panel said Wednesday they'll
try to amend every major provision of President Bush's clean air
bill, but all agreed it's time to break a 10-year stalemate and pass
the pollution-cutting measure.
   The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee was the
first panel to consider the Bush legislation, although the initial
session was reserved for opening remarks. Amendments that would
begin to shape a political compromise will be offered beginning
Tuesday, Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said.
   ``This bill is a delicate mosaic,'' said chief Republican sponsor
Norman F. Lent of New York, who said he feared that the Energy and
Commerce Committee might fashion a compromise that could unravel on
the House floor.
   The president's bill seeks to significantly reduce the three
major air pollution causes: ozone, which causes urban smog; acid
rain, and airborne toxic chemicals.
   The opening statements made clear that major battles will be
fought, beginning with the expected three-week subcommittee
consideration, over reducing auto emissions, which also produce
smog. Another fight: Do electric customers of dirty-burning power
plants get the entire bill for achieving acid rain reductions.
   Other amendments will seek to ban tall industrial smokestacks
that merely carry pollution elsewhere; to increase protection for
national parks; to establish strict standards to protect health near
toxic chemical plants, and to ensure that no one fuel is favored in
a program for alternative motor fuels.
   Lent was upbeat about chances for passage of the bill this
Congress, commenting, ``Republicans will be far more willing to
support a Bush bill than they would have been to support a bill by
the Democrats.''
   GOP lawmakers had no such alternative the last eight years,
because former President Reagan did not propose a clean air bill
during his eight years in office. The last major clean air revisions
were approved in 1977.
   Waxman repeated his determination to toughen Bush's language on
auto emissions. He aims to tighten tailpipe emission requirements,
to strip a provision to average pollution emissions by engine
category and to require that on-board anti-pollution equipment be
guaranteed for 100,000 miles, twice as long as in current law.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., the chairman of the full Energy
and Commerce Committee, is expected to oppose Waxman's changes and
argue the auto industry's position. The automakers contend that
introduction of new cars each year, with their sophisticated
anti-pollution devices, would bring a drastic cut auto pollution as
older models are replaced.
   Dingell and Waxman have fought each other to a stalemate in the
past on this issue.
   Lawmakers from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri are demanding
that other regions help them pay for acid rain reductions. These
states argue that, otherwise, their electric utility customers would
finance a disproportionate share of measures to cut emissions of
sulfur dioxide, the major component of acid rain.
   Bush seeks to cut sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons by the year
2000, based on 1980 levels. His bill places the entire burden on
utilities with power plants that burn dirty, high-sulfur coal _
which are prevalent in the nine states.

<HEAD>Outgoing New York Mayor: `There is No Better Job'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old candidate didn't bellow ``How'm I
doin'?'' He didn't mug for the cameras. He didn't joke, he didn't
kvetch.
   Graciously, patiently _ quietly _ Edward I. Koch stood Wednesday
morning at the ``lucky'' subway station entrance where he has shaken
hands and thanked voters after elections for two decades.
   But thanks must come hard when you've been mayor of New York City
for 12 years and suddenly you hear a young woman say, ``You were a
great mayor.''
   Koch lost the Democratic primary election Tuesday night to
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins by a 51 percent-42 percent
margin. Dinkins will face the Republican nominee, former U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, in the Nov. 7 general election.
   For 20 minutes Koch repeated ``thank you,'' ``thanks very much,''
``I just came by to say thank you,'' the sidewalk political litany
he has mastered in the course of 24 campaigns.
   He got the same in return: ``Good luck,'' ``Good try,'' and, from
one student of current events, ``Congratulations!''
   ``I hope you get a better job,'' a young man told Koch.
   ``There is no better job,'' the mayor replied. And later in the
morning he told a crowd at a Democratic unity rally that he would
never again run for office.
   At one point during his administration Koch was telling people he
planned to be mayor forever, and no one was really certain if he was
joking. Just six months ago, speaking in the same ballroom where he
conceded defeat in the Democratic primary on Tuesday night, he
admitted that being mayor was not just a job: ``It's my life.''
   That, apparently, was one reason the 64-year-old Koch tried to
become the city's first four-term mayor, despite corruption
scandals, a minor stroke two years ago and poor relations with the
city's black community.
   After his defeat he assured supporters there was indeed ``life
after the mayoralty,'' but many wondered what kind. The office had
transformed Ed Koch from a relatively obscure U.S. representative to
one of the world's most famous politicians and given him an almost
matchless pulpit.
   In the end, Koch seems to have failed to persuade voters, black
and white alike, that he could be a force for reconciliation among
the city's various racial, ethnic and religious groups.
   Seven of 10 black voters said they were convinced he favored
whites over blacks in office, according to a New York Times-WCBS-TV
exit poll, and in the end blacks constituted a tiny 2 percent of
Koch's vote.
   More generally, the poll found that more than half the voters,
including nine of 10 blacks and four of 10 whites, simply
disapproved of the way the mayor had handled his job.
   And there was another factor. ``I think after 12 years people
were tired of Ed Koch,'' said Jerry Skurnik, a Koch campaign
official. Tired, it seemed, not only of Koch's tendency to talk
before thinking, of his periodic arrogance and stridency, but also
of the spread of AIDS, homelessness, drug abuse and crime.
   A New York Daily News-WABC-TV exit poll found that only 24
percent of Democratic voters thought Koch was ``fair to all
groups;'' only 15 percent said he had ``good new ideas;'' only 7
percent agreed he was ``sensitive to people's needs.''
   The candidate was reminded of this ill will as he stood outside
the subway station at Lexington Avenue and East 77th Street.
   ``The chickens are coming home to roost, Koch!'' yelled a
middle-aged woman as she passed by the crowd of reporters and
photographers surrounding Koch. ``Now stop blocking the subway,''
she added.
   After Koch was finished shaking hands he was asked why he had
referred to the office he loved as a burden. ``It's not easy to be
mayor,'' he explained. ``It's a tough job. ... But you give it your
best, and you come away with a sense of pride and pleasure.''
   Then the man who took the bus to his first mayoral inauguration
climbed into the back seat of his official Cadillac and rode off
toward City Hall. It was the 4,238th day of his mayoralty, with 109
more to go.

<HEAD>President Lectured by 13-Year-Old on Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who advocates the death penalty
for some drug crimes, received a surprise lecture during an
anti-drug program Wednesday from a 13-year-old who called the
punishment murder.
   ``To me, killing someone that has committed a very serious crime
is wrong,'' Chantee Charles, a seventh grader from nearby Arlington,
Va., told a Rose Garden ceremony. ``It does not solve anything. All
it does is take someone else's life.''
   Taking it all in stride, Bush complimented Chantee and two other
students invited to speak for doing a good job expressing ``what's
on your heart'' without worrying ``if people agree with you or not.''
   Bush, who has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins and
for those who kill law enforcement officers, was presiding over a
ceremony honoring the Los Angeles-based DARE (Drug Abuse Resistence
Education).
   At the ceremony, part of Bush's continuing efforts to promote his
new anti-drug strategy, three Washington area students who are
members of the DARE program were invited to read essays.
   While the other two stuck to drug themes, Chantee used most of
her allotted time to attack the death penalty.
   Saying ``probably thousands'' of innocent prisoners have been
executed, she argued that death penalty proponents ``miss the point
that the prisoner has a family too.''
   ``The guard that turns on the switch to electrocute the prisoner
is just as much a murderer as the person who has committed the
crime,'' she said.
   ``The guy who kills the prisoner must feel guilty afterwards. But
I guess they get paid for it,'' she said. ``If I had one wish, I'd
wish that the death penalty never existed.''
   ``DARE has taught me to to make my own decisions and not let
friends make them for me,'' she added.
   Chantee, a student at Arlington's Thomas Jefferson Intermediate
School, later told reporters she was unaware of Bush's strong
support for the death penalty for certain crimes.
   She indicated she had not intended to be provocative, but ``I
don't like the idea of people getting killed. It was just a topic I
wanted to write about.''
   Maria Sheehan, a White House aide who helped coordinate the
program, said that the three students were picked to speak by local
leaders of the DARE program. ``We let them say what they wanted,''
she said.
   The two other students read somewhat less controversial essays.
   Janine Waters, 12, also of Thomas Jefferson Intermediate, said,
``If people offer you drugs, just turn away and say no. Or change
the subject.''
   And Borris Torrico, 13, of Williamsburg Intermediate School, also
in Arlington, said, ``When you're older and you want to get a new
car, like a Porsche, you can save up for it and not use it on drugs
or on alcohol.''
   ``My turn,'' Bush joked after the three students had made their
presentations.
   He told the student speakers: ``It's not eay to get up in front
of a big, scary audience like this and do such a good job _ say
what's on your heart, not worry if people agree with you or not.''
   Bush praised the DARE program as an organization that has
``manned the front lines'' in the drug war. Signing a proclamation
making Thursday National DARE day, Bush said, ``These kids have
dared to excel, and they are succeeding,'' he said.
   The ceremony came as the White House and Congress continued to
wrangle over how to fund the president's $7.9 billion drug program,
although there were hints that a compromise might be near.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who the day before
had denounced Democrats for playing ``price tag politics,'' said the
administration would ``reluctantly support'' a proposal by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.
   Hollings' proposal calls for partially financing drug programs
with a 0.225 percent across-the-board cut in other governent
programs. Fitzwater said the administration preferred it to a
proposal by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., calling for $4.4 billion
in new drug spending _ twice the administration plan.
   In related developments:
   _Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, here for the Rose Garden
DARE ceremony, suggested the financing battle between the White
House and Congress was counterproductive and told reporters, ``I'm
not going to get in the middle of the one-upsmanship that's going
on.''
   _Former Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson met with
presidential Chief of Staff John Sununu to discuss drug policy.
Afterwards, Jackson told reporters costly military programs, like
the B-2 stealth bomber, should be trimmed to provide extra funds for
the battle.
   _Patricia Ackerman, president of the National Alliance of Black
School Educators and principal of Taylor Academy in Cleveland
Heights, Ohio, gave Bush copies of her students' reactions to his
anti-drug TV speech last week.
   ``One student suggested that we needed a crew of robo-cops to
crash the drug dealers,'' she said. ``There were others who
suggested that the minimum wage needed to be increased, and then
selling drugs wouldn't be so attractive to kids.''

   New York City Democrats preached unity Wednesday, the day after
David Dinkins wrested the party's mantle from Mayor Edward Koch and
thrust himself into a November general election race with Republican
Rudolph Giuliani.
   There was no such consensus in Detroit, where Mayor Coleman Young
faces opposition from fellow Democrat Tom Barrow in November. But
Young, who led a field of 13 candidates in Tuesday's non-partisan
primary, remained an overwhelming favorite to win an unprecedented
fifth term.
   House Democrats savored twin victories in Texas and California,
where former House Speaker Jim Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho
were able to boost Democrats into seats the leaders abandoned when
they became targets of ethics investigations.
   In New York, Koch and two lesser-known Democratic candidates
appeared with Dinkins at a City Hall rally and pledged to support
him in November.
   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, beat Koch by a 51
percent-to-42 percent margin, a surprisingly large victory that
ended Koch's dream of winning a record fourth term.
   ``Yesterday, we were rivals,'' said Dinkins, who could become New
York's first black mayor. ``Today, we're allies united against
common foes. Those foes are crime and drugs, poverty and pollution,
illiteracy and infant mortality.''
   He might have added Giuliani to the list. The former mob-busting
federal prosecutor trounced cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder in the GOP
primary and immediately became the most seriously regarded
Republican candidate for mayor since former Mayor John Lindsay.
   Giuliani beat Lauder by a 67-to-33 percent margin, even though
Lauder spent an estimated $13 million _ about $350 per vote _ in a
media-intensive, sharply negative campaign.
   Giuliani went on the attack Wednesday, saying he would be ``much
tougher on crime, much tougher on corruption, much tougher on
drugs'' than Dinkins.
   But Dinkins had sent a signal Tuesday night that he intends to go
toe-to-toe with Giuliani on law-and-order issues. In his victory
speech, he told cheering supporters, ``I intend to be the toughest
mayor on crime that this city has ever seen.''
   In other New York races, Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth
Holtzman won the Democratic primary for city comptroller and special
state prosecutor Charles Hynes, known for his role in the Howard
Beach racial attack case, won the Democratic primary to succeed her
in Brooklyn. As in most New York races, victory in those Democratic
primaries is tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic city.
   In Detroit, the 71-year-old Young looked ahead to a general
election race against a candidate he defeated overwhelmingly in 1985.
   Barrow, a 40-year-old accountant who is the nephew of the late
boxing champion Joe Louis, came in second by a surprisingly
comfortable margin, winning 24 percent of the vote to Young's 51
percent.
   U.S. Rep. John Conyers, who staged a last-minute campaign with
active support from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, received a disappointing
18 percent of the vote. Political experts said that was good news
for Young, since Conyers was seen as a potentially stronger foe in
the general election.
   ``Conyers shot himself in the foot,'' said Wilbur Rich, an
associate professor of political science at Wayne State University
and the author of a biography of Young. ``His campaign had no
content, no issues.''
   Other congressional Democrats had reason to be cheerful after the
party held back Republican assaults on the Wright and Coelho seats.
   Fort Worth lawyer Pete Geren won Wright's old seat in Texas,
defeating Republican Bob Lanier by a 51-to-49 percent margin.
   In California's San Joaquin Valley, Assemblyman Gary Condit won
Coelho's seat over seven other candidates, winning 57 percent of the
vote to 35 percent for his nearest rival, Republican Clare Berryhill.
   ``We're looking mighty good,'' Democratic National Chairman Ron
Brown said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Brown noted that Democrats have won four of six special elections
for congressional seats so far this year. ``That's a good record,''
he said. ``We think we're off to a good start in 1989 and we intend
to keep going on that kind of roll.''

   A flash fire in a western Kentucky coal
mine killed 10 miners and injured three today in the nation's worst
mine disaster in five years, authorities said.
   State Police said 13 miners were near the fire at the Pyro Mining
Co.'s William Station mine, 140 miles southwest of Louisville, and
three escaped with burns. Rescue teams were sent into the shaft to
remove the bodies of the 10 others, said Trooper Ed Brady.
   The flash fire, or ignition, occurred about 9:30 a.m. CDT as a
mining machine was being dismantled to be moved, said Frank
O'Gorman, a spokesman for the federal Mine Safety and Health
Administration.
   MSHA spokesman Sam Stafford said a flash fire is caused when a
jet of methane, or natural gas, ignites ``like a flamethrower.''
Methane is found naturally in coal seams but ventilation systems
normally keep it below explosive concentrations.
   The exact cause of the fire was not immediately known. But
Stafford said such fires are usually caused when a piece of
equipment hits stone and causes a spark.
   O'Gorman said the dead were believed to have died of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
   The injured were taken to Union County Hospital in Morganfield
for treatment of burns, Brady said. Their condition was not
immediately known.
   Nancy Toombs, a secretary for state Commissioner of Mines and
Minerals Willard Stanley, said, ``There's nothing to indicate the
walls have collapsed or we have anyone trapped underground.''
   The accident was the nation's worst mine disaster since 27 miners
died in 1984 at the Wilberg Mine at Orangeville, Utah, said O'Gorman.
   The William Station Mine employs about 350 miners and includes a
longwall unit, a machine that continuously mines coal and allows the
roof to collapse behind it, the state mining agency said.

killing the man and hurling his body about 50 feet, police said.
   Joseph Bova, 43, was financial secretary and a part-time field

   ATF agent Jerry Singer in Chicago said investigators had not
immediately determined whether the bomb was attached to the truck
and triggered by ignition, or whether it was placed nearby and
triggered by remote control.

   Environmentalists tried a new tactic Wednesday
in their dispute over Exxon's cleanup of oil-stained beaches in
Alaska: They brought bits of the still polluted beaches to
Washington.
   Messengers from the National Wildlife Federation spread out
across Capitol Hill to deliver zip-lock plastic bags of oil-stained
Alaska rocks to every member of Congress.
   Rock samples also went to the White House, to other key members
of the Bush administration and to the top executives of Exxon Corp.,
in New York, according to spokesmen for the federation _ as well as
to reporters at a news conference.
   ``These are the rocks that Exxon has cleaned twice,'' Jay Hair,
the federation's president. He said he brought them back from Smith
Island, one of the areas of Alaska most affected by the massive
spill from the Exxon Valdez oil tanker last March.
   The island's beaches already have been cleaned twice by Exxon,
but oil continues to seep up from beneath, having penetrated as much
as 40 inches in some areas, the environmentalists said.
   ``We wanted every member of Congress to actually touch these
rocks, to smell the palpable coatings of crude oil, to experience
for themselves in a small way the immensity of this disaster,'' Hair
said.
   Criticism of Exxon's cleanup efforts increased this week as the
hugh oil company was pulling most of its equipment and manpower out
of the polluted areas for the winter. No further cleanup activity is
planned until next spring.
   Exxon, which has estimated that the cleanup costs likely will
exceed $1 billion, claims that most of the contaminated beaches have
been ``environmentally stabilized'' and has hinted that it may not
return for further cleanup activities next next year.
   Hair ridiculed Exxon's references to beaches being
``environmentally stabilized.''
   ``That's an Exxon euphemism. It does not mean cleaned up in any
scientific sense,'' said Hair, whose federation is the country's
largest conservation group with 5.8 million members. ``No beaches
have been cleaned. Exxon can not make this thing go away by their
arrogance.''
   Earlier this week nearly a dozen of the country's major
environmental groups criticized Exxon's cleanup efforts, saying that
claims by the oil company that 1,090 miles of contaminated shoreline
have been cleaned cannot be substantiated by scientific fact.
   The groups said the damage caused to wildlife by the spill has
yet to be calculated, but that so far the confirmed casualties
include more than 33,000 birds, 138 bald eagles, and 980 sea otters.
Alaska's fishing industry also has been thrown into chaos.
   Hair said that in many cases shorelines have been exposed to
``irretrievable damage.'' But he said Exxon should be directed by
the government to continue cleanup efforts to minimize damage on
severely oiled areas and limit the contamination to the food chain
that continues to threaten wildlife.
   ``At this point there is much that cannot be restored,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for five men on trial on
charges linked to the Medellin cocaine cartel are innocent and
government witnesses are ``lying to save their souls,'' defense
lawyers said Wednesday.
   A prosecutor argued in opening statements that the conspiracy
existed and created a ``pipeline'' of cocaine leading from Colombia
to the United States.
   The five are accused of conspiring with cartel leader Carlos
Lehder Rivas and others to create a large-scale coke-smuggling ring
which operated from 1974 to 1989.
   Lehder, extradited from Colombia in 1987, was convicted last year
of smuggling more than 20 tons of cocaine into the country and was
sentenced to life in prison without parole. Information developed
for that trial led to the indictment in this case.
   In opening arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller tied
Lehder to other cartel leaders who also were indicted in the case
but remain at large in Colombia. He said that beginning in 1974,
Lehder hired pilots and distributors, including some of the
defendants, to run the ring in the United States.
   ``The central theme you will hear is a core cast of characters
including the Medellin cartel ... had a central purpose that never
deviated _ to import and distribute cocaine in the United States,''
Mueller said.
   He described the beginnings of the operation and told how it grew.
   ``In 1978, there was a veritable cocaine pipeline from Colombia
to Norman's Cay in the Bahamas to the United States,'' Mueller said.
   Attorney Clyde Collins, representing Jack Reed, 58, called the
government's case a fabrication and said Reed was not a key figure.
   ``Lehder's lieutenant? This old man? No!'' Collins said.
   ``Liars, beggars and thieves _ that's who the government will
produce to testify in this trial,'' Collins said. ``They lied to
save their souls.''
   On trial with Reed, 58, who was convicted with Lehder last year
on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in prison, are
Thomas Howard Herington, 35, Mill Valley, Calif.; Barry Kane, 52,
Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale; Donald Kenneth Lady, 41,
Pomona, Calif., and Samuel Thomas Stewart, 53, Anaheim, Calif.
   Herington's attorney, Patrick Hallinan, admitted that his client
did some minor dealing in the past but gave up all ties to drugs.
   Rick Mycock, representing Kane, said most of the evidence against
him will come from George Jung, a felon and admitted liar. He said
Kane was innocent.
   Attorney Ray David, representing Lady, said his client helped
secure some ranches in Mexico for associates, but not for
drug-smuggling purposes. He cautioned jurors not to assume the
clients are guilty by association.
   ``Carlos Lehder is not on trial here and drugs are not on
trial,'' he said.
   Kevin Sanders, who represents Stewart, described him as a
law-abiding family man who operates a legitimate aircraft business.
   ``Sam got here today as the result of a very large and extensive
witchhunt conducted by the U.S. attorney's office,'' Sanders said.
   The Medellin cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is
based, is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine in the United
States.
   Reed is charged with conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or
more of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
Kane, Lady and Stewart face the conspiracy count and an additional
charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. Herington is charged with
conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   If convicted, the men could get sentences ranging from 10 years
to life.

   A House Veterans Affairs subcommittee voted
Wednesday to approve a 4.9 percent cost-of-living increase in the
benefits paid to 2.2 million veterans with service-connected
disabilities or to their survivors.
   The full committee is expected to act Wednesday on the
legislation, which would raise expenditures for fiscal 1990 to $9.34
billion instead of $8.9 billion under the current schedule,
according to committee estimates.
   The increase would become effective Dec. 1.
   The bill, approved by the subcommittee on compensation, pensions
and insurance, also raises the special monthly payment for loss or
loss of use of certain organs or portions of the body from $63 a
month to $66 a month. Further, it requires the Veterans Affairs
Department to move at least three and no more than seven VA regional
offices onto property owned by VA medical centers.
   Twenty-eight cities have medical centers and regional
administrative centers in different parts of town, according to the
committee.

   The Soviet ambassador to Denmark, Boris Pastukhov,
has been named the Kremlin's new envoy to Afghanistan, succeeding
First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov, an official confirmed
Wednesday.
   ``It seems we have our leaks as well,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told a government news briefing after a
reporter said he had heard rumors of Pastukhov's appointment.
   Gerasimov on Tuesday said Vorontsov, Soviet ambassador in
Afghanistan since October 1988, had been recalled to Moscow so he
could devote all his time to his duties as one of Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze's top deputies.
   The personable Vorontsov, one of his country's top diplomatic
troubleshooters, presided over the Soviet mission in Kabul as the
Kremlin ended its direct military involvement in Afghanistan and
searched for diplomatic ways to guarantee the survival of Marxist
President Najib's government.
   He had previously served as top Soviet negotiator at the
superpower arms talks in Geneva.
   Pastukhov, 55, envoy to Copenhagen since April 1986, previously
served as chairman of the Soviet State Publishing Committee and in
various leadership posts in the Komsomol Communist youth
organization and the Communist Party.

<HEAD>Group Says Toxic Spills on Railroads Up 13 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spills of toxic materials on railroads rose by
13 percent in 1988, but highway incidents dropped, a private group
reported Wednesday.
   Citizen Action, citing statistics from the Transportation
Department, said there were 1,015 toxic spills on railroads last
year, the most since the department started keeping track of such
incidents in 1982.
   An industry representative, however, disputed the significance of
many of the spills cited by Citizen Action and accused the group of
trying to ``cloud railroad safety.''
   There were no deaths linked to the spills, but they caused nine
major injuries and 27 minor ones and resulted in $2.4 million in
damage, Citizen Action said.
   Texas led the nation with 151 incidents, followed by Ohio, 64;
Illinois, 59, and Georgia, 55, the group said.
   ``This growing list of railroad catastrophes and
near-catastrophes is no aberation,'' Citizen Action said. ``Rather,
it is the inevitable consequence of the increased reliance on the
rail transport of toxic chemicals, explosives, combustibles,
caustics and other hazardous materials.''
   The totals included small spills that may have been related to a
broken valve on a rail car or other faulty equipment, said Robert
Creamer, a Citizen Action spokesman.
   There were 4,831 highway incidents in 1988, a drop from 4,932
recorded in 1987, Citizen Action said.
   The Transportation Department data are based only on incidents
reported to the government ``and as a consequence (are) very
conservative,'' the group said.
   But Jim Reiter, a spokesman for the Association of American
Railroads, said many of the spills counted by Citizen Action were
small and occurred in rail yards. He said there were 44 major train
accidents that caused spills, down from 50 in 1987.
   Railroad companies moved 1.4 million carloads of hazardous
materials last year, he said.

   Commonly used high school texbooks too often
give students a picture of American history that is without color,
passion, point or interest, a study released by the American
Federation of Teachers said Wednesday.
   The 158-page critique by historian Paul Gagnon analyzed five
books and said they neglect the role of religion in American
history, give short shrift to Old World roots, and fail to explore
deeply the thinking of such major figures as Abraham Lincoln.
   ``History is, above all, a good story and the truth is always the
best story to tell ourselves,'' Gagnon wrote in the study, entitled,
``Democracy's Half-Told Story: What American History Textbooks
Should Add.''
   The writers, he said, ``labor too hard to balance affirmation and
negation, and the result is a detached neutrality, passionless about
both the ugly and the beautiful moments in our history.''
   ``Whatever the case, the picture drawn for students is often
colorless, without point or interest,'' Gagnon said.
   Gagnon, a professor of history at the University of
Massachusetts, wrote the book for the Education for Democracy
Project, a joint venture of the federation, an AFL-CIO union
representing 710,000 teachers, the Educational Excellence Network
and Freedom House.
   Albert Shanker, president of the teachers' union, joined Gagnon
at a press conference with three of the books stacked on the table
and said, ``These textooks have some pluses but they also have some
very great failings. They are big, fat books, lots of names, lots of
facts, but a lack of focus.''
   Gagnon said that probably more than two-thirds of high school
juniors are taught from one of the books, which were the five most
widely adopted American history texts for high school use in 1987.
   ``They are not awful and they are not wrong; they just don't
provide enough help to the teacher,'' he said.
   Nancy Nemchik, an 8th grade history teacher at Kenmore Middle
School in Prince George's County, Md., said she agreed with the
study's conclusions about history texts, although she does not teach
from one of the ones studied.
   ``Students find that history is boring,'' Ms. Nemchik said. ``It
ranks below math and spelling.''
   Gagnon wrote that the longest sketch of Lincoln in any of the
books is a six-paragraph account in ``A History of the United
States'' by Daniel J. Boorstin and Brooks M. Kelley and even it
``does not reach to Lincoln's beliefs or depth of character.''
   He said Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton and
Franklin ``all fail to earn adequate descriptions of their ideas,
intellect, character or work'' in any of the five books.
   Gagnon gave the highest marks to ``History of a Free People,'' by
Henry W. Bragdon and Samuel P. McCutchen, published by Macmillan in
1981, saying it is superior to the others in writing style, analysis
and ``thoughtful remarks on economic, intellectual and world
perspectives.''
   He said the Boorstin and Kelley book, published by Ginn and
Company in 1986, ``follows closely behind'' in style and
organization, with a narrative that is ``unusually vigorous'' and
``less cluttered than the other three.''
   The remaining texts, said Gagnon, ``manage to pale down and
flatten out even the tragedy of the Civil War.''
   The others are:
   _``The United States: A History of the Republic,'' by James West
Davidson and Mark H. Lytle, Prentice-Hall, 1988.
   _``People and Our Country,'' by Normak K. Risjord and Terry L.
Haywoode, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1982.
   _``Triumph of the American Nation,'' by Lewis Paul Todd and Merle
Curti, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986.
   Gagnon said all of the books ``omit or dumb down the Old World
background'' of the American experience ``as though it were of
little importance.''
   And because they fail to explore adequately the religious ideas
of the Puritans, he said, ``Students are left with the impression
that toleration is the only `religious' idea worth remembering.
   ``Modern readers, always ready to mistake their own indifference
to religion for the virtue of toleration, could profit from a wider
perspective,'' he said.
   Gagnon criticized all of the books for failing to delve deeply
into the thinking of principal figures in American history.
   ``Even the longer biographical sketches of the Founding Fathers
do not reveal their education, reading, religious or philosophical
stances, cosmopolitanism, regard for the ancient, respect for
posterity, or place in the Enlightenment,'' he said.
   The books do give biographical sketches of Theodore Roosevelt and
Woodrow Wilson, he wrote, but, ``Little is said about ... the
religious and political principles they held, or about the substance
of their reading and education.''

<HEAD>Dissidents and Defectors Share Shelves With Gorbachev at Moscow Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Ilya Levkov looked proudly at books by
two Soviet defectors in his display at Moscow's International Book
Fair.
   ``I have two authors with death sentences against them,'' he
said, ``and here they are alive and well in my corner.''
   Judging by the fair that opened to the public Wednesday, the
Soviet Union is not only ready to hear the worst about itself, but
to buy it.
   Six years ago, authorities branded at least 50 Western books
intended for the fair as anti-Soviet and confiscated them.
   This year, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``Perestroika''
shares shelf space with works by defectors Arkady Shevchenko and
Stanislav Levchenko, emigre Jewish dissident Natan Sharansky and
American hard-liner Zbigniew Brzezinski.
   Brzezinski's book, ``The Great Failure,'' is subtitled ``Birth
and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century.''
   Also on display is John LeCarre's ``Russia House,'' in which a
Soviet scientist's crucial notebooks are passed to a publisher
attending the _ believe or not _ Moscow book fair.
   Levkov, who settled in New York after emigrating from the Soviet
Union 33 years ago, said the Soviet publishing company Progress
wants to acquire the rights to Brzezinski's book, and other Soviet
publishers are interested in almost all his offerings.
   At neighboring stands, Christian and Jewish publishers who once
had to endure harassment from this atheist state said they have
never had it so easy.
   Yosef Friedman, a member of the Lubavitch strain of Hasidic
Judaism, said most of his Russian-language religious books were
confiscated in the past. But this year, he said, Soviet airport
customs officers did not even examine his two cartloads of books.
   ``That's better than New York,'' he said. ``It was really
strange.''
   Soviets crammed the giant pavilions at an exhibition complex in
north Moscow where more than 2,000 publishing companies displayed
their wares, and people lined up for hours to get in.
   Moscow clerk Alexei Romantsev said that after the literary
journal Novy Mir began publishing Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag
Archipelago'' this summer, ``there can't be any risk here, or any
real surprises.''
   Still, Romantsev said he raced to Levkov's booth as soon as the
fair opened and had been sitting there devouring the emigre press
for more than two hours.
   David Kotick of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc.,
whose booth boasted such Western best-sellers as ``Russia House''
and Frederick Forsyth's ``The Fourth Protocol,'' said he was swamped
with offers from Soviet publishers.
   ``I've been offered so many things,'' he said. ``But it's hard to
make deals because how are you going to get paid?''
   The Soviet ruble is not freely convertible into other world
currencies, which makes it difficult for Soviet companies to import
goods.
   Still, Kotick said, Soviet publishers are clearly getting good at
``Western wheeling and dealing.''
   This was the first of the biennnial fairs since new rules came
into effect allowing individual Soviet publishers to form direct
ties with foreign partners, and the fair's commercial atmosphere
brought praise from the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The event has become a real fair instead of an ``exhibit'' of
forbidden fruit, it said, and Soviet publishers have already
received orders for about 2.5 million books.
   The official news agency Tass said not a single book intended for
the fair had been confiscated. But Levkov said one book he had
planned to bring, an obscene epic poem written in the 18th century,
was vetoed by fair organizers beforehand.
   For all its changes, one tradition of the fair held true:
larceny. Vendors reported their books were disappearing at record
rates.
   But Kotick said he couldn't blame Soviet readers hungry for
literature.
   ``It's like a starving man with bread,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a domestic jetliner
noted he had set a wrong course, then began sobbing in desperation
before his aircraft crashed into the Amazon jungle, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
   The cockpit voice recorder from the Boeing 737-200 that crashed
Sept. 3 contradicts statements made later by the pilot, who insisted
he had set a proper course, the O Globo paper said.
   The Varig Airlines flight carrying 54 people crashed in a remote
eastern Amazon region, 1,100 miles from its destination of Belem.
Twelve people on board were killed.
   The newspaper said its account of the voice recorder came from an
unidentified pilot taking part in an investigation of the crash. The
contents of both the voice recorder and the flight-data recorder
have not been released.
   ``On the black box, you hear the pilot say he made a mistake with
the course, and then his desperate weeping,'' O Globo quoted the
investigating official as saying.
   Pilot Cezar Garcez, a 32-year-old Air Force veteran, said after
the crash that he had set the correct course and that his
instruments were working properly.
   The newspaper said the investigating official confirmed a report
by passenger Epaminondas Chaves, who said Garcez told him he had set
an incorrect course.
   ``When he perceived the error in his computerized plan, he could
have used his air charts, which should always be consulted, but they
were folded when the plane crashed,'' the investigating pilot told O
Globo.
   Other pilots flying in the area when the Boeing got lost said
Garcez tuned his radio to a soccer game after he took off. Garcez
denied it.

<TEXT>
   The presidents of the three Andean nations to
receive U.S. funds to fight cocaine trafficking will meet later this
month to discuss President Bush's anti-drug plan, a government
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco said President Alan Garcia had
confirmed the meeting with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
Bolivia's president, Jaime Paz Zamora.
   Larco said the three will discuss the Bush plan, which includes
$261 million in aid to fight cocaine trafficking in the three
countries over the next five years.
   Peru and Bolivia are the world's primary sources for coca leaf,
the raw material from which cocaine is made. Colombian drug cartels
control the production and distribution of the drug.
   Larco said no date had been set for the meeting, but a spokesman
at the government palace said Wednesday the meeting would probably
be held in Lima at the end of September.
   Garcia, meanwhile, criticized Bush for offering too little
financial assistance, and for turning what he said was an economic
problem into a military one.
   ``It's not a problem of donating some number of helicopters,
sometimes very old helicopters, or donating some number of rifles or
bullets, it's rather an economic and financial problem,'' Garcia
said.
   ``It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed
market for the products that could substitute for the coca,'' he
said.
   Garcia's comments were made at a meeting in Lima of agriculture
ministers of the Andean Pact nations, which include Venezuela,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
   In the meeting, which ended Wednesday, the agriculture ministers
agreed to study whether such crops as coffee, cacao and palm oil
could be economically viable substitutes for coca cultivation.

   Dozens of East Germans have taken refuge in
the West German Embassy in Warsaw, state television reported
Wednesday.
   The news program Telexpress said there are about 50 East Germans
in the embassy, according to unofficial figures.
   It broadcast pictures of the refugees in the embassy courtyard,
including children at play.
   ``Not long ago this building was under a siege of Poles seeking
visas. After Budapest and Prague, East German escapees are seeking
shelter in the West German Embassy in Warsaw,'' the news program
said.
   It was referring to East Germans who this summer occupied West
German missions in Hungary and Czechoslovakia in hopes of being able
to emigrate to the West.
   Risking censure from its Warsaw Pact allies and courting praise
from the West, Hungary has opened its borders and allowed more than
10,000 East Germans to cross into Austria. Most have headed for West
Germany.
   But in Czechoslovakia, about 250 of 400 refugees holed up in the
embassy compound gave up Tuesday and left after being promised they
would not be punished and would be allowed to apply to emigrate
legally.
   Polish media have reported on the exodus, but there has been no
comment from Poland's government, the first East bloc administration
led by non-communists. Hungary also is pressing for major reforms,
but East German remains one of the most rigidly controlled states
and refuses to consider demands for change sweeping the communist
world.

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on
Wednesday convened the East bloc's first cabinet led by
non-Communists, and the Communist president urged support for it
from all sides.
   Mazowiecki, whose Solidarity-dominated Cabinet was approved by
parliament Tuesday, received a letter expressing support and loyalty
from 54 members of the security forces in southern Poland.
   Other offers of support came from the Communist-dominated trade
union OPZZ and Communist Party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who
said the Communists would offer ``constructive criticism.''
   The Cabinet, known as the Council of State, met for three hours
to discuss coordinating the various economic ministries, the
government press office said. It named Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, a
veteran Solidarity activist, to handle contacts with trade unions,
the communique said.
   The Cabinet also met with Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who urged all Poles to support it.
   ``The fact that we are sitting here together may be seen by
someone as a joke of history, and by someone else as the logic of
history,'' said Jaruzelski in comments carried by television. ``Most
important today is that this experiment is successful. There are big
hopes that it will.''
   Jaruzelski imposed martial law in 1981 in an effort to quash
Solidarity. However, earlier this year, he urged the legalization of
the independent labor movement and its participation in government
to gain backing for tough economic policies.
   Rakowski, a former prime minister, later said in a TV address
that the ``party is obliged to support this government, but we
(party) will not resign from constructive criticism.''
   He called for a renewal of the party, saying Communists must
forget their former monopoly on power and ``say goodbye to ...
remnants of outdated doctrines.''
   For the first time in any Soviet bloc country, the Communists are
losing control of the vast ministerial bureaucracies and power for
political appointments.
   Solidarity has vowed personnel decisions based on competence and
commitment to reform, and no ``witch hunt.''
   A parliamentary commission overseeing the activities of the
Interior Ministry met Wednesday and agreed to review 93 cases of
alleged crimes during Communist control.
   The Communists only control four of the 24 seats on the Council
of Ministers but retain power over the police and military.
   Solidarity has 12 votes, including Mazowiecki's. The independent
foreign minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, likely is sympathetic to
their point of view.
   Four other posts went to the United Peasant Party and three to
the Democrats, smaller parties that ended their communist alliance
to form a parliamentary majority with Solidarity last month.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said it would take time
before the Cabinet could begin the radical changes it pledged in an
effort to pull Poland out of economic decline.
   Balcerowicz said Poland's triple-digit inflation must be curbed
but in such a way that ``we don't stop our (government's) activities
in the first or second week.''
   ``I don't think it is possible ... to try to make a radical
anti-inflation operation overnight. The risk of social consequences
due to the economic effects would be excessive.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two governors leading preparations for the
education summit insisted Wednesday that school reform is everyone's
business and politics should not enter discussions with President
Bush later this month.
   ``I really do believe this is a national security issue and
therefore I believe we should have a bipartisan national plan to
rescue the country's educational system and preserve opportunities
for American kids for the 21st century. I believe that,'' said
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell agreed. ``It is a national
summit, not a federal summit. This is a summit to focus on ... the
role of the federal government.''
   Campbell, a Republican, and Clinton, a Democrat who already has
begun to implement cutting-edge programs to improve education in his
state, held a day-long hearing to gather ideas and information from
educators, business leaders, government officials and others on
possible topics for the summit set for Sept. 27-28 in
Charlottesville, Va.
   Panelists generally agreed with the governors that the various
groups involved with education should devise national standards and
goals to be presented to Bush for his endorsement and support.
   However, Clinton and Campbell conceded to reporters that the
president has not agreed with the approach.
   ``We're still in negotiations and discussions with the White
House,'' said Clinton, warning against negative speculations on the
outcome of the summit. ``We are going to do this. This hasn't been
done before. We are doing our best in good faith to say what ...
issues ... ought to be raised and to let other people come in here
and say that.''
   Asked if there is fear that the president may use the summit ``as
a substitute for serious action, rather than a first step for
serious action,'' Clinton responded, ``I think it would be wrong to
have any presumptions about it one way or the other on this. I think
the fact that he's been willing to call us together will go down to
his credit.''
   However, Clinton added, ``I think that if he does try to play
politics _ and I'm not suggesting that he is _ I think that it's a
trap. I think once you pick up this ball, you pretty well got to run
with it. If you try to put it down after the summit's over, then I
think you have dashed expectations, disappointed people, a divided
country, people disoriented.
   ``I think he has made a decision that he will have to live with
and that decision is to assume some personal responsibility for the
future of the quality of education. We have to assume his good
faith,'' concluded Clinton.
   The areas in which national goals could be set, the governors
said, include reducing school dropout rates, making sure every child
is prepared to attend school, decreasing illiteracy among
working-age Americans, raising standards in science and math and
increasing high school graduation rates.
   ``I don't think that we have any magical cure but I do think that
when we finish this process of pouring all the thought and ideas
into the funnel, that at the other end we will be able to come out
with a little clearer focus of where we want to go as a nation, and
in the states,'' said Campbell.

<HEAD>Experts: Coleman Young Well Positioned to Win Fifth Term</HEAD>

   Mayor Coleman Young is heavily favored to win an
unprecedented fifth term after a primary in which he vanquished his
most dangerous opponent, political experts said Wednesday.
   Young easily led a field of 13 candidates in Tuesday's
non-partisan election and will face second-place finisher Tom Barrow
in a November runoff.
   Barrow, who was badly defeated by Young in the 1985 mayor's race,
outpolled U.S. Rep. John Conyers, who was seen was a potentially
stronger candidate and had the support of the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Those familiar with the city's politics said Conyers, a 13-term
congressman with a national reputation, ruined his chances by
entering the race late and running a disorganized, ineffective
campaign.
   ``Conyers shot himself in the foot by making derogatory remarks
about city leaders. His campaign had no content, no issues,'' said
Wilbur Rich, an associate professor of political science at Wayne
State University and the author of a biography on Young.
   At a news conference, Conyers defended his strategy, saying,
``Campaigns by their nature are disorganized.'' However, asked what
he would have done differently, he said, ``I would have started
earlier.''
   Barrow, 40, began campaigning for this year's race soon after
losing to Young in 1985. Conyers entered a day before the filing
deadline in May.
   Most observers believe that the 71-year-old Young is a shoo-in to
win on Nov. 7 unless Barrow comes up with a secret strategy or the
mayor makes a major blunder.
   The Rev. Jim Holley, a well-known Detroit activist who remained
neutral in the primary, said Barrow has limited appeal among average
residents of the nation's sixth largest city, with most of his
support coming from white voters and ``Buppies,'' black urban
professionals.
   ``He's going to have to spend eight weeks demonstrating to the
grass-roots people he is concerned,'' Holley said.
   Rich said Barrow ``still needs to find out how government
works.'' He referred to a campaign blunder in which Barrow promised
to appoint a deputy mayor for education, apparently unaware that the
mayor doesn't have authority over the Board of Education.
   Barrow, nephew of the late prize fighter Joe Louis, hasn't paid
his dues, said Tom Turner, secretary-treasurer of AFL-CIO in Detroit
and a Democratic Party leader.
   ``Young has the kind of charisma and personality that he is able
to get a lot of industry and business people to do things in the
city of Detroit,'' Turner said. ``I'm not sure Tom Barrow is
sophisticated enough to do those kind of things.''
   Conyers may suffer next year if he seeks a 14th term in Congress,
Turner added.
   ``Once you attempt to take on someone like Coleman Young, you are
very vulnerable, and next year a lot of people will be going after
his seat,'' he said. ``Conyers never really was organized enough to
take a comprehensive program to the citizens of Detroit.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch will be out of office by the
end of the year, but Paul Blum is afraid the mayor will be hanging
around his store a lot longer.
   Blum, owner of a costume and novelty shop in Greenwich Village,
slashed the price of a Koch mask to $1 Wednesday, hoping to sell his
stock of 300 before the mayor leaves City Hall.
   The masks, which Koch himself called a good likeness when they
were introduced last year, normally retail for $36.
   ``We may have to give them away,'' Blum said following Koch's
loss in the Democratic primary Tuesday.
   ``If anyone has any ideas about what to do with 300 masks of
Mayor Koch, I'd appreciate hearing from them,'' he said. ``Maybe
they can be used to raise money for some charity.''

<HEAD>Educators Urge National Consensus on Education Goals</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs of governors' comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators urged President Bush on Wednesday to
use his upcoming education summit with governors as a springboard to
achieve a new national consensus on what children should learn.
   Bush joined Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos in the 45-minute
brainstorming session at the White House with leaders of 17 national
education organizations.
   Bush, who has said he wants to be ``the education president,''
has already decided not to invite them or any other education
experts to participate in his Sept. 27-28 meeting with the governors
in Charlottesville, Va.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wants the
governors ``to help develop a set of realistic goals for the nation
in education.''
   ``The president believes that the nation's education system needs
more accountability in terms of student achievement. He will suggest
the need for a results-oriented education system and ask the
governors for their ideas to make education meet those goals in a
more effective manner,'' said Fitzwater.
   But Bush likely will propose the goals not at the end of the
meeting but ``at a later date,'' Fitzwater said.
   If the educators were miffed at their exclusion from the summit,
they weren't showing it as they emerged from the Roosevelt Room of
the White House.
   Keith Geiger, the new president of the National Education
Association, said, ``The major overall theme was that the president
could lead in a national role of setting (educational) goals for
this country.''
   That could include spelling out what ``youngsters need to know in
order to graduate from high school,'' said Geiger.
   Albert Shanker, his counterpart at the American Federation of
Teachers, cautioned, ``There will be a tremendous letdown if the
summmit takes place and turns out to be a mere media event and
doesn't come up with anything that's substantive.''
   Shanker said Washington doesn't need to establish a national
curriculum, but must be concerned about the percentage of high
school graduates capable of reading and writing at advanced levels.
   Cavazos noted that many governors were holding their own
pre-summit meetings to canvass experts for advice, and he emphasized
that the Charlottesville meeting was ``only a start.''
   ``It's the beginning ... of an opening dialogue, not only with
the governors, but with all of the people, with the teachers, with
the educators, with the students, parents,'' said Cavazos.
   Cavazos said the Bush administration aims to move education
``back to the forefront'' of national attention.
   The former university president said he expects the summit to
produce a ``commitment at the national level to truly restructure
the educational system in America.''
   Cavazos, who has complained that school reform has produced only
meager improvements, said, ``Everyone in that room knows what it
takes. ... The fundamental question is why hasn't it happened.''
   ``I think it is a question of leadership to be provided by the
president and the governors in turn at their states, and the
national momentum,'' the education secretary said.
   Geiger's invitation to participate in the parley with the
president was the first for an NEA chief executive since the Carter
years.
   Last month, Bush remarked that the NEA has been ``frustrated with
me for evermore.''
   ``They've opposed me every time I've ever run for office that I
can remember, and so what's new? I mean, they've got their approach
to education and I've got mine _ and I am right and they are
wrong,'' the president said Aug. 23.
   Geiger said he personally thanked Bush for the invitation.
   ``We will disagree. We will always disagree, but I think we will
be able to work with the administration,'' the union head said.
   Meanwhile, two of the governors leading the preparations for the
summit said educational excellence is too crucial to the nation's
future to let politics enter into the discussions with Bush.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton told reporters, ``I really do believe
this is a national security issue ... we should have a bipartisan
national plan to rescue the country's educational system.''
   Clinton and Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina said the
summit sessions could set goals in areas such as reducing dropout
rates, cutting adult illiteracy and raising high school graduation
rates.

<HEAD>House Toughens Rules on Commodities Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Wednesday to
outlaw the trading practices cited in a wave of indictments
involving the nation's two largest futures exchanges in Chicago.
   The Commodity Futures Improvements Act, which passed 420-to-0,
also would give extra muscle to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which congressional critics have called too gentle a
watchdog of the nation's futures markets.
   The legislation makes sweeping changes in trading practices
exposed in last month's indictments of 45 brokers and traders and a
clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   The bill would:
   _Ban insider trading on the nation's 13 active futures exchanges.
   _Require floor traders, those who trade only for themselves and
not for outside customers, to register with the CFTC.
   _Limit trading among broker associations that could conflict with
customers' accounts.
   _Severely restrict the practice of dual trading.
   In dual trading, floor traders on an exchange can trade for
themselves as well as their customers on the same day.
   While not illegal, the practice has raised conflict-of-interest
questions about whether traders take care of themselves ahead of
their customers. Supporters of the practice say it is necessary to
maintain market liquidity when there are few customer orders.
   The bill also requires exchanges to maintain accurate trading
records so that investigators can reconstruct any given transaction.
   The Chicago indictments included numerous charges of customers
defrauded through falsified trading records. Transactions on the
Chicago exchanges, as well as others around the country, use
handwritten paper cards to record sales and purchases, with the
trader entering the information.
   Within weeks of the indictments, the two Chicago exchanges
announced they were working to develop hand-held computer terminals
to record floor trading.
   The bill would require exchanges _ one year after enactment _ to
develop systems that would pinpoint the time of a trade's execution
to within one minute of its occurrence.
   That standard would be tightened to 30 seconds within three years
of enactment.
   The bill also would make permanent the CFTC, which which Congress
has reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years
since it was created in 1974.
   The Senate has yet to take up the CFTC's reauthorization but Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said last week that he was asking staff members to draw
up legislation to correct gaps in the agency's surveillance of
trading activities.

   President Bush offered best wishes to Jews in
this country and around the world Wednesday as they observe Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur.
   In a written message marking the religious holy days, Bush said:
   ``The universal message of the High Holy Days is that each of us
can affect both our personal fate and our fate as a community. These
days remind us of the redemptive value of humility and repentence.''
   Bush said his wife, Barbara, ``joins me in extending best wishes
to Jews everywhere as you mark the High Holy Days. May the year 5750
bring us all closer to that day when all the world shares a profound
understanding of the Hebrew word for peace _ shalom.''
   Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, occurs on Sept. 30 this year.
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, follows on Oct. 9.

<HEAD>All North Chicago Workers Tested Under New Drug Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of North Chicago was the first in line
when a drug testing program for all 160 city workers got under way,
a program authorities called the first of its kind in the nation.
   Critics suspect it is unconstitutional.
   The program is aimed at creating a drug-free workforce and
setting an example for the community, said Mayor Bobby Thompson.
   President Bush ``just mentioned that government has to get
involved (in the drug war) in his speech the other day, so we were
one step ahead of him,'' Thompson said in a telephone interview.
   From office clerks to aldermen, 63 employees in North Chicago _ a
middle-class community of 18,500 about 25 miles north of Chicago _
were tested last Friday, and the remainder were to be tested
Thursday, Thompson said.
   Those who test positive for drug or alcohol use will be offered
help but not fired. Any employee who tests positive a second time
will be subject to dismissal, the mayor said.
   Employees must sign a consent form before they are tested, and
all have agreed to do so, he said.
   ``If they choose not to be tested, there's nothing you can do.
But that's grounds for suspicion,'' Thompson said ``The person is
definitely watched, because what do you have to hide?''
   North Chicago Police Chief Ernest Fisher said he thinks the city
is the first in the nation with such a testing program.
   Larry Cirignano, spokesman for U.S. drug czar William Bennett,
agreed, saying: ``I don't think anybody has it for all city
employees.''
   The program is allowed under a new ordinance that calls for
mandatory drug testing ``only where there's reasonable suspicion''
that an employee is using drugs, said Bob Long, an attorney for
North Chicago.
   ``I think most city employees have followed the lead of the mayor
and all the top administration in city government,'' he said. ``I'm
not aware of anyone who's declined.''
   But a few workers have questioned the constitutionality of the
new law and contacted the American Civil Liberties Union, which is
investigating, said ACLU attorney Alan Chen.
   The problem is not how the law is written, but rather the way
city administrators have described the tests publicly and to
employees, Chen said.
   ``The way it's been characterized by the city is that they are
mandatory,'' he said.
   ``If it were mandatory policy ... our position would be that it
was blatantly unconstitutional,'' he said.
   ``Obviously there are many reasons somebody would and could
refuse to submit voluntarily to this kind of test,'' including
privacy concerns, he said.
   If the ACLU determines that employees are being coerced into
taking the tests, ``we would seriously consider taking action
immediately'' to halt the program, Chen said.
   The idea for the program arose three years ago when North Chicago
began drug tests for all prospective city employees, Thompson said.
   ``We ran into so many people who were users at that time ... (we)
decided that maybe we'd check into this further.''
   The ordinance, passed by the City Council on Aug. 21, is based on
a contract that already governed the city's police department and
allows tests to be administered up to four times a year, the mayor
said. No decision has been made on how frequently the tests will be
given to other city workers.

   President Bush said Wednesday that he is
nominating Adis Maria Vila, a Florida state official, to be the
Department of Agriculture's assistant secretary for administration.
   Ms. Vila, 36, of Tallahassee is a Cuban-born lawyer who worked in
the White House, Commerce Department and at the State Department
from 1982-87, when she left to head the Florida Department of
Administration.
   He also is nominating Velma Montoya, a finance professor at
California State Polytechnic University, to be a member of the
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.
   Ms. Montoya, 51, of Los Angeles worked in the Reagan White House
in 1982 and was an economist for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in 1983-85.
   Bush is nominating William P. Glade to be associate director of
the U.S. Information Agency for educational and cultural affairs.
Glade, 60, is a professor of economics at the University of Texas in
Austin.
   The White House said Bush also has decided to keep Richard W.
Carlson as the USIA's associate director for broadcasting and
Richard T. Kennedy as ambassador at-large and special adviser to the
secretary of state on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear energy.
   Retired Brig. Gen. David H. Sudderth Jr., an executive of the

<HEAD>Khamenei: United States Cannot Be Trusted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday the
United States still resents Iran's 10-year-old Islamic revolution
and that any conciliatory gestures by the Bush administration toward
his country cannot be trusted.
   The Iranian spiritual leader's hourlong speech came during the
latest wave of anti-Americanism, which began last week after 186
U.S. legislators called for an economic boycott of Iran to press for
a new government.
   In his speech, Khamenei described the United States as a
``usurper'' that treated Iran like a ``puppet'' Iran before the 1979
revolution.
   Speaking before a crowd of Iranians at his Tehran residence,
Khamenei said, ``Washington has had a deep grudge against Iran since
the Islamic revolution'' toppled a pro-Western monarchy in 1979.
   ``Even if it comes and says, `Now let's be friends and let us
come back as friends,' it is obvious that its intention still is
enmity, exploitation and domination,'' he said in the speech.
   His address, broadcast live on state Tehran radio and monitored
in Nicosia, was frequently interrupted by shouts of ``Death to
America!''
   There was speculation that after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
death on June 3, Iran would move toward restoring ties with the
West, mainly because it needs the technology and expertise to
rebuild a shattered economy.
   Khamenei succeeded Khomeini, and Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of
the so-called pragmatists, was elected president July 28. Both
developments increased Western hopes of a more open foreign policy
after a decade of isolation.
   But the anti-American fervor was rekindled last week when the
U.S. congressmen called on President Bush to impose an arms embargo
and economic boycott to press for ``change and a new order in Iran.''
   In a statement Wednesday, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps,
Iran's main military force, condemned the congressmen's appeal:
``The letter proves the shamelessness and impudence of the arrogant
and expansionist regime of the Great Satan.''
   Their statement was carried by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, which was also monitored in Nicosia.

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Rally Told Legislature Will Review Their Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people were told at a
Wednesday night rally in Baku, Azerbaijan, the communist authorities
had agreed to consider ethnic demands that touched off a widespread
strike, a witness said.
   Ali Aliev, a member of the grass-roots People's Front group who
attended the rally in the southern republic's capital, said speakers
announced that Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet, the legislature, will
review the demands Friday.
   He said in a telephone interview the legislature will consider
pressing for an end to the special status given to the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region in January; adopting a law on the republic's
sovereignty; pressing for release of ``political prisoners;'' and
granting the People's Front legal status.
   The Kremlin took Nagorno-Karabakh out of Azerbaijan's control to
try to settle a dispute with Armenia over its jurisdiction.
   Azerbaijanis claim the mountainous enclave is theirs, but
Armenians say it is part of their historical homeland and want to
annex it. The region is 75 percent ethnic Armenian although it lies
in Azerbaijan.
   The dispute led to violence that killed about 100 people and
forced huundreds of thousands to flee their homes. A curfew was
imposed in Armenia and Azerbaijan to stop the unrest. Aliev said the
agreement announced Wednesday and signed by Azerbaijani party chief
Rakhman Vezirov asks the Supreme Soviet to consider lifting the
curfew.
   The accord came after three days of talks between Azerbaijani
officials and People's Front representatives, Aliev said.
   The People's Front led a strike over the issues that began Sept.
4 and silenced factories, stores and public transportation in the
mainly Moslem republic on the Caspian Sea. The Front called off the
walkout on Monday when it appeared its demand to have the Supreme
Soviet act on the dispute would be met.

   Czechoslovakia and Albania have
agreed to restore full diplomatic relations after a 28-year hiatus,
the official CTK news agency said Wednesday.
   Last week, Czechoslovakia proposed resumption of diplomatic
relations, saying it was ``abnormal'' for the two Communist states
to maintain only charge d'affaires in each other's countries.
   Czechoslovakia unilaterally severed its diplomatic ties with
Albania after Moscow broke with Tirana in 1961.
   Albania's isolated communist leadership has so far refused any
Soviet overtures to restore ties with Moscow.

<HEAD>Drug Treaty Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Nigeria's
justice minister Wednesday signed a law-enforcement mutual aid
treaty that officials said would help fight drug trafficking through
that African nation.
   The agreement provides for the production of witnesses,
documents, financial records or other evidence located in one nation
that is needed in the other country for a criminal investigation.
   Both countries agreed to help each other locate suspects, make
searches and seize assets from criminal enterprises.
   The agreement is the first of its kind that Nigeria has signed
with any other nation, said Prince Bola Ajibola, the Nigerian
minister of justice. It is the 14th between the United States and
another country.
   ``Every time we sign a mutual legal assistance treaty, the world
gets smaller and more precarious for drug dealers,'' Thornburgh said
after the signing. ``With each treaty signed we make it harder for
drug dealers to high from international justice.''
   Nigeria is a major transhipment point for Middle East heroin
bound for Europe and the United States.
   Similar treaties are in force between the United States and
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey. Six others are
awaiting ratification by the Senate.
   Agreements with Colombia and Morocco have been ratified by the
Senate but not yet put into force.
   Another was recently signed with Jamaica but has not been
submitted to the Senate for ratification.
   While the treaty will eliminates many legal obstacles for U.S.
prosecutors, corruption in Nigeria is still an impediment to
gathering evidence against Nigerian drug traffickers, said one U.S.
law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Provides Money For Leland World Hunger Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Rep. Mickey Leland was eulogized by
Congress Wednesday for ``his quest to end world hunger,'' while the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange donated $100,000 to begin a university
center in his memory.
   ``To have known him is to have been touched by him,'' House
Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash, said of Leland, who died on a flight to a
remote Ethiopian refugee camp last month.
   ``He never took, he only gave, and he never stopped giving: to
his nation, his state, to his friends, his family,'' Foley said.
   The $100,000 Chicago Mercantile Exchange donation will go to the
Mickey Leland Center on World Hunger, to be founded at Texas
Southern University, the congressman's alma mater, as the first
project of a newly created foundation in Leland's honor.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of the Chicago
Merc, and John Geldermann, chairman of the board, presented a check
for $100,000 to Texas Southern President William H. Harris during a
brief ceremony on Capitol Hill.
   Leland, the founder and chairman of the House Select Committee on
Hunger, was on his sixth trip to Ethiopia last month when his bush
plane slammed into a remote mountain on its way to a refugee camp on
the Sudanese border.
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., a member of the hunger committee,
said the Leland foundation and university center would focus on the
hungry and the homeless, at home and abroad. He said he is unaware
of any similar university center dedicated to such issues in the
United States, and possibly, the world.
   ``I think it is extremely important we carry on the work and
traditions Mickey Leland cared so much about,'' said House Majority
Whip William H. Gray, D-Pa.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Arab League criticism on suggestion
that more Soviet Jews go to Israel. Picks up 7th graf pvs `The administration
...'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration told Congress on
Wednesday that it wants to admit 50,000 Soviet refugees but doesn't
have the money to resettle many of the applicants, suggesting that
some go to Israel or return to the Soviet Union.
   There are already 17,000 Soviets waiting in Italy for permission
to enter the United States, and those who are rejected can ``always
go to Israel or return to Russia,'' Jewel S. Lafontant, the State
Department's coordinator for refugee affairs, told the House
subcommittee on immigration.
   ``In these days of glasnost, that's not an impossible thing,''
she said.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., was critical of Lafontant's solution.
   ``I don't think this is an appropriate response to someone who's
been languishing outside his country with the expectation of being
allowed to come here,'' he told reporters. ``You can't turn around
and send them back.''
   The majority of Soviet refugees are Jews who leave the Soviet
Union on Israeli visas, shifting direction for the United States
once they reach processing centers in Vienna or Rome.
   Israel, facing an increased Arab population both within and
outside its borders, has said it would welcome more Soviet Jews.
   However, the Arab League reacted angrily Wednesday, saying
increased Jewish immigration could ``adversely affect Palestinian
rights and the future of peace and stability in the Middle East.''
   The administration, testifying on its worldwide refugee plan for
fiscal 1990, said it doesn't have sufficient money to fund the
125,000 refugees it wants to admit beginning Oct. 1. That figure
represents about an 8 percent increase from fiscal 1989.
   Soviet refugees are the largest group among the 125,000, followed
by Vietnam with 26,500, East Asians with 25,000 and 6,500 each from
Eastern Europe, the Near East and South Asia.
   The figure for Eastern Europe, the same as this year's, is
designed mostly for Poles and Hungarians who already have applied,
as well as for a possible increase in Romanian and Bulgarian
applicants, administration officials said.
   The most controversial element in the administration proposal
centers on Soviet refugees, whose numbers have swelled as a result
of President Mikhail Gorbachev's liberalized emigration policies.
   ``The increased refugee flow brings problems in its wake,''
Lafontant said. ``But how much better it is to have to deal with the
problems caused by the success of one's policies than to deal with
problems caused by failure.''
   In an emergency move last spring, the administration nearly
doubled its Soviet refugee quota for fiscal 1989 to 44,000.
   Jewish groups estimate at least 72,000 Jews, and more than
100,000 Soviets altogether, will apply for refugee status in fiscal
1990.
   ``With no sign of decline in applications from Soviet citizens
seeking admission to the U.S., we judge that 50,000 is, if anything,
a conservative estimate of the potential admission requirements,''
said Princeton Lyman, the State Department's director of the Office
of Refugee Programs.
   Lyman said the administration's proposed fiscal 1990 budget
includes funding for only 84,000 refugees, placing the onus on the
congressional appropriations committees to come up with about $60
million to pay for the remainder.
   About 10,000 of the 125,000 slots will be funded by private
organizations, he said.
   Lyman also said the administration, in an effort to save money
and accommodate increasing numbers of Soviet refugees, was changing
its method of processing applicants by beefing up the staff at the
Moscow embassy and enlarging its facilities in the United States to
enable some processing here.
   Sources have said the proposal foresees phasing out facilities in
Ladispoli outside Rome, and in Vienna. Both serve as waiting points
for Soviet emigres seeking refugee status.
   The administration estimates that as many as 20,000 Soviets are
waiting in Italy and Austria, while another 35,000 applicants are
waiting processing in Moscow.
   Lyman said top priority would be granted to those who have
already applied for refugee status. If a large number of those are
approved, most of the proposed 50,000 slots would be taken, leaving
little room for new applicants.
   Those who are ineligible as refugees, who are given full
government funding, may still apply as immigrants or seek special
parole status.
   Officials also told the panel they didn't anticipate growth in
the number of refugees from Nicaragua despite a project to
demobilize the U.S.-supported Contra rebels and send them home from
their bases in Honduras and Costa Rica.
   Of the 3,500 slots allotted to Latin America and the Caribbean,
about 3,000 are expected to be filled by Cubans.

   Proposed legislation to allow senior citizens
to take jobs as child care workers without having their Social
Security benefits reduced got a cold reception Wednesday from the
Social Security Administration.
   Deputy Social Security Commissioner Louis Enoff told a House
subcommittee that while the agency agrees that older Americans
should be encouraged to stay in the workforce, relaxing the Social
Security earnings limit would be too expensive.
   ``We have not been able to come up with a way that would not
involve significant short-term costs,'' Enoff told a subcommittee of
the House Select Committee on Aging.
   Under current law, workers aged 65 trrough 69 lose $1 in Social
Security benefits for every $2 they earn above $8,880. The limit is
$6,480 for workers under age 65, and there is no limit for those 70
or older.
   In 1990, benefits for those aged 65-69 will be reduced $1 for
every $3 earned above the limit.
   Almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries lose some or all
of their benefits each year because of the test in effect for those
aged 65-69, and an additional 100,000 people in that age group do
not file for Social Security benefits because the test is in effect,
according to Social Security.
   Reps. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, and William Hughes, D-N.J., have
introduced legislation to exempt the earnings of child care workers
aged 65 or older from the Social Security earnings limits, saying
the proposal would encourage older Americans to work longer and help
meet the nation's day care needs.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cost $85
million over five years.
   ``Why shouldn't we attempt to match needs such as child care to
the desire to get older Americans who have so much to offer back
into the workforce?'' asked Hughes, acting chairman of the
subcommittee.
   ``I don't have any disagreement with trying to match them,''
Enoff responded. ``My only concern would be a massive elimination of
something like the earnings test or to try to administer a way of
picking and choosing'' which earnings would be exempt.
   Hughes said the earnings exemption could be extended to other
areas in which there are shortages, such as skilled nursing, with
the nation eventually repealing the earnings limit altogether.
   ``We need to be doing a far better job than we've done to date in
trying to find out how we can get older Americans back into the
mainstream of American life,'' he said.
   Carolyn Golding, deputy assistant labor secretary, took no
position on the legislation, but told the subcommittee that
premature retirement ``becomes a real cost to the individual worker,
the employer and the nation.''
   ``There is much to be gained by using older workers to meet the
needs for day care,'' she said.

<HEAD>New Beijing University Head Stresses Political Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new president of Beijing University on
Wednesday blamed ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and his
predecessor, Hu Yaobang, for the spring democracy movement, which
students from his school helped lead.
   Economist Wu Shuqing said the school is taking steps to prevent a
recurrence of the popular protests, which the army crushed on June
3-4.
   ``There is no place on the university campus for bourgeois
liberalism because it is a political, not an academic question,'' Wu
said in his first interview since being named president last month.
Bourgeois liberalism is a catch-phrase for Western liberal ideas.
   He said the school will hire more teachers of ideology and place
as much emphasis on educating students in Marxist-Leninist theories
as academics.
   Wu attributed student activism last spring to the failure of Zhao
and Hu ``to give enough stress to political and ideological work.''
   Hu was purged in 1987 because of pro-democracy student protests
in the winter of 1986-87. His death on April 15 precipitated the
spring democracy movement. Hundreds of posters went up at Beijing
University, mourning Hu's passing and subtly criticizing the
government.
   The school, considered China's most prestigious, has been the
hardest hit in the crackdown on dissent that began in June.
   Seniors returned to campus this summer for weeks of intensive
political study. Those who did not demonstrate that their thinking
was ideologically correct were not allowed to graduate.
   The freshman class was cut to 600 from a planned 2,100. Students
were ordered to undergo a year of military training before beginning
studies.
   Wu called the training an experiment.
   The beginning of the fall term was delayed until Oct. 14,
apparently to prevent students from disrupting the Oct. 1
celebration of the 40th anniversary of communist rule.
   Some people on campus have said another reason was that political
education among Beijing University teachers was taking longer than
planned. Many of them, particularly younger teachers, joined the
protests and showed sympathy for the students, even in the crackdown.
   However, Wu said, ``I feel the overwhelming majority of Beijing
University's teaching staff support the central authorities and
realize the harm which resulted from the anti-government riots.''
   China's official Xinhua news agency said 3,000 of the school's
12,000 students already have returned to campus.
   Wu, 57, replaced Ding Shisun, who headed the school for four
years and through two major student movements _ the spring protests
and the pro-democracy marches of the winter of 1986-87.
   Unlike other schools, Ding did nothing to stop Beijing University
students from taking the lead.
   Wu said Ding still teaches mathematics. News reports of Ding's
dismissal characterized it as non-political, saying he cited health
reasons.
   The official Beijing Daily newspaper said Wednesday that the
United States is being two-faced in criticizing the imposition of
martial law in Beijing, since America had thriving relations with
Taiwan when that Nationalist Chinese island bastion had martial law.
   ``It was precisely during the period of martial law that Taiwan's
economy and tourist industry, with the great help of the United
States, began to prosper,'' it said.
   Martial law was declared in Beijing on May 20, two weeks before
soldiers ended the student occupation of Tiananmen Square.
   Premier Li Peng said recently martial law must remain for now
because ``bad elements'' who stole military arms during the turmoil
are still at large.
   The Beijing Daily said the United States gave ``extraordinary
support'' in military and economic aid to Taiwan during the time it
was under martial law from 1949 to 1987.
   ``In the eyes of some Americans, whether a country implements
martial law or not is actually immaterial,'' the daily said. Those
who now use martial law to condemn China are ``shameless ... but
after all it is difficult to completely hide the harboring of evil
intentions.''

<HEAD>First Black Members Admitted to California Elks Lodge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMPOC, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of an Elks Lodge voted to admit two
black men whose rejection earlier this year led the national
fraternal organization to change its voting rules.
   The 1,600 members of the lodge, a popular eating and
entertainment center here, voted late Tuesday to admit Ernie
Hutchinson, a 57-year-old Santa Barbara County housing official, and
Joe Martin, a 56-year-old real estate agent.
   Five white candidates also gained admission to the all-male
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. No vote tally was released.
   ``I feel very gratified and personally relieved that it's over,''
said Martin. ``Now maybe things can get back to normal and the Elks
can get on with their business of providing scholarships and
performing community service.''
   Martin and Hutchinson will be initiated on Oct. 17, lodge
Secretary Walt Cooperider said.
   Hutchinson, the first of the two blacks candidates to apply to
the lodge founded in 1963, was rejected Jan. 17, and Martin was
rejected later. The two were told that fewer than a dozen members
voted against them.
   The rejections prompted the California chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People to call for a
boycott of the Elks.
   Community groups in this city of 31,000 people about 140 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, including the Lompoc school district,
severed their ties with the organization. About two dozen lodge
members resigned in protest, and the state attorney general's office
said it would investigate the lodge for civil rights violations.
   In July, delegates to the Elks' 125th annual national convention
threw out the old rule, which allowed any three members of a lodge
to reject a candidate and which some said made it difficult for
blacks to join the Elks. Under the new rule, a two-thirds majority
can approve a new member.
   For most of its history, the 1.5 million-member organization has
been all-white. In 1973, it changed its bylaws to include all men,
and blacks have joined other lodges since then.
   The Elks donate their time and money to everything from rodeos to
pancake breakfasts, and local chapters run such projects as
providing college cholarships and funding hot-lunch programs for
senior citizens. Nationally, the club raises millions of dollars for
charity.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Conditional Aid To El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee voted Wednesday to place
strings on the $85 million in U.S. aid for El Salvador next year,
signaling that lawmakers will watch the new government for progress
on human rights and peace with leftist rebels.
   ``We want to let them know we are really serious,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Appropriations foreign
operations subcommittee, who added the restrictions to a $14.4
billion foreign aid bill.
   Leahy's provision will be put to the test when the full
Appropriations Committee grapples with the bill on Thursday, and he
conceded a vote on whether to keep the restrictions in place will be
close. The language is vehemently opposed by the Bush administration.
   The measure would divide the $85 million in aid into three slices
which would be triggered at four-month intervals beginning Oct. 1.
The first two installments could be paid after the administration
reports and consults with Congress on the situation in El Salvador.
   But the third increment would in effect be made subject to a veto
by lawmakers with jurisdiction over foreign aid money if they
believe Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani is not doing enough
to make peace.
   El Salvador's rightist government is involved in peace talks with
the leftist FMLN rebels, aimed at ending a decade of fighting that
has cost more than 70,000 lives. Death squads linked to Cristiani's
ARENA party have been blamed for most of the deaths. While
substantially curtailed, human rights groups say the killings have
not been entirely stopped.
   The House version of the foreign aid bill, approved July 21,
included an $85 million cap on aid to El Salvador but placed no
restrictions on the money. That amount is $12 million less than
President Bush asked for.
   Other highlights of the foreign aid measure included:
   _ A provision, sure to provoke controversy from Greek Americans,
that would let the president cut aid to Greece so long as military
aid money previously sent remains unspent. If Bush were to exercise
the authority, it would, in effect, upset the longstanding ratio
that sends $7 to Greece for every $10 sent to Turkey, a U.S. ally in
conflict with Greece over Cyprus.
   _ $85 million for a fund to support private enterprise in Poland,
far more than Bush asked for during his trip to Eastern Europe in
July. The panel added $75 million to Bush's $10 million figure by
adopting an amendment by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   _ $160 million for the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the
Philippines, together with authority for the president to send an
additional $40 million to meet his full request for $200 million.
The House voted $160 million for the program.

   Many were culled, but many were chosen.
   Such was the night of news and documentary Emmy awards, with 50
given in 27 categories. At one point it provoked a gentle joke from
billionaire Malcolm Forbes, a presenter.
   There were three winners out of four nominees in one category, he
mused, and ``I just wonder how the one who didn't win feels.''
   PBS led the pack with 18 winners, followed by CBS with 16, ABC
with eight, and NBC with five. An HBO special, ``JFK: In His Own
Words,'' got cable's lone Emmy for achievement in 1988.
   When the non-televised, black-tie ceremonies at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel finally ended late Tuesday night, even a
syndicated show that bowed last fall to critical boos when it was
known as ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' had won two Emmys, for
title sequences and art direction.
   True, critically acclaimed works were honored, including Ted
Koppel's ``Nightline'' town meeting special from Israel on ABC. And
fine coverage of a breaking stories got Emmy honors, including CBS'
special on last year's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and Fred
Francis' ``NBC Nightly News'' report on the USS Vincennes and its
downing of an Iranian jetliner.
   But at times it seemed a hard task not to win.
   Example: In the category of ``segments'' _ stories _ in
informational, cultural or historical programming, there were nine
nominees, six of them from CBS' ``West 57th.'' There were three
winners. All were ``West 57th'' entries.
   In another segment category, for ``outstanding
background-analysis of a single current story,'' ABC's ``20-20,''
won three Emmys for various stories. There had been eight network
nominees.
   In yet another segment category, for ``outstanding
interview-interviewers,'' there were seven nominees and four
winners. Yet another segment category, for a continuing news story,
had eight nominees. Half of them won.
   Methinks it might be a good idea to restrict each category to no
more than two winners.
   CBS' Meredith Vieira, who shared in the first four Emmys she ever
has won, proved one of the night's most frank and gracious winners
when she paid tribute to Jane Stone, producer of one of her ``West
57th'' reports.
   Stone shared an Emmy with the correspondent for the segment.
Vieira, referring to her colleague's off-camera reportage on the
story, said, ``This was truly her piece, not mine. I came in at the
end.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle and Transportation
Secretary Sam Skinner will visit Alaska next week to check on
progress being made in cleaning up the Exxon oil spill as the
company gears down its efforts for the winter, officials said
Wednesday.
   The visit, coming as Quayle heads to Asia for 12 days, is
intended to refocus attention on the nation's worst oil spill. A
grounded Exxon tanker last March dumped 11 million gallons of oil
along the state's shoreline.
   Quayle will be ``briefed on the situation up there. We hope to
meet with some concerned citizens,'' as well as Coast Guard and
state officials during the 2{ hour stopover at Elmendorf Air Force
Base, said the vice president's press secretary, David Beckwith. He
said that it was undecided whether Quayle would meet with Exxon
officials, but that he was ``extremely interested in the company's
views.''
   Exxon has disagreed with state and federal officials throughout
the course of the clean-up on the adequacy of the company's efforts.
   ``There's still a good deal of uncertainty about the future of
the clean-up program. We hope there's less uncertainty after we
leave,'' said Beckwith.
   The Alaskan stop as Quayle flies to Korea, Japan, the Philippines
and Malaysia.
   President Bush had hoped to nonymity had said earlier
that administration officials convinced Bush it would not be
politically beneficial to refocus attention on the spill, after
initial criticism that he took too long to get the federal
government involved in the clean-up.
   Asked about the administration position on the amount of oil
still not cleaned up, Fitzwater said ``I don't think we can
characterize that situation. We're running into bad weather up there
and we'll have to see how things look in the fall in terms of the
spill clean-up.''
   Quayle and Skinner, who will not be going on the rest of Quayle's
trip, will receive briefings from the clean-up coordinator, Coast
Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, and others on the progress of
cleaning up the March 24 spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker.
   The Monday visit comes a week after an announcement by Alaska
state officials that they will continue the clean-up on a limited
scale when Exxon pulls out the last of its work crews Friday from
the fouled coastline of Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
   A spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said details of the
state's follow up were being worked out but that the governor and
state Department of Environmental Conservation were expected to
agree on a light, manual clean-up effort, plus research and
development during the dark and stormy winter months.
   The state is interested in various clean-up techniques that
inventers have proposed from coastal towns tainted by the spill.
   The governor's office said the state would expect Exxon to pay
for any clean-up costs it incurred.
   Exxon estimates its expenses for the summer clean-up at more than
$1.2 billion.

<HEAD>More Vietnamese Fleeing This Year Than Any Year Since 1981</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 61,000 boat people fled Vietnam in the
first eight months of this year, a figure higher than any full year
since 1981, and Hong Kong is bearing the brunt of the influx, a U.N.
group said Wednesday.
   ``The situation in Hong Kong continues to look very worrying,''
said Raymond Hall, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   The office registered 61,345 arrivals in countries of first
asylum in South East Asia and Japan from January through August,
just before seasonal conditions traditionally slow down the exodus.
   The outflow compared with 45,500 for last year and 74,000 in
1981. Hong Kong reported 32,000 arrivals during the first eight
months, almost twice the 1988 total of 18,400, the U.N. group said.
   In recent weeks, there have been numerous fights in the crowded
Hong Kong camps, and cholera has broken out among other Vietnamese
refugees living in primitive conditions on outlying islands.
   Most of the newcomers in the British colony face forced
repatriation as ``economic migrants'' because only those boat people
who arrived before June 16, 1988, were automatically considered to
be fleeing political persecution and thus eligible for refugee
status.
   In June, a 60-nation conference in Geneva formally endorsed a
plan to curb the outflow but did not commit itself on how to deal
with economic refugees.
   Hall said it was still too early to assess the impact of the
conference, saying there were ``definite signs of abatement'' in
some regions.
   The measures adopted by the Geneva conference call for efforts to
encourage the voluntary return of migrants who are refused refugee
status. So far, only 260 have gone back despite formal assurances by
Communist Vietnam that they are welcome and need not fear any
reprisals.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said Wedneday that
Vietnam remains opposed to any forced return of the boat people.
   The Vietnamese official also said negotiations with Washington
were continuing regarding the 94,000 former detainees of Vietnamese
``re-education'' camps who have been promised new homes in the
United States along with their families. He said this program would
involve roughly 500,000 people.
   He spoke to reporters after a two-day meeting in Geneva with
Western businessmen.

<HEAD>Ortega Says Washington Blocking Election Contributions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega accused the
Bush administration of blocking contributions from Europe and Latin
America to finance next year's national elections.
   ``The United States is obstructing the financing ... pressuring a
series of countries in Latin America and Europe so they won't
finance the electoral process,'' the Sandinista party newspaper
Barricada quoted Ortega as saying.
   The article Wednesday did not specify how the United States was
purportedly blocking such aid.
   The elections scheduled for Feb. 25 will cost an estimated $25
million, and foreign aid is essential to cover at least part of that
because of Nicaragua's severe economic crisis.
   Under Nicaraguan law, 50 percent of any U.S. contribution to
opposition candidates must go to the National Election Council,
which is to run the elections.
   The Bush administration wants Congress to appropriate $3 million
for the National Endowment for Democracy, a private non-profit
corporation funded largely by the U.S. government, for the campaign
of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the main opposition candidate.
   Ortega said if it wants to donate to Mrs. Chamorro's campaign, it
should appropriate $6 million and share it with the National
Elections Council.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
is running on a ticket with Virgilio Godoy of the Liberal
Independent Party for the National Opposition Union, a 14-party
coalition.
   ``The United States' problem is whether to maintain or not its
economic embargo of Nicaragua, but it can't obstruct the inflow of
funds to cover the elections,'' he added.
   Barricada did not say where Ortega made the remarks, but the
presidential press office said Ortega spoke Monday at a gathering of
farmers from cooperatives.
   Ortega also said that if U.S. congressmen want to come to
Nicaragua as election observers, they must first support a Central
American peace plan to dismantle the U.S.-supported Contra rebels by
Dec. 8.
   Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Guatemala agreed Aug. 7 to a plan to dismantle the Contra force.
   In exchange, Ortega has committed his Sandinista National
Liberation Front, a leftist organization in power for the past 10
years, to hold free and fair elections.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., one of four congressmen who met
Ortega on Sunday, said if the Sandinistas hold fair elections on
schedule, U.S.-Nicaraguan relations will improve regardless of who
wins.
   Otherwise, Edwards warned Nicaragua could expect more aid to the
Contras.
   The congressional delegation was joined by Janet Mullins, an
assistant secretary of state who heads the State Department's
congressional affairs office, the State Department said Wednesday.
   It was the first high-level meeting between the U.S.
administration and the Sandinistas since January 1985, when U.S.
officials accused Nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith. High level
contacts with Nicaragua were barred after that.

<HEAD>Rain Continues Across Texas And Oklahoma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cool air pushing southward across the center of the nation
dropped temperatures to record lows and generated enough rain on the
southern Plains to cause scattered flooding.
   Only a day earlier, the cold air had set off early snow in
Colorado, ranging from 2 inches in Denver to 6 inches in the nearby
foothills.
   Showers and thunderstorms were common Wednesday along and behind
a cold front from eastern Oklahoma across much of eastern, central
and southwestern Texas during the afternoon.
   Some residents of Guthrie, Okla., began leaving their homes
Wednesday afternoon as Cottonwood Creek climbed toward the top of
its banks. At one point, it rose 2 feet per hour. It was expected to
crest at about 28 feet, 6 feet above flood stage, during the night.
   ``We're gonna have a lot of flooding this time,'' said Gladys
Raffety, Civil Defense director. ``We've moved people out and set up
a shelter, we've notified all the businesses, set off the sirens and
told all the townspeople.''
   She said 27 residents in about 10 homes, in addition to about 15
businesses, will be affected by the flooding.
   About 25 residents of a homeless shelter in Midwest City, Okla.,
were evacuated overnight as nearby Crutcho Creek rose. The Crutcho
School was surrounded by water Wednesday morning but classes were
held as scheduled. Some rural roads were closed.
   One to 2 inches of rain fell in only two hours across parts of
southwestern Texas during the morning. Del Rio got three-quarters of
an inch of rain in only 30 minutes, causing some street flooding. In
addition to heavy rain, strong wind accompanied the thunderstorm in
Del Rio with one gust measured at 69 mph.
   Heavy rain overnight caused flooding in north-central Texas.
Beaver Creek was forecast to crest 8 feet above flood stage south of
Electra.
   During the 24 hours up to 7 a.m. EDT, 6.14 inches of rain fell at
Edmond, Okla; 5.6 near Webbers Falls, Okla.; 5.57 at Checotah,
Okla.; 5.02 at Piedmont, Okla.; 4.75 inches at Union City, Okla.;
4.70 at Olney, Texas, and 4.20 at Seymour, Texas.
   Since the rain began Monday, Scotland, Texas, received 7.05
inches of rain, and 6 inches had fallen on southern Wichita Falls,
Texas.
   Thunderstorms dumped two-thirds of an inch of rain in less than
one hour during the afternoon in Texas at College Station and
Houston.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered during the
afternoon from the lower Mississippi Valley across the southern
Appalachians, and along the mid- and southern Atlantic Coast.
   Rain fell over southern Michigan, and from western Illinois
across northern Missouri to Kansas.
   There was a sharp difference in temperatures across a cold front
that extended from the lower Ohio Valley to southern Texas.
Evansville, Ind., reached 84 during the afternoon, while 100 miles
away, Terre Haute, Ind., was at 63 degrees.
   Denver had a record low Wednesday of 33 degrees, and Scottsbluff,
Neb., posted a record 29. Cheyenne, Wyo., tied its record of 30;
Valentine, Neb., tied its record of 29; and Wichita Falls, Texas,
tied its record of 52.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Colorado Springs, Colo., to 98 at Harlingen and
Kingsville, Texas. Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 at
West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Thursday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
central and eastern Texas across eastern Oklahoma and the lower
Mississippi Valley to Tennessee. Rain was forecast from the lower
Ohio Valley across the southern Great Lakes to western New York
state, with scattered showers from eastern Pennsylvania and New
Jersey across eastern New York state to southern New England.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were expected from the mid
Atlantic states to the Carolinas, and over Alabama, eastern New
Mexico and western Texas. Widely scattered thunderstorms were
forecast over Georgia and Florida.
   Highs only in the mid to upper 50s were predicted over parts of
northern Illinois, northern Oklahoma and northeastern New Mexico; in
the 60s over northern Maine, and from the Great Lakes across the
lower Missouri Valley, Kansas and Oklahoma to northwestern Texas and
northeastern New Mexico; in the 90s over much of Florida, the
central Gulf Coast and the southern tip of Texas; between 90 and 102
from the interior valleys of California to the desert Southwest; and
in the 70s and 80s over much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Tax Breaks in Some Adoption Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush sent Congress legislation
Wednesday to provide tax breaks to parents who adopt children who
are difficult to place for reasons such as physical or mental
handicaps or age.
   ``We are here to take action to encourage more Americans to adopt
and to adopt children with physical, mental and emotional
disabilities,'' Bush said in a ceremony in the Roosevelt Room to
highlight the measures.
   Bush, who has an adopted grandchild of his own, said ``those who
adopt are giving far more than they receive.'' He said there are
30,000 ``special-needs'' children available for adoption.
   Bush first revealed his plan in his Feb. 9 address to Congress
outlining his budget proposals.
   His proposal would provide a $3,000 tax deduction to families for
costs incurred in adopting a special-needs child. Those expenses
largely are associated with legal costs, court fees, transportation
and social service reviews.
   A separate measure would provide additional benefits for federal
employees who adopt such children. During a four-year demonstration
program, federal employees would be eligible for reimbursement by
the government of up to $2,000 for expenses incurred in adopting a
special-needs child.
   As an alternative to abortion, Bush has proposed that mothers put
unwanted children up for adoption.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Wednesday
that her department will send a team to Poland to advise the new
government and Solidarity leadership on Western-style labor
relations and programs.
   ``We're ready as soon as they say to come,'' Mrs. Dole said after
announcing the plan in a speech to the Northeast-Midwest Leadership
Council. The visit probably will begin in a few weeks, she said.
   Mrs. Dole and her husband, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, visited
Poland last month and met with high-ranking officials in and out of
the government, including Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   The Labor Department visit will cost about $4 million, which will
come from the $100 million aid package President Bush has promised
Poland, Mrs. Dole said.
   It hasn't been decided who will be on the team but members
probably will include representatives of business and organized
labor along with department officials, she said.
   They will discuss such matters as job training and referral,
unemployment insurance and collective bargaining, she said. Other
details have not been worked out.
   Mrs. Dole said Polish leaders were eager for guidance during her
visit and voiced concern about how needed changes in their economy
would affect workers _ particularly if jobs are eliminated.
   ``There's no safety net for workers in Poland, and obviously
they're going through this very tough period, from essentially a
sheltered economy to a market economy,'' she said. ``Again and again
we had that message that they're counting on us.''

   President Bush on Wednesday proclaimed this

   Flanked by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, Bush spoke to a small group of
representatives of education associations and Congress members,
before signing the proclamation.
   ``Our nation's historically black colleges and universities have
long been a symbol of hope and a door to advancement for black
Americans,'' he said in the proclamation.
   Even though the law forbids schools to be segregated by race
today, these insitutions ```continue to maike vital contributions to
American education, adding to the diversity and caliber of academic
institutions in the United States.''
   Such institutions, Bush said, ``remind all Americans of our
obligation to uphold the principles of justice and equality
enshrined in our Constitution.''
   Noting his own longstanding financial contributions to the United
Negro College Fund, Bush said, ``I've been committed to historically
black colleges and universities for over 40 years ... and I am
determined to do everything in my power to assist and to help keep
black colleges strong.''

<HEAD>Israeli Ministers Clash Over Egyptian Plan, Army Eases Gunfire Orders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The four most powerful men in Israel's
government clashed at a closed-door meeting Wednesday over Egypt's
peace plan and a reported proposal to sponsor an opening meeting in
Cairo between Israelis and Palestinians.
   The army meanwhile revealed that soldiers patrolling the occupied
Gaza Strip have been authorized to fire with live ammunition on
unarmed masked youths who refuse to stop for questioning, in a new
effort to crack down on uprising activists.
   In Gaza, masked Palestinian assailants beat and stabbed to death
an Arab suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Arab
reports said. The army confirmed the death and said it was
investigating.
   Three Israeli dailies reported Egyptian plans to hold peace talks
in Cairo. The reports quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as saying
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt would soon issue invitations to
such a session in coordination with the United States.
   It would reportedly include a Palestinian delegation from the
occupied territories and an Israeli team, the Haaretz and Davar
newspapers said.
   American and Soviet delegations will also to be invited, the
English-language Jerusalem Post reported.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc
dismissed Mubarak's ideas in a speech in Tel Aviv, saying the plan,
``is not on our agenda. ... In my opinion it cannot help us.''
   Hours earlier, Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens argued
about the proposals at a meeting with Vice Premier Shimon Peres and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-leaning Labor Party,
Israel television reported.
   Peres said on TV he would support a preliminary meeting between
Israelis and Palestinians. ``What we have recommended is that there
be a meeting between us and the Palestinians,'' he said.
   Peres also indicated support for Egypt's 10-point peace plan that
backs Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupied
territories but also advocates trading land for peace.
   The occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank were captured by Israel
from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Labor has long supported territorial compromise with the Arabs as
a basis for a peace settlement. Likud is opposed, demanding Israeli
control over occupied territories.
   Accepting the Egyptian plan would ``allow the Palestinian
delegation to enter the eve of negotiations,'' Peres said. ``We need
a Palestinian side to begin negotiations.''
   Rabin said on Israel radio he would favor meetings with a
Palestinian delegation only if such meetings were based on the
Israeli peace initiative.
   ``If there is a reason for discussions (in the government), it
will be on the possibilities of a meeting of delegations, between
Israelis and Palestinians, based on the Israeli peace initiative,''
Rabin said.
   The new gunfire orders come after Rabin said last week that the
army needed more effective measures to combat masked Palestinian
militants who roam streets in the disputed lands, threatening Arabs
who do not obey uprising leaders.
   Under previous orders troops could only shoot at masked youths
carrying weapons, such as guns, knives or axes.
   Army officers blamed masked youths for a recent upsurge in
firebomb and stoning attacks on army patrols and a sharp increase in
the killing of Arabs suspected of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   At least 114 Palestinians have been killed by their brethren as
suspected collaborators during the 21-month-old revolt against
Israeli rule. The television said 84 died in the last three months.
   The latest was Jibara Abu Taha, 35, of Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip, who was fatally stabbed and beaten Wednesday by masked
youths, hospital offiicals and Arab reports said.
   Troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in clashes throughout the
seaside Gaza Strip, hospital officials said. The army was checking
the reports.
   At least 567 Palestinians have died in clashes with troops or
Israeli civilians during the uprising. Forty Israelis also have been
killed.

<HEAD>Soviets Said to Be Concerned Democracy `Moving Too Fast'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet elections are hampered by vague rules
and the fear of officials that democracy ``might be moving too
fast,'' says the chairman of the Federal Election Commission, who on
Wednesday detailed help his group is giving the Soviets to develop
their voting system.
   ``The fact is that it is hard to find the procedures written down
... Procedure was kind of being developed as they went along,''
Federal Election Commission Chairman Danny L. McDonald told a news
conference.
   McDonald, who led a commission team to the Soviet Union June
4-14, said that in his discussions with Soviet officials, ``time and
time again I got the distinct impression ... that even the most
ardent critics of the general process ... were concerned that the
process might be moving too fast.''
   The FEC chairman also said the Soviets disliked some aspects of
U.S. democracy.
   ``They are astounded at the amount of money that we spend'' and
``astounded by the close scrutiny that politicians have (to undergo)
in this country,'' McDonald said.
   Commission members, releasing a report on their visit, also found
that although Soviet leaders wanted to preserve the political
monopoly of the Communist Party, many Soviet politicians and
citizens favored a Western-style system with several parties.
   Members of the Soviet Central Electoral Commission ``are not
interested in many parties, they made that very clear, that there
was the Communist Party, and that there may be divisions within it,
but they are not looking at a whole variety of political parties,''
said Lee Ann Elliott, vice chairman of the U.S. commission.
   ``Many of the candidates'' elected to the Soviet parliament last
spring do favor a multiparty system, she said. ``But the people who
are running the elections at the moment worry that with more than
one party, they would not be able to function, if that happens too
fast.''
   The report dealt largely with balloting for the Congress of
Peoples Deputies last March, in which 2,250 legislators were
elected. Some Communist Party leaders were defeated and the results
were widely interpreted as an embarrassment for old-style party
apparatchiks.
   The report left the impression that Soviet democracy is now
developing so fast that it has produced confusion on virtually every
level, a feeling that was reflected in comments by team members at
the new conference.
   Procedures are poorly understood, and varied from place to place,
said McDonald.
   Soviet officials were ``not quite clear how far they wanted to go
and what the end result might be... there is a real battle going
on'' over who should control local elections in the 15 Soviet
republics, he said.
   No date has been set for those elections, and it is not clear
whether they will be run by the Central Electoral Commission or
local officials, commissioners said. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev announced last July that the local elections, which had
been postponed from the fall till next spring, might be held by the
end of this year.
   ``The latest word is that it might be in December,'' said
McDonald.
   ``In terms of the electoral process, they are going to have to
turn a lot over to the locals, because they simply don't have the
wherewithal at the national level,'' he said.
   The confusion was greatest outside of major population centers,
said Richard W. Soudriette, the director of the International
Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-profit private group that
helped sponsor the study.
   Soviet officials told the team that ``they did have quite a bit
of difficulty in some of the outlying republics. ... The farther
that you got away from the metropolitan areas, Leningrad, Moscow,
Kiev ... they increasingly encountered problems,'' said Soudriette.
   U.S.-Soviet cooperation will continue, the U.S. commissioners
said, as the Americans respond to Soviet requests for copies of
federal and state laws on elections, fund-raising and advertising.
   Late Tuesday, said McDonald, Soviet Embassy officials telephoned
the American commission to relay a request for a Soviet team to
observe local elections in New Jersey and Virginia.

   Felix Bloch, a U.S. diplomat suspected of
spying for Moscow, said in an interview that he plans to write a
book to set the facts straight.
   The Austrian daily Die Presse in its Thursday editions quoted
Bloch as saying he will write a book about the accusations that have
dogged him for months, but the newspaper gave no details.
   Asked if it was likely he would soon prove his innocence, Bloch
was quoted as answering, ``We will see.''
   The 54-year-old Austrian-born diplomat was suspended from the
State Department on June 22. No charges have been brought against
him, but he remains under investigation and surveillance by the FBI.
   In the interview, Bloch also rejected criticism he did not do
enough to stop technology transfer to the East bloc.
   ``I did everything in my power to stop the transfer, and I
succeeded,'' the former No. 2 envoy at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
was quoted as saying.

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab League committee resumed
efforts to end the bloodshed in Lebanon on Wednesday, six weeks
after suspending its mission because of Syrian intransigence.
   The official Saudi Press Agency said the foreign ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco met for 2{ hours Wednesday night.
Deliberations were to continue behind closed doors Thursday.
   The resumption of the effort was coupled with statements of
support from Arab and international powers, especially the United
States, the Soviet Union and France.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab leader, voiced
optimism Tuesday about the chances of a cease-fire in the latest
confrontation between Christians and a Moslem-Syrian alliance.
   Upon arriving in the Red Sea port of Jiddah for the meeting,
Morocco's Foreign Minister Abdel-Latif Filali said the committee has
secured ``clarifications'' and ``guarantees,'' but would not
elaborate.
   These, he told the Saudi news agency, would enable him, Algeria's
Bouallam Bilsayeh and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud al-Faisal ``to work
anew to reach the appropriate solutions for Lebanese national
reconciliation.''
   The three ministers met the last time in Algiers on July 31, when
they announced they were suspending their mission, mainly because
Syria would not accept a timetable for pulling its 40,000 troops
from Lebanon.
   The Syrians moved into Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate in 1976. But they have since become the Moslems' main
backers in the 14-year-old civil war against the Christians.
   Christian leaders have called for departure of Syrian troops as a
precondition for negotiating a settlement with the Moslems.
   After nearly four years of relative calm, fighting broke out in
March between Christian army units and the Syrians. At least 850
people have since been killed and more than 2,500 wounded.
   Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, on a visit to
neighboring North Yemen, said Wednesday: ``We should all work
together to help the committee implement the resolutions of the
Casablanca summit.'' He referred to the top-level Arab League
conference held in Morocco in May.
   That summit entrusted Fahd, Morocco's King Hassan II and Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid with finding a settlement in Lebanon
within six months.
   Diplomatic sources said the ministers, taking their cue from
Fahd's statements Tuesday, would issue a call for an immediate
cease-fire, ``the first important and necessary steps toward a
settlement.''
   Sources in Jiddah said the committee was considering a four-stage
peace plan comprising, a comprehensive cease-fire, lifting all land
and naval blockades, inviting parliament to talks on a ``charter of
political reform,'' and election of a president by the parliament
``within a few weeks.''

   Question: How do you get rid of three
bunkers, one of which is fortified with 48,000 tons of concrete and
built to withstand the largest projectile that could be fired from a
World War II battleship?
   Answer: Very slowly.
   When state officials began demolition on the bunkers Wednesday,
it was the start of a six-month leveling process. Officials have
undertaken the $4.5 million project to make way for a new wastewater
treatment plant that is part of the $6.1 billion Boston Harbor
cleanup.
   Massachusetts Water Resources Authority officials said it was the
first time such bunkers have been demolished.
   The Fort Dawes bunkers date back to 1942. During World War II,
all the islands within Broad Sound, the main shipping channel into
Boston Harbor, contained manned forts. After the war ended in 1945,
the Navy used the bunkers for storage.
   The first of the bunkers was blown up with 9,200 pounds of
dynamite at 5:25 p.m.
   ``The initial indication is that it was a successful blast,''
said Chuck Allen, a construction crew worker at the site. ``We hope
it broke into pieces of about three feet in diameter but we won't
know until we start excavating.''
   More than 40 men were positioned on Deer Island here Wednesday
afternoon setting out blasting mats and dirt on the sides of the
bunker to contain flying rock from the explosion in preparation for
the demolition.
   Because of the matting, all that was visible was a large puff of
smoke and a quick blast was heard.
   ``It's a huge job, we're here for a year even if it won't take
that long,'' said Mike Bissonette, construction superintendent for
J.M. Cashman Inc., of Quincy, which began initial work on the site
in early August.
   But Bissonette said the 48,000-ton Battery 105 will likely be the
most difficult bunker to demolish. The roof is fortified with 17
feet of reinforced concrete and the bunker itself has alternating
earth and concrete walls of between four and nine feet thick, with
45 feet of packed earth at its base.
   The third bunker that will be blown up is a personnel control
room, once the central command post for the entire complex. It
consists of 16 feet of reinforced concrete.
   The bunkers, some buried up to 20 feet, are located on Deer
Island, a remote point on Boston Harbor at the tip of this city just
outside Boston. Acres of land surrounding the bunkers were fenced
off in preparation for the explosion.
   At present, Deer Island is both a minimum security prison and a
sewage treatment plant. Once a natural island, it has since been
filled in and is accessible by car.
   The island will accommodate what is to become the world's second
largest sewage treatment plant. The existing treatment plant and
another in Boston are responsible for much of Boston Harbor's
pollution, discharging 70 tons of sludge and 400 million gallons of
treated wastewater every day.
   The new plant, scheduled to be constructed between 1990 and 1999,
will treat 1.3 billion gallons of sewage a day and remove about 90
percent of the pollutants in the water.

<HEAD>Announces Anti-Inflation Program; 1000s Stage Anti-Government Rallies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia announced Wednesday it
will soon introduce a new program to battle a 900 percent annual
inflation rate, the highest in Europe.
   The federal government acted as about 11,000 workers staged
rallies in two Belgrade industrial suburbs to protest steeply
declining living standards and demand a halt in runaway inflation.
   The state news agency Tanjug said new measures will liberalize
imports of cheaper foreign goods to compete with expensive domestic
products, but will apparently not include price or wage freezes. It
did not say when the measures would begin.
   The government also foresees closing all unprofitable state
companies, which would probably lead to huge layoffs, Tanjug said.
About 30 percent of the 6.8 million Yugoslavs who now hold jobs in
state companies operating at a loss could face dismissal.
   Besides inflation, communist Yugoslavia is burdened by a $19
billion foreign debt, a 17 percent unemployment rate and an alarming
increase in labor and ethnic unrest.
   About 10,000 workers at Rakovica chanted anti-government slogans
on Wednesday and hailed Serbian authorities for their support.
Speakers demanded immediate anti-inflation action by the federal
government.
   In Zemun, about 1,000 Zmaj tractor factory workers sent a ``final
warning to the government'' to brake plummeting living standards,
now officially at the mid-1960s level, Belgrade radio reported.
   The rallies appeared to be part of a campaign by leaders of
Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, to unseat the
federal government and Premier Ante Markovic.
   When he became premier in March, Markovic, a Croat, said he would
resign if all six republics do not approve his radical,
market-oriented reforms.
   Economists in this capital say Serbian leaders, headed by
President Slobodan Milosevic, fear a loss of popularity if living
standards drop further and favor short-term austerity measures such
as freezing prices.
   Serbian politicians claim Markovic's economic policies favor
Yugoslavia's economically most developed regions, Slovenia and
Croatia, at the expense of poorer republics such as Serbia.
   The communist leaderships of the republics, divided between
reformers and conservatives, have been unable to agree on whether to
introduce an open, free-market economy and more political pluralism
as a way out of the crisis.
   Serbia's Communist Party went on the record Wednesday as opposing
the political pluralism adopted in the liberal northern region of
Slovenia and advocated by reformists in the remaining republics.

   People seeking treatment in emergency rooms in
many areas of the country are finding a medical gridlock that keeps
patients waiting hours, even days, for hospital beds, emergency
physicians said Wednesday.
   ``We are on the verge of a major crisis,'' said Dr. Stephan G.
Lynn, chairman of an American College of Emergency Physicians task
force on hospital overcrowding and director of emergency medicine at
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City.
   The pressure on hospital emergency rooms is coming from the
growing AIDS epidemic, increased illegal drug use and an estimated
37 million Americans who have no health insurance and for whom the
emergency room is often their only entry to the health care system,
he said.
   This burden is exacerbated by medical staff shortages, financial
pressures that are leading a growing number of hospitals to close
their doors, and an inadequate number of nursing home beds, Lynn
said.
   In some cases, patients in emergency rooms in New York City have
waited for in-patient hospital beds for more than a week, Lynn said.
And though the problem is most critical in the Northeast and on the
West Coast, a survey shows emergency rooms across the country are
backed up.
   In a survey, 41 state chapters of the American College of
Emergency Physicians reported overcrowding problems in emergency
rooms in their states. Nine reported no backup problems: Idaho,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oregon, Utah and Wyoming.
   ``This is affecting everybody, from the drug abuser to the
homeless to the business executive,'' said Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh, who
sits on the college's board and is chief of emergency medicine at
the Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass.
   Lynn and Yeh said it is not known whether extended emergency room
stays have led to more patient deaths, but they said the quality of
care these patients receive often is marginal.
   ``The lights never go out. The noise never turns off. Meals are
served, but on an irregular basis and rarely are as palatable or
warm as they are on the in-patient side,'' Lynn said.
   ``The patient has no access to a telephone, and access to a TV is
beyond thought,'' he said. ``The patient is lucky if they are able
to see their visitors, and they spend their entire stay lying on a
stretcher with a mattress that is two-inches thick.''
   ``That level of care is inadequate,'' he said. ``Emergency
departments were not designed and are not equipped or staffed to
provide intensive care services or in-patient services.''
   At Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, the emergency room
is so overcrowded it is closed to ambulance traffic 25 percent of
the time, said Dr. Robert Hockberger, chairman of the Department of
Emergency Medicine.
   ``That results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to
find emergency departments that are open,'' he said. ``This is
starting to affect not only the poor barrio gang member who got
stabbed in the midst of a crack deal, but it's also affecting the
50-year-old, quarter-million-dollar-a-year businessman.''
   Cities on the two coasts have been hit most severely by the
overcrowding problem, but the college's chapters in West Virginia,
North Carolina, Alabama and Alaska said ``overcrowding is not simply
a problem of this nation's cities,'' according to a draft report by
the task force.
   ``It is ultimately going to come down to the public at large to
decide: If you want care when you want it and where you want it,
you're going to have to put in the resources for it,'' said Yeh.
``If you don't put in the resources, you're going to have to change
your expectations and expect the wait, and expect the fact that
you're going to have limited care and limited access.''

<TEXT>
   The president of Namibia's independence
movement will end a 30-year exile and return to his homeland despite
the assassination of another nationalist leader, officials said
Wednesday.
   A Namibian newspaper on Wednesday said callers claiming to
represent a white supremacist group claimed responsibility for the
killing Tuesday of Anton Lubowski, an official of the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the nationalist group, will return
Thursday even though there have been threats against his life, the
organization said in a statement. Nujoma has lived principally in
Angola during his self-imposed exile.
   Posters appeared in Windhoek on Wednesday with a photograph of
Nujoma and a target superimposed on his face.
   Nujoma is returning to Namibia to take charge of his group's
campaign for elections scheduled for early November, a prelude to
Namibian independence from South Africa.
   South Africa, which ruled Namibia 74 years, has agreed to
implement independence in the territory under United Nations
supervision. Independence is expected early next year.
   Lubowski, a Namibian lawyer and the nationalist group's
top-ranking white official, was shot in the head outside his home in
a Windhoek suburb.
   The 37-year-old Lubowksi was widely known abroad, and his killing
was condemned by officials from the United States, Britain, West
Germany, Norway, Sweden, amd Zambia, among others.
   Gwen Lister, editor of The Namibian, said she received two phone
calls Wednesday from men saying they belonged to the White Wolves
and that the white supremacist organization killed Lubowski.
   Ms. Lister said one of the callers also threatened her for
supporting the the South-West Africa People's Organization, the
black-dominated movement that waged a 23-year guerrilla war against
South African rule of Namibia.
   Men identifying themselves as Whites Wolves have carried out
several attacks on blacks and anti-apartheid activists in South
Africa. Police say they have not been able to prove the organization
exists.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization's election
directorate, of which Lubowski was a member, said in a statement
that ``the deliberate and well-calculated killing'' was intended to
create instability in the period prior to the elections.
   ``Such a cowardly act is part of the notorious scheme aimed at
scaring Namibian patriots from giving a hero's welcome to their
national leader (Nujoma),'' the statement said. ``It is also aimed
at frightening the white community in Namibia, which has been
increasingly joining SWAPO over the past weeks and months.''
   Fighting between nationalist guerrillas and the South African-led
security forces ended in April. Since then, there have been only
isolated violent incidents.
   Lubowski died only hours after Namibia's nine largest political
parties, including the South-West Africa People's Organization,
signed a code of conduct for the elections that prohibits violence.
   ``I wish to assure Namibians that their desire for a peaceful
transition to independence, too long delayed, cannot and will not be
frustrated by the increasingly desperate acts of a few extremists,''
said Martti Ahtisaari, head of the U.N. operation in Namibia.
   The South African-appointed administrator of Namibia, Louis
Pienaar, said authorities ``will not allow circumstances of anarchy
to develop in the run-up to the election.'' He promised tight
security for Nujoma's return.
   Pienaar said the assassination was part of a ``spiral of
violence'' that included the fatal stoning of a white police officer
during the weekend by a crowd of blacks.
   Lubowski announced in 1984 that he had joined the legal political
wing of South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Since then, right-wing newspapers often ridiculed him in stories
and cartoons critical of the leftist-oriented organization. He had
received numerous death threats.
   Police offered what they called a ``substantial'' reward for
information about the killing, but did not disclose a specific
figure.

   With former Miss America host Bert Parks
at the helm as emcee, a 105-foot, blue-and-white tugboat was crowned
the nation's most beautiful tug on Wednesday.
   As part of a day-long celebration of the resurgence of the city's
waterfront section, 13 tugboats chugged into New York Harbor for the
first Tugboat Beauty Contest.
   The nautical show coincided with this year's Miss America
Pageant, which will be televised live from Atlantic City on
Saturday. It also was used to promote the often-overlooked tugboat
industry.
   ``It's a first for me,'' said the 74-year-old Parks, who has
hosted everything from mother-daughter beauty contests to cat and
dog competitions.
   Parks hosted the Miss America Pageant for 25 years.
   ``Beauty is all in the eye of the beholder, whether it's a cat or
a tugboat or a lady,'' he said. ``You have to have a sense of humor
about it.''
   Each of the aquatic beauties sauntered down the ``aisle,'' a
channel from Jersey City leading into the harbor, as Parks, who did
not have a chance to croon the popular Miss America theme, belted
out the boat's vital statistics to more than 1,000 onlookers.
   The boats were judged by Jersey City Mayor Gerald McCann, Hudson
County Executive Robert Janiszewski and a representative from the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The judges looked at
their trim, sparkle, manueverability, charm and overall appearance.
   Once in the harbor, each tugboat turned around to demonstrate her
maneuverability and then strutted her stuff back to the starting
line.
   And when it was over, the blue, white and yellow-trimmed Rebecca
P. was crowned the nation's most beautiful tugboat.
   Rebecca P., a 9-year-old tug from Poling Transportation of Staten
Island, N.Y., won a flag hailing her as the most beautiful tug and
$2,500 for her crew.
   Parks said the contestants and timing of the pageant _ just three
days before Miss America 1990 is crowned _ did not bother him.
   ``This business is so ... strange,'' he said. ``I guess that's
the fascinating part of it. You never know what's going to happen
next.''

   Syrian and Christian forces battled in and
around Beirut on Wednesday, killing three people and wounding 17.
Arab mediators met in an attempt to revive their stalled peace
effort.
   Police said the casualties raised the toll from six months of
fighting to at least 850 killed and 2,545 wounded.
   A spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations, said
Syrians and Christians clashed with artillery, mortars and machine
guns in Beirut, north Lebanon and the mountains on the eastern edge
of the Christian heartland.
   He said residential sectors of the capital, badly hammered since
fighting erupted March 8, were spared in the sporadic clashes.
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria met in
Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port of Jiddah for 2{ hours late Wednesday,
resuming a peace effort that ran out of steam six weeks ago.
Deliberations were to continue behind closed doors on Thursday.
   The envoys on July 31 blamed Syria for refusing to accept a
timetable for pulling its 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, in what appeared to be a
compromise proposal, said even a partial Syrian withdrawal would
open the way for negotiations on political reforms to end the
14-year-old civil war.
   The Syrians, who consider Lebanon vital to their strategic
defense against Israel, have refused to withdraw.
   Informed sources in Jiddah, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Arab mediation committee was considering a peace plan that
calls for a cease-fire and the lifting of blockades by both sides.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily, the leftist As-Safir as well
as Moslem and Christian radio stations said the committee will
declare a cease-fire shortly.
   Several cease-fires called by the Arab League and others have
collapsed amid fierce artillery battles that have driven an
estimated 90 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people from the city.
   An-Nahar said the nationalist front, a coalition of 18 leftist
and Moslem groups allied with Syria and Iran, was expected to
facilitate the committee's effort by proclaiming a cease-fire in
``the coming hours.''
   The front, formed more than a month ago in an attempt by Syria
and Iran to intensify the pressure on Aoun, generally reflects
Syrian President Hafez Assad's policy in Lebanon.
   But sources in Damascus, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
no cease-fire announcement was imminent and did not indicate any
significant shift in the Syrians' stand.
   An-Nahar said the nationalist front will also lift the maritime
blockade imposed by Syria on the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
in mid-March.
   As-Safir, which is close to Assad's government, said the Arab
foreign ministers meeting in Jiddah will discuss ``complete
stabilization'' of a cease-fire to pave the way for talks between
the warring factions.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, said he was prepared to accept
``radical reforms'' to the political system that has given the
Christians the upper hand in running Lebanon since independence from
France in 1943.
   When the French pulled out, the Christians were considered the
majority. But now the Moslems comprise an estimated 55 percent of
the country's 4 million people and want equal political power.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrians,
whom, he views as an occupying power.
   Syria sent its troops into Lebanon in June 1976 under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun charges they have abrogated that
mandate by siding with the Moslems.

   Nicaragua has denied visas to members of a
privately funded delegation of Americans who wanted to monitor
prepartions for its February national elections, the embassy said
Wednesday.
   ``Our elections are not something to be manipulated by
individuals and groups interested in furthering conflict,'' charge
d'affairs Leonor Arguella de Huper said in announcing that the
Commission on Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua would not receive
the requested visas.
   The embassy said L. Brent Bozell, president of the conservative
World Freedom Foundation, sponsor of the commission, had just
returned from a visit to Contra camps in Honduras and expressed his
support for the Contras.
   ``It is known that the World Freedom Foundation's sole objective
is to discredit our electoral process and create conditions for a
revival of the Contra war,'' Mrs. Huper said.
   Former Democratic Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, a co-chairman
of the commission, called Mrs. de Huper's statement ``sheer
nonsense.''
   ``This is a bipartisan commission whose sole interest was in
observing and helping to promote free and fair elections in
Nicaragua. It has no other purpose whatsoever,'' Nelson said.
   Commission director Marc Ryan said visas were sought for Nelson;
commission co-chairman Curtin Winsor Jr., a former ambassador to
Costa Rica in the Reagan administration; Sergio Bendixen, a
Democratic political consultant; Alan Keyes, a former assistant
secretary of state in the Reagan administration; and Elaine Kamarck,
a Democratic political activist.
   Ryan, who said he and Bozell also had wanted visas, said the
group might ask Mrs. de Huper to reconsider.
   ``I find it terribly disturbing that the Sandinistas are saying,
basically, you must be vocally anti-Contra to be allowed to observe
this election,'' Bozell said.
   ``As far as I am concerned, I bent over backward trying to find a
glimmer of hope in these elections, but this action by the
Sandinistas is a major nail in the coffin on that expectation.''
   The action came just days after the United States and Nicaragua
had their first high-level contact in nearly five years.
   Janet Mullins, an assistant secretary of state, joined in a
meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. Ms. Mullins joined
a congressional delegation for the weekend meeting, which was part
of a visit to several Central American countries, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   High-level contacts were barred by President Reagan in January
1985 after officials accused Nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith
during six-month-long talks. The Bush administration has not
observed a similar policy.

<HEAD>Rockets Kills One at Kabul Airport, Fighting Reported in North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MACFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A barrage of rockets crashed into Kabul
airport Wednesday after a weeklong lull, killing at least one person
and damaging airplanes, including a U.N peacekeepers' jet, officials
and witnesses said.
   Also Wednesday, a commander for the U.S.-backed guerrillas
announced his fighters have started a northern offensive to cut
Soviet supply routes to Kabul.
   In the south, guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1,000-vehicle
army convoy with winter provisions for the country's second largest
city, Kandahar.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 14 rockets
struck in and around the capital's joint military-civilian airport.
However, airport workers and other witnesses put the number at 25 or
more.
   More than 300 people have been killed and 700 injured in almost
daily rocket attacks since June by the guerrillas.
   Amani said shrapnel from one explosion Wednesday killed a
firefighter at the airport's fire station.
   He said one rocket also hit a mosque in the neighborhood of Bibi
Mahro, next to the airport, killing a priest and wounding four other
people.
   However, several residents interviewed by reporters around the
mosque said no rockets fell, and nobody was killed or injured.
   Airport workers and other witnesses said at least one soldier was
killed and three wounded, but Amani said he had no information about
those casualties.
   Amani said shrapnel from another rocket knocked holes in the
fuselage of a U.N. jet and also damaged a Tupolov 154 jet belonging
to Ariana, the national airlines.
   U.N. officials said they patched the holes with special metal
tape. They said no one was injured by the rocket, however.
   The plane arrived carrying Benom Sevann, spokesman for U.N.
observers monitoring the 10-year-old civil war between the
Soviet-backed Afghan government and the Moslem guerrillas, who are
also backed by Pakistan.
   Airport workers also said a Soviet-designed Antonov-12 caught
fire when it was hit by a rocket while taxiing toward the runway.
They said the crew jumped off.
   However, a government spokesman said the plane had not burned.
   The Marxist government uses the planes to ferry military
equipment, food and other supplies to provincial capitals around the
country because the guerrillas control the roads in many rural areas.
   In neighboring Pakistan, Western diplomatic sources said a huge
Afghan army convoy of trucks, tanks and armored personnel carriers
from the Soviet Union was turned back from Kandahar by fierce
guerrilla attacks.
   Its original size reportedly was 1,000 to 1,300 vehicles, but
diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
insurgents may have destroyed more than 110 vehicles.
   Afghan government officials said the convoy was carrying
provisions for 200,000 people in besieged Kandahar.
   The convoy had pushed to within 36 miles of Kandahar before it
was forced back, the diplomatic sources said.
   At latest report, the column had retreated 33 miles and split
into two, with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to Kandahar.
   Meanwhile, guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud sent a radio
message to Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, saying his
forces were attacking four areas along the key Salang Highway north
of Kabul, including the government's biggest air force base at
Bagram.
   ``His message gave us no details about casualties, but he said
the mujahedeen (guerrillas) gained some very big successes,
especially at Salang,'' said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman of the
Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group.
   The diplomatic sources said intense fighting continued around the
eastern garrison town of Khost, with high casualties on both sides.
   The guerrillas have failed to capture a major Afghan city since
the last Soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on Feb. 15. The
Soviets still supply the government with weapons.

<TEXT>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, Calif., will
sell 15 paintings, mostly impressionist works, in London in late
November, and revenues from the sale are expected to surpass $18
million, Sotheby's aunction house said Wednesday.
   A number of the works hung at Sutton Place, the English Tudor
mansion once occupied by the famous oilman. He was worth $4 billion
when he died there in 1976 at age 83.
   The most important work is ``Breton Boy with a Goose'' by the
French artist Paul Gauguin, painted in 1889. It will be sold on Nov.
28, and is estimated to be worth at least $8 million.
   Other works include a standing nude by Pierre Bonnard, dancers by
Edgar Degas and a landscape by Claude Monet.
   Lori Star, press officer at the Malibu museum, said in a
telephone interview that the paintings to go on sale ``have been
overshadowed by more recent acquisitions.''
   The paintings will go on tour in Stockholm, Sweden; Tokyo; Los
Angeles; and New York before they are sold.
   Fiona James, Sotheby's spokeswoman, said most of the paintings
were purchased by Getty himself and reflect his own taste.

<HEAD>Peace Conference Begins Amid Violence in Sri Lanka</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lankan political parties and Tamil
rebel groups opened a conference Wednesday to seek a way to end this
land's ethnic violence that has killed more than 16,000 people.
   However, the same day, reports said 27 more people were killed
and 13 government buildings were burned in the strife.
   A government spokesman said 21 of the country's 27 recognized
political parties attended the conference in Colombo. President
Ranasinghe Premadasa said it was expected to continue through Oct.
12.
   ``I abhor violence. I believe in non-violence. I wish to make a
special appeal to all those outside the democratic process to return
to the mainstream, join the dialogue to jointly search for solutions
to the country's problems,'' Premadasa said in his opening statement
to the conference.
   The appeal was apparently aimed at Sinhalese radicals of the
People's Liberation Front, an ultranationalist guerrilla group
trying to overthrow the government.
   The front boycotted the conference organized by the
Sinhalese-dominated government. However, Bradman Weerakoon, foreign
affairs adviser to the president, said Premadasa was confident the
radicals would attend later meetings.
   More than 16,000 people have died in six years of ethnic violence
on this Indian Ocean island. At least 5,000 of them have been killed
in the two-year-old Sinhalese uprising. A revolt by minority Tamil
secessionists in the northeast has claimed the other lives.
   Delegates at Wednesday's meeting included members of five Tamil
guerrilla groups, among them the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a
leading group that continued fighting despite a failing peace accord
in 1987.
   ``All political parties and groups who are represented at this
meeting have placed as their first priority the cessation of
violence and restoration of peace and normalcy in our country,''
Premadasa told the 69 conference delegates.
   He said he would consider proposals made by some parties to
restore peace, including formation of a provisional government,
constitutional reforms and replacement of the presidential system
with a British-style parliamentary government.
   ``I am not adverse to change if change is to bring forth desired
results. I believe that we must search for new solutions to the new
problems we face,'' he said.
   Less than an hour before the conference began, a car bomb
exploded in a parking lot in downtown Colombo, shattering some
windows but causing no casualties, police said. No one claimed
responsibility, but police blamed the front.
   A government statement said suspected front members burned 13
government buildings Wednesday in Moneragala district, 100 miles
east of Colombo.
   It said nine bodies of young Sinhalese men were found Wednesday
in Kurunegala district, 85 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Such killings have also been blamed on the Sinhalese opponents of
the government.
   Also Wednesday, four civilians were killed in central Sri Lanka;
six bodies were found near a government-owned housing complex in
Moratuwa, a Colombo suburb; and five burned bodies of Sinhalese
women were found in central Kandy district, the statement said.
   It also said Sinhalese radicals shot and killed three policemen
on a foot patrol Wednesday near Galnewa village, 100 miles north of
Colombo.
   The violence broke out in 1983 with a Tamil insurrection in the
northeast. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, claim the government deprives them of jobs and education.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.
   Indian peacekeeping forces came to Sri Lanka under the 1987
accord, but they too have been caught up in the fighting. Sri Lankan
officials say the Indians have agreed to pull out their troops by
the end of the year.

   A train bound for Havana jumped the rails
Wednesday, injuring eight passengers, the Cuban government news

   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, said the train was
traveling from the western province of Pinar del Rio to the Cuban
capital.
   The report quoted Cuban Interior Ministry official Jose Rene
Rocubert as saying one passenger was seriously hurt.
   The dispatch gave no reason for the derailment and did not say
exactly where it occurred.
   Prensa Latin said two train accidents last month killed a total

   Senate Democrats, courting a showdown with the
White House, said Wednesday that President Bush's $7.9 billion
anti-drug package was inadequate and vowed to press their own more
costly plan unless Republicans agreed to major expansions.
   The Democrats made their decision in a closed strategy session as
drug coordinator William Bennett continued his defense of the
administration's plan, saying the blueprint was ``our best
assessment'' of what is needed to combat illegal drugs.
   ``Is it impossible to spend more? No,'' Bennett told a House
committee, but added it is unclear where more money could be used
effectively. The Democrats want to up the spending by $2.2 billion.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Democrats
have offered to negotiate on a compromise with the White House and
Republicans.
   ``The president's plan must be improved,'' Mitchell told
reporters. ``Its goals must be set higher. Its strategies to meet
the goals must be changed.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas met with Mitchell and
said afterward that the two sides hoped to begin talks soon.
   ``My own view is that the Bush plan does not need any changes,
but if there are good suggestions and if we get some agreement
between the president and Congress, then obviously that is fine,''
Dole said.
   Democrats emerged from their meeting saying the proposal by Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to add the $2.2 billion to Bush's total by
cutting a half percent from the budgets of other programs had their
support.
   ``If we can't find that in everybody's department, we're not
serious about fighting the war on drugs,'' said Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., predicting that most Democrats would fall into line behind
Byrd's plan.
   ``I think the Democrats want to do something on drugs and they
want to do it now,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Since last week when Bush proposed his $7.9 billion plan to
combat drug abuse next year, Democrats and Republicans have sought
tactical advantages on an issue that polls show is of intense public
concern.
   The White House has signaled it is willing to try to find middle
ground, although the Office of Management and Budget issued a
statement on Tuesday saying that top administration officials would
urge a veto if Democrats passed their own plan intact.
   Elsewhere in Congress, a former worker in a Colombian drug cartel
warned that embattled South American drug dealers might lash out
with terror attacks in the United States.
   ``Some of you may be the victims of attacks and maybe the
president of the United States would be the victim of drug
traffickers,'' Diego Viafara Salinas told the Senate permanent
subcommittee on investigations in comments that paralleled remarks
made earlier in the week by an FBI official.
   He testified behiond a screen to shield his identity while
bodyguards scanned the hearing room.
   Democrats initially criticized the president for proposing new
programs without specifying where much of the money was supposed to
come from. Some said new taxes were needed for any serious anti-drug
effort.
   Byrd, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, surprised
Republicans on Tuesday by advancing a proposal to add $3.9 billion
to the $6.2 billion Congress had planned to spend on anti-drug
programs. He proposed raising the money by trimming defense and many
domestic programs by 0.575 percent.
   The $10.1 billion total in Byrd's package would be $2.2 billion
beyond the president's figure. His additional spending would include
$1.1 billion for treatment and prevention programs and $1 billion
for new prisons.
   Republicans, however, say the Byrd plan is too expensive and
would take an unacceptable $1.8 billion bite out of the Pentagon's
budget.
   Bennett told the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and
Control Wednesday that the president's proposal represents ``our
best assessment'' of what is needed.
   The strategy seeks $925 million for treatment, a 53 percent
increase over this year's amount, and $1.2 billion for prevention
and education, a 25 percent increase.
   Bennett said some efforts don't need more money, just more
stringent policies.
   ``School policy _ clear, firm school policy _ is probably about
the most effective thing you can do, and it costs no more to have a
sound policy that to have an unsound policy,'' he said.
   Bennett also defended the way Bush's plan distributes money: 70
percent for law enforcement and 30 percent for education and
treatment. Byrd's plan would be split 53-47 respectively.
   ``It is a function of what we think needs to be done, what needs
to be done now, and what needs to be done by the federal
government,'' Bennett said.
   Meanwhile, Viafara Salinas, a one-time Colombian cartel health
officer who is a federally protected witness, warned senators that
South American drug dealers could spread terror within the United
States and possibly attack officials here if the crackdown
intensifies.
   Another witness testifying from behind a screen, David Wheeler,
the Washington-born son of a U.S. Foreign Service officer, said
wealthy Bolivians have a cocaine cartel that rivals those of
Colombia.
   He said he gained the confidence of cocaine dealers after living
20 years in Mexico, growing marijuana and shipping it to the United
States.
   The cocaine cartels, seeking new ways to smuggle the drug into
this country, are considering buying surplus diesel submarines,
Wheeler testified. He said they are buying land on both sides of the
Southwest border with an eye to tunneling and piping in narcotics.

   Hungary said on Wednesday its agreements
limiting movement of East bloc citizens are out of step with its
human rights commitments and that the government will seek to revise
them.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ferenc Somogyi also said Hungary will
continue to dismantle border barriers but does not plan to be a
springboard to the West.
   Somogyi said Budapest's decision this week to allow the exodus of
more than 12,000 East Germans to the West was ``a unique step.''
   An East German Communist Party newspaper, the youth daily Junge
Welt, on Wednesday for the first time called for a look at why East
Germans flee their homeland.
   However, the main party daily, Neues Deutschland, continued its
criticism of West Germany, which it contends ``lured the refugees
West.'' It also criticized Hungary for allowing their ``unsanctioned
departure.''
   In Austria, border authorities said the number of East Germans
crossing from Hungary en route to West Germany climbed to 12,545
since the freedom convoy began at midnight Sunday.
   Bavarian border police gave a similar estimate and said the push
to the West had peaked.
   Polish television meanwhile reported that about 50 East Germans
seeking a new life in the West took refuge in the West German
embassy in Warsaw.
   The Telexpress TV news program showed pictures of the refugees,
including children at play in the embassy courtyard.
   They are following dozens of others who recently sought refuge at
West German embassies in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Budapest's reform-minded government, risking censure from its
Warsaw Pact allies and courting Western praise, allowed the East
Germans to leave for West Germany via Austria.
   Its decision to defy an ally and work together with West Germany
to let the East Germans emigrate marks the first time a Warsaw Pact
country has cooperated with a NATO nation to help citizens of an
allied country resettle in the West.
   But in Prague, about 300 refugees gave up Tuesday and Wednesday
and left the embassy compound after East Berlin promised they would
be allowed to apply to emigrate legally, the Czechoslovak news
agency CTK reported. It said up to 150 East Germans remain inside.
   Polish media have reported on the exodus, but there has been no
comment from the Warsaw government, the first East bloc
administration led by non-communists. Hungary also is pressing for
major reforms.
   East Germany remains one of the most rigidly controlled states
and refuses to consider demands for change sweeping the communist
world.
   But on Wednesday Junge Welt said even a ``minority'' of healthy
young people vital to the economy should not be enticed away by
better living standards.
   ``How do we make this country indisputably the focal point for
dedication and happiness for every individual? How do we make it a
homeland for even more people in which one accepts burdens and from
which one is not lured away just by shop windows full of bananas or
glossy travel guides?'' it asked.
   East German refugees say they were tired of political repression
and economic stagnation.
   In a formal protest Tuesday, East Germany accused Hungary of
violating bilateral agreements and interfering with East German
sovereignty. Czechoslovakia and Romania also were critical.
   Hungary's Foreign Ministry, in a terse note carried by the
official MTI news agency, said Wednesday it would ``extensively
contradict'' the East German accusations. It did not say when.
   As part of its reforms, Hungary became the first Soviet bloc
nation to join the U.N. convention on refugees' rights. It came into
force June 12, and officials have said they plan to change domestic
laws and international agreements to dovetail with the accord.
   With its release of the East German refugees, Hungary suspended a
1969 agreement with East Germany which in effect stipulated that no
East German could leave for the West without East Berlin's
permission.
   Somogyi said similar agreements with other Warsaw Pact countries
``are no longer in line with our newly assumed international
responsibilities.''
   But officials have insisted for months that Hungary does not
intend to become a ``springboard'' to the West.
   Somogyi said anybody _ including citizens of Soviet bloc nations
_ could apply for refugee status and would be given a fair hearing.
He emphasized that the current situation was temporary and limited
to East Germans.
   ``This decision to allow East German citizens to leave for the
West was a unique step,'' he said. ``It pertains only to East German
citizens ... and in no way can it be interpreted as applying to
citizens of other Warsaw Pact nations.''
   He said Hungary in the future will work under the criteria of the
Geneva Convention, forbidding signatories to return to their
countries refugees whose ``life or freedom would be threatened on
account of his race, religion, nationality ... or political
opinion.''
   Signatories also can only allow the exit of refugees welcomed by
a third country. West Germany recognizes all East Germans as
citizens, but few nations are willing to accept refugees from
Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, which have also been slow to
introduce reform.
   Officials have acknowledged that tensions with Romania were
partially responsible for Hungary's decision to join the convention.
Hungary began sheltering Romanian refugees in January 1988, breaking
an agreement with its southeastern neighbor to send back citizens
seeking asylum.
   About 17,000 Romanian nationals have fled, most of them ethnic
Hungarians, in the first instance of one Warsaw Pact country giving
permanent sanctuary to citizens of another on grounds of alleged
persecution.

   Former rebel leader Alfonso Robelo
returned to Nicaragua on Wednesday after seven years' exile and said
he will take part in the election campaign against the leftist
Sandinista government.
   ``Not only are we going to win, we are going to sweep,'' Robelo
predicted at a news conference at the headquarters of the opposition
Nicaraguan Democratic Movement Party. He had just arrived from Costa
Rica.
   Robelo is the latest of several former and current members of the
Nicaraguan Resistance directorate who have returned to Nicaragua
from exile. All have said they will take part in general elections
set for Feb. 25.
   A chemical engineer and businessman, Robelo co-founded the Social
Democratic Movement in 1978 with businesspeople, industrialists and
professionals opposed to then-President Anastasio Somoza.
   The movement is one of 14 parties now making up the National
Opposition Union, the main anti-Sandinista bloc in the campaign.
   Robelo was one of the five original members of the provisional
government junta after Somoza fled the country in July 1979 and the
Sandinistas came to power. He resigned from the junta in April 1980
over disagreements with Sandinista policies and left the country in
March 1982.
   Robelo was elected to the directorate of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, an umbrella group of exiled anti-Sandinista group, in
May 1987. He resigned in January 1988, when President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica ordered that Nicaraguans living in Costa Rica must
renounce membership in armed anti-Sandinista groups.
   On Wednesday, Robelo drove across the Nicaraguan-Costa Rican
border and arrived at party headquarters alone in the early
afternoon in a red sedan, apologizing for being late and saying he
had gotten lost.
   ``I have not come looking for positions; I didn't come to compete
with anybody,'' Robelo told journalists. ``I'm happy to say I'm
present.''
   He said he would not seek an elected post but had come to help
his party and the opposition alliance ``in whatever way I can be
useful.''

   An East German Communist Party newspaper on
Wednesday for the first time called for the country to take a look
at why East Germans flee their homeland.
   ``How do we make it a homeland ... from which one is not lured
away just by shop windows full of bananas or glossy travel guides?''
asked the paper Junge Welt, or Young World.
   Refugees at camps in West Germany meanwhile made a beeline for
blue jeans among clothing donated to help start their new lives in
the West.
   ``The big thing for these people is blue-jean clothing _
blue-jean trousers, blue-jean skirts, and blue-jean jackets,'' said
Amanda Dropalla, who was overseeing distribution of secondhand
clothes at Passau.
   Other new arrivals were being interviewed for jobs.
   At a park near Hamburg, some began setting up temporary
households in 60 mobile homes.
   They are among more than 12,500 refugees who fled as East
European leaders face demands for democratic change. Poland has
installed the East bloc's first government led by non-communists,
and Hungary's leaders promise free elections. But East Germany
remains among the most rigid communist nations.
   New arrivals in West Germany, many young, skilled craftsmen, say
they were dissatisfied with the stagnating economy and political
oppression in their communist homeland.
   Junge Welt, which often reflects official views, said East
Germans no longer can avoid discussing why ``a minority'' fled the
country of 16.6 million people.
   ``How do we make this country indisputably the focal point for
dedication and happiness for every individual?'' the newspaper asked.
   But the main East German party daily, Neues Deutschland,
continued its criticism of West Germany, which it contends has
``lured the refugees West.''
   It also criticized Hungary for allowing their ``unsanctioned
departure.''
   West Germany's Die Welt newspaper quoted a founding member of a
reform movement in East Germany as saying demands for change are
increasing dramatically.
   ``Things are breaking up, with some wanting to go West and others
looking for a changed'' East Germany,'' it quoted Hans-Jochen
Tschiche as saying.
   He told Die Welt that his Neues Forum, or New Forum, considers
itself a platform for smaller reform movements across East Germany.
   Tschiche said he sees the possibility of achieving a
``reorganization of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)
with reform-minded people'' within the Communist Party, Die Welt
reported.
   Meanwhile, Western diplomats in East Berlin said East German
leader Erich Honecker is still recovering slowly from two
gall-bladder operations.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
77-year-old Honecker is so weak he is able to leave his bed for only
a half-hour at a time.
   They said his life is not in danger, but he is in no condition to
resume his duties.
   East German officials concede Honecker's recovery has been slow.

   No injuries were reported in the blast, which occurred at 3 a.m.
at the home of Felipe Costa in a northern suburb of Ecuador's most

   A teen-ager called police Wednesday to rescue five
younger siblings from a house containing cocaine and guns even
though he was a fugitive from a New Jersey youth detention center,
police said.
   Police arrested the 16-year-old from Newark but released him
later when New Jersey officials declined to seek his return.
   ``He must have been scared to death,'' said Jill Reilly, a Boston
police spokeswoman.
   The youth called police at about 1 a.m. after he allegedly was
robbed at gunpoint near the home where the children were staying in
Dorchester, a section of Boston where drug-related violence is
common.
   When police arrived, the juvenile told them he was afraid the
children, ages one through 12, were in danger, Reilly said.
   The teen-ager said Jimmy Lee Pettway, 35, who lived in the house,
threatened him with a .22-caliber pistol and grabbed his watch,
Reilly said. Pettway told police he was babysitting the children.
   ``The officers believed the children were in danger,'' Reilly
said, and they entered the house. They found eight grams of cocaine,
scales and ``lots and lots'' of other drug paraphernalia, as well as
several rifles in plain view in a closet, she said.
   Pettway, 35, was charged with armed robbery, carrying a firearm
and possession with intent to distribute drugs, said David Rodman, a
spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office.
   Another man at the scene, James Young, 43, was also charged with
assault with a dangerous weapon, possession of a firearm and
possession with intent to distribute, Rodman said. And a woman at
the scene, Theresa Clark, 22, also known as Claude, the mother of a
2-year-old who was a sixth child in the house, was charged with
possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to violate drug
laws.
   All three pleaded innocent to the charges and were released on
personal recognizance, Rodman said.
   Police also arrested the 16-year-old who called them, but Rodman
said he was released later Wednesday when New Jersey authorities
declined to seek his return to the state on a robbery charge.
   ``New Jersey said they don't want him, so we let him go,'' Rodman
said. ``He didn't do anything wrong.''
   Officials in the Essex County sheriff's office in New Jersey
would not comment on the case because it involves a juvenile. Newark
police did not return telephone messages.
   Boston police brought in Gladys Williams, the mother of the
juvenile and the other five children, for questioning when she
arrived at the house later in the morning. Williams, whose age was
not available, told police she originally was from New Jersey but
had been living in the Dorchester house for about two months.
   The state Department of Social Services was granted temporary
custody of the six children, and they will be placed in foster care,
said department spokesman Joseph Landolfi.

<HEAD>House Panel Says Western States Should Pay For Eastern Mine Reclamation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee decided Thursday
that coal mines all over the country should pay for cleaning up
abandoned strip mines, rejecting arguments of Western states that it
was unfair to tax them for eastern cleanups.
   On a 27-11 vote, the panel sent to the full House a bill
providing a 15-year extension of the mine reclamation tax, with
special provisions that may let western states pay at a reduced rate.
   Western coal producers want an end to the tax because all their
abandoned coal mine projects are on track for completion by the end
of 1992, when coal mining's version of Superfund is scheduled to
expire.
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, argued that the federal program has
served its purpose and further reclamation should fall to the states.
   He said it's unfair to ask one segment of the mining industry to
take care of another segment's problems. Western coal interests
would end up subsidizing Eastern projects, he argued.
   The Office of Surface Mining estimates another $4 billion in
high-priority problems will remain in the East after 1992.
   Lawmakers from Eastern coal states argued that the nation as a
whole benefited from the coal mined in Appalachia and is responsible
for damage left behind.
   ``This is the coal that fueled the Industrial Revolution,'' said
Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va.
   Saying open shafts, contaminated water and burning refuse piles
are local or regional concerns is like arguing that a state without
Superfund sites should be exempted from paying into the toxic
cleanup-fund, he said.
   ``Just as we have declared a war on drugs, so must we protect
coalfield citizens from the health, safety and environmental hazards
they face on a daily basis,'' said Rahall, who came up with a
compromise that cuts in half the tax paid by coal producers
operating in states where abandoned mine projects have been
completed.
   The legislation ready for House consideration includes that 50
percent cut.
   The tax currrently is uniform nationwide: 35 cents per ton of
surface-mined coal, 15 cents per ton of deep-mined coal, 10 cents
per ton of lignite.
   The legislation would let companies in states certified to have
finished all mine reclamation work pay 18 cents per ton of
surface-mined coal, 8 cents per ton of deep-mined coal and 5 cents
per ton of lignite.
   The tax had collected $2.2 billion through last Sept. 30.

   Evangelist Oral Roberts announced Wednesday
that he will close his City of Faith hospital and medical school and
sell his home to help make up for a $25 million deficit caused by a
drop in donations.
   Four other ministry-owned homes, including his evangelist son
Richard's house, and an 830-unit housing complex for married
students at Oral Roberts University here, also will be sold, Roberts
told a campus news conference.
   He said the 777-bed hospital would close by Jan. 1 and the
medical school, which is part of the university, would shut down
with the end of classes next May.
   Roberts, who in 1987 raised $8 million for the medical school
after saying God would end his life if the money didn't come in,
left open the possibility ``some miracle'' could happen. But he said
the action was necessary to save the 4,300-student university.
   ``I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made,'' the
71-year-old evangelist said. ``I hurt because this is my calling,
but I'm encouraged that we're doing the right thing.''
   Roberts has blamed the sharp decline in donations to his ministry
on a ``spirit of skepticism'' in the wake of scandals involving
fellow evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   He said a $50 million endowment would be needed to prevent the
closing of the medical complex, which Roberts has long considered a
symbol of his medical missionary work.
   ``Who knows that when this is known across America that someone
we might have been dealing with, or someone we haven't been dealing
with, might say, `I've got the $50 million,''' Roberts said.
   He said he had talked to a potential big contributor who might
have been able to donate the $50 million, but the discussions fell
through.
   ``He hasn't given up yet, but he said the economy is just too bad
now,'' said Roberts, who would not identify the man.
   Roberts talked to students, faculty and staff of the hospital and
medical school in an emotional meeting early Wednesday to explain
the crisis afflicting his ministry, the Oral Roberts Evangelistic
Association.
   He told them that at least half of the $25 million was needed to
pay vendors, and that the remainder was owed for various costs,
including mortages.
   ``I asked the Lord to not let me cry because I've cried all the
tears I thought I could cry. And sure enough, I didn't cry,'' he
said.
   The five homes and the housing complex will be sold as soon as a
buyer can be found, said Mark Swadener, chief fiscal officer for the
ministry. The homes sit on 9 acres near the 400-acre ministry
complex.
   Oral Roberts' 6,328-square-foot, four-bedroom home was valued at
about $500,000 in 1987. The value of his son's 7,091-square-foot,
two-story home was put at $547,000 that year.
   City of Faith hospital employs 600 staff members and the medical
school has 147 students and about 100 faculty, said school Dean Dr.
Larry Edwards. The 27 seniors at the school will be allowed to
graduate. The other students will be be helped in seeking transfers
to other medical schools.
   ``It's not going to stop me from being a doctor and it's not
going to stop me from being a medical missionary,'' said medical
student David Chorley.
   The hospital, part of a three-tower complex with 60-story,
30-story and 20-story buildings, will be leased and the revenue
generated dedicated to the ministry's endowment, Roberts said.
   Swadener would not say how much money the sales and the closings
would bring.
   ``After the dust has settled, we'll take a look at it,'' he said.
   Some university students approved Roberts' action. Tulsa Mayor
Roger Randle said he believed the evangelist made the right
decision. ``We have a short-term loss, but a strengthened ability to
survive in the long term,'' Randle said.
   The financial problems involving Roberts and his ministry have
been well chronicled.
   Roberts' 1986 plea for $8 million caused a furor, but the money
was raised.
   Last March, Roberts said he needed $11 million to keep creditors
from dismantling the ministry, university and hospital. The money
was needed to pay past-due bills from more than 4,000 vendors, he
said.
   The six-week fund drive, which the evangelist termed a
life-or-death struggle for his ministry, ended successfully in May.
   At the time, ministry spokeswoman Jan Dargatz said contributions
would have to continue at a level of about $3.3 million per month to
sustain the medical center, the ministry and the university.
   Monthly contributions to the ministry declined from $5 million to
$2.7 million, ministry officials said.
   When Roberts built the City of Faith, which opened in 1981,
officials at Tulsa's five other hospitals harshly criticized him,
saying Tulsa didn't need another hospital.
   Although the hospital has 777 beds, it is licensed for no more
than 294 patients and has never had an annual average higher than
148.
   Roberts announced in May that the university's athletic programs
were dropping out of National Collegiate Athletic Association
competition immediately to save an estimated $500,000 to $1 million
a year.
   The ministry also canceled contracts with some commercial
television stations that had been airing the daily show hosted by
Richard Roberts, 41.
   Oral Roberts University has more than 4,300 undergraduate and
graduate students.

<HEAD>Smokers' Dogs May Run Higher Risk of Lung Cancer, Study Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Smoking, Bjt</HEAD>

   Dogs whose owners smoke are at a 50
percent greater risk of getting lung cancer, a health researcher
said Wednesday.
   A Colorado State University study examined 51 cases of dogs with
lung cancer from the files of veterinary teaching hospitals at the
university and the University of Illinois.
   ``Dogs don't smoke and lung cancer is extremely rare in dogs,''
said John Reif, a Colorado State environmental health professor at
Colorado State's College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical
Sciences.
   Reif said the study of dog cancer cases had shown a relationship
between exposure to secondhand smoke and canine lung cancer and that
it could help research on the effect of such smoke on humans.
Studies have shown a relationship between secondhand smoke and lung
cancer in humans.
   Reif and his associates interviewed the dogs' owners about their
smoking habits, and determined that 24 of the 51 dogs, or 47
percent, had owners who smoked.
   The researchers also looked at a control group of 83 dogs with
other forms of cancer. Of that group, 31 dogs, or 37 percent, had
smokers as owners, Reif said.
   Based on those findings, the researchers concluded that dogs with
owners who smoke were 50 percent more likely to get lung cancer.
   Reif said the number of dogs in the study was low because of the
rarity of lung cancer in dogs. Of 15,000 dogs seen by the Colorado
State hospital, just five had the disease. The researcher said there
were no national figures.
   Reid presented the study findings at the annual meeting in July
of the American Veterinary Medical Association in Orlando, Fla.
   Reif said he hopes to study more dogs. He said dogs make a good
model for the study of secondhand smoke's effects because they lead
relatively simple lives.
   ``People's lives are highly variable. Exposure to passive smoke
in the workplace and at home, as well as to occupational
environmental hazards, can be health risks'' and make it difficult
to assess secondhand smoke's effect, he said.
   Reif said future studies might look at the effect of secondhand
smoke on canine nasal cancer.
   Unlike humans, who have short nasal passages that cause smoke
particles to lodge more often in the lungs, dogs filter the air they
breathe through a relatively long nasal passage where many smoke
particles lodge.
   Nasal cancer is more common in dogs, making a larger study group
possible, Reif said.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, on trial on charges
she slapped a Beverly Hills policeman, said Wednesday she is
frightened by the prospect of going to jail because ``I'm afraid of
lesbians.''
   ``Everybody's afraid of going to jail. Who isn't?'' Miss Gabor
said.
   The Hungarian-born star of such films as ``Picture Mommy Dead''
and ``Queen of Outer Space'' was in court for the third day of jury
selection in her trial on police-slapping and traffic charges. If
convicted, she faces up to two years in jail and a $4,000 fine.
   A jury was sworn in late Wednesday afternoon, and Miss Gabor
described the panel as ``very charming people.'' The jury of her
peers included a bank clerk, a lawyer and the ex-housekeeper@cook
for actress Jaclyn Smith.
   ``I don't know whether they like me, but I like them,'' the
actress said.
   Defense lawyer William Graysen said he expected opening
statements Thursday.
   Miss Gabor's temper flared when she stepped into a courthouse
hallway to speak with reporters and a female television reporter who
apparently somehow offended the actress earlier this week placed a
microphone near her face.
   ``Get that out of my face!'' Miss Gabor snapped. Then she asked,
``Why should the pretty woman be so rude to me?''
   Miss Gabor, who wore Donna Karan creations earlier in the week,
was clad Wednesday in an off-the-rack suit with black-and-white
stripes.
   ``Sak's mail order _ and I love it,'' she said.
   Miss Gabor was arrested June 14 after a policeman stopped her for
having expired registration tags on her $215,000 Rolls-Royce
Corniche convertible. While the officer was checking for other
infractions, Miss Gabor allegedly drove away, only to be caught
again two blocks away. At that point she allegedly slapped the
officer.
   The former beauty queen maintains she was verbally and physically
abused by the officer, who she says has a history of harassing
celebrities.
   She pleaded innocent July 12 to charges of misdemeanor battery on
a police officer, disobeying a police officer's orders, driving with
an expired license, having an open bottle of liquor in her car and
having an expired car registration.
   Despite a court-imposed gag order, Miss Gabor speculated on why
the public is interested in her case.
   ``Nobody wants a woman to be battered,'' she said. ``A 6-foot-6
man cannot beat up a 5-foot-4 woman. I am really here for one
reason: to be sure you guys have no right to beat up a girl.''
   She said her eighth and current husband, Prince Frederick von
Anhalt, Germany's Duke of Saxony, was ``brooding'' because of news
reports revealing he took naps during court sessions. The prince
wore dark glasses in court Wednesday.
   Among courthouse spectators was Margaret Holloway of Los Angeles,
who displayed photographs of herself in a Zsa Zsa lookalike contest.
When told about Ms. Holloway, Miss Gabor looked across the
courthouse hallway and said, ``She's beautiful, but she weighs so
much.''
   Miss Gabor has been extremely secretive about her age, but court
documents reveal she is 66.

<TEXT>
   The Senate failed by a single vote Wednesday to
override President Bush's veto of congressional restrictions on the
coproduction of a jet fighter with Japan.
   The 66-34 vote, one vote short of the required two-thirds
majority, came after a debate in which both the White House and
Congress were accused of trying to monopolize the power to regulate
the nation's international trade.
   In the debate, Bush supporters said the legislation represented a
serious erosion of the powers of the presidency and would force
renegotiation of the terms of the FSX production contract between
the two nations.
   The vote means Japan can go ahead with the fighter, an updated
version of the General Dynamics Corp. F-16, under the deal
negotiated with the Bush administration.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas pleaded with
colleagues not to aggravate the president and to sustain Bush's veto
of legislation Dole called ``meddling, micromanagement and not
constructive.''
   Senate Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the principal sponsor of the FSX
resolution, told the Senate that the FSX resolution is ``too
important to have a turf battle over,'' declaring that it improves
the terms of the deal for the United States.
   Senators seeking to overturn the veto said it represented a White
House power grab in the international trade arena and a direct
threat to the constitutional power of Congress to regulate trade.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said the FSX legislation does not
derail the coproduction deal, which he said is ``in place and cannot
be undone.''
   ``This debate is about the drawing of lines between the president
and the Congress on international trade issues,'' Danforth said.
``If the president is correct in his view, then he has succeeded in
dramatically shifting the line from where it has been.
   ``If we agree (with the veto) then there has been a very
substantial rollback in the authority of the Congress of the United
States on issues related to international trade,'' he said. ``This
is trying to muscle the other fellow off the beach.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., contended that in passing the FSX
resolution on a 72-27 roll call, the Senate ``overreached'' and
moved to usurp the president's proper authority under the
Constitution.
   ``The president of the United States has not attempted to strip
the Congress of any constitutional power whatsoever,'' Lugar said. '
   He said the president is contending that ``the executive branch
retains the right to negotiate agreements with other nations and
that the Senate has the right to approve or reject them.''
   He appealed to the Senate to let the agreement with Japan go
forward on grounds it is in the U.S. national interest and not to
``foul it up with mischief legislation.''
   Bush vetoed the FSX resolution on July 31, saying, ``I cannot
accept binding provisions ... that would tie my hands in the
exercise of my constitutional responsibilities.''
   He said the legislation would inject the General Accounting
Office, an agency of the legislative branch, into the administration
of the jet program ``in a highly intrusive manner,'' trespassing on
the constitutional powers of the president.
   ``To reopen discussions now for additional and needless changes
can only damage the prospects for a successful agreement,'' the
president said.
   ``If this occurs, substantial injury to the U.S.-Japan security
relationship is likely and the considerable strategic and commercial
benefits to the United States will be lost.''
   The agreement, negotiated earlier this year by Bush
administration officials with officials of the Japanese government,
calls for development by General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, named FSX, to
be deployed by Japan in the 1990s. The deal envisions a $6 billion
price tag.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley walked a ``gray area of the
law'' as a paid consultant to two savings banks doing business with
the city, but evidence is insufficient to prosecute him, the city
attorney said Wednesday.
   Bradley instead faces a civil lawsuit that alleges six violations
of failing to report investments, two of them in excess of $100,000.
   City Attorney James Hahn filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles
Superior Court at about the same time as he released a 1,613-page
report on the mayor's conduct. The report was based on a five-month
investigation by Hahn's office into Bradley's relationship with Far
East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   ``No vindication of the mayor's conduct is intended, implied or
should in any way be inferred,'' Hahn wrote in the report. ``The
mayor clearly stepped into that gray area of the law between factual
innocence and a chargeable offense.''
   The mayor said the report confirmed his earlier statements that
he broke no conflict-of-interest laws.
   ``I would never do anything to harm Los Angeles,'' he said in a
locally televised afternoon speech. ``I will not let you down.''
   In the lengthy speech, Bradley said that he saw no connection
between accepting consulting fees from a bank and the city
treasurer's decisions to deposit city money in the bank.
   ``The two have nothing to do with one another,'' he said.
   Although Hahn described his five-month investigation as
``exhaustive'' and ``unprecedented in scope and purpose,'' it was
limited to a narrow range of questions about the mayor's outside
financial dealings.
   Still unresolved are questions about possible illegalities
involving a city-funded task force for Africa, Bradley's ties to the
investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and an
alleged cover-up by the city treasurer's office.
   Hahn said it was apparent that a March 22 telephone call from
Bradley to City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg influenced Rittenberg
to deposit $2 million in city funds with Far East National Bank.
   Bradley was paid $18,000 as a consultant to Far East.
   It was also obvious, Hahn said, that someone altered financial
bid sheets following a reporter's inquiry about the Far East
deposit. A section of the bid sheets that contained the words ``per
the mayor'' had been blotted out.
   ``There's no question in my mind that there was a cover-up, but
we could find no evidence linking that to the mayor,'' the city
attorney said.
   Hahn noted, however, that a criminal investigation into the
treasurer's activities is continuing.
   While much of the report dealt with the mayor's relationship with
Far East, he also received at least $89,000 in consulting fees from
Valley Federal since 1979.
   The mayor was a consultant for Valley Federal while it had a $2.7
million tax dispute with the city, and while developments backed by
Valley Federal sought zoning changes from the city.
   Bradley has resigned from consulting positions with both banks.
   The 11-page lawsuit, alleging violations of the state Government
Code, does not specify the penalties sought by the city attorney.
However, Hahn and Bradley were expected to negotiate over about $2.2
million in possible fines.
   The suit alleges that Bradley intentionally or negligently failed
to report personal financial interests totaling more than $200,000.
   In some instances, the mayor's investments were made through the
local office of Drexel, and Hahn referred that aspect of the
investigation to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The report also noted serious concerns about the mayor's
relationship to the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles, and said
police are continuing their investigation into the city agency. But
Hahn said he found no misconduct by Bradley in his dealings with the
agency.
   Juanita St. John, head of the task force, has been ordered by the
City Controller's office to account for missing city funds granted
to the trade group.

   Three days of pounding rain and
high winds left 12 people dead and drove thousands from their homes
in southern Brazil, civil defense officials said Wednesday.
   Three people drowned and a fourth was killed by lightning in
Curitiba, capital of Parana state, 500 miles southwest of Rio,
Carlos Daher of the civil defense said in a telephone interview.
Among the dead was a 16-year-old boy, swept away by a flooded river
in the slum neighborhood of Vila Sofia.
   ``The river rose so high that parts of the city looked like a
lake,'' Daher said of the flooding. ``But the rain has stopped now,
and people who were driven from their homes are going back to clean
up.''
   Six people died in western Parana when winds of up to 65 mph
knocked down buildings and blew off roofs, leaving 4,000 homeless,
Daher said.
   Worst hit was rural Pato Branco, where winds destroyed the homes
of 2,500 people, he said.
   The homeless were being sheltered in churches, schools and public
buildings, Daher said.
   In Santa Catarina state, heavy rains caused a gold mine in the
city of Lages to collapse Tuesday, trapping and killing two men,
officials said.
   Heavy rain also left 2,000 people homeless in Rio Grande do Sul,
Brazil's southernmost state.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Soviet
legislator, on Wednesday toured the birthplace of U.S. democracy,
visiting Independence Hall and touching the Liberty Bell.
   ``The same kind of crack which I see in this bell should not
arise in the free countries of the world as a result of the
emergence of liberty,'' Yeltsin said.
   After sightseeing, the 58-year-old Yeltsin addressed more than
800 people at a World Affairs Council luncheon for a fee of $25,000,
which he said will go to charity.
   Yeltsin, who met briefly with President Bush during his weeklong
speaking tour of the United States, also arranged for a meeting
Thursday with former President Reagan, recovering from brain surgery
at a hospital in Rochester, Minn., Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg
said.
   Yeltsin, a sharp critic of what he called Mikhail Gorbachev's
``compromising and half measures,'' said he hoped the Soviet Union
would improve economic relations with the United States.
   ``We have to change some of our laws on land holdings and
property to make this possible,'' he said through an interpreter.
``If foreigners could purchase land, they would make investments.
   ``I would like to see someone build 1 million apartments and sell
them because Soviet citizens have money available and they would
bring a good price if they were good.''
   Yeltsin, ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief in 1987 but
later overwhelmingly elected to parliament, said he did not expect
any retaliation for his frank criticism about developments in his
country.
   ``I'm no less straightforward about what I say back there as I
say here,'' Yeltsin said. ``I'm trying to practice the diplomacy of
truth. I think we should get away from the old-fashioned diplomacy
of people trying to outwit each other.
   ``If we can be truthful it will increase the level of confidence
between countries and people.''
   He said he did not expect any kind of effort to oust Gorbachev,
calling it ``extremely unlikely since I have been on the inside for
2{ years and I know it can't happen.''
   On the thousands of East Germans fleeing through Hungary to the
West, he said, ``People should have the right to leave their country
and go someplace else. This is part of an international agreement.''
   Yeltsin was asked about a report that the KGB, the Soviet secret
police, had offered the United States help in its drug war.
   ``All I can say is that the KGB has its hands full dealing with
drugs in the USSR,'' he answered. ``They have to take care of their
own domestic problems before they start trying to help someone
else.''

   Suspected Sikh extremists Wednesday shot
to death the son of a senior police official and wounded his friend
as they returned from college on a motorcycle in northern Punjab
state, authorities said.
   Press Trust of India news agency said the extremists also killed
three people elsewhere in the state Wednesday, bringing to 1,206 the
number of people killed in the secessionist violence this year.
   Rajan Ram, 18, was shot in the head and chest by unidentified men
in a car in Jallandhar, a senior police officer said in that city 45
miles south of Amritsar.
   Ram and a friend, Pradeep Kumar, were returning from college when
they were attacked on a busy road in the town's center, Suresh
Arora, the senior police superintendent of Jallandhar, said in a
telephone interview.
   He said Kumar was seriously injured, and the attackers sped away
in the car.
   Arora quoted Kumar as saying that before opening fire, the men
asked Rajan Ram if he was the son of Gobind Ram, a senior
superintendent of police in the Punjab Armed Police.
   He was transferred to the post Sept. 1. Earlier, he served as
senior superintendent of police of neighboring Batala district,
where he had led a crackdown on Sikh extremists fighting to set up
an independent nation.
   Rajan Ram was the fourth son of a senior police officer to have
been killed by suspected Sikh extremists. Police officials said the
extremists have killed at least 20 relatives of police officers.
   Sikh militants began their secessionist campaign in 1982,
charging discrimination by the Hindu-dominated government.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but they
are in a slight majority in Punjab. Hindus make up 88 percent of the
population.

   PTL gave founder Jim Bakker bonuses as big
as $500,000 even while it was losing money, the ministry's former
finance director testified Wednesday.
   ``We're spending as if there's no crisis,'' Peter Bailey said in
a July 1984 memo to Bakker and PTL executive vice president Richard
Dortch.
   Bailey testified about his warnings in the U.S. District court
trial of Bakker, who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly diverting nearly $4 million from the
tax-exempt ministry. Bakker left PTL in disgrace in March 1987 in a
sex and money scandal.
   The prosecution testimony followed stories earlier this week from
Bakker's ``lifetime partners'' _ people who gave meager savings for
the promise of guaranteed lodging at his theme park, but were turned
away because rooms weren't built with their donations.
   The wife of a disabled coal miner told the jury Tuesday that she
thought her $1,000 contribution to PTL guaranteed a cheap vacation
for her 13 children. But she said never was given a room.
   Contributions to PTL hit a five-year low in 1986, Bailey wrote in
an Oct. 6 memo, dropping to $3.5 million that September.
   Bailey said he wouldn't write checks except for emergencies. But
the PTL board voted a $500,000 bonus for Jim Bakker and $100,000 for
his wife, Tammy Faye, on Nov. 3, about four months before Bakker's
reign ended at PTL.
   Bailey said he frequently had to take money from lifetime partner
accounts to pay bonuses to Bakker and Dortch, as well as salary,
payroll and other expenses. Partners paid $1,000 in return for the
promise of lifetime lodging privileges at Bakker's Heritage USA
retreat and theme park.
   Bailey said in the memo that numerous accounts were overdue by 90
days and some vendors were not being paid at all.
   Among Bailey's warnings:
   _ Bailey said he wrote in a March 16, 1984, memo that ``Every day
brings us into a deeper crisis,'' and that more than $700,000 was
needed to meet the payroll. Less than two weeks later, records
showed that Bakker received a $390,000 bonus from the board.
   _ In 1983, Bailey said, he warned Bakker that he was dipping into
PTL's savings account to pay operating expenses and that Bakker
approved. Ten days earlier, the board approved bonuses totaling
$150,000 for the Bakkers.
   _ Bailey said he told Bakker in November 1983 that contributions
for the month totaled $4.7 million and expenditures were $6.8
million. Two weeks later, prosecutor Deborah Smith said, the board
voted another $150,000 bonus for the Bakkers.
   _ On Sept. 6, 1985, Bailey warned Bakker the ministry was
surviving on lifetime partner donations and said cuts of 40 percent
were needed immediately in the ministry payroll. On Nov. 12, 1985,
the prosecution said, Bakker got a $250,000 bonus from the board.
   A Tulsa, Okla., attorney testified late Wednesday afternoon that
he, too, had expressed concerns about the partnership program.
   Charles Chapel, who was hired to represent PTL in March 1986 when
the ministry was responding to an Internal Revenue Service Audit for
1981-83, said he told ministry officials the lifetime partnerships
should be separated from general contributions.
   Chapel was withdrawn from the PTL account in September 1986. He
said Dortch had told him the ministry wanted to hire another law
firm to represent PTL in an upcoming IRS audit for 1984-85.
   After he was replaced, Chapel wrote Bakker a letter saying, ``You
have got to get your church under control or it will be lost.''
   If convicted, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison
and fined more than $5 million.
   Dortch pleaded guilty to similar charges and was sentenced to
eight years in prison and fined $200,000.

back to normal after nearly a month of drug-related shootings,
bombings and arson attacks.
   Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez said there was no more need for the 11
p.m.-5 a.m. curfew, which was imposed Aug. 30 in the city of 2
million.
   On Tuesday night, gunmen attacked the Medellin home of federal
Judge Laurentino Gallego Gil but police guards drove them off,
police said. One guard was wounded, a Medellin police spokesman said
on condition of anonoymity.
   Earlier Tuesday, hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of
former Medellin Mayor Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez, who tried to rid the
city of drug traffickers. Pelaez was assassinated on his way to work
Monday.
   The mayor said the city has returned to ``absolute normalcy,''
although army vehicles remained on the streets.
   There are some exceptions to the lifting of the curfew.
   Motorcycles, frequently used in drive-by bombings, are banned
from the streets from 6:30 p.m.-5 a.m. Restaurants, bars, discos and
other places of entertainment must close at midnight during the week
and 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
   In Bogota, the 13th Army Brigade on Wednesday displayed weapons
captured in a raid just north of the city. The chief Defense
Ministry spokesman, Col. Eduardo Arevalo, said the guns probably
belonged to drug traffickers.
   Authorities displayed about 20 semiautomatic and automatic arms,
including Israeli Galil, U.S. R-15, Chinese AK-47 and Belgian FAL
rifles; a British MP-5 machine gun; and pistols, grenades,
ammunition and radio scanners for monitoring police and military
frequencies.
   The Bogota newspaper El Espectador said the cache, seized
Tuesday, belonged to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the reputed No. 2
member of the Medellin drug cartel. The Defense Ministry spokesman
did not confirm that.
   Colombia has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to
the capture of Rodriguez Gacha or reputed cartel leader Pablo
Escobar.
   It declared a war on the country's drug lords Aug. 18 after a
leading presidential candidate was assassinated.
   In the Brazilian capital of Brasilia, an Aeronautics Ministry
communique said Wednesday that Brazil's air force has moved a
powerful, 54-ton mobile radar unit to the jungle border wih Colombia
to detect clandestine flights by drug traffickers. It said the unit
has a 125-mile range and can pick up several planes simultaneously.
   Romeu Tuma, Brazil's federal police chief, has ordered border
controls tightened to prevent Colombian drug traffickers from
sneaking into Brazil. Although not a major cocaine producer, Brazil
is considered an important cocaine processing and transshipping
point and as a hideout for traffickers.
   At Meech Lake, Quebec, Chris Davis, a spokesman for Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, said Canada has conveyed to Bogota ``an
acceptance in principle'' of Colombian proposals for Canadian help
in its drug fight, with details and cost to be worked out.
   Colombia also is at war with guerrilla factions.
   In northern Cesar state, troops killed 12 leftist guerrillas, an
officer said Wednesday.
   Col. Tobias Duran Quintanilla, the regional military commander,
said in a radio interview the battle Tuesday was with guerrillas of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the largest of six rebel
groups. He gave no details.
   In a guerrilla-stronghold in Cauca state, police Wednesday
prevented 7,000 Indians from marching to Popayan, the regional
capital. Two Indians were wounded in a clash with police, RCN radio
reported.
   The station said Guanbiano and Paeces Indians, protesting the
recent killings of two Indian activists, announced they were on a
hunger strike and took over a highway leading to Popayan.
   About 75,000 Colombians have been killed in the past 25 years in
guerrilla fighting and other politically motivated conflicts.
   At a rural encampment in southwestern Colombia, the government
continued talks with the second-largest guerrilla group, M-19, aimed
at working out a truce or amnesty.

   Independence leader Juan Mari Bras
proposed Wednesday that all Puerto Rican pro-independence groups
unite at one big rally on Sept. 23 to commemorate this Caribbean
island's 1868 revolt against Spain.
   He said the groups, which often differ over ideology, should
cancel separate events planned to commemorate the revolt.
   Mari Bras, founder of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party and
veteran independence leader, suggested the main speakers be
Independence Party leader Ruben Berrios, Socialist Party leader
Carlos Gallisa and Macheteros founder Filiberto Ojeda Rios.
   Ojeda Rios is on bail pending trial in Hartford, Conn., in
connection with the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo
depot.
   Nationalists in the mountain town of Lares in 1868 called for a
revolt against Spain. Their rebellion failed. Spain later lost
Puerto Rico to the United States in the 1898 Spanish-American War.

   The leader of the militant anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue and four associates were acquitted Wednesday on
trespassing charges for blocking entrances to clinics where they
said abortions were performed.
   The Municipal Court jurors, who deliberated for four days,
indicated after delivering their verdicts that they had accepted
Randall Terry's ``necessity defense'' in spite of the judge's ruling
to the contrary. Terry and his codefendants have claimed laws can be
broken to prevent a greater harm.
   ``We felt they stood up for their rights. We didn't feel they
broke the law,'' said juror Mike Simons of west Los Angeles.
   The jury found Terry, who represented himself at the trial, and
the other activists innocent of five misdemeanor charges that
included trespassing, resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy.
   The jurors, however, deadlocked 8-4 for conviction on conspiracy
counts against Terry, 30, of Binghamton, N.Y., Michael McMonagle,
36, of Philadelphia and Jeff White, 31, of Santa Cruz.
   Judge Richard Paez declared a mistrial on the three counts,
meaning they could be refiled by the City Attorney's office.
Prosecutors said a decision on refiling the charges would be made by
Oct. 2.
   Paez had said earlier the issue at trial was not abortion but
trespassing, and ruled the ``necessity defense'' did not apply
because abortion is legal. Defendants' motives for their actions
were not legitimate defenses in the case, he said.
   The judge had scolded Terry and the other defendants for
repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to their opposition to legal
abortions.
   The five were on trial for allegedly ignoring a federal
injunction barring activists to block entrances to abortion clinics.
Terry denied he was ever served a copy of the court order.
   Also on trial were Don Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo, and Andrew
Eppink, 41, of Palmdale.
   Juror Edmond Bleavins said he hoped the verdict would send a
message to the Los Angeles Police Department. ``The police just
brutalized these people in my opinion,'' he said.
   Bleavins said he did not intend to give Operation Rescue the
message they could ``keep on doing what they've been doing.'' He
said the jury deadlocked on conspiracy to block the entrance to
clinics was because at least one juror felt the defendants' intent
was not to break the law but to save babies.
   Only one of the defendants, White, was present for the verdicts.
Defendants are not required to be present for all phases of
misdemeanor trials.
   ``Thank God. I think it's wonderful that a jury of our peers has
said it's not against the law to save babies in L.A.,'' White said.
   He said the jury appeared to have accepted defense claims that
the Los Angeles Police Department used excessive force and believed
``The issue of our intent _ we were there to save lives.''
   Asked if the abortion issue came up during deliberations, juror
Marilyn McNichols of Downey answered: ``I wouldn't say it didn't
come up but I would honestly say it was not a factor in arriving at
our decision.''
   Deputy City Attorney Lara Bloomquist, leaving the courthouse,
said the defendants had succeeded in turning the abortion issue into
their defense.
   She said the compression of television screens jurors viewed
during the trial made the police tactics appear more violent than
they were.
   The charges were lodged after Operation Rescue activists blocked
the doors to a women's clinic on March 25, during a week of protests
in which more than 1,000 anti-abortion activists were arrested
throughout California.
   The protests were held as the U.S. Supreme Court considered a
Missouri law, later upheld, which broadened the role of states in
making laws about when a woman can have an abortion.
   During the trial, Terry frequently referred to abortion clinics
as ``aboratorium,'' ``killing centers'' and ``abortion mills,''
prompting Paez to rebuke him for using ``inflammatory'' language.

   Wheat farmers will be allowed to increase
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish its wheat
reserves, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced Wednesday.
   The Agriculture Department will dip into its reserve for some 3.5
million metric tons of wheat for this year and next to meet U.S.
commitments for international food aid, a department statement said.
   The change in the wheat program will cause a slight increase in
the overall income of wheat farmers, the statement said. Acreage of
harvested wheat will increase from an estimated 67.5 million acres
to 69.6 million acres because of the program change.
   Under the 1990 wheat program, farmers are required to idle 5
percent of their wheat acreage to qualify for federal supports.
   Farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of the
farm's wheat base, rising to a limit of 105 percent, the statement
said.
   ``The action today does not suggest that we expect another year
of less than average wheat yields, nor will it boost stocks
significantly,'' Yeutter said. ``But it will help restore stocks to
safer levels. In view of the tight U.S. and world supply and demand
situation, we should give wheat producers the option to increase
plantings if they wish to do so.''
   This decision comes less than two months after Yeutter said there
would be no change in the 5 percent acreage reduction program for
wheat.

   Miss Oklahoma won the talent division
and Miss Louisiana won the swimsuit contest Wednesday in the second
night of preliminary competitions for the Miss America Pageant.
   Tamara Denise Toshiko Marler, a 26-year-old from Tulsa, Okla.,
performed a haunting, romantic rendition of ``Since I Fell For You.''
   For her performance, she wore a full-length navy silk gown beaded
with Mediterranean blue bugle beads and featuring a sweetheart
neckline.
   Miss Marler, who is half-Japanese, is a recent marketing graduate
of the University of Tulsa. She hopes to someday become a lawyer.
   Miss Marler, who has auburn hair and chestnut eyes, said her hero
is Barbra Streisand.
   ``She is so talented,'' she said. ``She's a great singer,
producer, director and writer, and she's straightforward and
honest.''
   The winner of Wednesday's swimsuit competition was Miss Louisiana
Stacy King, a green-eyed blonde. At 5-foot-5 and 105 pounds, she
wore a white swimsuit with spaghetti straps at the shoulders.
   To stay in shape, she plays softball, dances, bicycles and trains
with weights ``every day.'' To prepare for the pageant, Miss King
said she gave up chocolate chip cookies.
   ``I gave them up right after I won the state pageant on June 18 _
that's 2 1-2 months,'' she said. ``If I lose in Atlantic City, I'll
eat a lot of them.''
   Miss King, a 23-year-old from Slidell, La., has a degree in
fashion merchandising from Louisiana Tech University and plans to
obtain a degree in dental hygiene. Eventually, she said she hopes to
combine both degrees to design more fashionable uniforms.
   Wednesday's competition was the second of three nights of
swimsuit, talent and evening gown rounds. The winners of the
preliminary evening gown competitions are kept secret to heighten
the suspense for the finals.
   The three nights of preliminary competitions for the 51
contestants are the first steps to the live nationally televised
Miss America Pageant on Saturday. On Friday night, the contestants
participate in the famous, colorful Miss America Parade on the
resort's Boardwalk.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will become the top 10
finalists. Those 10 will start with a clean slate Saturday night,
competing to succeed Miss America 1989 Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   The judging has been revised this year, with talent counting for
40 percent, the interview for 30 percent, and the evening gown and
swimsuit divisions counting for 15 percent each.
   At Tuesday night's preliminary competition, Miss Missouri Debbye
Turner wore a canary yellow swimsuit to win that contest.
   Miss Ohio Kristin Huffman won the talent division with a
classical vocal piece titled ``Csardas.''
   The 63rd annual pageant will air on NBC-TV at 10 p.m. EDT
Saturday. Gary Collins and Miss America 1971 Phyllis George Brown
will host.

   A homemade bomb exploded Wednesday outside a
bookstore owned by the British publisher of Salman Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' and a second bomb was defused at another of
its stores, police said.
   There were no injuries.
   However, the bomb that exploded caused minor damage to the York
bookstore owned by the Viking Penguin group, police said. The store
was closed for the night.
   The other bomb was found Wednesday night outside the group's
bookstore in Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London, police said.
It was safely defused by army experts, they said.
   No group claimed responsibility for planting either bomb, but
suspicion fell on Moslem hard-liners opposed to the publication and
sale of the book, which many Moslems say blasphemes their religion.
   Inspector Ron Johnson of York police said the bomb there was
spotted about a half-hour before it went off. Police cleared the
area, which was crowded with tourists.
   He said the attackers gave no warning.
   Moslem militants in Britain ignited worldwide demonstrations
against the book when they burned copies in Bradford, 30 miles
southwest of the northern city of York, following its publication in
September 1988.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born naturalized British citizen, has been in
hiding since Feb. 14, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Iran's spiritual leader, called on Moslems to kill him and his
publishers.
   On Aug. 3, a bomb killed a man in a London hotel, and a
previously unknown Islamic group claimed he was preparing to use the
device against Rushdie.
   In addition, two California bookstores were firebombed on March
1, and five stores in London were bombed between April 9 and Sept.
3. Authorities said those attacks may have been connected to ``The
Satanic Verses.''

<TEXT>
   A grand jury on Wednesday indicted a local man
on charges of assault with dangerous weapons for allegedly having
sex with a 13-year-old boy at the same time he knew he had AIDS.
   Michael A. Feaster, 30, was indicted on a total of 41 counts
involving six children by a District of Columbia Superior Court
grand jury.
   He surrendered to police Wednesday night and is being held in the
city jail on $200,000 bond. He will be arraigned Thursday.
   Feaster's attorney, Duff Lewis, said the U.S. attorney's office
was seeking to create ``a mass hysteria over the AIDS virus.''
   According to the indictment, Feaster abused the children, between
the ages of 9 and 15, from June 1987 until February of this year.
   Feaster was charged with three counts of assault with a dangerous
weapon for incidents which allegedly occurred between November 1988
and February 1989, after he tested positive for the HIV virus, the
indictment stated.
   The indictment said Feaster assaulted the boy ``with dangerous
weapons'' by having sex with him at after having tested positive for
AIDS.
   Georgetown University law professor Robert Stein said the charge
was unusual.
   ``It is unusual, but there are a number of examples of people who
have had sex with others knowing they were infected who, under state
laws, have been brought to trial. In a couple of cases, including
one in the military in a court-martial, they were convicted,'' Stein
said.
   The indictment caused concern among some close to AIDS victims.
   ``If we have our law enforcement agencies in the country now
beginning to define AIDS as a lethal weapon, then all of our efforts
at educating people and encouraging people to come forward and be
tested and receive treatment as early as possible, could seriously
by hampered by something like this,'' said Robert Harvey of the
Whitman-Walker Clinic, a major AIDS treatment facility in the
Washington area.

   The Supreme Court granted a defense request
Wednesday and postponed an appeal by a convicted Nazi war criminal,
enabling his attorney to verify new evidence he claims was covered
up by the United States.
   The decision on John Demjanjuk's appeal followed a 4{-hour
session in which prosecutor Michael Shaked disputed that the
Americans had hidden any evidence in the case.
   The appeal before the five-justice panel was postponed from Nov.
1 to May 14, 1990.
   Demjanjuk, 69, a retired auto worker from the Cleveland suburb of
Seven Hills, was found guilty by an Israeli court in April 1988 of
crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people. He was
sentenced to death.
   Demjanjuk was convicted of being a Nazi guard known as ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' who switched on the gas chambers in 1942-1943 at the
Treblinka death camp, where 850,000 Jews perished.
   But the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claims to be a victim of
mistaken identity and testified at his trial that he was at two
other Nazi prisoner of war camps during that period.
   Demjanjuk attorney Yoram Sheftel told the court he had recently
received new evidence that could help his client.
   These included documents found several weeks ago in a garbage bin
across the street from the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations (OSI) in Washington, Sheftel said. The office
investigates alleged Nazi war criminals.
   ``Of course, we are delighted we have at least until May,'' said
Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law and leader of the Cleveland-based
John Demjanjuk Defense Fund. ``We'll have the evidence needed to
present to the Supreme Court. We hope to have further evidence we
have identified that is still in the possession of the OSI.''
   Sheftel said the papers were found after news from an ``inside
leaker'' at the Justice Department. He declined to elaborate on his
alleged informant.
   One document is a memorandum of an interview with a former Nazi
prison guard, Otto Horn, who failed to identify Demjanjuk in a photo
lineup, contradicting evidence presented in court, Sheftel said.
   The other memorandum, he said, concerned a Treblinka survivor
named Rigrodsky, allegedly questioned before a 1981 trial to strip
Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship.
   Sheftel said Rigrodsky had recounted being forced to play the
violin for officers at the camp, including Demjanjuk, during a
period when Demjanjuk was said by other witnesses to have been
assigned to another camp.
   ``The accused is in effect shown in two places at the same time.
But the court verdict never referred to this contradiction,''
Sheftel said.
   Sheftel said he had heard there were also other documents
withheld from Demjanjuk' lawyers. He said he filed a motion Tuesday
with the U.S. District Court in Washington to obtain this and other
evidence from five important witnesses within 30 days.
   The lawyer said the Justice Department office ``has been hiding,
concealing and fabricating evidence.'' He argued that he needed at
least another six months to pursue the paperwork.
   Prosecutor Shaked accused Sheftel of using delay tactics. He said
the court record showed the U.S. officials had answered numerous
defense requests for information, and called the documents that
Sheftel referred to ``working papers which have no power of
evidence.''
   The Justice Department has consistently refused to comment on the
allegations, saying only that Demjanjuk's 1986 deportation was
upheld by U.S. courts.
   After consulting more than an hour, the five judges postponed a
ruling on the admissibility of the new evidence but agreed to delay
the appeals date until May.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Cocaine Kingpin With Alleged Ties to Medellin Cartel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police stormed an outlying slum and
captured the city's top drug kingpin Wednesday. He is believed to
have direct ties to Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, an official
said.
   Darcy da Silva Filho allegedly smuggled large amounts of cocaine
from the Medellin cartel to Brazil as well as neighboring Bolivia,
state police Col. Emir Campos Laranjeira said.
   ``Filho had direct contacts with drug bosses in Medellin and
Bolivia,'' Laranjeira said. ``He went there personally on several
occasions to buy. He smuggled cocaine in shipments as large as 800
pounds.''
   He said Filho, 37, sold an average of 130 pounds of cocaine in
Rio each week. That represents about 60 percent of the city's drug
trafficking operations, he said.
   ``This is perhaps the biggest drug arrest in Rio in recent
times,'' said Laranjeira. ``The repercussions of this arrest will be
far felt.''
   Early Wednesday, 120 policemen with machine guns, shotguns and
aided by helicopters began the day-long raid. They discovered the
drug traffickers in a lavishly furnished apartment at noon,
Laranjeira said.
   After an intense gunbattle, Filho's bodyguards fled and police
arrested the drug baron, his chauffeur and nephew, said Laranjeira.
   Police seized 13 pounds of cocaine paste, valued at $200,000, but
found no weapons, he said.
   The drug leader has been charged on three counts of drug
trafficking and faces up to 40 years in prison, Laranjeira said.
   Brazil traditionally has played a relatively minor role in the
South American drug trade, which is dominated by Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia. Colombia's Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels produce an
estimated 80 percent of cocaine for U.S. markets.
   But in recent years, South America's largest nation has emerged
as a key player in international trafficking, with a role in every
stage of the drug chain, from production to consumption.
   Seizures of cocaine have risen from about 200 pounds in 1981 to
more than 15 times that amount last year, according to police
figures.

   U.S. officials said Wednesday they have
trustworthy reports that Burma's military government routinely
tortures political prisoners, and it has become questionable whether
the country's election next spring will be free.
   Electric shocks, cigarette burnings, beatings and other forms of
torture were described at the State Department's daily news
briefing, and later by department witnesses who told a congressional
hearing that the Burmese junta has killed and arrested thousands in
a continuing wave of repression that began one year ago.
   Congress also heard testimony about forced labor and ``death
marches'' in Burma in which members of ethnic minorities were
rounded up, put on starvation rations and used as human minesweepers
for army units.
   Two House Foreign Affairs subcommittees unanimously approved a
resolution demanding that Burma release everyone ``imprisoned for
the peaceful expression of their views,'' investigate and punish
those accused of torture and uphold its commitment to free and fair
elections by next May.
   The legislation also urged all countries to follow the U.S. lead
in withholding foreign aid from Burma. It was sent to the full
committee and sponsors said a final floor vote would be sought this
month. The Senate last month passed a similar resolution, with
backing of the Bush administration.
   From Burma, ``we now have credible, first-hand reports that
instances of torture, beatings and mistreatment are commonplace and
that deaths have resulted,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler told reporters.
   She and Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human
rights, who testified in Congress, made similar statements
describing cigarette burnings, beatings causing severe eye and ear
injuries, electrical shocks to the genitals and immersion in water
during questioning.
   Such mistreatment along with forced loss of sleep ``appear to be
routine methods of questioning'' of thousands of detainees in Burma,
Schifter told a joint hearing of the subcommittees on human rights
and Asian and Pacific affairs.
   ``The number of Burmese killed by the government the past year is
in the thousands,'' he said. ``It may well be that the number of
Burmese killed is indeed higher'' than the count of those massacred
in China's current crackdown on its democracy movement, he said in
answer to a question.
   Burma's military government headed by General Saw Maung seized
power Sept. 18, 1988, ousting a month-old moderate civilian regime
that took over after the resignation of General Ne Win whose
18-year-rule, Schifter said, had reduced Burma ``to a state of
poverty.''
   Recent developments in Burma ``call into question the military
government's pledge that it will hold free and fair elections and
turn over power to a civilian government,'' said David F.
Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs.
   ``Recent measures ... appear designed to engineer an electoral
victory by the leading pro-government party,'' he said. Thousands of
backers of the National League for Democracy and other leading
opposition groups have been arrested since July 20, and NLD leaders
Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo are under house arrest ``virtually cut
off from the rest of the world,'' Lambertson testified.
   Schifter said the United States has not given up hope for a fair
election, ``but the situation is going to have to change, leaders of
the opposition are going to have to be given freedom ... recent
performance does not give much reason for optimism.''
   The government might well step up its ``resort to lethal force if
political opponents mounted mass public protests anew,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court OKs Auto Insurance Referendum for New Jersey</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Wednesday cleared the way
for a citizens group to put a referendum on state ballots calling
for a 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates.
   In a 2-1 decision, an Appellate Division panel of Superior Court
ruled that the referendum, sponsored by Citizens Auto Revolt, is
legal. Representatives of the insurance industry said they would
appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   The non-binding referendum is to be placed on the November ballot
in each of New Jersey's 21 counties. It urges state lawmakers to
trim auto insurance rates by 20 percent and enact several reforms of
the state insurance system.
   Lawyers for the insurance industry had argued that the
referendum's sponors acted improperly by trying to place the
initiative on each county's ballot, rather than on a statewide basis.
   But two of three judges on the panel agreed with the group's
contention that it could initiate a statewide referendum through the
counties.
   ``This is a very exciting and important decision,'' said Jay
Angoff, executive director of the reform group. ``It shows that a
citizens group can fight back against an industry as powerful as the
insurance industry by going directly to the people.''
   Michael Herbert, an attorney representing the insurance industry,
said the referendum would confuse voters and ``create turmoil.''
   In addition to the rollback in auto insurance costs, the
referendum urges state lawmakers to initiate reforms that include
the scrapping of the Joint Underwriting Association pool for high
risk drivers and the elimination of the insurance industry's
exemption to the anti-trust laws governing price-fixing.

   East Germany's Communist leaders are demanding that
Hungary stop allowing East Germans to flee to West Germany by the
thousands in an exodus that is draining their labor pool of young,
skilled workers.
   About 11,000 refugees had arrived by Tuesday night and West
German border officials said the mass trek to the West may have
peaked. There were indications East Berlin had begun restricting
travel to Hungary.
   The refugees have traveled by car, train and bus through Austria
to their new homeland since midnight Sunday, when Hungary suspended
a 1969 agreement with East Germany and opened its border to the
refugees.
   The border officials said the number of refugees, who are granted
automatic citizenship in West Germany, could top 15,000. In West
Germany, the new arrivals crowded relocation camps and were greeted
with plenty of job offers.

   The Bush administration is gearing up for a
major campaign to encourage Americans to save more money and urge
U.S. companies to make long-term investments rather than chasing
fast-buck takeover deals.
   ``We've been willing to mortgage our future, to sacrifice quality

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day in El
Salvador's guerrilla war, khaki-clad commandos of an unsung assault
force have descended on war zones armed only with ratchets, pulleys
and shovels.
   They are the intrepid electric-power linemen who replace towers
toppled by guerrilla sabotage, raise tons of downed cable and keep
the country's lights on in the midst of civil war.
   They have seen companions killed and maimed by mines or in cross
fires and now they are delighted with the announcement by the
anti-government guerrillas of an indefinite end to sabotage as of
Sept. 10.
   The linemen, however, have plenty to keep them busy for months
without new damage to the network of high-tension cables
criss-crossing El Salvador, a nation about the size of Massachusetts.
   ``Halting the sabotage is good, because everybody is favored by
it,'' said lineman Roberto Segovia. ``But let's see what the
government offers in exchange, to show it is really interested in
peace and ending the war for good.''
   He was one of 30 linemen working to replace six poles bombed
recently along a major transmission line traversing a high flank of
the volcano looming northwest of San Salvador, the capital city.
   Segovia was wounded in the face by shrapnel in 1986 when a
soldier near him stepped on a mine at a sabotaged site.
   Although mines have killed one lineman and wounded seven since
1981, the linemen don't speak harshly of the Marxist-led guerrillas
who have been fighting the government for nearly a decade.
   Antonio Ramirez, a lineman whose left arm was partly disabled by
shrapnel in 1981, said guerrillas sometimes visit the workers at job
sites and the meetings are cordial.
   Describing an encounter late last year, he said: ``We talked
about things in general. Then all gave each other Christmas embraces
before they went off.''
   Almost all of the linemen are members of a militant union,
veterans of labor battles that have given their views a tone similar
to that of many positions expressed by the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, the guerrilla organization.
   The front said in its announcement Sept. 7 that its suspension of
sabotage and the use of mines was for ``a sufficiently prudent time
for the government and armed forces to carry out reciprocal gestures
that contribute to a serious climate of negotiation.''
   The government's immediate response was that the suspension would
permit the guerrillas to evacuate their wounded.
   A subsequent broadcast on the guerrillas' clandestine radio said,
``Sabotage has played a strategic role in the war, preventing the
regime from spending all its money on arms. Sabotage has undermined
the war economy, and its effectiveness has been undeniable.''
   Sabotage of the electric-power system has cost the country more
than $100 million since the war began, and it has been getting
steadily worse. Last year was the worst to date with 539 bombings of
major lines. Through August of this year, 451 bombings of such lines
were recorded _ a rate that would easily have surpassed 1988 had
sabotage continued.
   However, the United States, through the Agency for International
Development (AID), pays virtually all the repairs to damaged power
lines. It has provided more than $3.5 billion in military and
economic aid this decade in an effort to prevent a rebel victory,
making El Salvador by far the hemisphere's biggest recipient of U.S.
assistance.
   ``Without AID, we couldn't survive,'' said Mauricio Arevalo,
superintendent of line maintainance, who oversees the 90 linemen,
five engineers and five foremen who keep the power flowing
nationwide.
   AID provided the two Bell 212 helicopters that transport the
workers and carry, dangling from a cable, the 40-foot pine poles,
also donated by AID, that hold the lines.
   The steel towers used originally now lie twisted and rusting
along transmission routes.
   ``Between 75 and 80 percent of our metal structures have been
destroyed,'' said Arevalo, on the volcano with his men. ``We replace
them with poles because it's much cheaper and they are much more
mobile.''
   A lineman with 20 years experience earns the equivalent of about
$280 a month, including the 35-percent raise that was the result of
a bitter 21-day strike last year, plus $7,000 life insurance
policies. El Salvador's minimum wage is $100 a month but $280 a
month is about what a teacher or factory worker would earn. The
linemen maintain that their wages and compensation are inadequate.
   Raul Mendez, who lost his right leg below the knee to a mine in
1986, said he received $3,500 in compensation and continues working
with a prosthesis.
   Asked if he resented the guerrillas who planted the mine, he
said: ``Not at all. It's the kind of thing that happens in this line
of work.''

   Could it be just a coincidence that 99 percent
of the quarterbacks, 98 percent of the kickers and 97 percent of the
centers in professional football in 1983 were whites _ while 82
percent of kickoff returners, 88 percent of running backs and 92
percent of cornerbacks were blacks?
   It couldn't be, and it isn't, says sociologist D. Stanley Eitzen,
who has taken on _ and ripped to shreds _ the proposition that the
world of sports is at least one place in America that's free of
racial discrimination.
   Club owners, coaches, players and fans are united in the desire
to win and so the color of the players doesn't matter as long as
they perform _ right?
   Wrong, says this scholar, and tragically wrong for millions of
black youngsters who put all their energies into preparing for a
career as an athlete and wind up unable to play and unable to do
anything else well enough to earn a living at it.
   Eitzen is a professor of sociology at Colorado State University
and a former president of the North American Society for the
Sociology of Sport. When the National Academy of Sciences asked
scholars and experts to write a report on the status of blacks in
American society today, they farmed out the research to other
scholars and experts. Eitzen wrote the paper on black athletes.
   The academy's final report, ``A Common Destiny: Blacks and
American Society,'' came out this summer. Its overall conclusion was
that whatever progress was made in improving the status of blacks
occurred before the early 1970s. Since then, ``the status of blacks
relative to whites has stagnated or regressed.''
   The report paid little attention to Eitzen's research on racism
in sports, but the academy made a copy available to The Associated
Press.
   Eitzen is no more cheerful about the status of blacks in sports
than the committee was about blacks in society overall, even though
four out of five basketball players, half the football players and a
fifth of the baseball players in the big leagues are black.
   ``Rather than being free from racism, sport as a microcosm of the
larger society reflects the same racial problems,'' he says.
   Applying sociology's use of statistics to sports, he concludes:
   _If you are a black player, you've got to be considerably better
than a competing white to be signed to a professional contract.
   _If you're black, expect to play the less-prestige positions: the
ones that require brawn, not brains.
   _Since those positions are the ones in which you'll take more of
a physical punishment, your playing career will be shorter and your
career earnings from sports less than if you were white.
   _If you're the black parents of a talented athlete, think again
if you believe that sports is your son's entree to the good life.
   Sports as a ``mobility escalator'' _ as an escape hatch _ is a
dead end for almost all, he says.
   The majority would be better off stretching their minds than
their muscles; America doesn't have jobs for washed-out potential
athletes who know nothing but sports.
   ``Many boys work very hard to become great in sport, but only a
very few will be successful,'' Eitzen said. ``They spend many hours
per day developing their speed, strength and `moves' to the virtual
exclusion of those abilities that have a greater likelihood of
paying off in upward mobility _ mathematical reasoning and
communication skills.''
   On the playing fields and courts, central positions calling for
leadership and control go to white players, the research said,
citing the statistics on football positions.
   ``It is inconceivable that blacks lack the ability to play these
positions at the professional level,'' Eitzen said.
   ``Placekick holders must, for example, have good hands, an
important quality for pass receivers.''
   But a 1973 study of all players whose names appeared in the
Football Register found that two-thirds of professional pass
receivers were black while all the placekick holders were whites.
   To show that ``black players must be better than white players to
succeed in the sports world,'' Eitzen cites research which compared
big league batting averages. It shows that blacks batted, on
average, 20 points better than their white counterparts. He
concludes that blacks who play ``only'' as good as whites won't be
offered contracts.
   How else, he asks, explain statistics like these: big league
black pitchers in 1967 won an average of 10.2 games; white pitchers
that year won 7.5 each on average; in basketball, blacks' career
scoring averages were 11.1 points per game, compared to 9.3 for
whites.
   Where is the black who scores only 9.3 points per game? Less
likely to play than a white, with that score, and Eitzen says that's
proof of racism.

   He was the most brilliant defense attorney in
the state of Indiana and it was the most important case of his
career, yet Lloyd Bridges plays him as a man who was happy to lose.
   It was 1925, and Eph Inman's client was David Curtis Stephenson,
grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and the most powerful man in
Indiana.
   The story of Stephenson's trial is told in the upcoming NBC
miniseries ``Cross of Fire.'' He was tried for second-degree murder
in the death of a young woman he had held captive and attacked.
   ``Eph Inman was considered the best lawyer in Indiana,'' Bridges
said, ``and Stephenson wanted the best for his defense. Eph was
shrewd and folksy. We see that he was very clever, but he didn't
have much to work with. Stephenson didn't have much character.
   ``I think in the end he was glad he didn't succeed in getting him
off. He lost very few cases. It was the most important case of its
time and if he had won it would have been another feather in his
cap.''
   The case destroyed the Klan in Indiana. Stephenson, angered that
Gov. Ed Jackson wouldn't pardon him, released his ``little black
box.'' Its contents sent a congressman, the mayor of Indianapolis,
the sheriff of Marion County and numerous other officials to prison.
Jackson was indicted for bribery, but the statute of limitations
saved him.
   John Heard stars as Stephenson, Mel Harris is Madge Oberholtzer,
the young woman who falls for the charismatic Klan leader, and David
Morse is the small- town prosecutor who wins a conviction. The
two-part, four-hour miniseries will be telecast this fall.
   Bridges will also be seen later this season in the ABC midseason
series ``Capital News'' and has just completed wok on a feature
film, ``Joe Vs. the Volcano.''
   ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``I was able to work the two movies
into my schedule before starting the series. There aren't that many
good stories around. We filmed my scenes for `Cross of Fire' in
Lawrence, Kan. I'm only in the second part. Mine were all courtroom
scenes.''
   In ``Joe Vs. the Volcano,'' Bridges stars with Meg Ryan, who
plays his daughter, and with Tom Hanks.
   ``I get him to jump into a volcano for a price,'' he said. ``I
play an entrepreneur who has a chance to get the mineral rights to
an island in the South Pacific. But the chief won't sell it to me
because island legend has it that someone has to jump into the
volcano every hundred years or the island will sink.''
   His new series, ``Capital News,'' focuses on the metropolitan
desk of a major Washington newspaper. It was created by David Milch
of ``Hill Street Blues'' and Christian Williams, formerly with The
Washington Post.
   ``I play the editor,'' said Bridges. ``He's a man who doesn't
stand for any nonsense. He wants people to do the job properly and
he doesn't mince words if he's unhappy. He encourages his people to
go after the issues.''
   It's the seventh series for Bridges, who began with the
syndicated ``Sea Hunt'' in 1957. Other series: ``The Lloyd Bridges
Show,'' ``The Loner,'' ``San Francisco International Airport,''
``Joe Forrester'' and ``Paper Dolls.''
   He has starred in numerous TV movies and such miniseries as
``Roots,'' ``East of Eden,'' ``Moviola,'' ``George Washington'' and
``The Blue and the Gray.''
   His sons, Beau and Jeff, appear together in the feature film
``The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' They play a couple of nightclub piano
players who take on a girl singer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer.
Lloyd was in ``Tucker'' with Jeff and he and Beau have been in
several productions. Beau has also directed him in several shows.
   ``All three of us have never done anything together,'' he said.
``It's difficult to find the right part. Jeff is now doing
`Texasville' and Beau is up for a picture. He wants me to play the
father if I can squeeze it in.''

<HEAD>Carrying A Financial Umbrella</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A person delivering a pizza falls on your
slippery front step.
   Or an unfriendly neighbor sues you for slander after an argument.
   Or the guests at a recent party claim the food you served made
them sick.
   These are but a sampling of the everyday risks people run in a
society where going to court often seems far from the last resort.
   ``In this lawsuit-crazy age you can be ordered to pay damages for
any number of reasons, including personal injury, character
defamation, even mental anguish,'' says Jonathan Pond of Financial
Planning Information Inc. in Watertown, Mass.
   Standard home and car insurance policies may provide you with
considerable protection from this peril. But what if a court award
exceeds the limits of your liability coverage?
   Then your assets _ your home and savings, even a portion of your
future earnings _ could be at risk.
   To protect yourself against such an eventuality, Pond and other
students of the subject suggest looking into extended personal
liability insurance, popularly known as an ``umbrella'' policy.
   ``An umbrella policy ideally serves two purposes,'' says William
Brennan at the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young.
   ``First, it increases the primary liability coverage limits on
basic policies such as automobile and homeowners. Second, umbrella
insurance broadens the primary coverage by insuring against claims
that may be excluded in the primary policies.''
   Enough!, a beleagured consumer may protest at about this point _
if I buy every kind of insurance they want to sell me, I won't have
anything left to lose. Besides, it's a fool's errand to try to
insulate yourself from every risk in life.
   Perhaps so. But in this case, Brennan says, a little money in
premiums paid on umbrella insurance goes a long way.
   The first $1 million in umbrella protection typically costs
between $100 and $200 a year. For $1 million increments above that,
the premiums are even smaller.
   ``Because umbrella insurance offers enormous coverage for a small
premium, the added coverage should be viewed as a necessity and a
wise investment,'' Brennan contends.
   Before you decide on any given umbrella, advisers say, you should
examine it for leaks.
   ``Normally,'' says Pond, ``all liability costs not related to
your occupation are covered, including legal defense costs. However,
exclusions on individual policies will vary. Therefore, it is
important to understand all policy provisions.''
   That phrase ``not related to your occupation'' is one important
exception. Umbrellas generally don't cover problems that can arise
in the line of duty, whether the case involves medical malpractice
or copyright infringement by a writer or artist.
   In these cases, professional liability insurance is recommended.
   ``Also, there can be significant gaps between the upper limits of
your primary policies and the initial coverage limits of an umbrella
policy,'' Brennan notes.
   ``You and your insurance agent should work together to minimize
or eliminate any gaps.''
   Since the primary and umbrella coverage needs to be matched
together, Pond adds, it is usual practice to seek umbrella insurance
from the same source as your auto or homeowners coverage.
   ``It is like a major medical policy that takes over where your
basic policy ends,'' he says.

<TEXT>
   A solution has been found to one of the most
distressing events in the life of small-business founders and
operators, one that allows them to have their company and financial
security too.
   It turns what could have been a sad event into a triumph, one
that in many instances produces a win-win-win situation involving a
relieved seller, a happy buyer and satisfied lenders.
   The event develops when a founder must sell out to raise funds,
perhaps to finance eventual retirement. Traditionally, more than
only a business is sold; in the package also are skills, hopes, and
sweat that built it.
   Even more. The company, a monument to the founder and 12-hour
days, may be bought by a larger company that puts a less dedicated
9-to-5 manager in charge. Sales fade. In a few years the company
disappears.
   No monument. No tombstone. Not even a memory.
   Sanford Ziff escaped that fate, which was common a few years ago.
He got full price for his 100-unit retail chain, put money in the
bank, remained in control, provided for his son's participation,
received funds to expand, and obtained an investment in a
first-class, rationally structured company.
   That, or other seemingly impossible feats, is the combined result
of more creative lending _ itself a consequence of bank deregulation
_ more enterprising investment groups, and ingenious
``boutique''investment advisers.
   Alan K. Wells, who helped put the Ziff deal together, is one.
Acting for the seller, his firm, Bollinger, Wells, Lett &amp; Co. brings
the parties together, determines the needs of each and somehow
merges the different interests.
   It's a touchy, time-consuming business involving intimate
knowledge of the seller's needs, the interests of potential buyers
and the possibilities for creative financing. It involves no
boilerplate. Each deal is unique.
   Overly simplified, a price, perhaps $20 million, is set by Wells
and the seller. Wells already has a list of investment groups that
might consider the deal. One is acceptable. With Wells, the parties
sit down to discussions.
   ``You never know the shape of the table in advance,'' says Wells.
He and his client at one moment might be confronting the buyer, but
shortly thereafter joining the buyer as an investor in the new
capitalized company.
   The buyer and its investors, often including Wells, his client
and maybe some of the client's family, seek financing. Generally,
they put up a relatively small amount, borrowing the rest.
   That small investment, however, can capture sizeable ownership.
The reason: Because the recapitalization involves large amounts of
debt, the equity value of the company shrinks, perhaps from $20
million to $1 million.
   Therefore, to buy 10 percent of the financially restructured
company costs only $100,000, which generally makes the
entrepreneur-seller happy.
   It should. The entrepreneur gets liquidity, estate planning and
assured survival of his heritage. He or she keeps ongoing control of
the future without great personal risk, because much of the risk has
been transferred to lenders.
   And, Wells insists, ``freed from worries, protected from lenders
by covenants, the entrepreneur becomes a better manager,'' able to
concentrate on expanding the market, which he knows, rather than
tedious back-office details.
   Others are happy too, says Wells. Lender and buyer get good
management, and participation in a company with cash flow to handle
repayments and growth to retire debt. Lenders get a good return, and
maybe the chance to convert debt to equity as the company grows.
   Wells says the process beats the way deals were done just five
years ago. Then, he says, small companies simply were bought out by
large companies. ``In two years the manager was gone. Five years
later the company was gone.''
   Now, he says, the manager and his family have liquidity, key
employees have stock, control is retained. And, recapitalized, the
company leaps the divide that keeps small companies from growing
large.

   Arthur ``Bud'' Brown was 79 when he died,
but Florence Brown remembers her husband as a younger man _ not the
man who lay in the casket but the one in the videotape playing on a
TV screen behind it.
   There he was, flanked by three friends as he sat proudly in the
'29 Chevy roadster he used to court his wife. Cut to a 1952 photo,
the Browns at a party thrown by merchants on Garland Avenue. In one
from the mid-1970s, Brown is at the wheel of the motor home that
took the couple on scenic vacations.
   The six-minute video played at Brown's funeral July 28
interspersed family snapshots with stills of majestic Northwest
sunsets, lakes and mountains, all to the tune of ``Just A Closer
Walk With Thee,'' his favorite gospel song.
   ``We thought it was wonderful,'' said Mrs. Brown. ``So many of
the people that were there that I have seen and talked to since
couldn't just get over the beauty of the whole thing. I had several
say that it was so beautiful that they almost clapped for approval.
They just thought it added a lot to the funeral.''
   The ``Tribute'' video is the brainchild of Merrill Womach,
founder and president of National Music Service, a Spokane company
that has been providing recorded music and sound systems to funeral
homes and mausoleums since 1958.
   ``I first thought about it when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
I looked at all the things that were done for him, and rightfully
so,'' Womach said.
   ``And I thought to myself, `Why can't a tribute be paid to us
normal peons rather than just reserved for heads of state? Do not
our families love us as much as JFK was loved?' I think everbody
who's lived deserves a memorialization or a tribute paid to their
life, no matter whether they were a president or a king or a brick
layer or a garbage collector.''
   The idea got sidetracked until Womach's mother died 3{ years ago.
He remembered seeing her in a nursing home in her last three months,
haggard and weakened from several strokes. Every time he thought of
his mother, it was this somber scene. Then last year, he gathered
some old family album pictures of her cheerful, spirited and
smiling. The pictures were reproduced onto videotape.
   ``Now when I think of my mother, you know what comes to my mind?
Instantly it's that picture on the video.''
   Several thousand ``Tribute'' videos have been sold in 17 states,
most through funeral homes, since they were introduced in April. The
videos, which can be played on a standard VHS recorder, cost an
average $100-$125. The music comes from National Music's 2,500-title
library and is recorded with the company's proprietary process.
   Acquaintances of actress Amanda Blake _ Miss Kitty in the TV
series ``Gunsmoke'' _ bought a ``Tribute'' video that was played on
a huge TV monitor at her Aug. 24 memorial service in Sacramento,
Calif.
   ``What we're trying to do is to celebrate the life of the
individual. We resurrect a memory,'' said Womach, who almost died in
a Thanksgiving 1961 plane crash and has had a ``Tribute'' produced
of himself.
   Partly because of the soaring demand for its videos, National
Music plans to double its staff of 100 next year.
   ``It's a very meaningful way to express a person's life and how
he lived it,'' said Larry Rayburn, a funeral director at Riplinger
Funeral Home, where ``Tribute'' tapes have been played at about 15
funerals, including Brown's.
   ``I personally think funeral services are something people do not
like to go to,'' Rayburn said. ``This is a way ... to notice that a
death has occurred but also to celebrate a person's life.''
   In Warren, Mich., the family of a 5-year-old girl killed in a car
accident ordered a ``Tribute'' video after her funeral. Don
Temrowski, director of D.S. Temrowski Funeral Home, said the death
was especially traumatic because the girl died in her stepfather's
arms and her body was grossly disfigured.
   After viewing the videotape, the girl's mother remarked, ``My
baby will live on continually,'' Temrowski said.
   Cathy Robertson of Sandpoint, Idaho, who works in a funeral home,
ordered a video of her parents, who died within three months of each
other.
   ``It has been five years since they passed away and it's almost
like having them back for those few minutes,'' she wrote to Womach.
``I have watched my 11-year-old daughter watch it over and over .. .
   ``What a beautiful and lasting remembrance to pass on to the
grandchildren, especially the younger one when the memories are
starting to fade. Yes we have picture albums, but there is something
very different about the video.''

<HEAD>Tim Robbins Takes on Religious Con Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tim Robbins, the lanky co-star of
``Bull Durham'' and ``Miss Firecracker,'' is trying his hand as a
playwright and director of a play that takes a biting look at
religious con artists and other media manipulators.
   Co-written with Adam Simon, ``Carnage,'' an unruly satire on
religious evangelism, was one of two American entries in this year's
Edinburgh International Festival. Robbins directs but does not
appear in the play, which opens off-Broadway Sept. 17 at the Public
Theater for a month-long run.
   ``It's kind of like our Boston, our New Haven,'' Robbins said
with a laugh in the wee hours one recent morning at the St. Bride's
Center in Edinburgh, where ``Carnage'' recently finished seven
performances.
   ``Carnage'' marks the New York debut of The Actors' Gang, a
14-member ensemble from Los Angeles, most of whom were classmates at
the University of California at Los Angeles, Robbins' alma mater.
Although the Gang has been mounting knockabout productions of such
classic plays as ``Ubu Roi'' since 1981, they lately have opted for
original scripts with a satiric and political bent.
   ``Carnage'' takes aim at fundamentalism in the United States,
mocking such evangelists as Jimmy Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker, as well as a public that can hero-worship Col. Oliver North.
Although none of these people is mentioned by name, they are all
implicated in the play's absurdist brew.
   The play opened to fine reviews in Los Angeles last year
following a 1987 workshop, but critics in Edinburgh were divided.
   Martin Hoyle in the Financial Times praised the ``cartoon-strip
robustness'' of Robbins' direction, adding that it made a welcome
change from ``so much prissiness on the English stage.'' But Charles
Osborne in The Daily Telegraph said that ``its savagery is toothless
... and the finale collapses into bathos.''
   Robbins admitted that the production was still being fine-tuned,
but said he expected conflicting reactions.
   ``We try to produce plays that raise questions rather than
provide answers,'' the boyish 30-year-old said between puffs of a
cigarette after a late-night performance.
   ``I personally do not care for theater that is just purely
entertaining; I like to be challenged. I think that's more important
than having a play that everyone smiles at, enjoys thoroughly and
forgets the second they leave the theater.''
   He said he and Simon, a 27-year-old graduate of Harvard
University, wrote ``Carnage'' to confront ``rapturism and the
dangers of that, which no one in the press was talking about.''
   Of wayward evangelists, Robbins said: ``I think it's
irresponsible to just write it off as these people being corrupt
financially or sexually, when they're indeed more corrupt in a much
more insidious way.
   ``For some reason, people within the media in the United States
are afraid of Born Again Christians, as if they have some kind of
majority _ as if the Moral Majority really was a majority,'' he said.
   Robbins thinks he may get a rough ride from the New York critics,
because he thinks they are biased against Los Angeles drama, and
because ``political drama in America is really not encouraged. You
try to say something, and unless you hit it spot on, people tear you
apart.''
   He has kept the Actors' Gang afloat with proceeds from his
supporting roles in movies such as ``Howard the Duck'' and ``The
Sure Thing.'' But that is more difficult now that he has a
4-month-old son by Susan Sarandon, his ``Bull Durham'' co-star.
   In ``Bull Durham,'' the hit baseball movie of 1988, he played a
klutzy pitcher opposite Kevin Costner. In ``Miss Firecracker,'' he
was the deranged, philosophizing cousin of Holly Hunter. He will
next be seen this fall in the title role of ``Erik the Viking,'' a
comedy directed by Terry Jones, formerly of the Monty Python comedy
troupe.
   Co-starring John Cleese and Mickey Rooney and filmed in Britain
last winter, ``Erik'' is ``a very sweet story,'' Robbins said.

   The white men called it ``next year'' country.
   Next year the rains will come, the prairie fires (or locust or
'hoppers or blizzards) won't. Next year the price of wheat will be
up, taxes down. Next year the bank'll be paid off, the truck'll be
paid up, the cows'll pay for themselves.
   That's the American West: Next Year Country.
   Except this year.
   This year North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington are
celebrating their 100th birthdays, and they're having a rip-roarin'
party stetching most of the way from the Missouri River to the
Pacific Ocean.
   Wyoming and Idaho have caught the spirit, too, because next year
marks their centennials. If you missed the huge barbecues, cattle
drives, rodeos, fairs, powwows, fishing tournaments, parades,
dances, and the 101 other festivities this year, Idaho and Wyoming
promise encores in '90.
   President Bush, who earlier took part in North Dakota's
centennial observance, heads to Sioux Falls, S.D., and Helena,
Mont., on Monday to join in festivities, then on to Spokane, Wash.,
on Tuesday.
   Centennial celebrations are milestones measured long ago in much
of the rest of the nation. Virginians, Floridians, even Missourians,
may wonder: Why all the fuss?
   Well, the West has always been America's young upstart, the
shirttail relative of the establishment East, the antebellum South,
the Spanish Southwest, the conservative, agrarian Midwest.
   But in the 1980s, the West has come of age and come into its own.
It has a cachet sought by CEOs as well as collegians. Everywhere you
look, from Hollywood's movies to Detroit's cars (Mustang, Cherokee,
Dakota, Bronco) to Ralph Lauren's and Calvin Klein's designer denim
fashion, the West is IN.
   Ask Bill Cody, the 76-year-old grandson of Buffalo Bill. ``When I
was born, Granddad was one of the most famous men in the world,''
said Cody, a lookalike for the old showman. ``Even today, I go to
Singapore, Greece, Europe _ hell, even Sri Lanka _ and the locals
know about the West because of Buffalo Bill.''
   Although Thomas Jefferson never saw the West, the third president
heard the siren singing in the lonely wind there and he had a
vision. He traveled only as far as Harper's Ferry, W.Va., but
imagined the fledgling United States stretching from the Potomac to
the Columbia River, south to the mouth of the Mississippi, and north
to the headwaters of the Missouri.
   ``All eyes, all hopes, are now fixed on you,'' Jefferson wrote in
January 1803 to James Monroe, urging him to be his special envoy to
France and negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. ``On the event of this
mission depends the future destinies of this republic.''
   Monroe pulled it off. For $15 million, the United States acquired
the entire 830,000-square-mile territory claimed by France in the
New World.
   Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Bernard De Voto described it as
one of the most important events in history.
   ``Not only did it double the area of the United States, not only
did it add to our wealth resources of incalculable value, not only
did it provide a potential that was certain to make us a great
power, not only did it make equally certain that we would expand
beyond the Rockies to the Pacific ... it also provided the
centripetal, unifying force that would hold the nation firm against
disruptive forces from within,'' wrote De Voto.
   Even before his diplomats had sealed the deal, Jefferson had
secretly asked Congress for $2,500 to cover the cost of dispatching
an expedition up the Missouri River and on to the Pacific ``for the
purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States.''
The reason was a red herring, innocuous so as not to alarm the
British or Spanish who still held enormous tracts in North America.
   But it was excuse enough for Army Capts. Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, co-commanders, to leap at the opportunity to chart a
map marked ``Unknown.''
   Lewis, who grew up on a farm called Locust Hill only 10 miles by
straight gallop northwest of Jefferson's Virginia estate Monticello,
called the chance to explore the West ``a darling project of my
heart.''
   Young Albert Gallatin, an immigrant from Switzerland who had a
good head for numbers, was Jefferson's treasury secretary and
therefore responsible for paying the venture's bills. Lewis and
Clark remembered by christening a river after him.
   Today the Gallatin name is attached to many western landmarks,
including a Montana county and the Bozeman airport. Gallatin's
oldest living descendant, Beatrice Gallatin Beuf, 82, lives just
over the Montana border in Big Horn, Wyo.
   ``When my father bought this ranch in 1911 we traveled by train
from New York to Sheridan, and there were hitching posts on Main
Street and nothing was paved,'' she recalled. ``We were met at the
station by a wagon pulled by four horses, their tails tied up in mud
knots. It took us four hours to travel 13 miles.''
   Mrs. Beuf's ranch reaches into the Big Horn Mountains, where she
still rides her Arabian mare every fair day. It was she who was
asked to sit next to Queen Elizabeth II, when the monarch dined in
Big Horn on a 1984 private visit, and regale her with stories.
   ``This is a place where the glamorous days of the cowboy are just
over your shoulder,'' said Mrs. Beuf. ``You're not choked in with
people troubles. Here your troubles are big ones: drought, too much
snow, a wind that can carry you away. Here we live with the great
realities of life.''
   After Lewis and Clark came the mountain men. The traders
followed, paddling up the Missouri and the Yellowstone rivers. As
the buffalo massacres decimated the herds, cattlemen from as far
away as the Rio Grande and even the Clyde in Scotland saw the
potential and shrewdly staked out giant ranches.
   When gold was discovered, miners stampeded for Dakota Territory
by the thousands, enterprising merchants hot on their heels.
Finally, with the 1862 Homestead Act promising 160 acres to anyone
with a strong back and the means to claim the land, sodbusters
followed.

   His father was a commercial fisherman.
So was his father's father. It follows, then, that Randy Babich was
expected to become ... a dentist?
   ``Every fisherman tried to coax his son into something other than
fishing. They thought a steady job on land, with a steady paycheck,
was less risky,'' Babich said the other day, sitting on the family
dock and thinking how lucky he was to have rejected that advice.
   Like his forebears, Randy Babich has chosen the sea. In doing so,
he helps to preserve a maritime heritage that has distinguished
Washington's development since the first white settlers arrived.
   Sea traders plied the coast starting in the 1700s, looking for
furs. Even after the railroad arrived in 1883, most settlers who
rode the rails westward passed up Washington's arid eastern plains,
preferring tidewater towns such as Seattle and Tacoma.
   Unlike much of the Pacific coast, where great ocean swells
pounded the shore, Washington's island-studded Puget Sound offered
miles of protected coastline. Salmon and other fish were abundant,
and the waterways became highways for ships hauling timber cut from
tall forests.
   Randy's grandfather, Spiro Babich, came from Yugoslavia in 1910,
about 40 years after the first whites settled in Gig Harbor. Two of
the town's founders were Yugoslav fishermen, and they started a
Slavic connection still obvious in the local phone book, where
Jerisich, Markovich and Stanich are well represented.
   Spiro Babich was a typical immigrant: He had no money and spoke
no English, but he learned fast. He soon had his own boat and used
it to zealously pursue salmon. It's said he used to pray for bad
weather so the timid would go ashore and leave more fish for him.
When he died at 67, he was planning to fish the next summer.
   One of his two boats went to son Peter, who fished until retiring
last year at 65. ``Talk about a duck out of water,'' Randy Babich
said of his father. ``He's going to be leasing a boat for the fall,
just so he can go out and fish once a week.''
   Randy, 39, with a bachelor's degree from the University of
Washington, could have avoided the dangerous fisherman's life. But
his exposure to the workaday world of landlubbers gave him an
appreciation of fishing that his grandfather's generation couldn't
match.
   ``If they knew about commuting to work every day on the freeway,
fighting traffic, they'd have come home and kissed their deck
winch,'' said Babich.
   Fishing today is easier in many ways. While his grandfather
pulled up heavy, tarred-cotton nets by hand, Randy Babich uses a
power winch to haul nylon nets aboard the Paragon, his 56-foot
seiner.
   But hazards remain. The weather is as unpredictable as ever, and
Babich, like most Washington fishermen, now must motor up to the
distant waters of Alaska to make a living. He complains about strict
regulations, foreign competition and outrageous insurance rates.
   Lately his son, Stefan, 19, has been helping on the boat. But
just to work his way through school, you understand.
   ``I encourage him not to follow fishing,'' Babich said.

<DATELINE>LVOV, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A half-century ago as Adolf Hitler's war
machine was crushing Polish resistance to the west, Josef Stalin
sent the Red Army to wrest this city of forested hills and medieval
churches from eastern Poland.
   For Lvov's Ukrainian population, the outbreak of World War II in
September 1939 was the beginning of a bloody new series of battles
across their land.
   It ended, just as the feuding of Russians, Germans, Swedes,
Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians in this area had ended for
centuries, with Lvov being incorporated into a new country.
   Now, a stubborn streak of nationalism has reappeared, denouncing
both Polish and Soviet rule as occupation and seeking to encompass
all of the Soviet Union's second-most populous republic in what
nationalists dream will one day be an independent Ukraine.
   To make that point, a small group of organizers planned an
open-air religious service, march and rally for Sunday to mark the
day Soviet troops marched into Poland. They expected 100,000 people
to take part.
   ``This will be a day of mourning,'' said Ivan Gel, the head of
the lay council of an underground Ukrainian church loyal to the
Vatican but outlawed since the area's incorporation into the Soviet
Union.
   Soviet control began Sept. 17, 1939, two and a half weeks after
Hitler started World War II by attacking Poland and less than a
month after he and Stalin reached a non-aggression agreement with a
secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.
   The Red Army moved into Poland along a broad front encompassing
what is now the western portions of the Ukraine and Byelorussia
republics of the Soviet Union.
   ``This was aggression, and a second occupation after the
occupation by Poland,'' said Bogdan Gorin, a leader of the Ukrainian
Helsinki group, which was formed to monitor human rights in the
republic of 52 million people.
   Before World War I, Lvov as well as Poland itself, was part of
the Russian empire. After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, Polish and
Soviet armies fought back and forth between Warsaw and Kiev before a
peace finally gave the western Ukraine to Poland.
   The Soviet Union retained the rest of the Ukraine, which suffered
severely through collectivization and famine during the 1930s.
   Oleg Vitovich, a 23-year-old factory worker and Helsinki group
member, said that in the context of the Nazi attack on western
Poland, Lvov residents were friendly to the Soviet soldiers when
they arrived in 1939.
   But almost two years of deportations and executions followed,
until the Nazis invaded and seized the territory. It stayed under
German control for three years.
   Despite the cruelty of the Nazis, the attitude toward the Soviet
soldiers had changed, Vitovich said. ``By 1944, when the Red Army
came through here on its way to Berlin, the people didn't meet them
with flowers, but with guns in their hands, with bullets,'' he said.
   Armed bands of Ukrainians held out against Soviet power in the
hills of the western Ukraine for almost a decade after the war ended
in 1945.
   Resistance to Soviet domination has resurfaced, much as it has in
the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to the north
and in Moldavia to the south.
   Lvov activists joined enthusiastically with more than 1,000 other
Ukrainians in the republic's capital of Kiev on Sept. 8-10 to found
the Narodny Ruk, a grassroots political movement. The movement takes
in environmentalists, a Ukrainian language society and the local
affiliate of a national organization dedicated to the memory of the
victims of Stalin's terror.
   Even though the movement still is in its infancy, the prospect of
growing Ukrainian demands for independence is a troubling one for
the Soviet Union.
   It is one thing when the Baltic republics with less than 8
million people demand sovereignty, but quite another if the Ukraine,
with a powerful industrial and agricultural base and close ethnic
ties to Russia, does the same.
   The Ukraine's Communist Party leadership has moved slowly in
coming to grips with demands by informal political groups. But it is
considering legislation that would make Ukrainian the official
language. Such laws have been the starting point for strong ethnic
movements in other Soviet regions.
   Ukrainians have flooded a downtown Lvov park with flowers in an
informal memorial to their national poet, Taras Shevchenko. The
yellow-and-blue Ukrainian national flag, representing golden wheat
and blue sky, flies constantly. Crowds gather to debate the latest
political news and sing Ukrainian national songs.
   Ivan G. Postoronko, the Communist Party chief in the
Ivano-Frankovsk region of the western Ukraine, told a party meeting
in Moscow in July that the activity of the underground Ukrainian
Catholic, or Uniate, Church was increasing alarmingly.
   ``The so-called Uniate question is nothing more than a cover for
nationalism,'' he said.
   When World War II came, some Ukrainians cooperated with the
Nazis, and in its official accounts the Soviet Union blames the
resistance after World War II on collaborators. The official version
is especially harsh on the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   The church was forced to merge with the Russian Orthodox Church
after the war and believers were repressed, but it has continued to
exist. Ukrainian nationalists are demanding that the church be
legalized.
   Vitovich said the Helsinki group is seeking to work with other
informal political groups to gradually win more freedom for the
republic.
   ``Without the establishment of sovereignty, return of our
national symbols and self-accounting, it's not possible to solve the
separate language problem,'' Vitovich said. ``It can be solved only
as a complex.''

   Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the
jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first
entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a
show called ``G.I. Journal.''
   ``I really can't remember many details about it,'' said Hope, who
pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday
night. It's called ``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball.'' She
died in April of this year.
   That first time together was followed by four movies, frequent
visits by Hope on ``I Love Lucy'' and regular appearances by Lucy on
his television shows.
   ``Lucy was a very funny woman,'' Hope said. ``Even in private she
could get off a great ad lib. But it's hard to compare her with
other funny women. It's like asking who's the best golfer. You have
to go to the records. I don't think anyone ever had the success she
had. She certainly holds the most records.''
   A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of
one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long
comic career. There are written records of all his shows, copies of
all the scripts, monologues and comic routines, audio tapes of his
radio shows and thousands of other mementos.
   ``G.I. Journal'' was on May 4, 1945. Hope's file reads: ``Spot:
Lucille Ball ... English play ... For Charity Bazaar.''
   Hope and Ball had actually known each other before they began
working together. In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband,
worked for Hope first.
   He said Ball asked him nearly 50 years ago to find a place on his
popular radio show for band leader Arnaz.
   ``Stan Kenton was leaving as my orchestra leader,'' Hope said.
``I gave Desi a spot on my show. We also gave him some lines to
speak. Every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an
enchilada. He could hardly talk, let alone get a laugh. When they
started `I Love Lucy,' I said, `What's going on? This man is
funny.'''
   ``The night before she died I performed at the Music Center,'' he
said. ``Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie
Arnaz, and said, `Isn't it wonderful she's doing better.' They
called me the next day and said she had died. I said, `God has her
now, but we'll have her forever.' We'll be watching her performances
for a long, long time.''
   ``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy'' will include clips from
their movies and TV appearances, plus such guest stars as Betty
White, George Burns and Danny Thomas.
   ``I'm going through everything myself picking out the clips,''
Hope said. ``The last time she was on my show was my birthday show
two years ago. We sang `I Remember It Well.' Our last time together
in public was at the Academy Awards in March. I think I'll do my
tribute to her over a shot of that in the background. I think
everyone remembers that.''
   She was on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit. The
program notes say, ``Lucille Ball: New York, clothes, cars,
pictures.''
   ``I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage,'' Hope
said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the
special. ``She had great gowns and hairdos. When she performed she
would use different styles. She'd change the way she read a line.
She'd throw a line away one time, then she'd turn around and milk a
line for laughs.''
   Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living
room of his Los Angeles home. It overlooks the one-hole golf course
in the back yard, and he was attired in golfing clothes.
Occasionally, he called his office in another building on the
grounds to check on a piece of information. Soon after the
interview, he was aboard a plane for a series of personal
appearances around the country.
   Ball made 22 appearances on Hope's specials and he was on her
shows 10 or 12 times, he said.
   In their first movie, ``Sorrowful Jones'' in 1949, Hope played a
racetrack bookie who's forced to become the foster father of a young
girl whose real father was killed by gangsters in a racehorse fix.
Ball was a nightclub singer who helps him look after the girl. It
was a remake of ``Little Miss Marker,'' which starred Shirley Temple
in 1934.
   Next was ``Fancy Pants'' in 1950, a remake of ``Ruggles of Red
Gap.'' Ball played a rich rancher who acquires an English butler,
played by Hope. ``Facts of Life'' was in 1960, with Hope and Ball as
married lovers who have a tryst. Their last film was ``Critic's
Choice'' in 1963, in which Hope is a Broadway critic who has to
review a play written by his wife, played by Ball.
   ``Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of
movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures,'' he
said. ``I think it was `Critic's Choice.' I found her very
cooperative, very wonderful. We always had a lot of fun together.''

   The nation's governors, preparing for the first
presidential summit since the Depression, are tackling a tough
assignment: how to shore up America's failing school system.
   Few substantive results are expected from the Sept. 27-28 session
at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, but some governors
say the summit may bring much-needed attention to the issue.
   ``Most Americans still believe that when we talk about a crisis
in education we are talking about someone else's kid in some other
school,'' said New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who has earned a
reputation as an education leader in his nearly eight years in
office.
   ``If the presidential summit can turn that attitude around and
highlight the need for a national focus on education, that will be a
major achievement.''
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said the presidential emphasis on
education will make it ``a major issue in every state.''
   The White House has not released an agenda, but governors
responding to a pre-summit poll by The Associated Press said the
three key issues were expected to be increased federal financing,
less government meddling and more parental control _ popularly
called ``choice.''
   The governors expect the sessions will be closed to allow open
discussion between them and Bush.
   The meeting is only the third such policy session called by an
American president. Theodore Roosevelt held a meeting in 1908 to
deal with the ravaging of forests, and Franklin Roosevelt called an
emergency meeting in 1933 for economic recovery talks in the midst
of the Depression.
   The decline of education first gained nationwide attention in
1983 with the government's ``Nation at Risk'' report that warned of
students' academic failures. Statistics have shown little
improvement since.
   The cost of education continues to soar, with the administration
projecting that federal, state and local spending will reach a
record $353 billion.
   The federal government spends a little under 2 percent of its
overall budget, or $22 billion, on education. The federal share of
the nation's total education spending has fallen to about 6 percent
from around 9 percent in 1980.
   Bush has offered a $441 million package of increases that include
money to reward good schools and teachers, create magnet schools and
promote alternate teacher certification systems.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo criticized the Bush administration for
worrying more about summits than spending federal money on education.
   ``If the education summit becomes a cheerleading session in which
the president encourages us to raise local taxes, we don't need a
summit,'' said Cuomo, a Democrat. ``We don't need to be encouraged
to spend. We need help.''
   Another Democrat, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, complained that the
federal government has decreased its funds to the state by more than
7 percent a year for the last two years, mainly by changing various
educational formulas.
   ``We at the state level are making an honest effort to make
progress,'' Andrus said. ``The (Republican) Legislature is working
with us. We're making an effort, but everytime we take two steps
forward they take some federal money away and we lose a step.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said a ``dramatic retreat'' in college
grants and financial assistance means more students must turn to
loans to continue their education. That keeps many blacks and
Hispanics from college because ``they view those loans as a form of
servitude,'' Celeste said.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh said the federal government should fully
finance such early childhood programs as Headstart. The highly
acclaimed program provides education, social, medical and
nutritional services to only 20 percent of the low-income pre-school
children who need it.
   Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota said Bush should target more
federal aid to rural schools, which need money to expand their often
limited courses.
   ``The key is to make sure that we help him find the money and
that it's focused on things like early childhood education, drug
education, rewarding excellence, employability, dropout reduction,
good citizenshp,'' said Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat.
``We need to put some ... meat on the Bush proposal.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said the best hope was to persuade the
administration to give the states more flexibility.
   ``When they give you the money they're going to call the shots,''
said Montana Republican Gov. Stan Stephens. ``And I think the shots
are best called for education at the local level first, the state
level second and the federal level third.''
   Many states face high dropout rates, but even those states with
relatively low rates are worried.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson said his state's dropout rate,
still among the nation's lowest, is creeping upward. The state
ranked fifth lowest in 1982, eighth lowest in 1986 and now is 12th
lowest.
   The centerpiece of Bush's education initiatives is ``choice,''
allowing parents to decide what school their children will attend.
Among the governors, however, there is no clear consensus on the
issue.
   Minnesota Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich is a key promoter of the
choice programs under way in his state and has touted the concept
nationally.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts favors parental choice
programs ``if they contain careful safeguards to prevent
discrimination and resegregation.'' The state Legislature is
considering such a program.
   ``Our educational policy,'' said Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter,
``favors the concept of neighborhood schools whenever possible to
allow communities and parents to have more involvement.''
   Virtually all the governors oppose national standards for
education curriculum, but consider uniform standards for teachers
more palatable. However, a recent nationwide poll of parents found
strong support for national curriculum standards.
   Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete says standardized curricula
``often resulted in rather unexciting, seamless textbook versions of
all manner of essential debates that have their place in history,
science and literature.''
   ``While a minimum level of performance might seem a rational
response for the nation, it runs the risk of simply becoming the
least common denominator,'' DiPrete said.
   Some governors are expected to tout pet projects at the summit.
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon favors longer school years and ``even
a longer school day,'' while Nevada Gov. Bob Miller has signed into
law a plan to lower the pupil-teacher ratio in public schools.
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles said Virginia has begun a literacy program
requiring students to pass reading and math tests before being
admitted to high school. State schools also are being required to
keep track of dropouts, interviewing students and parents about why
the student wants to leave school.
   ``The opportunity for the governors and the president to sit down
and discuss openly education issues and a national agenda for
education will be invaluable,'' said Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, a
Republican.

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade widened to $30.99 billion from April through June as the
nation suffered its first shortfall in the category covering
overseas investment earnings in three decades, the government
reported.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the current account deficit
rose by 2 percent over the January-March imbalance of $30.39
billion. It marked the second consecutive quarterly setback and
provided fresh evidence, economists said, of how entrenched
America's trade problems are.

   The overall results Tuesday fell largely within expectations
although some analysts said they were disappointed that Paramount's

<TEXT>
   Investor Burt Sugarman said he has
agreed to buy Aspen Airways, a 35-year-old privately-owned airline
serving Colorado's ski resorts for an undisclosed price.
   ``As a part-time resident of Aspen for 22 years, I've flown on it
many times over the years, and I've enjoyed the service,'' said
Sugarman in announcing the purchase Monday.
   Donald W. Ringsby, chairman of the family-owned carrier, said the
airline could not afford on its own to replace its turbo-prop
airplanes, which are about 25 years old.
   It could cost between $8 million and $10 million to replace the
10 Convair 580 commuter planes, Ringsby said. Aspen, which serves 16
cities in the western United States and Canada, also operates four
British Aerospace-146 jet planes.
   In March, Sugarman sold his controlling interest in Barris
Industries Inc., producers of the television programs ``The Gong
Show'' and ``The Newlywed Game,'' to the owners of an Australian
television network for $34.5 million.
   He is acquiring Aspen through Giant Group Ltd., his Beverly
Hills, Calif.-based holding company that also owns cement plants.

   ``It's like taking away the index from the library,'' said John

   But McAfee said Tuesday that the virus, while unusually harmful,
is so rare that most PC owners do not need to be overly concerned.
   ``It's a low-probability, high-consequence risk,'' said Harold J.

   The virus was named the Datacrime virus by its unknown creator
but goes by several other names, including the Columbus Day virus,
the Icelandic virus and the Friday the 13th virus, since Friday,
Oct. 13, is the first day it could strike.
   The virus is spread by contaminated floppy disks or over phone

when it will be activated by the computer's internal clock. Only
computers that use Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS operating system can be
infected.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is paying for the
defense of its indicted former chief junk bond trader, Michael
Milken, while providing potentially damaging information about him
to prosecutors.
   But both government and Drexel officials say the unusual
arrangement is legal, does not pose a conflict of interest for the
Wall Street firm and does not violate its plea agreement that
settled securities fraud charges.
   ``We've got a criminal investigation and prosecution going on,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said Tuesday. ``It's about
historic acts. It's irrelevant who cuts a check to pay what lawyer.''
   Carroll said Drexel is not violating any agreement with the
government by paying lawyers' fees for Milken, who records show made
more than $1 billion from 1984 to 1987. Drexel has agreed to sever
all business ties with Milken.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm, under company
policy, also is paying the legal fees for other employees involved
in the continuing investigation of trading practices involving
Drexel, its employees and clients.
   Under its plea agreement with federal prosecutors, finalized
Monday, Drexel is immune from further criminal charges but must
cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office investigation.
   Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts and immediately paid
more than $500 million of its $673 million in fines and penalties.
The plea, in which Drexel admitted it manipulated stock and
defrauded investors and customers, ended nine months of wrangling
over an agreement that avoided a possible racketeering indictment.
   Milken remains government target No. 1 and prosecutors have
promised a new, broader set of charges about Oct. 1 that should bear
out some of Drexel's cooperation.
   Drexel also has given the government dozens of documents and
trading records. The firm has hired an outside accountant to analyze
some of the records. Whenever prosecutors wish to speak with
employees, Drexel has to make them accessible under its plea-bargain
agreement.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the government is pleased with
the extent of Drexel's cooperation.
   Several Drexel traders and other employees currently are
answering prosecutors' questions. Some, such as salesman James Dahl,
have been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their
testimony. Others, such as chief junk bond trader Warren Trepp, have
refused to answer any questions.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were charged in a 98-count securities fraud indictment in
March alleging racketeering, insider trading, tax fraud and other
violations.
   Those charges focus on alleged collusion between Milken and
jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky, but the new indictment now
under preparation is expected to contain broader charges.
   Prosecutors plan to identify but not charge Drexel clients
Solomon Asset Management and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association in
the expanded indictment, according to a report Tuesday in The
Washington Post. Boesky's firm and the defunct Princeton-Newport
Partners LP were named in the original charges.
   The government will allege that Milken directed a series of
illegal stock and bond trading arrangements with the clients, the
newspaper said. Prosecutors are assembling witnesses to testify
about the alleged dealings at Milken's trial, scheduled to begin
next March, the report said.
   Columbia's general counsel, Ken Heitz, has acknowledged that the
Los Angeles-based thrift tried to ``implement its tax planning''
through heavy year-end trades with Drexel and other firms, but
denied any wrongdoing, the Post reported.
   Attempts to reach David Solomon, former head of Solomon Asset
Management, failed Tuesday. The firm has changed its name and said
Solomon no longer worked there.
   Carroll declined to comment on the report. Milken's public
relations spokesman said in a statement: ``The continuing press
leaks related to the case are designed to deny Mike Milken his right
to a fair trial. Mike Milken has pleaded not guilty and will fight
the charges in court, not in the newspaper.''
   In addition to the Milkens and Newberg, other Drexel employees
are expected to be charged in the new indictment. At least four
Drexel officials late last year were told by the government to
expect charges. A person involved in the case said Tuesday he knew
of no others.

   Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company, it at a critical point in its history as Chairman Frank
Lorenzo faces shareholders here today at a long-delayed annual
meeting.
   Eastern Airlines, one of its two main subsidiaries, is in its
seventh month of a bitter strike and tortuous bankruptcy proceeding.
The Miami-based carrier recently disclosed to creditors that it will
have about $370 million less in cash by year end than first
projected, having abandoned a plan to sell its Latin American routes.
   As a result, Texas Air may underwrite some of Eastern's
operations _ a prospect unlikely to cheer Texas Air shareholders. A
hearing is scheduled for today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York
on a proposal for Texas Air to pay part of a $100 million Eastern
pension payment due Friday.
   While Eastern has been buffeted since early March by the strike
by Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants, its
sister carrier, Continental Airlines, appeared to enjoy stability
and even turned a modest profit. But in a surprise move, Lorenzo
announced Aug. 24 that he was considering selling all or part of the
Houston-based carrier.
   The ``noise'' at strike-torn Eastern was hurting non-union
Continental's business, Lorenzo recently explained.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' he said. ``We
have an obligation to look for alternatives.''
   Texas Air, which Lorenzo aggressively built from a small
intrastate carrier into an airline empire, could be shaken to its
foundations. If Continental were sold, many observers believe the
wily airline chief would move to liquidate troubled Eastern and get
out of the business altogether.
   ``The question is whether he has had enough, whether he's having
serious misgivings about staying in the industry, period,'' said
Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage. ``This may be some sort of a swan
song.''
   It may be an opportune moment for such a departure. The airline
industry has been gripped by a takeover frenzy in recent months,
catapulting stocks of major carriers to high altitudes.
   A group led by California investor Alfred Checchi recently
acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $4 billion, while
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is being ardently pursued by
investor Marvin Davis and a pilot-management group allied with
British Airways PLC.
   The wave has swept up Texas Air stock, too, despite the strife at
Eastern. The company's shares have soared from about $9 or $10 at
the beginning of the year to near $20 currently. They rose 37.5
cents Tuesday to close at $19.62{ on the American Stock Exchange.
   In the second quarter, Texas Air posted a $109.3 million net
loss, as Eastern's $129.3 million loss outweighed a $32.1 million
profit at Continental. The $109.3 million loss compares with a
$255.9 million loss for the same quarter last year.
   Texas Air's revenue dropped to $1.4 billion from $2.1 billion in
the quarter, reflecting the sharp reduction in Eastern's operations
during the May-July period.
   There was a slim ray of hope this week for a possible resolution
of the Eastern debacle as a federal mediator met in Washington on
Monday with company officials and with leaders of the pilots union
Tuesday.
   Lorenzo has met with Donald J. Trump in an effort to persuade the
New York developer to buy Continental, according to Trump Shuttle
President Bruce Nobles. In early June, after a series of setbacks,
Trump finally bought Eastern's Northeast shuttle service from Texas
Air for $365 million.
   Other possible buyers of Continental or part of it could include
Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in
Texas Air, and Pan Am Corp., which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers.
   There also has been speculation that Carl Icahn, the owner and
chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., may be interested in a
combination with Continental. On the Eastern front, the airline
announced Tuesday that the bankruptcy court had approved its $210
million agreement to sell Midway Airlines 16 DC-9 aircraft, spare
engines and parts, Philadelphia gates and related facilities, route
authority linking Philadelphia with Montreal and Canada, and
high-density operating slots at Washington and New York.
   Eastern also announced plans for new service to Cancun, Mexico,
and Mexico City later this year.

   Neiman Marcus, seller of sumptuous fantasies for 81
years, is inviting its well-heeled clientele to put on a pair of
spurs and recapture the Wild West.
   The Dallas-based retailer began delivery Tuesday of its Christmas
catalog, the annual wishbook of the wealthy. For one cowpoke with
$108,000, Neiman's will sell a hand-tooled saddle by Edward H.
Bohlin Co., lavishly furnished with sterling silver and 18-karat
gold.
   A cowboy ain't a cowboy without a horse, so for $4,000 and up
Neiman Marcus is offering a selection of champion bloodline painted
horses from the Real Ranch in Kerrville. Buyers can choose from 1989
weanlings and up _ from black to bay.
   Those wishing to relive the great cattle drives of the Old West
can reserve a pony to chase herd for a weekend at the Y.O. Ranch,
also near Kerrville. There is room for 150 people to attend the
ranch's 110th anniversary in April 1990.
   ``I do not recommend this for pussyfooters,'' said Jan Roberts, a
Neiman Marcus spokeswoman.
   To give prospective ropers across the country an equal shot at
the event, Neiman Marcus has set 11 a.m. CDT Oct. 18 as the time it
will begin taking reservations. The weekend costs $627 for a double
occupancy room.
   ``Texas is really in right now,'' Ms. Roberts said. ``From the
president to Lonesome Dove, Texas and the West are in vogue. And
because Neiman Marcus is from Texas, we thought we should get back
to our roots and pay tribute to our heritage.''
   The catalog includes more whimsical gifts with a Western flavor,
including teepee-shaped salt and pepper shakers and a replica of the
badge deputized lawmen once fashioned.
   In recent years, Neiman Marcus, which has stores across the
country, has offered a spangled cat, his-and-her mummy cases and
giant hot air balloons.
   The catalog always contains several pages of furs. A coat of
Russian lynx bellies sells for $150,000 this year.
   For fisherman who can't wait to see what they are reeling in, an
8-foot glass-bottom boat is available for $1,800.
   The catalog does not leave out the pet or pet lover. In a section
titled ``From Santa Paws,'' the catalog features townhouses for
tomcats and beds for bulldogs along with a cat collar lined with
fish-shaped pearls.
   But the 130-page gift book does not only cater to the rich, Ms.
Roberts said.
   ``This year we have six pages dedicated to gifts for $26 or
less,'' she said.

<HEAD>Campeau Board Approves Sale of Bloomingdale's, Loan From Developer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of troubled Campeau Corp. have approved
a plan to sell its crown jewel, the Bloomingdale's department store
chain, and to accept a loan from a real estate firm as part of a
restructuring of the Toronto-based retailer.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, shopping mall developer Crown American Corp.
confirmed its interest in acquiring Bloomingdale's.
   ``We are still in the process of gathering information,'' said
Frank Pasquerilla, Crown American's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   ``At this point, we are interested in keeping the 16-store chain
and its operations intact,'' he said in a statement released by
Crown American's headquarters in Johnstown, Pa. He added that any
bid ``probably would be in excess of $1 billion.''
   Campeau board members, meeting privately in Toronto, agreed to
put Bloomingdale's on the block and approved a proposal aimed at
coping with a cash crunch.
   Campeau stock fell 25 cents to close at 16.87{ Canadian dollars
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading Tuesday. The announcement of the
board's decisions was made after the market closed.
   Campeau management unveiled the restructuring plan Friday, saying
it was designed to reduce debt and address a need for working
capital. The sale of Bloomingdale's would be a key element of the
overhaul.
   As one of the best-known names in retailing, New York-based
Bloomingdale's was expected to attract significant interest among
potential buyers.
   Crown American, a privately held company founded by Pasquerilla,
is one of the country's biggest shopping mall developers. It owns 30
enclosed malls and nine community shopping centers plus 19 hotels
and five office buildings. Its hotels include Comfort Inns, Hotel
Ibis and Compri Hotels.
   In 1979, Crown American bought Hess's Department Stores of
Allentown, Pa. Hess's now has 72 stores, up from 17 a decade ago.
   The only other potential rival for Bloomingdale's to come forward
so far is the department store chain's chairman and chief executive,
Marvin S. Traub, who last week said he was in the early stages of
putting together a buyout proposal.
   Traub, in an interview Friday, wouldn't say what price he might
offer for Bloomingdale's or comment on where he might obtain
financing. He said he was still contacting lawyers and investment
bankers.
   Traub said he has been interested in taking control of the
retailer he has headed for 11 years since the time when Campeau
became embroiled in a bidding battle for Bloomingdale's parent
Federated Department Stores Inc. with rival R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc.
   The takeover of Federated, completed about a year and a half ago,
cost Campeau $6.7 billion and contributed to the Canadian company's
precarious financial condition.
   Campeau, which bought Allied Stores Corp. in 1986 for $3.4
billion, is struggling with a debt burden approaching $10 billion.
   A sale of Bloomingdale's could raise $1 billion to $2 billion,
Wall Street analysts say, and chop an estimated $200 million off
Campeau's annual $1 billion in interest payments.
   A pressing concern for Campeau this week is a loan of about $400
million left over from acquiring Federated. Unless refinanced, the
loan converts into notes and warrants of Federated stock this week.
   Among elements of the restructuring plan approved in principle
Tuesday by Campeau's board was a $250 million loan from
Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which has an 11.8
percent stake in Campeau.
   The funds from Olympia &amp; York, which analysts speculated might be
given in exchange for a larger stake in Campeau, were expected to
allow Campeau to cover its immediate cash needs.
   Retail analysts said an intense bidding battle could develop for
Bloomingdale's, a high-profile retailer usually considered to be on
the cutting edge of fashion merchandising.
   ``It's going to be similar to the Federated feud,'' said analyst
Linda R. Morris, of PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh.
   Rumors that possibly as many as a dozen retailers and real estate
holding companies were considering making offers circulated in the
stock market. Among the names cited were Limited Inc., a leading
specialty apparel retailer. A spokeswoman at the chain's Columbus,
Ohio, headquarters said the company had no comment.

<HEAD>Orders Dropping for 90 Cars As Dealers Face Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Houston auto dealer Alan Helfman will be scaling
back his orders for 1990 model cars and trucks, even though he has
just five 1989 models left on his lot.
   Helfman, general manager of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in that
Texas city, isn't alone. Other dealers nationwide say they too will
trim their orders for the next model year's vehicles, due out next
month, mainly because of pressure from their own inventories and
sagging sales.
   ``I'm probably going to cut them back a touch,'' Helfman said
Tuesday. ``I think we will be a little more conservative this year.
When you look at everything, you've got to really forecast and
you've got to be conservative.''
   After a few strong sales periods recently, year-to-date car and
light truck sales through the end of last month were running 3.7
percent behind last year's pace.
   While that's better than at the end of March, when sales were
down 8.9 percent compared with that time last year, industry experts
expect the market to contract in the early 1990s.
   Sales figures for the first 10 days of September from the major
automakers are due today.
   ``There's a trend (among dealers) to get to a lower inventory,''
said Jake Kelderman, executive director of industry affairs for the
National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   He estimated that dealers would aim for a 45- to 60-day supply of
cars on their lots in the coming year. A 60-day supply used to be
the norm, he said.
   Each of the automakers has predicted 1989 model-year sales well
below the previous year's 15.8 million. The 1990 model year could be
worse yet, although no recession is forecast.
   Interest rates, which determine how much dealers pay to buy cars
on credit from the manufacturers, have been relatively steady
recently, but it still costs money to keep cars on the lot.
   Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether automakers will stay
in the incentive war they have been waging since early spring.
Dealers often carry more stock during heavy incentive periods than
during other times.
   ``You've got to really watch it now,'' Helfman said. ``There have
been a lot of negative (economic) articles and it's kind of getting
dealers scared.
   ``Manufacturers are cutting and slicing and dicing. They're
expecting very, very hard times,'' he said. ``It scares me that if
that's going to be the case, you've got some blood ready to be
spilled.''
   Helfman said he planned well and has just five 1989 cars on his
lot. But he's going to trim his upcoming orders to a 45-day target,
down slightly from previous years, and rely more on swapping cars
with other dealers as orders come in.
   ``I think I'd rather give up a little profit and find the car for
those people who want a special kind of car and deal out of other
people's inventory,'' he said.
   The Big Three _ General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. _ trotted out enhanced incentive plans in late March and early
April, and during the last several months, manufacturers have
offered rebates to dealers, too, giving them the option of using
that money for advertising or to cut the price of 1989 cars.
   For automakers, that's a gamble with potentially high stakes as
the model year draws to a close, which for bookkeeping purposes
happens at the end of this month.
   ``I just hope that it works,'' said Herb Adcox, owner of Adcox
Chevrolet in Chattanooga, Tenn., a longtime General Motors dealer.
``If it doesn't, you've got a lot of dealers who are not going to
order (as many) 1990 models.
   ``Sometimes they call it `Generous Motors,''' he said. ``We're
going to find out just how generous they are.''

<HEAD>Packwood Urges Hands Off Policy in BAT Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The international tug of war over the British
conglomerate BAT Industries PLC lurched back to Capitol Hill with a
top Senate Republican urging the Bush administration to stay out of
the takeover fight.
   Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, in a letter to Secretary of State
James A. Baker disclosed Tuesday, said the U.S. government should
``take no action'' to avoid the appearance of ``unreasonable
government interference.''
   Packwood, ranking minority member of the Senate Finance
Committee, sent similar letters to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman David S. Ruder.
   Ruder has already informed several congressmen that the SEC does
not believe it has the authority to do more than monitor the
takeover bid for BAT, which owns several major U.S. companies.
   The Packwood letter was the latest development in an
international legal and public relations tug of war since Hoylake
Investments Ltd., a consortium headed by Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, launched a $21 billion bid for BAT, the world's
largest tobacco company, in late July.
   BAT, whose U.S. holdings include Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp., the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field department stores
and Farmers Insurance Group, has vowed to fight the unsought
takeover.
   Packwood's Sept. 6 letter was in sharp contrast to a letter sent
to Baker last month, co-signed by more than 200 members of the House
and Senate, asking him to express their concern to the British
government about the multinational leveraged buyout.
   Senate aides, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said Packwood wrote the letter on his own and it did not reflect the
views of other Republicans on the committee.
   Because Goldsmith has a reputation for taking over companies and
then breaking them up and selling off the pieces, labor unions in
this country have condemned the takeover as a potential threat to
about 55,000 U.S. workers.
   And 209 members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans,
wrote Baker about their concern the deal eventually would
``dismantle a company that is important to hundreds of U.S.
communities.''
   ``Although I am sympathetic to my colleagues' concerns about the
uncertainties new ownership of business entities in their
communities might raise, I frankly cannot see a proper role for the
federal government under U.S. law or the United States open
investment policy in this transaction,'' Packwood's letter said in
part.
   ``I would appreciate your assurances that the administration will
remain true to its open investment policy by taking no action in
this transaction that might be construed as unreasonable government
interference,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Report: Airline Expected to Place Plane Orders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc. this fall will
place orders and options for 12 European-built Airbus airliners in a
transaction valued at nearly $850 million, a newspaper reported
today.
   Industry sources familiar with the negotiations told The Dallas
Morning News that the Fort Worth-based airline plans to place firm
orders for six Airbus A300-600R aircraft and get options for another
six.
   The sources told the newspaper an announcement for the order
could come within the next two months.
   However, officials at AMR Corp., the parent of American, and
Airbus Industries, based in Toulouse, France, would not comment on
whether a deal is near.
   American's vice president and treasurer, Michael Durham,
confirmed the airline has been looking at several aircraft,
including the Airbus, in search of a plane that could be used on
overwater routes to destinations in Europe and the Caribbean.
   Fulfilling that priority is the carrier's top priority in the
realm of aircraft acquisition, said Durham.
   The airline was the launch customer for the A300-600R and has
taken delivery of 25 copies of the model, officials said. The
airline uses the planes on its route system in the Caribbean, where
it has a hub at San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   The A300-600R is a newer, longer-range version of Airbus' A300
and has a price tag of $71 million, officials said.

<HEAD>SAS: Not Immediately Interested in Buying Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airline Systems said
Wednesday it has no immediate interest in buying all or part of the
Texas Air Corp.'s subsidiary Continental Airlines.
   SAS Managing Director Jan Carlzon released the statement as an
answer to ``recent speculation around SAS and its cooperation
partner Continental Airlines.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that SAS was involved
in advanced talks with Texas Air, which had said it may consider
selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental.
   The governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway own half of SAS,
and the other half is in private or corporate hands.
   ``The cooperation between SAS and Cointinental is already a great
success and has given SAS an excellent vantage point to service the
American market,'' Carlzon said.
   ``If Texas Air decided to sell Continental, SAS of course would
guard its interests,'' he said, adding that SAS was ``so pleased
with the current cooperation that the issue of buying Continental
for the time being is not of immediate interest.''
   SAS, which has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air, would not be
able to buy Continental outright since foreign companies are barred
from having more than a 25 percent share in a U.S. carrier.
   SAS and Continental began work in June 1988 on a joint marketing
agreement.

   Flight delays in Europe reached a record
high in the first seven months of 1989 with one in four flights
delayed by more than 15 minutes, the Association of European
Airlines reported Wednesday.
   The 21-member AEA said that 6 percent more flights were delayed
in the first seven months of 1989 than in the corresponding
year-earlier period.
   In July, 28.6 percent of international short and medium-haul
departures were more than 15 minutes late, the AEA said.
   The association said that the figures supported its demand for a
unified air traffic control system in Europe. It claims Europe's 22
different national air control systems cost as much as the single
U.S. system which handles three times more flights.
   Despite longer delays, growth in European passenger traffic was
modest in July. It rose 7.5 percent from the corresponding year
earlier month, in line with the 6 to 9 percent growth range in
passenger traffic over the past 12 months, the AEA said.
   Long-haul passenger traffic rose by 4 percent in July from the
year-earlier month, with 2.6 percent growth recorded on North
American routes. These routes accounted for half the volume of
long-haul passenger traffic in July, AEA said.

<HEAD>Economist Charles Cox Stepping Down From SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles C. Cox, the first economist to be
appointed a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
leaving the federal regulatory agency at the end of the month to
join a consulting firm.
   Cox, an SEC commissioner since 1983 and a former chief economist
of the agency, said in a brief letter to President Bush that his
resignation would take effect September 30, unless his numerical
replacement, Richard Breeden, assumes office before that date.
   The resignation of Cox had been expected because his term
technically had expired, but the announcement Tuesday marked the
first time Cox disclosed a departure date and post-SEC plans.
   Cox, 44, is joining Lexecon Inc., a Chicago-based economic
consulting concern, where he will be senior vice president in its
securities and finance group, responsible for directing studies in
securities, securities fraud and commodity futures trading.
   ``We are delighted that Charles Cox is joining Lexecon and
bringing his unique experience as an SEC commissioner and former
chief economist of the SEC to our firm,'' Lexecon President Andrew
Rosenfield said in a statement.
   The statement quoted Cox as saying ``I'm excited to be joining
Lexecon because it affords me the opportunity to do research in the
areas I've been dealing with at the SEC every day, issues like
securities fraud, insider trading, tender offers and the structure
of financial markets.''
   Lexecon analyzes many areas of business, including antitrust,
corporate reorganizations, securities regulation, health, safety and
environmental regulations, transportation and tax matters.
   A native of Missoula, Mont., Cox served as the SEC's chief
economist for a year before he was nominated as a commissioner by
then-President Reagan.
   Before joining the SEC staff, Cox served from 1980 to 1982 as a
professor of management at Texas A&amp;M University from 1972 to 1980 as
a professor of economics at Ohio State University.
   A 1967 University of Washington graduate, Cox has masters and
doctoral degrees in economics from the University of Chicago.
   Breeden, a Bush aide who played a leading White House role on the
savings and loan bailout legislation, was nominated Aug. 14 to
become an SEC commissioner. The administration has said that once
Breeden is confirmed by the Senate, Bush will designate him as
chairman.
   The Senate Banking Committee was to begin confirmation hearings
Thursday for Breeden.
   Current SEC Chairman David S. Ruder previously announced that he
also would step down Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   Two partners in the accounting giant Coopers &amp;
Lybrand say they will appeal an order barring them from practicing
before the Securities and Exchange Commission for the next five
years.
   An administrative judge, in a ruling announced Tuesday, found
David J. Checkosky and Norman A. Aldrich had engaged in ``blatant,
serious'' unprofessional conduct.
   Following 30 days of hearings, 13 witnesses and 350 exhibits, the
administrative judge ruled in favor of the SEC, which claimed
Checkosky and Aldrich violated generally accepted standards of
auditing and principles of accounting in audits their firm did for
Savin Corp., which markets copy machines.
   Financial information provided in the audits ``portrayed the
company as a far more successful business enterprise than it was,''
according to the judge's ruling.
   ``It's fair to characterize the judge's decision as outrageous,''
said Geoffrey F. Aronow, an attorney for both men, who worked in
Coopers &amp; Lybrand's Stamford, Conn. headquarters.
   Aronow accused the Administrative Judge Brenda P. Murray of of
ignoring ``large portions of the evidence in the record'' and said
she ``has misapplied the applicable auditing principles and
misconstrued the underlying regulatory legal standards that apply
here.''
   He said his clients ``intend to appeal to the commission and
believe the propriety of their actions will ultimately be
vindicated.''
   There were no allegations of wrongdoing against Savin in the SEC
action, but several investors lawsuits are pending in Connecticut.
   A spokesman for Coopers &amp; Lybrand was not available for comment.
   Savin has been a client of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the nation's
largest accounting firms, since the mid-1960s.
   The judge noted that annual billings from Savin totaled about
$340,000.
   ``For professional reasons, it was important to both men that the
client be pleased with their efforts. Unfortunately, pleasing the
client became their paramount consideration,'' she wrote in a
68-page opinion.
   Checkosky and Aldrich were the senior people assigned to the
Savin audits in question, for fiscal years 1981 through 1984.
Savin's fiscal year ran from May 1 to April 30.
   The SEC charged, among other things, that the two partners did
not adequately plan the audits; did not ``exercise due care'' in
examining Savin financial statements and did not obtain sufficient
credible evidence to back up the opinions they submitted in SEC
documents.
   According to the judge's finding, the partners wrongly claimed it
was proper to defer as start-up costs the costs Savin incurred in
developing a new copier.
   She found the SEC's evidence persuasive that during the time
covered by the audits, Savin should have listed its costs as
research and development expenses.
   By deferring rather than expensing, Savin kept these costs from
increasing its net operating loss during the period in question.
Instead these costs were included as assets on Savin's balance sheet
and increased owners' equity.

<HEAD>Steel Giants Plan to Expand Joint Venture with $450 Million Facility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of Inland Steel Industries Inc. and
Nippon Steel Corp. say customers are already lining up to purchase
coated steel from a soon-to-be-built $450 million facility in
Indiana.
   The two steel-coating lines, called I-N Kote, should strengthen
Inland's position as a supplier to the appliance and auto
industries, primary markets for corrosion-resistant coated steel
products, said Frank Luerssen, chairman and chief executive officer
of the company.
   The move will ``measureably strengthen our joint commitment to
meet the needs for differentiated steel products in the American
market,'' Luerssen said at a news conference Tuesday. ``We now see
customers lining up to get their share of the materials.''
   The two production lines will have an annual capacity of 900
finished tons and will be constructed next to a nearly completed New
Carlisle, Ind., plant, where Inland and Nippon are finishing work on
a continuous cold-rolling mill called I-N Tek.
   I-N Tek and Inland Steel's Indiana Harbor Works in East Chicago,
Ind., will provide all the sheet steel for I-N Kote.
   The $900 million complex being built at New Carlisle, Ind., by
Chicago-based Inland and Tokyo-based Nippon is believed to represent
the largest spending program so far for an American-Japanese joint
venture in the United States.
   The new coating lines will take the cold-rolled steel produced at
the plant and coat it, using an electrogalvanizing process or a
hot-dip line.
   Automakers use galvanized steel's higher-grade sheets on exposed
car panels and hot-dipped sheets for such things as panels for light
truck beds.
   Inland, the sixth-largest steel company in the nation, supplies
the three major U.S. carmakers and major Japanese auto manufacturers.
   Nippon is the largest steel maker in the world, exporting about 8
million tons a year.
   Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon, said the venture with Inland
represented a joint commitment to Japanese carmakers who have built
U.S. plants and to American companies with a demand for the
materials.
   Saito said the new plant will be entirely operational in 1991,
with I-N Tek beginning operations next year.
   Such ventures, he said, work to ease tensions about the trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
   ``I am confident that this undertaking will play a major symbolic
role as a constructive attempt to resolve issues between the two
economies through mutual understanding and cooperation,'' Saito said
in a prepared statement.
   Nippon and Inland will contribute $150 million each to I-N Kote,
with the rest sponsored by debt-financing. Inland is assuming 60
percent of the construction costs for I-N Tek, also a joint venture.
   Inland this year has experienced three consecutive quarterly
earnings declines, blamed partly on seasonal softness in orders, but
Luerssen predicted a small gain for the company's fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Fuji Bank to Buy Out Kleinwort Benson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuji Bank Ltd. plans to buy Kleinwort Benson
Government Securities Inc. in Chicago as part of its business
expansion in the United States, officials said Wednesday.
   The bank, which bought a 24.9 percent stake in the securities
firm in January, would increase its ownership to 100 percent under
an agreement with the firm's London-based parent, Kleinwort Benson
Ltd., said Fuji Bank spokesman Tomonori Kobayashi.
   ``It will probably cost us some $44 million,'' he said.
   He said the bank was awaiting approval for the total buyout from
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which is examining foreign firms'
access to the Japanese government bond market.
   The bank hoped for Federal Reserve approval by the end of the
year, Kobayashi added.
   Fuji Bank, the No.3 Japanese bank, with assets totaling the
equivalent of about $351 billion at the end of last year, has six
U.S. branches and bought the U.S. finance company Walter E. Heller
in 1984.
   ``So this (Kleinwort) is our first securities firm, which we
believe will promote our securities business in the United States,''
Kobayashi said.
   Fuji's announcement came one day after officials of Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank said the bank was negotiating to buy at least a share of
CIT group, a financial services subsidiary of Manufacturer's Hanover
Corp.
   If Fuji's purchase plan goes through, Japanese banks will be
managing four of the 42 primary government securities dealers in the
United States, said the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading
economic journal.
   The U.S. central bank voted in August to allow Japanese firms to
continue to act as primary dealers in U.S. Treasury securities.
Primary dealers, which may conduct business in government securities
directly with the Fed, have access to advance information about note
and bond auctions.
   The economic journal said Japanese banks are actively
establishing such strengths in the United States mainly because the
U.S. government has started reconsidering the border line between
bank and securities operations.
   Kleinwort Benson still holds 100 percent management rights at its
six branches in the United States, said Shigemitsu Minagawa,
spokesman for the company's Tokyo branch, established eight years
ago.
   He said Fuji Bank and Kleinwort Benson had maintained a
relationship for quite some time in human resources and investment.
   Other purchases of U.S. firms by Japanese banks include a 1984
buyout of the Bank of California by Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of
Tokyo's purchase of Union Bank in 1988.

<HEAD>Government Drops Plans for New Sale of NTT Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Finance Ministry said Wednesday it has dropped
plans to sell 1.95 million shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. stock this year.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference the
decision was based on various factors, including the slump in NTT
share prices.
   The government had planned to sell 1.95 million NTT shares in
fiscal 1989, which ends next March 31, after Parliament approved the
sale to finance public works and the redemption of outstanding
government bonds, said a Finance Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Since NTT, the former government monopoly in telecommunications,
was turned into a private firm on April 1, 1985, the government has
sold 5.4 million shares, 35 percent of the shares it owned.
   In April 1987, two months after the stock was first offered, a
single share of NTT stock was worth 3.18 million yen, or about
$21,600. NTT stock closed at 1.51 million yen, or about $10,272,
Wednesday.
   NTT posted a 14.3 percent decline in unconsolidated pretax
profits for the fiscal year that ended March 31.
   Officials attributed the decline to lower long-distance revenues
caused by competition from new entrants in the market, and to a
slump in revenue from data communications services.
   The company's chairman, Hisashi Shinto, resigned last December
after being implicated in the Recruit scandal, and was arrested in
March on bribery charges.
   The Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate, has been
accused of using cut-price stock sales and political donations to
try to buy influence with a wide range of politicians, bureaucrats
and businessmen. Although NTT now is a private firm, its employees
are treated the same as public officials under laws covering bribery.

<HEAD>Luxury Auto Maker Posts Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luxury auto maker Jaguar PLC on Wednesday posted an
after-tax loss of $1.7 million for the first half of the year,
citing a decline in U.S. sales, adverse currency factors, and a
large depreciaton charge.
   These negative factors were partly offset by improvements in cost
efficiency, the company said.
   The loss for the six months ended June 30 compared with an
after-tax profit of $21 million, or 11 cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
   The company said its pre-tax profit sank to $2.2 million from $35
million, a year ago.
   Sales climbed 3 percent to $869 million, from $832 million.
   The depreciation charge for plant and equipment came to $55
million, up from $42 million in the year-earlier period.
   Jaguar said sales in its key U.S. market deteriorated sharply
during the second-quarter, and that they were well below
expectations. U.S. sales rose 14 percent to $399 million in the
period.
   The company said that fiercer competition forced it to raise its
marketing expenditure in the region. Jaguar is forecasting U.S.
sales of around 20,000 cars in the current year, compared with
20,700 in 1988.
   Jaguar said half-year sales in Britain were on a par with year
earlier levels, but that there was ``some uncertainly about overall
demand'' due to the country's high interest rates.
   Jaguar said it hoped ``to maintain good sales progress'' in
continental Europe, where sales declined 17 percent to $109 million.
   Overall, Jaguar said it didn't envisage any improvement in its
underlying trading conditions during the rest of the year. However,
the company said the introduction of new models was expected to
enhance demand.
   Jaguar did not produce quarterly results. It isn't required to
under British law.

<HEAD>Bush Administration to Encourage More Personal Savings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 11th graf, `The 1986 ...,' to specify that figures differ
for couples and individuals. This also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is gearing up for a
major campaign to encourage Americans to save more money and urge
U.S. companies to make long-term investments rather than chasing
fast-buck takeover deals.
   ``We've been willing to mortgage our future, to sacrifice quality
and to cut corners in the pursuit of the immediate payoff,''
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Tuesday night. The United
States needs to make fundamental changes in its economic affairs or
risk losing out to international competitors, he warned.
   Brady indicated the administration is considering ways to expand
tax incentives to encourage individual savings, proposals to
eliminate the double-taxation of stock dividends and initiatives
that would encourage corporate managers to focus more on long-term
performance.
   ``Our approach to the challenges of the 1990s and beyond should
be to maintain our competitiveness where it's strong and to rebuild
it where it has faltered,'' Brady said in a speech billed as the
opening salvo in the administration's new campaign.
   Brady said other nations are challenging America's economic
leadership because the country has grown complacent with too many
corporate executives chasing quick profits rather than investing for
long-term performance.
   ``It worries me when I see many of the best minds in America
concentrating on financial engineering rather than laying plans for
sound corporate strategies for the future,'' Brady told members of
the American Business Conference, who were invited to dinner at the
Treasury Department.
   Brady's comments received a generally warm response from the
executives.
   American Stock Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. told Brady
that many of his suggestions were similar to proposals by the
Business Conference, which earlier this year called for a major
government effort to boost the nation's savings rate to lower the
cost of capital for U.S. businesses.
   Brady, however, conceded that the administration hasn't found an
answer to the key problem raised by the proposals _ how should they
be funded.
   Suggestions to expand tax-deferred savings plans such as
Individual Retirement Accounts could cost $15 billion over five
years, while any proposal to eliminate the double taxation of
corporate dividends might cost as much as $40 billion annually.
   The 1986 tax law sharply curbed IRA tax benefits for couples
making more than $40,000 a year or individuals earning more than
$25,000 and covered by a company retirement plan.
   Brady said the administration is currently wrestling with the
cost question. He said final decisions probably will not come until
President Bush presents his next budget to Congress in January.
   ``What we have done is commit ourselves to the kind of program
that I have outlined,'' he said. ``We are going to make it work.''
   Part of the administration's competitiveness program includes the
president's push to lower the capital gains tax rate.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, proposed offering deductible IRAs to all
taxpayers as a substitute for reducing the tax on capital gains.
   Brady said expanding IRAs is being reviewed by the
administration, but he said the president remains committed to
getting a cut in the capital gains rate.
   Brady said the administration's proposals were aimed at lowering
the cost of businesses to raise needed capital to make long-term
investment.
   ``If we provided for more of our domestic investment needs with
our savings, we'd have to import less capital from abroad, thus
improving our trade balance,'' Brady said.
   Brady said the administration will be looking at a number of
options ``that give people the incentive to save, instead of to
consume.''

   Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s plans to sell the Sears
Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest building, to Canadian
developer Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. have hit a snag, the Wall
Street Journal reported today.
   The two sides had prepared to sign a deal on Tuesday but couldn't
decide on who would bear tax costs of a reappraisal expected to
follow the sale, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified
individuals close to the negotiations.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the company would have
no comment on the report.
   The retailing giant had announced last October that it would sell
the downtown Chicago landmark as part of a corporate restructuring,
and it reportedly began serious talks with Olympia &amp; York earlier
this summer.
   Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York, according to media reports, had
agreed to pay around $1 billion for the 110-story building and was
considering signing British-based publisher Maxwell Communications
Corp. as its anchor tenant. Sears' Merchandise Group is currently
the tower's anchor tenant.
   Sears had agreed to continue to pay rent for six years on the
space it was planning to vacate but it said it was unwilling to
shoulder any increased taxes, according to the Journal.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .19 to 2,707.45 in

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

   But some observers said it may take something more surprising to
stir stocks out of their recent torpor.
   And with prices still hovering near the record highs they reached
a couple of weeks ago, talk persisted on Wall Street that the market

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan
intends to sell not only the nation's largest pizza delivery chain
but also most of the rest of his multimillion-dollar holdings, a
spokesman says.
   Monaghan said last week in a letter to Domino's franchisees and
employees that he might sell the chain to leave him with more time
for charitable work. Monaghan also said the sale could protect the
company from controversy surrounding his outside activities,
including opposition to abortion.
   But there is more on the block, company spokesman Ron Hingst said
Tuesday.
   ``Everything's up for sale _ except the Tigers and his wife
Margie,'' Hingst said. Monaghan bought the Detroit Tigers in 1983,
and the American League club went on to win the World Series the
next season.
   Besides Domino's, which reported sales of $2.3 billion in 1988,
Monaghan owns 3,000 acres of property on Drummond Island in northern
Lake Huron; Domino's Farms, the company's $250-million headquarters
outside Ann Arbor; computer software companies; about 300 classic
automobiles; and about $30 million worth of furniture and
memorabilia by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
   Domino's has been flooded with calls from investment bankers
interested in helping Monaghan sell the pizza chain, but there have
been no recent bids from buyers, Hingst said.

<HEAD>Monthly Figures Show Sharp Decline in Domestic Production, Rise in
Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic crude oil production dropped 6.6 percent in August
compared with a year earlier, falling to the lowest daily output
level in more than 25 years, the American Petroleum Institute
reported today.
   The trade group's monthly breakdown of supply and demand in the
United States also said August imports of oil and petroleum products
rose 16.3 percent over a year earlier and supplied nearly half of
American requirements for the second straight month.
   The API report reflected both falling domestic production and a
rising American dependence on foreign energy sources, trends that
have resurrected fears in Washington of an excessive reliance on
imports.
   The report said year-to-date domestic oil production has been
falling at an average annual rate of 5 percent to 6 percent compared
with 1988, nearly double the decline of 3.2 percent for the previous
three years.
   The report said it was clear that production in all oil-producing
states has been declining rapidly, even after adjusting for
temporary production curtailments in Alaska caused by the March 24
Exxon oil spill.
   U.S. crude production averaged 7.545 million barrels a day in
August, vs. 8.079 million barrels a day in August 1988, the report
said. The last full year in which average daily domestic crude
production dipped as low was in 1963.
   Imports of crude oil and petroleum products in August totaled
8.559 million barrels a day compared with 7.361 million barrels a
day in August 1988. The import level nearly matched the July level
of 8.6 million barrels a day, keeping total imports' share of
domestic deliveries near the 50 percent mark. Among other key
statistics in the report:
   _ Domestic demand for oil and petroleum products declined
slightly in August, to 17.438 million barrels a day from 17.482
million in August 1988.
   _ Domestic refineries operated at 90.3 percent of capacity in
August, compared with 87.4 percent a year earlier.
   The API, based in Washington, represents 200 corporations in the
petroleum and related products industries, including producers,
refiners, marketers and transporters of crude oil, lubricating oil,
gasoline and natural gas.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Retreat Following Bearish Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices retreated
slightly this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade following a
government crop report construed as neutral to slightly bearish.
   The Agriculture Department report released late Tuesday projected
slightly larger 1989 corn and wheat harvests than traders had
expected _ 7.32 billion bushels of corn and 2.06 billion bushels of
wheat.
   The USDA's soybean crop estimate of 1.89 billion bushels was in
line with expectations.
   ``There's really not a whole lot in these reports that's going to
impact these markets,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in New
York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   He said the markets were focusing instead on slack foreign demand
for U.S. grains and speculation that the USDA will take action soon
to increase wheat acreage.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.92} a bushel; corn
was } cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.35{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents lower with September at $1.36 a bushel;
soybeans were 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at
$6.01 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .32 cent higher with October at
72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .58 cent higher
with September at 83.20 cents a pound; hog futures were .15 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with October at 39.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .02 cent to .83 cent lower with February at 46
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Tuesday while pork futures were
mixed.

finished goods, due out Friday, is expected to show no change or a

   Americans shouldn't let minors buy cigarettes
from vending machines any more than they would tolerate machines
selling liquor to anyone with the correct change, Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop told Congress today.
   The machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco and send a
message that this country isn't worried that they will become
addicted, Koop said.
   ``There is no logical reason why we should have a double standard
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol, the two major legal
addicting drugs used in our society,'' he told a congressional
hearing.
   ``Would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages through
vending machines? Would we allow free samples of alcoholic beverages
to be sent through the mail or passed out on public property? Of
course not,'' he said.
   Koop, whose tenure as the nation's health policy chief ends this
month, said 43 states have laws on the books banning tobacco sales
to minors, but don't enforce them.
   ``As long as states take no action to enforce these laws, I
support federal efforts to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors,''
he said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on transportation and hazardous materials.
   Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, is pressing for a
federal law restricting tobacco vending machine sales.
   At a previous hearing on Luken's bill, the Tobacco Institute,
citing a report by a vending machine trade organization, the
National Automatic Merchandising Association, said only 2{ percent
of teen-age smokers bought their cigarettes from machines.
   A federal limit on vending machine sales ``is a solution in
search of a problem,'' said institute spokesman Charles O. Whitley.
``It would pursue its goal at the cost of severe economic
consequences for an industry already beset by high taxes and
burdensome regulation.''
   Whitley told the panel that ``Most cigarette vending machines are
located in factories, offices and other establishments that are not
open to the publlic or generally are not frequented by persons under
18.''
   About eight out of 10 cigarette machines are nowhere near areas
frequented by teen-agers, according to the Tobacco Institute
testimony.
   But Koop said that is enough machines to justify federal action.
   ``Even if true, and I'm not convinced it is, it's a poor argument
against banning vending machine sales of cigarettes,'' Koop said in
his statement. ``Even 20 percent of the 374,000 vending machines in
the United States represents a huge number of sites from which
teen-agers can readily obtain cigarettes, illegally.''
   Koop also told the panel he opposes the U.S. government's crusade
to force Thailand into repealing its ban on tobacco advertising.
   He said America is not respected overseas ``because of the manner
in which we export disease and death to underdeveloped countries.''

<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the beleaguered
Australian group led by Alan Bond, said Wednesday it sold its 20.4
percent stake in the British conglomerate Lonrho PLC, for an
undisclosed sum.
   Bond Corp. said it sold about 114.3 million shares to the British
investment firms Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. and Smith
New Court Securities PLC, for ``onward distribution to investors.''
   Lonrho stock was down the equivalent of 17 cents to $4.56 a share
at midafternoon on London's Stock Exchange.
   Bond Corp. bought its holding in Lonrho shares last autumn, which
prompted speculation of an impending bid.
   But Bond announced that he would sell his Lonrho holding at a
minimum price of $5.97 a share after Lonrho rejected Bond's offer to
cooperate with the British company.

   Sales of cars and light trucks made by the
nation's Big Three automakers rose 2.2 percent in early September
compared with last year, as a drop in car sales offset an increase
in truck sales, the companies said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they
sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 28,848 during the Sept.
1-10 period this year, compared with a daily rate of 28,215 during
the same time last year.
   Big Three domestic car sales fell 0.2 percent, while truck sales
rose 6.3 percent.
   The sales rate during the last several reporting periods has
shown improvement over corresponding periods last year, which ended
up the second-best year on record.
   Fears of price increases for the 1990-model cars, which are
arriving at showrooms now, and incentive programs which were not in
effect during the period last year have been attracting consumers to
dealerships. This year started out with a slow sales pace, compared
with last year.
   Through Sept. 10 this year, the Big Three had sold 3.6 percent
fewer cars than they had during the same time in 1988. The average
daily car and light truck sales rate fell to 35,242 this year from
36,561 last year.
   Year-to-date car sales were off 5.5 percent and truck sales were
down 0.3 percent.
   Ford was the only one of the Big Three to report declines in
early-September car and truck sales. The nation's No. 2 automaker
said its car sales were off 6.6 percent this year compared with
last, and truck sales were down 10.8 percent.
   For the year, Ford's car sales were off 0.1 percent and its truck
sales were down 2 percent.
   GM said its early-September car sales rose 1.7 percent, while
truck sales jumped 30.5 percent. For the year, GM's car sales were
running 7.1 percent behind last year's pace and truck sales were up
0.9 percent.
   Chrysler said its cars sold at a 6.7 percent brisker pace during
the 10-day period this year, but for the year were down 11.5
percent. Truck sales at Chrysler, whose earnings depend heavily on
the vehicles, were down 8.3 percent in early September and off 0.1
percent for the year.

<HEAD>Currency Trading in U.S. Doubles to $129 Billion a Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Currency trading in the United States has more
than doubled in the last three years to about $129 billion a day,
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said today.
   Growth in trading volume has far outpaced the growth in the U.S.
economy and the expansion of world trade, said Gretchen Greene, a
senior vice president at the central bank.
   U.S. businesses need to trade currencies in order to turn their
earnings from overseas sales or investments back into dollars, or to
obtain foreign currencies for spending in foreign countries.
   But the vast majority of the volume of currency trading is simple
speculation, in which banks and other traders buy currencies they
expect to rise and sell ones they expect to fall.
   By taking on extra risk in the hope of profit, the speculators
allow companies that actually need foreign currencies to lay off
risk by hedging.
   Although there are no precise estimates of the amount of
speculation that goes on, Ms. Greene said banks did only 12 percent
of their trading volume with parties that were not themselves
involved in wholesale currency trading, such as industrial companies.
   Based on a monthlong survey in April, the average daily volume of
currency trading in the United States was $128.9 billion, up 120
percent from $58.5 billion in March 1986, the last time the survey
was conducted.
   The survey covered trading done by 127 banks and 14 non-bank
financial institutions, which are believed to be almost all the ones
actively involved in currency trading.
   The West German mark remained the most actively traded foreign
currency.

   The dollar drifted lower Wednesday as traders
marked time until the release of the next batch of U.S. economic
data.
   Gold prices were little changed in thin trading.
   The market has been waiting all week for fresh economic news to
give the dollar direction. The most important figures are the U.S.
trade data for July, due out on Friday. There is also the potential
for some market movement on Thursday when Washington releases the
August retail sales data.
   ``There is a rally waiting to happen,'' said William Simpson, an

Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.9800 West German marks, down from 1.9880;

   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $359.93 an ounce, unchanged

<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of a proposed smoking ban on
all airline flights today scheduled a Thursday vote aimed at
stopping tobacco state lawmakers from blocking the legislation.
   The vote was scheduled by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, after opponents of the ban threatened to hold up unrelated
spending bills unless a compromise was reached.
   Tobacco state senators had said earlier that rather than the
stronger restrictions, they would accept a permanent ban on smoking
aboard airline flights of two hours or less.
   ``We're willing to make that permanent,'' Sen. Wendell Ford,
D-Ky., said of the current smoking ban on two-hour flights, which is
due to expire next April.
   But he said he would continue opposing a provision permanently
extending the ban to all flights, language that is part of a bill
providing $11.9 billion for next year's federal transportation
programs.
   ``This one will take basically a week to get through,'' Ford said
of the transportation bill. That would delay approval of other
spending legislation awaiting Senate approval, he said.
   Congressional leaders want to complete work on the transportation
measure, and 12 other spending bills, by the Oct. 1 start of fiscal
1990.
   But the author of the permanent smoking prohibition on all
flights, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., continued to defend his
measure and called on opponents of the ban to let work on the bill
proceed.
   ``If they have a case to make they ought to make it and let us
vote on it,'' Lautenberg said.
   The House voted Aug. 3 to make the ban on two-hour flights
permanent. Tobacco industry supporters have said they are willing to
accept that if Lautenberg will drop his insistence on the broader
restrictions.
   Lautenberg, supported by health groups and airline unions, argues
that non-smoking passengers risk cancer and other diseases because
of the cigarette smoke they breathe in airline cabins.
   The tobacco industry has argued that there is no convincing
evidence that such smoke is dangerous and that there are other
chemicals besides cigarette fumes in the recirculated air of
airliner cabins.
   Tobacco supporters in Congress have also said the restrictions
would hurt tobacco growers.

   National Intergroup Inc. said Wednesday it will
sell the rolling division of its National Aluminum Corp. subsidiary
to Norandal USA Inc., a subsidiary of Noranda Inc. of Toronto, for
$117.7 million.
   National Aluminum's unit employs about 500 workers in Caldwell,
Ohio; Salisbury, N.C.; and Newport, Ark.
   National Intergroup said the rolling division contributed about
$15.2 million in profit on sales of $204.6 million to National
Aluminum in fiscal 1989.
   ``The proposed sale...is in keeping with our previously stated
strategy to divest our metals businesses and to focus on our
long-term strategy of being a leader in wholesale distribution,''
said National Intergroup Chairman Howard M. Love.
   He said selling off National Aluminum by divisions was better
than selling it whole.
   Love said National Intergroup is ``continuing to explore its
options'' for National Aluminum's extrusion division in Anniston,
Ala., and its 55 percent-owned primary smelter in Hawesville, Ky.
   Love said the sale is expected to result in a non-recurring,
third-quarter gain of about $30 million after taxes and expenses.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. expects several hundred of
the 700 eligible workers to accept its offer of 40 to 104 weeks of
pay if they voluntarily leave the company.
   Digital, the nation's second largest computer firm, has never had
a layoff in its 31-year-history and said it has no plans for one.
   Under intense price competition and declining U.S. sales,
however, the Maynard-based company is undertaking what it calls a
``work force transition'' to reduce its manufacturing payroll by
4,000 jobs this year through redeployment and retraining. The
voluntary severance package was not connected with the larger
effort, said Jeff Gibson, a Digital spokesman.
   The plan was offered Tuesday to 500 workers at Digital's former
systems manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H., and 200 employees based
at other sites whose jobs are related to the Salem facility.
   Digital said it expects several hundred employees to accept the
offer. Those who choose not to leave the company may be transferred.
   Digital now employs 125,800 people worldwide, including 33,600 in
Massachusetts. In May, the company froze the salaries of all of its
73,500 employees in the United States. Employees at foreign
facilities were not affected because sales overseas have remained
strong.
   Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the severance package
will include 40 weeks of py for employees with less than two years
of service.
   Employees with three to 10 years of service are also eligible for
40 weeks of pay, plus three additional weeks for every year of
service over three years. That means a 10-year veteran would get 61
weeks of pay.
   Employees with more than 10 years of service would get 64 weeks
of pay, plus four more weeks for each year between 11 and 20. The
maximum award is 104 weeks of pay.
   In addition, Digital will maintain medical, dental and life
insurance coverage for the employees for one year. And the company
said it will provide free outplacement services.

   The government Wednesday proposed fining the
owner of Maine's largest paper mill nearly $1.6 million for 531
alleged safety violations inspectors said left workers at
substantial risk of death and serious injury.
   The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said many of the problems found at the Boise Cascade
Corp. mill in Rumford, Maine, had been detected in company safety
audits but left uncorrected.
   A government inspection six months ago found ``a substantial
disregard by this major corporation for the safety and health of its
employees,'' said Alan C. McMillan, acting OSHA chief.
   The inspection of the mill, which has 1,600 workers, was
requested by the United Paperworkers union, OSHA said.
   Boise Cascade has 15 working days to contest the citations and
the $1,591,600 in proposed fines. Boise Cascade spokesman Eric A.
Baxter said the OSHA complaint would be reviewed ``item by item''
before any decision is made.
   ``We welcome any effort that will help us improve the safety of
our mill,'' Baxter said. ``Safety is the utmost priority here at
Boise Cascade.''
   A nearly $1 billion modernization plan for the mill included
significant safety improvements, he said.
   OSHA cited Boise Cascade for more than 300 alleged willful
violations of safety standards, including sub-par records
documenting illnesses and injuries, unsafe operation of industrial
trucks, failure to protect workers from exposed, high-voltage
electrical equipment, improper guarding of power equipment such as
belts and pulleys and failure to vent gases to safe locations.
   Other alleged willful violations included failure to install
guard rails to protect workers from falls, unsafe noise exposure,
inadequate emergency response plans and inadequate respiratory
protections.
   Willful violations are those in which an employer knows a
violation or potential violation of safety standards exists but does
nothing to correct it.
   Boise Cascade also was accused of 175 serious violations, 33
``less serious'' violations and five repeat violations.
   Serious violations are those in which an employer knew or should
have known about conditions that pose a substantial probability of
death or serious injury but doesn't correct the problems.
   The company drew attention earlier this week because of a violent
protest at a Minnesota paper mill.
   The protest by union workers and supporters was attributed to a
company decision to hire a non-union general contractor for a mill
expansion project, who in turn has hired mostly non-union labor.
   Twenty-nine people were arrested at the protest, which caused a
reported $1.3 million in damage to the International Falls, Minn.,
mill near the Canadian border.

   The stock market declined slightly in an erratic
session today, still struggling to break out of its recent narrow
trading range.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.03 to 2,700.23
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 766 down and
523 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were hoping for some positive news later in
the week to serve as a market stimulus.
   For instance, the monthly data on the producer price index of
finished goods, due out Friday, is expected to show no change or a
modest decline in that measure of inflationary pressures.
   But some observers said it may take something more surprising to
stir stocks out of their recent torpor.
   And with prices still hovering near the record highs they reached
a couple of weeks ago, talk persisted on Wall Street that the market
might be heading for a ``correction,'' or period of retrenchment.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
dropped [ to 40]; International Business Machines lost ] to 116{;
Exxon fell { to 44~, McDonald's was unchanged at 29|.
   MGM-UA Communications climbed 1} to 21{. The company said it
received a takeover bid from another NYSE-listed concern it didn't
identify.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .37 to 193.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .30 at 384.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.50 million shares with an

to Close</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout, CORRECTS Qintex bid to $1.2 billion to account
for preferred stock and changes Qintex Entertainment to Qintex Australia;
including new details and analyst comment.</HEAD>

   MGM-UA Communications Co. said today
that it had received a $1.35 billion buyout offer from an
unidentified bidder that would apparently compete with an Australian
company's offer of $1.2 billion.
   MGM-UA identified the prospective buyer only as a New York Stock
Exchange-listed company who it said had offered $23.16 per share of
MGM-UA common stock and $18 per share of preferred stock.
   The proposal values the stock at aout $1.35 billion, or about
$150 million more than the bid for the same stock that Qintex
Australia Ltd. has made through an affiliate.
   Andrew Wallach, an analyst who follows MGM-UA for Drexel Burnham
Lambert, said speculation on the buyer focused on media giants who
have shown interest in MGM-UA in the past.
   They include 20th Century Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., Sony Corp., The Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc.
   Qintex Australia owns 43 percent of Qintex Entertainment Inc., a
TV company that financed part of the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove'' and bills itself as Australia's largest TV production and
distribution company.
   When assumption of debt and other factors are considered, the
Qintex bid totals about $1.35 billion, according to Qintex
Entertainment Executive Vice President John Lloyd. If the same
factors applied on the new offer _ details in MGM-UA's announcement
were sketchy _ it would total $1.5 billion, Lloyd said.
   He said Qintex was waiting to learn details about the new offer
and would have no immediate comment about it.
   The Qintex deal was to have closed by the end of this month. In
essence, it would split the present MGM-UA Communications Co., and
leave majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian in control of the MGM
portion of the business.
   By the time Kerkorian bought back the MGM businesses, Qintex
would have paid about $600 million for United Artists.
   MGM-UA spokeswoman Mary Hardy said the company's board will meet
Thursday to consider the latest offer. MGM-UA shareholders were
scheduled to vote on the Qintex offer at a meeting Sept. 23. MGM-UA
has agreed to pay Qintex $18 million if it accepts another offer.
   Ms. Hardy declined to say whether the latest offer had been
expected by the board or Kerkorian, the Los Angeles billionaire who
owns 82 percent of MGM-UA's 50.6 million common shares of stock and
all but a tiny fraction of MGM-UA's 10.1 million shares of preferred
stock.
   MGM-UA said nothing about the financing involved in the latest
offer.
   Qintex has assembled a group of 10 Asian and European investors
to help finance its deal. The investors would buy stock worth $500
million, while Qintex Group would buy shares worth $100 million.
   The renamed United Artists Corp. would be the first big American
motion picture studio to pass into foreign hands.
   United Artists, one of the five dominant U.S. movie studios,
holds the rights to 4,000 movies, including the ``The Pink Panther''
and James Bond series and Rocky films.
   Kerkorian's ``new'' MGM that he would buy back from Qintex would
include movie and TV production assets and a library of 34 recent
films, including ``Moonstruck'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda.''

   The dollar declined Wednesday against all key
foreign currencies in quiet trading.
   Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $359.90 a troy ounce, up 40 cents from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $358.70 an
ounce, up 20 cents.
   Linda McLaughlin, a currency trader for Chemical New York Capital
Markets Group, attributed the dollar's decline largely to renewed
concerns that West Germany and Japan might soon raise their interest
rates, and that would help strengthen the currencies in those
countries.
   But she said Wednesday's trading was relatively light as many
dealers preferred to keep a low profile in anticipation of a spate
of upcoming economic data.
   The government is scheduled to release its report on August
retail sales on Thursday. Reports due out Friday include August
producer prices and industrial production and July merchandise trade.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to 146.70 Japanese yen from 146.73 yen Tuesday. It
traded at 146.90 yen in London, and at 146.40 yen in New York, down
from 146.905.
   The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In London, the
pound rose to $1.5530 from $1.5470 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched
$1.5585 in New York, up from $1.5485.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.9725 West German marks, down from 1.9865; 1.6990
Swiss francs, down from 1.7140; 6.6525 French francs, down from
6.6915; 1.18405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18725; and 1,415.00
Italian lire, down from 1,422.125.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday,
included: 1.9800 West German marks, down from 1.9880; 1.7095 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7160; 6.6805 French francs, down from 6.6950;
2.2300 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2330; 1.1855 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1892; and 1,419.00 Italian lire, down from 1,421.75.
   Gold traded at $358.50 an ounce in London late Wednesday, down
from $358.75 bid Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $358.25 an ounce
from $358.55.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $359.93 an ounce,
unchanged from Tuesday.
   Silver prices were little changed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.067 from $5.069 Tuesday.
Silver closed in London at $5.08 an ounce, unchanged.

   The stock market yielded to a late-afternoon
barrage of selling Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial
average below 2,700 for the first time in three weeks.
   Brokers attributed the selloff partly to rumors, which were
quickly denied, that a major brokerage firm was facing large losses
from a position in high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 27.74 points to
2,679.52, closing below 2,700 for the first time since it stood at
2,678.11 on Aug. 23.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
555 up, 912 down and 526 unchanged.
   The market's drop in the last hour of trading came as rumors
spread that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was sustaining losses from holdings
in bonds of a unit of Campeau Corp., which is undergoing a financial
restructuring that includes plans to sell its Bloomingdale's
department store chain.
   Merrill Lynch denied that it faced any losses in the junk bond
sector, and said it owned no bonds related to Campeau. But Merrill
stock dropped 1] to 32~.
   Otherwise, analysts said traders were hoping for some positive
news later in the week to serve as a market stimulus.
   For instance, the monthly data on the producer price index of
finished goods, due out Friday, is expected to show no change or a
modest decline in that measure of inflationary pressures.

   MGM-UA Communications climbed 1{ to 21\. The company said it

   Circle K Corp. was the day's biggest percentage loser among NYSE
issues, down 1} at 7}. The company said it had ended efforts to
solicit takeover proposals without attracting a bidder, and
suspended its dividend.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.33 million
shares, up from 142.14 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 208.69 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $23.08 billion, or 0.67
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   Somewhere under the rainbow, a group of
Tupperware executives broke into a song and dance about the famous
air-tight plastic containers. Soon, some of the other 10,000 top
dealers and family members at the annual corporate jubilee took up
the chorus.
   The celebration, once the premier local shindig in the days
before the Central Florida theme-park boom, was held last month
beneath a 120-foot metal rainbow erected behind Tupperware world
headquarters.
   The spot seemed appropriate for a company that spent years
hunting for the pot of gold it lost when waves of working mothers
and faster-paced lifestyles made its trademark home-party sales
system seem like an ``Ozzie and Harriet'' era anachronism.
   The quest to modernize may be starting to pay off for Tupperware,
which is a unit of Premark International Inc.
   After a post-recession slump in the mid-1980s, Tupperware Home
Parties last year reported sales rose to a record $967.1 million.
More than 100,000 independent dealers in the United States _ also a
record _ are now out toting their wares from office conference rooms
to day-care centers.
   With more than 80 million people attending a Tupperware party
somewhere last year, the company is outselling its nearest kitchen
container rival, Rubbermaid Inc., by nearly 2-1.
   ``Nobody dislikes Tupperware. The question was: `How were people
going to find the time to buy it these days?','' said Robert
Donegan, vice president of marketing. ``We may have been slower than
others to respond to the changing lifestyles. But I think we've got
it together now.''
   Today, alternatives to the traditional two-hour home parties
account for about 25 percent of total sales of Tupperware, which was
pulled from store shelves in April 1951.
   Dealers are now catching customers during coffee breaks and after
work _ a strategy adopted by other giants of the $9 billion
direct-sale industry such as Avon Products Inc. and Fuller Brush Co.
   Donegan said one of the most effective new tactics is the
``rush-hour'' party, a brief display of products at a house or other
site along commuter routes.
   ``People don't have a lot of time now, so we get right to the
point, show the product, answer questions and take the order,'' he
said.
   Tupperware this month also began allowing orders by Visa and
Mastercard and is testing a system to ship products directly to
customers rather than via the longer route from distributor to
dealer.
   Later this year, it may air television spots to show consumers
how to get in touch with dealers.
   Since the company began phasing out references to its ``burp''
seal in 1979, more contemporary pastel and earth-tone colors have
been emphasized and smaller containers emerged to handle leftovers
of singles and one-parent families.
   Yet one of the most popular of the nearly 200 products remains
the original bell tumbler, one of 24 Tupperware pieces in the
permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
   ``Our products are timeless. We're just trying to stay up with
the times in the way we make them available,'' said Tupperware
spokeswoman Lawrie Pitcher Platt.
   It's also a different brand of sales people. Although virtually
all the 350,000 independent dealers and distributors worldwide are
still women, the days have passed when Tupperware attracted
housewives with time on their hands but little outside work
experience. Many of the new Tupperware dealers in the United States
are college educated and seeking a part-time job or the freedom of
independent sales.
   ``It looked for a while like we were in big trouble, but these
new women really figured out how to get out there and sell,'' said
Tom Damigella, 74, an Everett, Mass.-based distributor who helped
Tupperware founder Earl Tupper develop the home party concept in the
late 1940s. ``We got some real bright women out there for us now.''
   The seed for the Tupperware empire was a lump of black
polyethylene slag, a petroleum byproduct. Tupper, a self-educated
chemist and tinkerer, developed a process to purify the goop into a
tough yet flexible translucent plastic.
   Tupper found the non-porous plastic was perfect for food storage.
The air-tight seal was modeled after a paint can lid in reverse. By
1945, Tupper Corp. products were appearing in stores, but public
acceptance was slow and consumers were stumped by the seal.
   Damigella and Brownie Wise, who both sold Stanley tools and other
home products on a home party plan, worked with Tupper to develop
its party plan, which was nearly unaltered until sales began to drop
in 1983.
   Tupper, who died in 1983, had sold the company in 1958 to Rexall
Drug and Chemical Co., which 11 years later was renamed Dart
Industries Inc. Tupperware became a unit of Premark International in
June 1986 when Dart &amp; Kraft Inc., a successor to Dart Industries,
separated its holdings.
   In its 39-nation market, Tupperware has tried to meet some unique
demands. In Latin America, it produces a tortilla holder. Japanese
customers can order a kimono storage bin. Presently, studies are
under way for possible expansion into China and the Soviet Union.
   But there are no plans to bring Tupperware back to stores after
38 years.
   ``There's sort of a mystique to Tupperware and the fact you can't
just go out and buy it,'' said Donegan, holding one of the bell
tumblers. ``The company is a little like the product. We may have
changed a bit over the years, but the basic formula doesn't change.''

   A former New York Federal Reserve Bank
director, Robert A. Rough, was sentenced to six months in prison
Wednesday for leaking secret interest rate data.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise also ordered the
50-year-old ex-banker, who made an emotional plea for mercy before
the sentencing, to perform 200 hours of community service during two
years of probation.
   Debevoise called the case ``particularly sad'' and said he was
convinced that Rough's anguished expression of remorse in his
remarks to the judge ``came from the heart.''
   But he said jail time for Rough was ``essential for the public
perception of the fairness of the system'' _ that white collar
criminals, and those with advantaged backgrounds, be properly
punished.
   ``I breached a trust placed in me, and in doing so, blemished the
reputation of the institution I still revere,'' said Rough, his
voice quavering with emotion.
   He said a picture of former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker remains hanging on his wall. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York is part of the Fed's regional system.
   Rough sat on the New York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984 while
president of the National Bank of Sussex County in Branchville.
While there, Rough admitted in a plea bargain, he regularly
disclosed advance word regarding the Fed's discount rate to a
now-defunct Livingston brokerage firm, Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman
Inc. The discount rate is the Fed's interest charge on loans to
financial institutions.
   Bevill, Bresler traded in government securities, the market of
which is powerfully affected by the discount rate.
   Federal authorities called the case the first to involve insider
trading of government securities, and the first such charges against
a director in the Fed system.
   Rough could have received up to five years in prison. But in an
unusual move, the U.S. attorney's office recommended that if Rough
was sent to prison, it should be for less than a year. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman, in a pre-sentencing memo, said Rough
expected no financial gain.
   Debevoise agreed to recommend that Rough serve his sentence,
beginning Oct. 16, at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a minimum
security prison camp. Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, who had
asked for probation, said his client would probably serve about 4{
months, accounting for time off for good behavior.
   Rough's career as a prosperous ``country banker'' who once
aspired to be chairman of the Federal Deposity Insurance Corporation
began to unravel in the spring of 1987, when witnesses at the trial
of Bevill, Bresler president Gilbert C. Schulman disclosed the
allegations.
   Rough usually leaked the data to Schulman, and blamed his actions
on a misguided friendship with the Bevill, Bresler official.
Schulman and four other top executives of the firm were sent to
prison in connection with its April 1985 collapse.
   In his remarks to Debevoise, Rough said his life was in tatters
following the December 1988 indictment. Rough said his wife is
seeking a divorce, his funds vanished, his career finished, his sons
in trouble with the law and his reputation gone.
   ``I am an outcast in the banking community and my own
community,'' he said. ``These past few years have been truly a
living hell.''
   Rough began in the banking world as a bank runner at age 14 and
started working as a management trainee and auditor at the New York
Fed in 1961. He joined the National Bank of Sussex eight years
later, and rose to president in 1978 during explosive growth at the
rural institution.
   Banking was in his veins, he said, with his grandfather and
father in the industry. Rough said he still wore his father's
retirement watch.
   Rough said he remembered being scolded as a youth by his father.
   ``He would shake his head and say, `Son, you let me down.' God
knows my dad must be shaking his head now,'' said Rough, his voice
choked with emotion.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Skyrocket On Dwindling World Supply Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices skyrocketed Wednesday on the New York
Cotton Exchange, climbing as much as 2 cents a pound, the permitted
daily limit, on fresh signs of shrinking world supplies.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell steeply; most
energy futures advanced and precious metals, livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Cotton futures settled 1.13 cents to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 73.77 cents a pound.
   The rally was rooted partly in Tuesday's Agriculture Department
crop report, which painted an ultimately bullish scenario for
cotton, although it was not apparent at first blush.
   For starters, the USDA estimated the 1989 cotton crop at 12.28
million bales, which represents a 20 percent decline from the 1988
harvest but an increase of 450,000 bales from the agency's August
estimate.
   The estimate was higher than expected, which would have been a
bearish signal _ except that the USDA also reduced by 400,000 bales
its estimate of the U.S. cotton stockpile as of last July 31,
offsetting the increased harvest projection.
   The bullish news came in the USDA's new projection for world
cotton stocks as of next July 1: 25.2 million bales, 1 million less
than the agency had predicted a month earlier.
   World supplies are dwindling, analysts said, because of poor
growing weather both in the United States and abroad.
   ``The foreign crops are not doing well, especially in China and
the Soviet Union,'' said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist in New York
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The U.S. crop, which was punished earlier this year by too much
rain in the Southeast and too little in Texas, has been taking
another beating this week due to cold, wet weather in the high
plains of Texas.
   Prospects for at least another day of harsh weather contributed
to cotton's rally.
   Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade in selling sparked by a higher 1989 wheat crop estimate and
expectations for an increase in 1990 wheat acreage.
   The USDA raised its projection for the 1989 wheat harvest to 2.06
billion bushels from 2.04 billion, surprising traders who had
expected little change in the number.
   Further selling was linked to persistent rumors that the
Agriculture Department is preparing to revise its 1990 wheat program
to allow farmers to increase spring wheat planting, which is already
underway, by as much as 10 million acres.
   Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., said that despite the improved 1989 harvest outlook,
U.S. wheat stocks are relatively low.
   He said USDA leaders are worried the United States may have to
reduce its wheat exports unless it can ensure an increase in
supplies.
   Wheat futures settled 8 cents to 14 cents lower with September at
$3.85 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 5{ cents lower with September
at $2.33} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with
September at $1.34 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 15{ cents
lower with September at $5.86{ a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures traded above $20 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange but closed below that level as the technically
inspired rally ran out of gas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 16 cents
higher with October at $19.86 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with October at 55.46 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .21 cent to .86 cent higher with October at
57.75 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures rose slightly while silver inched lower on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 20 cents higher across the board with October at
$361.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to .06 cent lower with
September at $5.067 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 72.02 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .38 cent higher with September
at 83 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower to .55 cent higher
with October at 39.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20
cent to .32 cent lower with February at 46.25 cents a pound.

   About 100 striking Eastern Airlines workers and
their supporters picketed parent company Texas Air Corp.'s annual
meeting Wednesday, carrying signs and balloons critical of Chairman
Frank Lorenzo.
   ``We hope to get rid of Mr. Lorenzo,'' said Jim Fullerton, of
Houston, an Eastern pilot for 25 years and on strike since March.
``I miss flying, definitely, but I'm not going to fly for Mr.
Lorenzo's type of management.
   ``All we can do is peacefully demonstrate, withhold our services
and convince people not to fly (sister carrier) Continental Airlines
and get him through his pocketbook.''
   Many of the demonstrators had red and black balloons affixed with
stickers showing Lorenzo's name enclosed in a red circle and with a
slash mark through it.
   The demonstration, outside the elegant Four Seasons Hotel in
downtown Houston where shareholders met, was peaceful and quiet and
began breaking up as the mid-afternoon meeting began. Houston police
sat in squad cars nearby.
   Security at the hotel was tight and similar to measures taken for
a presidential visit. Uniformed police were stationed at the
entrances to the meeting room while plainclothes security men were
obvious elsewhere. People attending the meeting had to pass through
metal detectors.
   The Machinists union walked out March 9 in the wake of a lengthy
contract dispute, and the pilots and flight attendants joined the
strike. Eastern is restructuring under bankruptcy court protection
as a smaller carrier and has hired hundreds of replacement employees.
   ``When we come back _ not if _ this will be the best airline
you'll ever see,'' said Al Glover, a striking machinist who wore a
Frank Lorenzo mask and carried a sign proclaiming the Texas Air
chairman as ``the most hated man in America.''
   Inside the hotel lobby was a handful of working Eastern pilots
and flight attendants wearing buttons proclaiming ``Eastern is
working, and so are we.''
   ``We've got thick skins, we just ignore them,'' Sue Alfonso, an
Eastern agent from Atlanta, said of the demonstrators. ``We're here
to represent Eastern and let everyone know we're proud to be
Eastern.''
   ``I've been in this all the way,'' said Frank Barber, of Miami, a
pilot for 23 years. ``My mind was made up from the beginning. My
main concern is our airline's survival.''
   He said airline management made the trip to the Houston meeting
available to him if he wanted it, but ``nobody told me what to say
or do.''
   Barber said the picket line Wednesday was no big deal following
his experiences earlier this year in Boston, when angry protesters
smashed the windows out of an Eastern van. He also said nails had
been scattered on the driveway of his home, his phone rings
routinely late at night and he ``gets every magazine published''
because subscriptions have been submitted with his name.
   ``I've started to like some of them,'' Barber laughed.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Rise on Increased Demand</HEAD>

   Demand for gasoline and heating oil boosted
energy futures higher in brisk trading Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.86 cent to close at 57.75 cents a
gallon while heating oil for October delivery picked up 0.09 cent to
settle at 55.46 cents a gallon.
   On Tuesday, gasoline fell 0.18 cent while heating oil slipped
0.73 cent.
   Prices for refined products moved higher as demand stepped up in
several markets across the country, said Andrew Lebow, an energy
futures analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The strength carried over to the crude oil market, Lebow said.
When demand for gas and heating oil goes up, demand for crude _ from
which the products are refined _ also increases.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 16 cents to $19.86 a 42-gallon barrel.
The contract fell 6 cents on Tuesday.
   Lebow said prices were also supported by reports of production
problems at a new refinery in Norway.

<TEXT>
   Japan's public broadcasting organization, NHK, will
sell some of its high-definition television technology to Texas
Instruments Inc. so the company can design chips for advanced
televisions, the companies said Wednesday.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, except TI's statement
that it will pay NHK for the transfer of its decoder technology. The
chips from Texas Instruments' Japanese arm will be sold to Japanese
television manufacturers.
   ``This agreement with NHK gives TI the system knowledge needed to
design integrated circuits for advanced televisions,'' said Akira
Ishikawa, TI's semiconductor group senior vice president and
president of TI Japan.
   ``TI will take this resulting technology and work with customers
in Japan, Europe and America.''
   TI said the agreement is part of an ``overall strategy to focus
and penetrate the advanced vision systems segment of the
semiconductor consumer market.''
   Meanwhile, TI also announced it plans to take a $10 million
charge in the third quarter because of severance pay and overhead
costs involved in last month's voluntary reduction plan.
   The Dallas-based company also said it expects capital spending to
exceed the $800 million previously announced. In addition, research
and development, including some funded by customers, should reach $1
billion this year.
   The formal name of NHK is Nihon Hoso Kyokai.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Dismiss Remaining Claims by Aquino Against Westinghouse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Wednesday to dismiss
civil charges that Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a New Jersey
engineering firm bribed former Philippines President Ferdinand E.
Marcos in order to win a nuclear power plant contract.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise keeps
alive a major claim in a broad lawsuit by the present Philippine
government.
   Debevoise in May shifted 13 of 15 counts of the suit, filed six
months before, to arbitration. The International Chamber of Commerce
will consider breach of contract, negligence, fraud, antitrust and
other claims.
   The suit said massive corruption surrounded the project, a $2.3
billion, 600-megawatt plant on the Bataan peninsula begun in 1976
but that has yet to open.
   The Philippine government is seeking recovery of its investment,
damages and the alleged bribes, which the Philippines say were
passed to Marcos through ``consultants'' linked to him.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, the nation's leading nuclear power
plant producer, in turn is seeking $30 million in fees through the
chamber's arbitration court. The other defendant is Burns &amp; Roe
Enterprises Inc. of Oradell.
   Both companies have denied that consultant fees were bribes.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Westinghouse attorney David Boies argued
that because Marcos was the Philippines' absolute power at the time,
a U.S. federal court was not the place to determine whether the
payments caused him to violate his duty to the nation.
   ``Marcos was Marcos; whatever he was doing he was doing with
absolute impunity long before Westinghouse came on the scene,''
Boies said.
   Mark Augenblick, an attorney for the Philippines, argued that the
scope of the deposed dictator's power at the time was not important.
   Marcos's wrongdoing ``does not mean that the Philippine
constitution and the laws of the Philippines do not apply,'' said
Augenblick.
   To throw out the remaining two bribe-related counts ``would send
a message that one can with impunity bribe the president of a
foreign country and avoid civil penalties in the United States,'' he
said.
   Debevoise called the defendants' arguments a ``semantic
exercise,'' ruling that the legality or illegality of a regime is
not the issue. What is important, he said, is whether such payments
were acceptable under applicable law.

   Allegheny International Inc. likely will lose
money for another two years after emerging from protection under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, the company said Wednesday.
   Company officials filed the projection, which they termed
speculative and highly conditional, with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
as exhibits to its latest reorganization proposal.
   Officials said the company will return to profitability in 1992
with a profit of $6.3 million on sales of $983 million.
   Meanwhile, management said, it expected the company to lose $32.9
million on sales of $879 million in fiscal 1990 and to lose $5.9
million on sales of $930 million in fiscal 1991.
   The Pittsburgh-based firm, best known for manufacturing Sunbeam
and Oster small appliances, has not made an annual profit since
1984. It has reported aggregate losses of more than $600 million
since.
   The company has filed six reorganization plans with the
bankruptcy court, but the first five failed to win approval. The
sixth is pending before the court.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop criticized U.S.
tobacco marketing at home and abroad Wednesday, backing a bill to
keep cigarette machines away from minors and declaring America is
not respected overseas ``because of the manner in which we export
disease and death.''
   Koop said the epithet ``ugly American'' will ``indeed come home
to roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of today
realize what we did to them.''
   He said the wide availability of cigarette vending machines in
the United States makes a mockery of laws forbidding minors to buy
cigarettes.
   ``Would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages through
vending machines?'' he asked. ``Would we allow free samples of
alcoholic beverages to be sent through the mail or passed out on
public property? Of course not.''
   Koop, in what he said would be his last appearance as surgeon
general on Capitol Hill, testified at a House subcommittee hearing
called by anti-smoking activists in Congress.
   He supported a bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, that
would forbid the placement of cigarette vending machines in any
location accessible to people under 18.
   During the hearing, Reps. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., and Luken both
took aim at possible Bush administration action against Thailand's
ban on tobacco advertising, comparing the case to the British East
India Co.'s efforts to develop Asian opium markets in the 1800s.
   Luken is pushing in particular for more restrictions on tobacco
advertising in this country, while Atkins wants to make it
impossible for the United States to challenge any other country's
limits on the sale of American cigarettes.
   Along with Koop and other members of Congress, they are scheduled
to testify next week at a U.S. Trade Representative hearing into
whether Thailand's tobacco ad ban is an unfair trading practice.
   The Tobacco Institute said the industry has pressed the U.S.
government to make it easier to sell in Korea, Japan, Thailand and
other countries _ but only to give the U.S. industry a fair shot at
the existing market for cigarettes.
   ``Wherever market barriers exist in foreign countries, it is and
should be our government's policy to eliminate them and promote
trade throughout the world,'' Tobacco Institute spokesman Charles O.
Whitley told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation
and hazardous materials.
   As for U.S. sales, Koop, who is retiring this month as the
nation's health policy chief, spoke in favor of a provision in
Luken's bill that would restrict vending-machine cigarette sales.
   He said the machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco and
send a message that this country isn't worried that they will become
addicted.
   ``There is no logical reason why we should have a double standard
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol, the two major legal
addicting drugs used in our society,'' Koop said.
   At a previous hearing on Luken's bill, the Tobacco Institute,
citing a report by a vending machine trade organization, the
National Automatic Merchandising Association, said only 2{ percent
of teen-age smokers bought their cigarettes from machines.
   Whitley told the panel, ``Most cigarette vending machines are
located in factories, offices and other establishments that are not
open to the public or generally are not frequented by persons under
18.''
   But Koop said, ``Even if true, and I'm not convinced it is, it's
a poor argument against banning vending machine sales of cigarettes.
... Even 20 percent of the 374,000 vending machines in the United
States represents a huge number of sites from which teen-agers can
readily obtain cigarettes, illegally.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ABC Television Network said Wednesday it
plans to launch a bimonthly magazine, Episodes, in February that
will be devoted to its own daytime soap operas.
   The magazine is the first of its kind for the television network,
a Capital Cities-ABC Inc. operation that said it has been developing
the publication for two years.
   Network officials said the purpose of the magazine is to attract
viewers to its daytime serials and to offer advertisers on those
shows another way to market their products.
   ABC said more than 18 million women watch its soap operas for at
least two hours a week, and that it hopes the magazine will have an
initial circulation of 2 million.
   The magazine will be available by telephone subscription. Those
wishing to subscribe will be directed in a promotional campaign that
will be carried on the ABC network starting in December to call a
900 number to sign up. The charge for the call and six issues will
be $3.

   Rupert Murdoch entered the bidding
for MGM-UA Communication Co. on Wednesday with an offer that values
the company at $1.8 billion, topping a rival $1.64 billion bid by an
Australian entertainment group.
   The bid was made by the media magnate's News Corp. Ltd. and its
20th Century Fox Film Corp. subsidiary.
   Analysts said Murdoch apparently wants MGM-UA's huge film
library, which he could use for his Fox TV network here and Sky
Television satellite operation in Europe.
   MGM-UA had agreed to sell its United Artists assets to an
affiliate of Qintex Australia Ltd. by the end of this month in a
deal that valued MGM-UA's stock at about $1.24 billion, $160 million
less than the new offer of $1.4 billion, according to MGM-UA
spokeswoman Mary Hardy.
   She said the buyer would also assume about $400 million in debt.
   MGM-UA said Fox and News Corp. had offered $23.16 for each of the
approximately 53 million shares of MGM-UA common stock and $18 per
share for the more than 10 million shares of preferred stock. Qintex
had offered $20 for each common share and $18 per preferred share.
   Shares of MGM-UA common stock closed Tuesday at $19.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange, a high for the year, then surged to $21.125 per
share by the close of trading Wednesday. Qintex plunged $2 to close
at $6 per share Wednesday in over-the-counter trading.
   Confirmation of a rumor earlier Wednesday that Murdoch was the
bidder did not come until after the market closed.
   News Corp.'s American Depositary Shares are traded on the NYSE,
and slipped 12{ cents to $25 a share Wednesday. Each News Corp. ADS
is equivalent to two shares of the Australian company's common
shares.
   Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey confirmed the offer, but refused
to discuss how it would be financed or other issues, saying only,
``We are in discussions with MGM-UA. We will have no further comment
until the discussions are concluded.''
   Ms. Hardy said MGM-UA's board will meet Thursday to consider the
latest offer. MGM-UA shareholders were scheduled to vote on the
Qintex offer at a meeting Sept. 23. MGM-UA has agreed to pay Qintex
$18 million if it accepts another offer.
   MGM-UA's most attractive assets are its film libraries. United
Artists has nearly 1,000 films, including ``Rain Man,''
``Betrayed,'' ``The Living Daylights,'' ``Baby Boom'' and the
``Rocky'' pictures. Foreign home video distribution rights to the
3,000-film MGM library are also up for grabs; cable TV magnate Ted
Turner already owns the other rights to those movies.
   ``The libraries throw off $90 to $100 million (a year) in cash
flow,'' said Andrew Wallach, an analyst who follows MGM-UA for
Drexel Burnham Lambert. ``If you're paying $1.4 billion for it,
that's about 14 times operating cash flow, aside from any other
assets.''
   He said that would make MGM-UA an attractive target for an
aggressive bidder such as Murdoch, who needs programming for his Fox
TV network here and for his British Sky Channel, the four-channel
satellite service into which he already has sunk $120 million in its
first five months.
   The Australian-born Murdoch, now a U.S. citizen, is just one of
many entertainment industry giants actively acquiring programming
for the booming overseas market.
   The programming demand will be fueled by the coming deregulation
of European television and new satellite technologies. Overseas
audiences have demonstrated such an insatiable taste for U.S. films
and TV shows that European regulators are considering limiting how
many American productions can be shown after 1992, when European
trade barriers come down.
   According to proxy material mailed to MGM-UA shareholders
recently, Qintex and Fox were the final two suitors of a host of
companies that expressed interest in MGM-UA after it acknowledged in
April 1988 that it had received sale inquiries.
   Other companies that have been mentioned as being interested in
all or part of MGM-UA include Sony Corp., The Walt Disney Co., MCA
Inc., Polygram NV, The Cannon Group, Weintraub Entertainment Group,
former and present MGM-UA directors Alan Ladd Jr. and David Gerber.
   Qintex Australia owns 43 percent of Qintex Entertainment Inc., a
TV company that financed part of the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove'' and bills itself as Australia's largest TV production and
distribution company.
   The Qintex deal in essence would split MGM-UA, leaving MGM under
the control of Los Angeles billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82
percent of MGM-UA's common stock and all but a tiny fraction of the
preferred stock. By the time Kerkorian bought back the MGM
businesses, Qintex would have paid about $600 million for United
Artists, plus assumed $400 million in debt.

<HEAD>No White House Reprimand for Mosbacher, Aide Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   An aide to U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
denied Wednesday that the White House had reprimanded Mosbacher for
his plan to promote a U.S. high-definition television industry.
   Earlier, a congressional source in Washington said the White
House branded Mosbacher a ``renegade promoting industrial policy''
with his plan to loosen tax and antitrust laws to boost the
competitiveness of U.S. industry in the development of
high-definition television, or HDTV. The source spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Wayne L. Berman, counsellor to Mosbacher, attributed the report
to ``anonymous midgets in the seat of the mighty in the White House
commenting on matters to which they were clearly not a party.''
   Berman, accompanying Mosbacher on a 15-day visit to Asia and
Eastern Europe, said the report of the reprimand was based on
``wholly incorrect information.''
   He said that in many months of meetings with various government
agencies, the Commerce Department's plan to deal with HDTV has been
broadened.
   ``It took us some time to evolve our thinking, but we decided we
don't want to single out HDTV for special treatment,'' Berman said.
``It will be part of a larger policy to make our high technology
competitive.''
   Also Wednesday, Mosbacher told Japanese and foreign reporters at
a luncheon that the flow of HDTV technology from Japan, the pioneer
in the field, to the United States would be welcome.
   ``We don't believe it's the government's position to take the
lead in this kind of development, but this could be a good example
of building a basis for some technology from Japan to the United
States,'' Mosbacher said.
   Japan's public broadcasting organization, NHK, said Wednesday it
will sell some of its HDTV technology to Texas Instruments Inc. so
the U.S. company can design chips for advanced televisions.
   The congressional source had said the White House reined in
Mosbacher for talking in terms reminiscent of the ``industrial
policy'' program that Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis advocated in the 1988 campaign.
   The Wall Street Journal last month quoted sources who said
Mosbacher's HDTV initiative was soundly criticized by other
government agencies and was near death.
   Advocates of HDTV, which promises motion-picture clarity and
compact disc-quality sound, say it could revitalize a lifeless U.S.
consumer electronics industry and have important applications in
medicine, defense and other industries.

<HEAD>American Continental, De Laurentiis Suspended by Pacific Exchange</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Laurentiis'' is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Continental Corp. and De Laurentiis
Entertainment Group will be suspended from trading on the Pacific
Stock Exchange subject to a Sept. 28 vote by the exchange's
directors, an exchange spokesman said Wednesday.
   The exchange's equities listing committee voted Tuesday to
suspend the companies because they failed to file financial forms
within the required 45 days of the previous quarter, said spokesman
Roy Berces.
   ``The suspension will be enforced as long as they do not meet our
listing requirements,'' he said.
   In April, Phoenix-based American Continental, a real estate and
savings and loan holding company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. Federal regulators then seized its largest subsidiary,
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, based in Irvine, Calif.
   The collapse of Lincoln could result in the government's most
costly bailout, requiring more than $2.5 billion in federal funds,
analysts and regulators said.
   Jim Feder, an attorney representing American Continental, said
Wednesday that the company to the best of his knowledge was not
behind in its filings. He referred further questions to another
lawyer for the company, who did not immediately return phone calls
Wednesday evening.
   De Laurentiis Entertainment, based in Beverley Hills, has been
operating under Chapter 11 since August 1988. Its stock was taken
off the American stock exchange last month, De Laurentiis general
counsel Robert Goldsmith said.
   Goldsmith acknowledged that the company no longer met the
exchanges' requirements for net worth and conducting an ongoing
business. Shareholders of DEG stock are unlikely to receive anything
for their shares, he said.
   Carolco Pictures Inc. and Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti
have been conducting a bidding war for what remains of the company,
which was founded by Dino De Laurentiis, the Italian movie producer.
   The forms the companies failed to file were 10-Q forms, similar
to quarterly reports, and 10-K forms, similar to year-end reports,
Berces said.

<HEAD>American Cyanamid Sues Generic Drug Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Cyanamid Co. filed suit Wednesday
against Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., claiming Vitarine misled the
federal government to obtain permits to produce generic drugs that
compete with American Cyanamid products.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Newark, accuses
Vitarine of submitting false statements to the federal Food and Drug
Administration to win approval to manufacture several generic
versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals.
   The lawsuit contains charges similar to those recently leveled
against Vitarine and 10 other generic drug makers by FDA, which is
investigating fraud in the generic drug industry.
   The Vitarine drugs include a version of Maxzide, known
generically as triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide, a hypertension drug
exclusively distributed by Lederle Laboratories, a division of
American Cyanamid.
   The complaint accuses Vitarine, based in Springfield Gardens,
N.Y., of injurious interference with prospective economic advantage,
unfair competition and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations act, American Cyanamid said in a statement
from its headquarters here.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injuction against
Vitarine's using illegal means to obtain permits to manufacture
drugs produced or distributed by American Cyanamid.
   The FDA told Vitarine two weeks ago that it planned to revoke the
company's permits to manufacture 25 generic drugs because of untrue
statements in Vitarine applications, American Cyanamid said.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Down, Share Prices Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Thursday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
inched up.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 30.59
points, or 0.09 percent, ending morning trading at 34,317.53. The
index had shed 45.94 points the previous day.
   The dollar ended morning trading at 145.75 yen. It started
trading at 146.05 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's 146.70-yen
close, and moved in a range of 145.50 to 146.43 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's lower opening to its
overnight downswing, mainly against major European currencies, on
overseas markets.
   ``The dollar started falling against the yen as foreign investors
sold it against the West German mark,'' said a Bank of Tokyo trader,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The currency fell further as the Bank of Japan conducted a
dollar-selling intervention to halt the dollar's excessive rise when
some investors attempted to buy it back, he said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold some $300 million. The central
bank does not comment on its monetary actions.
   Other traders said many market players were sitting on the
sidelines as the market awaited a spate of major U.S. economic
figures this week.
   Among major data to be released by the U.S. government were the
nation's August retail sales, due out later Thursday in Washington,
and the July merchandise trade figures, due Friday.
   On the stock exchange, the market's key index rose as market
players were reassured by the yen's recovery against the dollar,
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a Daiwa Securities dealer.
   ``The yen's rebound pushed down the short-term interest rate
here, which also reassured participants and encouraged them to buy
stocks,'' he said.
   But trading was light ahead of a three-day weekend starting
Friday, Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday, Suzuki said.
