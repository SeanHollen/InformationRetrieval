   A minister, his wife and two of his
daughters were found shot to death inside their rural home Sunday
morning after he failed to show up for services, police said.
   The bodies were discovered around 8 a.m. inside the parsonage
next door to the Olive Branch United Brethren Church by a church
trustee who came looking for the Rev. Robert Pelley, said St.
Joseph's County Sgt. Charles Feirrell.
   Pelley, his wife, Dawn, and daughters Jonel, 8, and Joelene, 6,
had been shot at close range, Feirrell said. He did not have the
ages of the minister and his wife.
   There were no signs of forced entry, and investigators had a
suspect and a motive in the case, but no arrest had been made by
late Sunday, Feirrell said. The suspect resided locally, he said.
   The Pelleys have two older daughters and a teen-age son, but
they were out of town over the weekend, he said.
   Pelley was pastor for the past 2{ years at the church in this
rural residential area on the outskirts of Lakeville, nearly seven
miles south of South Bend.

   In true urban cowboy fashion, police
officers in the West are taking to the streets on mountain bikes to
combat crime.
   ``We've found (bikes) to be quite the urban crime fighter,''
said Officer Paul Grady.
   Grady and his partner, Pete Rossen, pioneered the use of bikes
two years ago. As of June 1, Grady said 20 Seattle officers will be
on two-wheelers rather than behind the wheel of a patrol car.
   ``You see (criminals) at the end of an alley, and they disappear
before you can always get to them. We thought of using bikes when
it seemed there just had to be a way to get at them faster,'' Grady
said. ``And on a bike, criminals don't know when or where you might
appear on your beat.''
   Others apparently agree. Police departments in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Palo Alto, Calif., Fort Worth, Texas, Olympia, Wash., and
Victoria, British Columbia have started their own bike detachments.
   Seattle's bikers wear a modified police uniform, including
uniform pants made into bike shorts with a padded seat, a helmet,
bike gloves, a nylon gunbelt and protective glasses, Grady said.
   The idea is a money-saver. The start-up cost is about $1,000 per
officer, and equipping Seattle's 20-man unit cost less than two
squad cars, he said.
   Only one serious injury has occurred so far. One officer broke a
leg during a fight with a felon when he was knocked over his parked
bike, Grady said.
   Lt. Paul Wooten of the Tacoma police said his department plans
to put two officers on bikes in the downtown area later this month.
   ``The officers will be able to ride up and down stairs, over sky
bridges and through parking garages. Boy, when you see an officer
coming at you on a bike you won't forget it,'' said Wooten.

   As far as members of the Grand National
Waterfowl Hunt Club are concerned, life really does imitate art.
   The club has planned to erect an $80,000 bronze sculpture
``Geese in Flight'' atop a 15-foot obelisk on the banks of the
Choptank River.
   But a pair of migrating osprey got there first. The birds
returned to their summer breeding habitat last month and found the
perch to be an ideal nesting site. For the past several days, the
pair has been carefully arranging branches, twigs and weeds on top
of the pedestal as if planning on a long stay.
   ``If they decide to nest up there, I don't know what will
happen,'' said John W. Tieder Jr., one of the organizers of the
project.
   Sculptor George Northnup had been expected to journey from his
Wyoming home in next few weeks to erect the sculpture, Tieder said.
   The club's problem is how to evict the unwanted guests, and its
plight isn't unique.
   Glenn Therres of the Maryland Forest, Park and Wildlife Service
said the agency has received numerous calls recently asking for
advice on ospreys nesting on piers, light poles and other
inconvenient places.
   ``If nest building has just gotten started, we do authorize
removal of nests,'' Therres said. Approval must come from the state
or the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, though, and nests cannot
be removed after eggs have been laid, he said.

   A businessman has come up with a
novel way to celebrate this week's 14th-annual clean air week.
   He's declared today as The Great American Smut Out, part of his
one-man crusade against public profanity.
   ``We have the option of turning off the TV or turning off the
radio or not to see a movie or to close a book that contains foul
language,'' says Bradford Honigsberg. ``We do not have the option
of turning off the people next to us in the restaurant.''
   Honigsberg's previous efforts to improve the quality of life in
the United States included the offering of a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the conviction of medical waste dumpers,
whose trash polluted New Jersey coasts last summer, and an offer of
$10,000 to any U.S. congressman who sponsored legislation making it
illegal to use foul language in a public building.
   The Smut Out seeks to take advantage of a New Jersey law that
outlaws obscene ``public communication.''
   ``I'm the first to enjoy a nice juicy curse word in a card game
... or when I hit my thumb with a hammer,'' Honigsberg said, but
obscenities are inappropriate in public.

<HEAD>Met Presents One-Week Ring Cycle for First Time in 50 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dwarfs, dragons and demigods who populate
Richard Wagner's ring cycle returned to the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera last week true to the composer's wishes for the
first time in 50 years.
   A standing-room-only crowd of nearly 4,000 people paid up to
$620 to see the epic performed the way Wagner wanted it _ all four
operas, totaling 17 hours of music, unfolding in a single week.
   Not since the season of 1938-39 had the Met done the Ring right,
although the individual operas have been performed many times over
the years.
   The Met's new production, already reviled as reactionary by some
critics as they watched it assembled over the last 2{ years, shuns
the current vogue of squeezing Wagner's untidy mythmaking into a
political, economic or psychological mold.
   Instead, the staging by Otto Schenk and sets and costumes by
Guenther Schneider-Siemssen are deliberately old-fashioned, a
throwback to productions that let the drama and music speak for
themselves.
   Scenes and characters are just what they appear to be in this
version of Wagner's tangled tale about the theft of a golden ring
and the disasters that befall all who pursue it.
   The Rhinemaidens are really mermaids, not prostitutes as in one
production, and their river is not a hydroelectric dam; Wotan is
really the king of the gods, not a 19th century capitalist;
Siegfried is really a noble young warrior, not a garage mechanic.
   With no striking interpretation to hold the audience's interest,
the production might fall flat if the singing and orchestral
playing were not on such a high level.
   The orchestra sounded splendid all week and conductor James
Levine kept things moving with a keen sense of dramatic tension.
Aside from a wobbly horn here or there and a rare sour note, the
sound was as close to perfection as any orchestra could produce.
   Hildegard Behrens once again proved herself the finest Wagnerian
performer of her generation. Though she lacks the vocal power of a
Flagstad or a Nilsson, she makes up for that with dramatic
intensity. And she looks the part of a beautiful young Valkyrie _
this was no case of the opera being over when the fat lady sings.
   Bass James Morris was a superior Wotan, his brilliant high notes
cutting through the heavy orchestration with ease. Another
outstanding bass, Matti Salminen, carried off the rare feat of
appearing in all four operas, as Fafner (a giant in ``Das
Rheingold'' but transformed into a dragon in ``Siegfried''); as
Hunding in ``Die Walkuere,'' and as Hagen in ``Goetterdaemmerung.''
   Other singers who made memorable contributions to the week
included Franz Mazura and Graham Clark as the brother dwarfs
Alberich and Mime; Helga Dernesch as Wotan's nagging wife Fricka
(but not as Waltraute in ``Goetterdaemmrung'' where the high notes
were too much for her); Siegfried Jerusalem as the crafty god Loge,
Brigitta Svenden as the prophetess Erda and Mari-Anne Haeggender,
unusually sweet-sounding as the goddess Freia.
   As the romantic lovers Siegmund and Sieglinde, Robert Schunk and
Ellen Shade looked convincing and sang acceptably but were no vocal
match for the team that appeared in earlier performances, Gary
Lakes and Jessye Norman.
   A bigger problem was the Siegfried of Toni Kraemer. He acted
fairly well, but had to press his voice in the upper register and
tired under the heavy demands of his role. The world is still
waiting for a true heldentenor who can do justice to this killer
role.
   The Met is offering one more ``Ring Cycle'' this week, with
Gwyneth Jones as Bruennhilde, William Johns as Siegfried and Hans
Sotin as Wotan. It will be back three more times next spring, and
will be televised on four consecutive nights in June 1990 by the
Public Broadcasting Service.

   The city's Communist Party chief promised student
representatives Sunday that some of those who have demonstrated for
democratic reform will not be punished, Chinese official media
reported.
   It was the second day of meetings between students and officials
in response to student demands for talks with the government on
freedom of the press, human rights and official corruption.
   The students have pressed their demands during the past two
weeks by holding the largest protest marches in 40 years of
Communist rule. They also have boycotted classes for a week, and
activists from the nearby city of Tianjin said students at two
schools there have joined the boycott.
   The official Xinhua news agency reported Sunday's meeting but
did not say if students were protesters or members of official
student associations that most students now reject.
   The students have set up their own student unions and insist
that the government talk with them. The government has said the new
groups are illegal.
   A meeting between student representatives and government
officials also took place Saturday, but students said it
accomplished nothing.
   Xinhua said Sunday's meeting was between 29 students from 16
Beijing colleges and municipal leaders, including Mayor Chen Xitong
and party secretary Li Ximing.
   It said a student asked ``whether students who are party members
and who have taken part in the demonstrations and boycott of class
will be punished.'' Li said they would not be, Xinhua reported.
   Li and Chen, acting on student demands, both revealed their
monthly incomes were about $80, or about 50 percent more than the
average factory worker. Chen also denied he won his post through
nepotism.
   Special privileges for officials and corruption have been key
targets of the students since they began their protests April 15.
   So far, most of the protest activity has been limited to the
capital, although smaller marches have been reported in other
cities. Tianjin is the only other city where a large-scale class
boycott has been reported.
   A Tianjin University activist said the boycott began April 24,
the same day as in Beijing, and that 90 percent of Nankai students
and 70 percent of Tianjin University students were taking part.
   He said about 10,000 students marched peacefully Friday in the
port city 68 miles east of Beijing to show support for Beijing
students who marched the previous day.
   About 150,000 students and ordinary citizens joined in the
Beijing march.
   The mayor of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, is among officials who have
been criticized by students in Beijing for allegedly having gotten
his job through nepotism. Li is the son-in-law of Wan Li, the
chairman of the National People's Congress.
   A Nankai University student said school officials were warning
upperclassmen they will not be assigned good jobs if they boycott
class.
   Beijing students, meanwhile, continued to denounce Saturday's
meeting with central government officials as inadequate. The
officials took a conciliatory tone but urged them to return to
class.
   ``It was regrettable,'' said Wang Dan, one of the leaders of
Beijing University's new student association. ``It wasn't a
dialogue _ it was more like a news conference with the students
playing reporters and asking questions.''
   ``The government is still cheating us,'' read a student poster
at the school. ``Continue boycotting to protest the government's
insincere dialogue,'' said another.
   Wang and other leaders said the boycott would continue at least
through Thursday, the 70th anniversary of China's first student
pro-democracy movement. The students have said they will hold
another march then.
   However, some student leaders expressed fears they would be
arrested before Thursday in a government effort to head off further
embarrassing marches.

   A radical leftist group has claimed responsibility
for a bombing that destroyed three cars and three motorcycles on
the eve of the late Emperor Hirohito's birthday, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Kyodo said the Chukakuha (Middle Core Faction) sent it a letter
declaring that the bombing in a parking lot of a dormitory for
Imperial Household Agency employees was to protest the turning of
the birthday, April 29, into a ``memorial day'' for Hirohito.
   No one was injured by the bomb, which had been placed in one of
the cars.
   Three other bomb or firebomb attacks occurred in Tokyo and
nearby cities at about the same time Friday, also with no injuries
reported.
   After the emperor's death on Jan. 7, at age 87, the government
kept his birthday as an official holiday but renamed it ``Greenery
Day.''
   Radical leftist groups in Japan oppose the country's monarchy.
   Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito, attended a ceremony on Saturday
to celebrate the new Greenery Day.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak
Mordechai, a bull-necked, outspoken veteran of three wars, says
Israel's army will outlast Arabs in the daily street battles that
have become a fixture of the Palestinian uprising.
   ``We will never become tired. We will act as if the intefadeh is
going to last for 100 years,'' said Mordechai, the head of Israel's
southern command. ``It means the Israeli army will carry out its
mission with tenacity and sensitivity as long as it is ordered to
do so by the government.''
   At least 112 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip
since the uprising _ or intefadeh _ began nearly 17 months ago
against Israeli rule of the territory and the West Bank.
   Mordechai, 44, believes the only lasting solution to the Gaza
Strip's chronic unrest is an international campaign to relocate the
nearly 250,000 Palestinians who live in the crowded refugee camps
that spawned the uprising.
   Until then, Mordechai is prepared to direct the battle against
the squads of Arab youths who throw stones at his cream Land-Rover
as it leads a convoy of jeeps through Gaza City.
   At a strategy session last week, he placed his black-handled
.45-caliber automatic on the desk in front of him as he questioned
two dozen field officers packed into a situation room.
   Should he close a school where students had rioted? What about
the mosques?
   Avi, a studious-looking major with wire-rimmed glasses, argued
that classrooms should be kept open to encourage as normal a life
as possible.
   Asaf, a white-haired veteran, proposed closing the school for a
month as punishment. But he argued against shutting mosques, saying
it could inflame Moslem fundamentalists. Israel doesn't want a holy
war, he said.
   Mordechai, who allowed a reporter to attend the review on
condition he not quote soldiers verbatim, ended the debate with a
lecture on the need to be sensitive during the holy month of
Ramadan, when Moslems fast from dawn to dusk.
   The general recalled a recent three-hour meeting with Moslem
elders in which Israeli officers, on his orders, refrained from
eating, drinking or smoking in deference to the fast. He said the
elders praised the Israelis for showing respect.
   ``We should use the same respect with the mosques,'' said
Mordechai, who later demonstrated his fluency in Arabic by stopping
to chat with Palestinian vegetable vendors and children on Omar
Mukhtar Street.
   The army has temporarily cut off access to six of the 60 mosques
in the Gaza Strip and indefinitely shut 15 of the 260 schools.
Officers say the schools and mosques have become rallying points
for the uprising.
   More than 450 Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
have been killed in the revolt.
   By mid-April, according to army count, soldiers had shot and
killed 112 Arabs and wounded 1,500 in the Gaza Strip.
   By U.N. count, 131 Palestinians had been killed in the Gaza
Strip and 18,000 hurt, 2,659 by gunfire. U.N. officials said about
one-third of the injured were children under 15.
   The high number of casualties in an uprising in which soldiers
often face rock-throwing youths has caused many Israelis to
question army tactics.
   Some reservists contend that service in the occupied lands is
not what they have been trained for. They have argued that daily
confrontations with Palestinian civilians have damaged troop morale.
   Mordechai, in an interview over lunch at the Gaza City jail,
bristled when asked why so many children were hurt. He and other
officers said activists invite serious injury by putting women and
children in the midst of violent demonstrations.
   ``We don't shoot children (intentionally) even with plastic
bullets,'' he said, adding that children only got hurt when they
stood behind adults and soldiers couldn't see them.
   Mordechai also said Palestinian hospital officials padded
casualty figures by taking names from telephone books. On one
recent day, the army could only confirm eight to 10 wounded while
Arab reports said more than 50 were shot, he said.
   ``This is part of the battle to win public opinion to their
side,'' he said.
   Mordechai, a paratroop officer who studied infantry tactics in
England, is a veteran field officer _ what Israelis call a ``battle
fox.'' He commanded troops at the ``Chinese farm'' in Egypt, one of
the bloodiest encounters of the 1973 war; 51 of his soldiers were
killed and 100 were wounded.
   He defended the Jordan Valley against Palestinian cross-border
raids in the 1960s and in 1982 led Israeli troops in taking West
Beirut, the former PLO enclave.
   Mordechai stands in sharp contrast to his more liberal
counterpart in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who
threatened to resign over Israel's conduct of the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon and who told reporters he had trouble sleeping at night
because of the actions soldiers were sometimes forced to take in
the West Bank.
   Mordechai said the key was finding the right amount of force to
use in a given situation. In the uprising, he said, the army cannot
use the large amount of firepower at its disposal without long-term
repercussions.
   ``We don't use 5 percent of our might,'' he said. ``We want to
live in this part of the world, with our neighbors'' when the
uprising has ended.

   Ralph E. Adams, a World War II submariner who
helped rescue a downed flyer destined to become president of the
United States, has died at age 76.
   Adams died at his home of cancer on April 21.
   He was part of a rescue party sent from the USS Finback on Sept.
4, 1944, to pick up then Lt. j.g. George Bush and four other downed
Navy airmen in a rubber raft bobbing about 70 miles off Osaka,
Japan.
   ``I was one of the four men in our `man overboard party' that
went for them,'' Adams said in a November 1988 interview. ``I was
in the party because I was the best swimmer.''
   Bush, who had been piloting a single-engine bomber that was shot
down by the Japanese, and one of his crewmen were in the raft along
with three other flyers from another downed plane.
   ``I think that Bush and the others were suprised that they were
going to have to stay with us so long,'' Adams said. ``I think they
thought we'd take them right back to their (aircraft) carrier or
right to some American base. But our orders were to stay at sea, on
lifeguard duty, for another 30 days.''
   Bush and the other survivors stayed aboard the Finback until the
submarine reached Midway Island around Oct. 15, 1944, Adams said.
   Adams, a native of Crete, Ill., served in the Navy from 1929
until 1933. He rejoined in 1940 and retired as a chief petty
officer in 1970.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday.

   Three or four B-2 Stealth bombers could
have handled the 1986 Libyan bombing raid better than the nearly
100 planes that carried out the raid, a high-ranking Air Force
official said Saturday.
   ``We're talking about an airplane that just gives us much more
flexibility than anything right now in the strategic deterrent
family,'' said Gen. Bernard S. Randolph, commander of the Air Force
Systems Command.
   If the B-2 had been in the Air Force arsenal three years ago,
three or four flying from the United States and refueling en route
could have bombed Libya with complete surprise, more efficiency and
accuracy than the European-based planes that did the job, he said.
   Randolph addressed the annual news conference of the
Aviation-Space Writers Association.
   The bomber can carry up to 80 500-pound conventional bombs or 20
nuclear weapons, can fly from low levels to altitudes of about
50,000 feet and personifies a technological leap into the next
century, he said.
   The subsonic two-man aircraft will weigh more than 350,000
pounds with weapons and fuel and have a range of more than 6,000
nautical miles, or more than 10,000 with one refueling, Randolph
said.
   The range is greater than that of a B-52, the mainstay of the
nation's bomber fleet for three decades, he said. The plane will be
able to fly from any airfield that can handle a Boeing 727, he said.
   With two domestic and two overseas bases, the United States will
be able to attack any land mass in the world, Randolph said.
   The B-2 is scheduled to make its first flight this summer.
   Last week, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said the
administration would delay purchasing the plane pending a review of
the program, which has been estimated to cost $70 billion for 132
planes.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan government has begun dispensing gas
masks and other chemical warfare equipment to its army, according
to a report published Sunday quoting a member of the U.S.-backed
resistance forces as saying the move could be a preparation for the
use of chemical weapons.
   Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak, who commands one faction of Afghan
resistance fighters, last week told a fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies that refugees from Jalalabad
had confirmed troops there were getting the equipment, The
Washington Post reported.
   Wardak told CSIS fellow Marin Strmecki the refugees had given
him ``confirmed information'' of the supply operation, The Post
said.
   Strmecki recently spend five weeks in Afghanistan and Pakistan
with the rebels.
   The use of chemical weapons would be ``a significant threat'' to
the resistance on two fronts, said Wardak, who heads guerrilla
forces of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan.
   NIFA forces have struck against government troops in Jalalabad
for nearly two months in an attempt to gain control of the
stronghold of the Kabul government.
   At least two members of Congress, Reps. Chalres Wilson, D-Texas,
and John E. Porter, R-Ill., have received reports about the gas
masks, according to The Post. But Defense and State department
sources told the newspaper they could not confirm the reports.

   Mrs. Yeutter was known to many as the ``Rose Lady'' because of

   Mrs. Yeutter, born on Feb. 21, 1897, was raised on a Nebraska
farm and was married in 1923 to Reinold ``Doc'' Yeutter. They lived
on a farm between Eustis and Cozad until her husband's death in
1965, when she moved to Cozad.

<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Iowa's No. 1 gun turret had a
misfire in one of its 16-inch guns shortly before the battleship's
No. 2 turret exploded on April 19, killing 47 sailors, a survivor
said.
   Petty Officer Kendall L. Truitt said the misfire occurred during
gunnery exercises just before the blast ripped through the No. 2
turret, The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk reported
in its Sunday's editions.
   ``Later, after the explosion and firefighting attempts, they
still had bullets in Turret One's gun,'' Truitt said.
   The newspaper also reported that survivors said 12 sailors in
the turret area survived the explosion. The Navy has said only 11
men lived.
   A Navy official in Norfolk who spoke on condition of anonymity
said he couldn't comment on the report. And in Washington, Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. John Marchi said he had not heard reports of a
12th survivor.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally has said there were no indications of any
problems with the guns before the explosion.
   The ship's weapon's control officer, Cmdr. Robert J. Kissinger,
said earlier this week the guns had passed a rigorous inspection
that morning. They had been fired last in early February, he said.
   The powder also had been inspected before the exercise,
Kissinger said.
   The newspaper quoted Truitt as saying quick action by gunner's
mate John M. Mullahy Jr. prevented the fire from spreading to the
ship's powder magazines.
   Truitt was contacted by the newspaper at his parents' home in
Illinois.
   The only survivors in the gun's area were those working at the
bottom level of the turret, in the nearby powder magazines and in a
narrow hallway that ringed the armored turret.
   Mullahy was on the turret's internal communications system when
the explosion occurred, the newspaper reported. Unable to raise
anyone on the upper decks of the six-deck turret, Mullahy opened
the blast-proof door between the magazine and the hallway, letting
in the three men who were outside, Truitt said.
   Then Mullahy opened the door to the ``powder flats,'' an area on
the turret's bottom level where powder is temporarily stored on its
way up to the guns, the newspaper reported.
   There were no lights, only a thick brown haze and a fire burning
to the right. The covers on several 110-pound bags of powder were
also burning, the newspaper said Mullahy told investigators.
   Mullahy quickly got out of the powder flats and left the
magazine, which Truitt ordered evacuated, locking the door behind
him.
   Once outside the magazine, Truitt said Mullahy threw emergency
switches to flood the area.
   Moosally has said he ordered the magazines flooded seven minutes
after the blast.

<TEXT>
   Jewish leaders are protesting PLO leader Yasser
Arafat's visit to Paris this week and calling for silent vigils to
honor victims of terrorism.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader is to arrive
Tuesday morning for a two-day visit, beginning with talks at the
Elysee Palace with President Francois Mitterrand.
   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions appealed to
the French to turn out in large numbers Monday evening at Jo
Goldenberg's restaurant in Paris.
   Terrorists burst into the popular Jewish restaurant in August
1982, spraying machine-gun bullets that killed six, including two
Americans, and injured 21.
   Vigils also were planned at the Tati department store, where a
bomb hurled from a passing car killed seven people and injured 51
in September 1986; and at the Point Show shopping gallery on the
Champs Elysees, the site of a terrorist bombing in March 1986 that
killed two and injured 28.
   The largest demonstration is expected Tuesday in front of the
Copernic synagogue, where in October 1980 a bomb killed four.
   The attacks on Goldenberg's restaurant and the Copernic
synagogue are believed to have been carried out by the Abu Nidal
organization or another Palestinian splinter group opposed to the
PLO. The Tati and Point Show bombings are thought to have been the
work of pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorists.
   Theo Klein, head of the Reprsentative Council of Jewish
Institutions, said all victims of terrorism would be memorialized
by the demonstrations, including Arab leaders who believed in an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and who were killed because of their
views.
   Klein denounced the Arafat visit.
   ``I'm sorry no one has thought it useful to mention on the
occasion of this visit that terrorism exists, that the Jewish
community has been its target, that the PLO is responsible in part
for the terrorism and that it is up to the Jewish community to say
so,'' Klein said in a statement.
   Klein said French Jews find the visit especially offensive
because it coincides with Yom Ha-Shoah, the day marking the Nazi
extermination of millions of Jews.
   On Thursday, Mitterrand wrote to Klein trying to ease the anger
of the Jewish community.
   ``Beyond the present circumstances, France has not forgotten the
victims of the Shoah, nor those of blind terrorism,'' Mitterrand
wrote, using the Hebrew word for the Holocaust.
   ``This cruel and cowardly past is not erased from our memories
as we conduct French foreign policy. But it is founded on dialogue,
which makes it necessary to hear both sides. To hear is not to
approve.''
   While many Jews say it is inappropriate for Mitterrand to meet
with Arafat, some have expressed hope it will further the cause of
peace in the Middle East.
   Arafat on Wednesday is to meet with Premier Michel Rocard and
tour the Louvre.

   A lifeboat capsized in rough seas Sunday as it
carried crew members from a leaking Peruvian cargo ship, and two
people died and four were missing, the coast guard said.
   The lifeboat was carrying 10 of the 26 Peruvian crew members of
the 6,896-ton Yacuwasi when it overturned in the Pacific Ocean
about 638 miles east of Sendai in northern Japan, according to the
Maritime Safety Agency.
   The lifeboat was attempting to shuttle crew members to the
nearby Japanese freighter Kyokushin-maru, an agency official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Six of the crew members in the lifeboat were picked up by the
Japanese vessel, but one was dead and another died about an hour
later, the agency said.
   Four crew members were lost.
   The official said the 16 other crew members remained aboard the
Yacuwasi, which was taking on water.
   The Yacuwasi, owned by Naviera Anazonica of Peru, was traveling
from Peru to Aomori in northern Japan with a cargo of copper ore
when it began leaking, the official said.
   The official said the Maritime Safety Agency was sending two
Japanese patrol boats that would reach the scene Monday.
   Yutaka Mifune, a Maritime Safety official, said the Peruvian
cargo ship was in rough seas that may have caused damage to the
hull, but he said the cause of the leak was still unknown.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Preparing Effort To Redirect Job Training Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is drafting major
changes to the nation's premier job-training program, aiming to
provide more services to the unskilled poor by retargeting spending
while also cutting the number of people served in favor of more
thorough training.
   The proposed changes to the Job Training Partnership Act also
would take youth-training programs now under JTPA and establish
them as a separate entity that would drop its emphasis on summer
training for a year-round approach both in schools and for
dropouts, according to department officials.
   Also recommended will be new oversight methods to insure
cooperation at the state level between agencies that handle
billions of dollars in training and related money distributed by
the federal government each year, primarily from the departments of
Labor, Education and Health and Human Services.
   The recommendations are included in legislation drafted by Labor
Department officials, a process essentially completed Friday. The
legislation is to be reviewed by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
this week and then forwarded for White House review. She hopes to
unveil the proposals to Congress in mid-May.
   ``Right now a person can't go one place and get all the
services,'' Mrs. Dole said in a recent interview. ``It's piecemeal.
It's fragmented. We've got to bring down this bureaucratic barrier.
... The hardest thing to do is coordinate across government. But
we're determined to do it.''
   The proposed changes address many of the criticisms directed at
JTPA in a number of recent studies and reviews, including one by
the General Accounting Office and another by an advisory committee
appointed to monitor the program, established under legislation
co-authored by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``JTPA is the most successful (training) program that we've ever
had,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``But I think we can make it much better.''
   Mrs. Dole has met with Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and HHS
Secretary Dr. Louis Sullivan to discuss the proposals. They would
involve expanded cooperation between JTPA and such ventures as the
jobs programs included in last year's welfare reform law and the
nation's vocational education system, which is up for congressional
reauthorization this year.
   JTPA, by far the largest of the federal government's training
programs, was allocated $2.4 billion for the current fiscal year
and projected to serve 1.9 million people. The Bush administration
has requested stable funding for next year.
   A Labor Department official said he could not say how many fewer
people would be served by JTPA if the changes are approved but said
the reduction would be ``modest.''
   The two most significant changes would be rewriting the funding
formula and separating the youth programs.
   Two-thirds of JTPA money now is targeted based on unemployment
rates while one-third goes to areas with concentrations of
economically disadvantaged populations.
   The new formula, which still was being fine-tuned Friday, will
``substantially shift'' spending and have at least two thirds of
JTPA funding targeted to the economically disadvantaged, primarily
those identified as lacking basic literacy and jobs skills, the
department official said.
   Because of funding restrictions, JTPA now serves about 8 percent
of those eligible for its services, with state and local officials
administering JTPA-financed programs generally given considerable
leeway in selecting program participants from the pool of those
eligible.
   The proposed changes would refine the selection process to add
individual skills assessments to better screen potential trainees
for those most lacking skills.
   ``Too often, I'm afraid, we're training people who can make it
on their own,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Also changed would be program guidelines that emphasize
per-trainee cost and the rate of job placements. Those have been
criticized for encouraging program directors to select trainees who
already have marketable skills so they can be placed in jobs
rapidly and for encouraging ``quick fix'' approaches that lead to
placement in low-skills jobs that offer few career opportunities.
   ``What we're saying is it's all right to spend more per person
as long as we have longer-term outcomes, training that leads to
meaningful and lasting jobs,'' said the department official.
   Improved targeting has been suggested by several recent reviews
of JTPA, including a GAO report that said more than 40 percent of
JTPA on-the-job training money was being used to prepare workers
for low-skills jobs such as dishwashers and custodians.
   Since taking office Mrs. Dole has spoken frequently of improving
training for youths, a labor pool essential to hopes of heading off
projected labor shortages, particularly in high-skills jobs.
   ``Young people who are prepared are needed,'' she said. ``There
are plenty of jobs if you have the skills.''

<HEAD>As Congress Readies 1990 Deficit Cuts, Urge to Spend Is Still Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House and Senate are set to move closer
next week to enacting a deficit-reduction package for fiscal 1990,
but lawmakers have shown again that it is still spending that
drives many of Congress' decisions.
   The Senate plans to begin debate on Tuesday on a $1.16 trillion
spending plan, and the House is scheduled to consider its $1.17
trillion version the next day. Leaders of both chambers expect the
measures to be approved, and are hoping that a compromise plan can
be completed by mid-May.
   The two packages each claim to whittle this year's expected
federal deficit of $163 billion to just above $99 billion for 1990,
using a recipe of spending cuts, new revenues, sunny economic
assumptions and accounting gimmicks.
   The outlines of the savings were drawn in a pact reached last
month between President Bush and congressional leaders of both
parties, an alliance that makes ultimate approval of the budget
likely.
   In other congressional activity, a group of Texas investors in a
gas well venture have been subpoenaed to appear Wednesday and
Thursday before the House ethics committee, which is continuing its
probe of the personal finances of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The witnesses refused to speak to members of the panel last week
when they tried to interview them in San Antonio, Texas.
   The House may vote on whether to impeach a U.S. district judge
from Mississippi, Walter L. Nixon, who is serving five years in
prison for a perjury conviction. Nixon is hoping to return to the
bench when his prison term is up.
   Congress' budget votes next week will be greeted by lawmakers
who will praise the deficit-reduction plans as healthy first steps
toward steeper budget cutting in the future. But there is a
contrast between those sentiments and some that were expressed in
the House last week during Congress' first major budget vote of the
year.
   Last Wednesday, the House rejected a plan by its Democratic
leaders that would have paid for a $4.7 billion spending bill for
this year by slashing defense, domestic and foreign aid programs.
   Some lawmakers voted against the measure because they said they
wanted it cut down in size. Others, however, took to the floor to
make it clear that they opposed the spending reductions it
contained, cuts that happened to affect programs they are connected
to.
   Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., who chairs the Appropriations
health and education subcommittee, warned, ``If you take care of
the health of your people and educate your children, you can
continue living in the strongest country in the world.''
   Moments later, Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., told her colleagues
that the cuts would have a ``devastating impact'' on ``our men and
women in uniform.'' Byron chairs the Armed Services military
personnel subcommittee.
   House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., went even further,
saying the legislation ``basically says we can get to a balanced
budget if only we abolish the Defense Department.''
   In the end, the vote against the proposal was 252-172, with 92
Democrats voting against their own leadership.
   ``That vote was not an expression of deficit reduction
mentality,'' said Rep. Bill Schuette, R-Mich., a Budget Committee
member who voted for the plan. ``It was a coalition of people who
didn't want further cuts in defense, and people who didn't want
other programs cut.''
   How is that sentiment likely to effect this week's budget votes?
   The conventional wisdom among many lawmakers is that if
anything, it will help the leaders obtain passage of the budget
resolutions. Many domestic programs are slated for spending
increases, and the defense cuts have the endorsement of the Bush
administration.
   That's not to say there won't be some rebellions. Rep. G.V.
Sonny Montgomery, D-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, said Friday he would lead a fight to seek $300 million
more for veterans hospitals.
   ``If they don't give us the money, they shouldn't come around
when the secretary says he has to close some units,'' said
Montgomery, who said he had not decided what he would do if he
could not obtain the extra funds.

<HEAD>Civil War-Era Law Produces Flood Of New Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Civil War-era law allowing citizens to bring
fraud suits against government contractors has produced a flood of
new cases despite doubts about its cost-effectiveness and its
constitutionality.
   The False Claims Act was first passed by Congress in 1863 after
Union commanders found they had been cheated by munitions makers
who sold them bullets filled with sawdust.
   For 123 years, citizens made little use of the so-called ``qui
tam'' provisions _ legal shorthand for a longer Latin phrase
meaning ``Who, as well as for the king as for himself, sues in this
matter.''
   But in 1986, Congress passed amendments giving citizens a
financial incentive to come forward with allegations of wrongdoing.
Citizens can share between 15 percent and 30 percent of the
judgment if the government wins the case.
   ``This law gave me the incentive to do what I should have done
anyway,'' said Christopher Urda, a former bids administrator for a
defense contractor who has brought one of the biggest suits to date.
   The government recently decided to intervene and become the lead
plaintiff in Urda's $231 million suit charging that Singer Co.'s
Link Flight Simulation unit had fraudulently overcharged the
government for flight simulator equipment for eight years.
   In the last three years, more than 140 cases have been filed in
federal courts, mostly against defense contractors.
   After a case is filed under court seal, the government has 60
days to decide whether to intervene and take over the litigation
   So far, the Justice Department has entered 20 cases and declined
to join 60 others. The rest remain under court seal pending Justice
Department review.
   Department officials question whether the financial recoveries
from the suits will be worth the time government lawyers must spend
evaluating the complaints.
   Some lawyers in and out of the department have questioned the
constitionality of allowing private citizens to bring civil cases
on behalf of the government.
   The Justice Department is now deciding whether to take a
position on constitutional challenges to the law being mounted by
defense contractors who were sued. Because the law was to little
used until 1986, its constitutionality was never challenged
previously in the courts.
   The department declined to take a position on a case involving
McDonnell Douglas Corp. now pending in federal court in Los Angeles.
   But Washington attorney Richard Sauber, a former government
prosecutor, says the government is studying whether to support
constitutional challenges he is mounting for Northrop Corp.
   The law is unconstitutional, Sauber argues, because ``it gives
to private parties a law enforcement function and the right to sue
on behalf of the United States.''
   Continued use of the law by private plaintiffs means the
government ``is going to be saddled with the lawyering and the
legal strategy'' begun by private citizens, he said.
   If a private plaintiff loses a suit, the government could be
foreclosed from bringing a new case if it found better evidence of
fraud, he said.
   ``What if they investigate it and decide not to come in?''
Sauber said. ``The private people get a hold of it and muck it up.
But six months later they have new evidence?''
   The 1986 amendments were enacted by Congress in the wake concern
about waste in defense procurement, including revelations that the
Pentagon had paid $600 for a toilet seat and $7,400 for a coffee
pot.
   ``With major dollars going to the defense budget, people wanted
it to be properly spent,'' said Stuart E. Schiffer, a deputy
assistant attorney general who oversees the law's enforcement.
   The amendment passed despite misgivings in the Justice
Department about whether the long-dormant law should be revived.
   The department ``had a policy concern about whether or not it
was really needed and surely it had constitutional dimensions _
that the attorney general should be in charge of bringing a suit to
vindicate the public interest,'' Schiffer said.
   The 60-day review requirement has imposed ``very severe'' time
constraints on the commercial fraud section of the Justice
Department, Schiffer said.
   ``It obviously means we're not able to take the cases in the
order we would take cases,'' Schiffer said.
   Michael Hertz, who heads the commercial fraud section, said a
study he conducted showed his staff of 40 attorneys has spent about
25 percent of its time reviewing False Claims suits.
   In the period of time Hertz reviewed, False Claims Act suits
generated between $5 and $10 million for the government compared
with $175 million produced by cases developed by federal
investigators.
   ``You get some idea of the amount of resources going to qui tam
cases versus the payoff,'' Hertz said.
   Recently, the government has intervened in some large cases that
have the potential of big settlements.
   Other big cases will probably increase the returns to the
Treasury from the ``qui tam'' provision, but ``whether it is going
to come up to the level of justifying spending all the time on it I
have no idea,'' Hertz said.

   A ship carrying timber sank in
rough seas, but all 20 crewmen were rescued when a South African
helicopter and an Israeli vessel teamed up to find the seamen's
lifeboat, an official said Sunday.
   The bulk carrier Sevasti sank Saturday about 115 miles west of
Luderitz, Namibia, and its Greek crew entered a life raft and
radioed for help, said Maj. Flories Brand, a spokesman at the South
African Sea and Rescue Center.
   An Air Force Dakota helicopter was sent to search for the raft
and radioed ships in the area to watch for the men. Contact with
the lifeboat was later lost, probably because the radio's batteries
ran low, Brand said.
   On Saturday night, the Israeli vessel Azgad 4 found the life
raft and picked up all 20 crew members, said Brand. He quoted the
survivors as saying the ship listed when its cargo shifted, then
sank about two hours later.

   Yi Bang-ja, a member of Japan's royal
family who married the late Korean prince Yi Un, died Sunday. She
was 88.
   Family members said Mrs. Yi, who was being treated for
phlebitis, died shortly after being moved from Seoul National
Hospital to Changduk Palace.
   She will be buried at a royal graveyard outside Seoul on May 8,
they said.
   Mrs. Yi, a Japanese royal family member, married Prince Yi Un, a
son of King Kojong, in Tokyo in 1920, 10 years after Japan annexed
the Korean peninsula as its colony. The prince died in 1970.
   Mrs. Yi, whose Japanese name is Masako, became a naturalized
Korean citizen in 1945 after World War II. She devoted herself to
charitable activities, such as setting up a nursing home for the
handicapped.
   She was a cousin of Japanese Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of
Emperor Hirohito, who died in January. She also was the eldest
daughter of Morimasa and Itsuko Nashimoto, then imperial family
members.

   Ten drug traffickers were hanged Sunday
in the Iranian capital, Tehran, and in three other cities,
state-run Tehran radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the men had smuggled and
distributed more than 1,058 pounds of narcotics. Some also were
convicted of theft and embezzlement, the report said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
reported that two men were hanged in Tehran, one in the nearby city
of Varamin, four in Rasht in northern Gilan Province, and three in
Arak in central Markazi Province.
   The hangings brought to 516 the total number of executions since
tough new drug laws that took effect Jan. 21. The law mandates the
death sentence for possession of even small quantities of drugs.
   Many arrests have been in provinces along the border with
Pakistan and Afghanistan, from where authorities say most drugs are
smuggled into Iran.

<HEAD>Small Swiss State Narrowly Agrees to Let Women Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNDWIL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some shouted approval and some
jeered on Sunday as the men of Appenzell Outer-Rhodes state
gathered in this little village and decided, by show of hands, to
give women the right to vote.
   ``I can look my wife in the eye again,'' said one man,
reflecting the relief of many of the 5,000 men who voted.
   Neighboring Appenzell Inner-Rhodes now is the only one of
Switzerland's 26 sovereign states, or cantons, that still denies
women the vote on local issues ranging from budget questions to
alcohol laws.
   The issue was by no means clear-cut in Appenzell Outer-Rhodes, a
canton of 50,000 people.
   Four times in the past 17 years the state parliament _ an
open-air assembly comprised of all the state's eligible voters _
has rejected women's suffrage.
   Emotions ran high Sunday as the men, bearing swords as a sign of
their voting eligibility, began gathering in Hundwil for the latest
vote.
   A seemingly equal number of hands were raised by those on both
sides of the issue. The pronouncement by local official Hans Uli
Hoehl that a majority had voted ``yes'' was greeted by shouts of
surprise and some jeers.
   ``A tradition has been destroyed,'' commented one man.
   State authorities had urged acceptance of the proposal to let
women participate in the Landsgemeinde, or parliament, because of
fears the Swiss government would act unilaterally and impose
federal legislation ensuring equal voting rights.
   Women won the national vote in a 1971 referendum. Ten years
later, another nationwide poll changed the constitution to make
``all Swiss equal before the law.''
   The debate on women's rights has raged for many years in
Appenzell. Many men argued that allowing women to participate in
the local popular parliament, the original form of Switzerland's
direct democracy, would damage the unique atmosphere of the
Landsgemeinde.
   A substantial number of women seemed to share that view. A
1986-87 survey, in which half the adult population of Appenzell
Outer-Rhodes took part, found only 57 percent of women favored
having the right to vote.
   At Sunday's meeting, the parliament also agreed to vote before
1993 on whether to abolish itself, replacing the once-a-year
Landsgemeinde with another system.
   Only five cantons in northeastern Switzerland still retain the
Landsgemeinde.

   A 1931 photograph on a wall at the
headquarters at the Air Force's Chanute Technical Training Center
shows a soldier dangling from a biplane, his parachute caught on
its tail.
   Residents of this central Illinois town _ where nearly half the
people and two-thirds of the economy are associated with the base _
feel they, too, are dangling because the base is one of 86 Congress
voted to close.
   Mayor Katy Podagrosi said it could take two years to exhaust
efforts in the courts and in Congress to remove Chanute from the
list.
   ``That's not long when the stakes are as high as they are,''
said Podagrosi.
   ``The big problem is the uncertainty,'' said Al Vogelsang, owner
of Gery &amp; Al's Sporting Goods. ``Will it actually close, how long
will it take for them to leave and how soon can we get something in
there to take Chanute's place?''
   The House voted 381-43 on April 18 to reject a resolution to
disapprove the recommendations of the Base Closure and Realignment
Commission.
   That meant the recommendations now goes into effect, giving
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney the go-ahead to implement the
recommendations beginning in January. The law creating the
commission required that the entire package take effect unless both
houses of Congress voted to disapprove it.
   The Pentagon contends the closings will save taxpayers $693
million a year.
   But residents hope a judge will agree that the commission's
report included misleading information about Chanute.
   Illinois congressmen have argued that transcripts of commission
deliberations have shown that discussions about Chanute involved
figures and reports that were more than a decade old.
   Commission members acknowledged they invented property values at
Chanute, creating unrealistic estimates of savings. They also
referred to Chanute as ``an empty air base,'' despite 51 training
programs that graduate 24,000 students a year. Several members
disclosed they didn't know where the base was.
   Chanute, now one of five Air Force technical training centers,
opened in 1917 and reached its peak during World War II, training
more than 200,000 soldiers.
   The 2,400-acre base, located within the Rantoul city limits, has
239 buildings, 1,473 family housing units and dormitories for 5,879
servicemen.
   There are about 3,000 students, 3,100 regular military personnel
and 2,400 civilian workers. The annual payroll, including retired
servicemen living in the area, is $169 million.
   Illinois congressmen hope to block the closing through the
appropriations process. Congress still must appropriate the money
for short-term expenses associated with closing the bases.
   Critics of closing note that the government has spent $42.2
million in the last five years on new or improved facilities at
Chanute.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., examined a nearly complete $6.5 million
military weather school and a partially constructed $4.6 million
officers' dormitory last week, saying, ``Somebody in Washington has
to be very stupid to close this base before anyone lives in it.''
   ``Everybody here will go somewhere else, and they'll have to
reproduce all of these facilities at another base,'' said Dixon.
   Podagrosi said closure would mean loss of 65 percent of the
town's economic activity, along with about 8,000 of its 20,000
residents.
   A University of Illinois study estimated one-third of the 3,075
single-family homes would be for sale, and that property values
would drop 20 percent.
   The loss of Chanute also would create hardships for about 5,000
retired military people who count on free medical care and
prescriptions on base as well as reduced prices in base stores.
   Frank Elliott, economic development director for Rantoul, said
there are other options for the base, such as industries or schools.
   ``We haven't given up the cause yet, but we're looking at these
other possibilities,'' said Elliott.
   Residents hope Chanute will stay open so Rantoul's ordeal ends
as happily as the dangling paratrooper's predicament ended 58 years
ago.
   A fellow airman walked out on the wing of a second plane and
lowered a knife to the young man, who then cut himself free and
floated to safety.

   A fire at a factory and a workers' dormitory killed
one person Sunday and left more than 40 people homeless,
authorities said.
   The fire started about 2:30 a.m. in the main factory building of
the Shinko Spinning Co. in Sennan City, a suburb of Osaka, 255
miles west of Tokyo, and it spread to a warehouse and employee
dormitory because of strong winds.
   One factory worker was killed, but 16 other employees working
the night shift escaped. Forty-two people living in the dormitory
were left homeless.
   About 60 people living nearby were evacuated, but fire officials
confined the fire to the three buildings of the factory compound,
which was heavily damaged. An investigation into the cause of the
fire was in progress.

   Siamese twins Viet and Duc are doing
well six months after they were surgically separated in Vietnam's
Ho Chi Minh City, the official Vietnam News Agency reported Sunday.
   The twins were given little chance of survival after their
operation, which the report called the most complicated ever
performed in the country.
   The two boys, about seven years old, were joined at the pelvis,
had a single pair of legs and shared other major body parts.
   Duc can now operate his wheelchair alone and go outside to enjoy
the sun each morning. He is also learning reading, writing,
painting and music.
   Viet, the weaker of the two, is slowly recovering from
encephalitis and remains in intensive care. He recently underwent
another skin graft operation.
   The twins were last reported staying at Tu Du Hospital in Ho Chi
Minh City, formerly called Saigon.

   They're not as glitzy as the stores other
malls in this affluent suburban shopping mecca, but the shops at
the brand-new Magic Mall have a few things over their competitors.
   ``They will teach us kids how to run our own businesses and
avoid bankruptcy,'' said third-grader Warren Johnson. ``I think
they are fun because they offer different ways of learning. And
best of all, they are all my size.''
   Magic Mall, an elaborate wooden structure housing a dozen
enterprises, opened last Wednesday at Kent Gardens Elementary
School with the goal of ``teaching children here a business
person's mentality,'' said principal Robyn Hooker.
   The mall is a $20,000-plus project that takes up a spare
multipurpose ``pod'' area in an airy, carpeted, skylit new wing of
the school outside Washington, D.C.
   Private sources, including a local bank and three development
and construction companies, picked up the tab. Parents in the
fields of film-making, architecture and consumer advocacy played
key roles. And everyone involved has become a missionary for school
malls.
   ``This is but one example. It's a model. It could be done in
every community in the country. It's not difficult,'' said Ed
Rothschild, the consumer advocate.
   ``We are ready to pass the torch to Washington, D.C., and a
depressed school,'' said Hooker. ``You don't have to have the
luxury of a pod area to do this. Your facilities don't have to be
this elaborate. You don't have to have a computer in each shop.
Based on the children's enthusiasm, the other pieces will fall in
place.''
   Payrolls, profits, losses, investments and inventory will be
among the concerns addressed by the third-graders, and eventually
fourth-graders, who run the shops at Magic Mall. Each venture will
start off with an imaginary $20,000 in capital, to be multiplied or
diminished depending on the skill _ and grades _ of the students.
   Students will write letters and mail them at the post office;
publish books; put out a newspaper; invest in stocks at a market
exchange; conduct experiments at a science store; cook at a
short-order snack bar; use a video camera at an ad agency; and work
with wood at a shop called ``Sawdust.'' Each shop is scheduled to
have a computer. Each student will have a credit card provided by a
local bank.
   ``Once they learn to balance checkbooks, once they begin to
understand how the stock market functions, these are lifelong
skills. We're planting seeds and they will germinate,'' said
Hooker. Asked if the youngsters will learn about mergers and
takeovers, she grinned. ``Why not?''
   The mall was the brainchild of third-grade teacher Roger Socci,
sparked by memories of ``the lemonade stand, the hideout, the
dollhouse.'' To operate a successful shop, he reasoned, children
would be virtually forced to upgrade their math, reading and
writing skills. They would be naturally interested in the project
and they would learn to work as a team.
   Architect Jairo Delgado designed the school mall in the latest
neo-Victorian style, with quaint varied roof lines and bright
painted trim in red, blue and green. Each shop is the size of a
large playhouse.
   On ribbon-cutting day, three girls fussed over supplies at
``Card and Craft,'' showing off homemade cards, flowers and paper
baskets. Several others concocted a chocolate sundae, stepping over
children's cookbooks strewn across the floor of their tiny
restaurant.
   Newspaper editor Adam Sher, 8, was writing an editorial about
the mall opening. ``I think that's going to be my front page,'' he
confided.
   Down the way, ``Packs of Facts'' manager Brian Rowe, 8,
explained that ``we patent inventions and we do experiments and
package them.'' His first product, he said, would be a vinegar
rocket _ a cork that shoots out of a bottle due to a mixture of
baking soda and vinegar.
   ``Tomorrow it has to be ready,'' Brian said. He had the look and
sound of a man worried about the bottom line.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Predicting Election Fraud in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before the first ballot was cast, political
seers from President Bush on down were predicting widespread fraud
in this week's presidential elections in Panama.
   At the same time, a bipartisan consensus, often rare in foreign
policy issues, emerged saying the de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, had to go.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have been on the
skids since February 1988, when Noriega was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Miami on drug trafficking charges. Then-president
Eric Arturo Delvalle a few weeks later attempted to force Noriega
out, only to be ousted himself by the general.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle, who lives in Miami, as
Panama's legitimate president, which has led to a political vacuum
that has caused a host of problems, ranging from snags in Panama
Canal treaty negotiations to incidents against American citizens.
   Neither traditional diplomacy, nor the cutoff of economic and
military aid nor economic sanctions have achieved the stated goal:
Noriega's ouster.
   The elections, scheduled for Sunday, pit Noriega's candidate,
Carlos Alberto Duque, against Guillermo David Endara, running on an
anti-government coalition ticket.
   In the United States, Democrats and Republicans alike claim the
general will stack the ballots in favor of Noriega. The Panamanians
charge the United States with interfering in their internal
politics.
   ``In recent weeks, the Noriega regime has taken steps to commit
systematic fraud,'' President Bush said last week. ``The people and
the government of the United States will not recognize fraudulent
election results engineered by Noriega.''
   The Panamanians claim the United States is pouring millions of
dollars into the opposition campaigns. The National Endowment for
Democracy, a non-profit, federally funded Washington group,
provided $99,000 this year to an anti-Noriega coalition, Adelina
Reyes-Gavilan, senior program director for Latin America, said.
   The Bush administration, citing security, has refused to comment
on reports published in April saying the president signed a secret
directive to grant the opposition group $10 million.
   The State Department recently issued a two-page statement
outlining ``the activities the Noriega regime is undertaking to
control the results of ... elections.'' The paper cited false voter
lists, vote buying, fabricated polls, visas aimed at barring
foreign observers, coercion, intimidation and detentions.
   ``The polls are so bad that he'd (Noriega) have to steal it big
time,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   The liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs has published several
statements charging Noriega with pre-election fraud for financing
his candidate with government funds and barring opposition media
from operating.
   On the conservative side, Michael G. Wilson, a political analyst
with the Heritage Foundation, said rigging the elections was
``certain.''
   Congress approved $100,000 for election observer missions and
administration officials say Bush will appoint an official observer
team that will include members of Congress, executive branch
officials and private citizens.
   The administration also is encouraging the efforts of private,
watchdog groups and Ken Wollack, executive vice president of the
National Democratic Institute, said a group of about 50 people,
including 18 Americans, planned to leave Thursday for Panama.
Former Presidents Carter and Ford were to be part of the private
delegation.
   Carter negotiated the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, which call for
the United States to turn the American-built waterway over to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. The current problems with the government
there have caused several people to question the U.S. commitment.
   ``When the treaty was negotiated no one had an idea Panama and
the United States would not be speaking to each other,'' Michael
Rhode Jr., assistant to the chairman of the Panama Canal
Commission, said. ``It's going to create a real problem.''
   Rhode said the treaty provisions have stalemated because ``there
isn't an avenue for any communications with the United States and
the regime in Panama.'' Under the timetable of the canal treaty, a
Panamanian is to be named administrator of the commission on Jan.
1, 1990.
   ``Anyone would have a problem if he's ever been associated with
Noriega,'' Rhode said.
   He said Panama Canal revenues of $98.2 million were being held
in escrow as part of the U.S. sanctions.
   ``There isn't a clear policy commitment in Washington toward
Panama,'' said Wilson of the Heritage Foundation. ``We need to try
to renegotiate the treaties for our national security.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the Bush administration needed
to adopt plans for Panama.
   ``It has not been clear that the administration or Congress had
a strategy on what to do,'' the senator said in a telephone
interview. ``We'll have to take whatever force we need to defend
our people and the canal. We ought to be saying that now, not after
the election.''
   Some 10,000 U.S. troops and 40,000 Americans live in Panama.
American servicemen have been harassed by Noriega's Panamanian
Defense Forces, foreign journalists have been expelled, and
Panamanian Defense Forces recently stopped several school buses
carrying American children.
   Juan B. Sosa, recognized in the United States as Panama's
ambassador, said Noriega would ``steal the elections'' and feared
violence would break out.
   ``The Panamanian Defense Forces are going to have to decide if
they'll fire on their own people or take Noriega out themselves,''
he said in a recent interview at the embassy. ``It's that
explosive.''

<HEAD>Eight Years Later, AIDS Remains A Death Sentence For Most Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One federal health report seemed to suggest many
AIDS patients survive for up to eight years after their diagnosis,
but a researcher says most presumed survivors have actually died
and their deaths not reported.
   A monthly report from the Centers for Disease Control listed 14
adults and two children who were diagnosed with AIDS more than
eight years ago and still are not listed among the dead.
   If those statistics are an accurate portrayal of AIDS in
America, as many as 20 percent of the known patients from the
disease's earliest known days _ when the number of patients was a
fraction of what it is today _ are still alive, giving rise to a
hope that AIDS is survivable in a number of cases.
   But CDC scientists and other AIDS experts acknowledge that most
of those early ``survivors,'' along with many others from more
recent years, probably have died, their deaths unreported to the
federal government. But at least some people are living for five
years or more and have been confirmed to have the disease.
   ``People who are not listed as dead are not necessarily alive,''
said Dr. Ann Hardy, who spearheaded a CDC study ``looking at these
people. Are they really alive? Did they really have AIDS?''
   Ms. Hardy, who has since transferred to the National Center for
Health Statistics, said her study managed to track down at least
some information on 780 people who, by statistical count, seemed to
have survived AIDS since being diagnosed in 1983 or before.
   In fact, the CDC study confirmed that 475, or 61 percent, of
those 780 presumed survivors had indeed died, but local health
officials had not reported their deaths to the federal government.
   An additional 186, or 24 percent, ``are lost to follow-up,'' she
said. ``What we would probably guess is that a good proportion are
dead, but they went out of the country, or to another state, and
the local health departments lost track of them.''
   The remaining 119 pre-1984 AIDS patients were still alive at the
time of the study, which was conducted in 1987-88. Researchers
tried to have those patients tested to confirm that they actually
had AIDS; since AIDS tests did not come into use until the
mid-1980s, many early AIDS diagnoses, based on symptoms alone, may
be wrong, they reasoned.
   Out of 47 people diagnosed with AIDS before 1984 who agreed to
blood tests, six showed no sign of AIDS infection. The remaining 41
were confirmed as living patients of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``While ... the mortality is high, there are some who are
surviving. Mortality is not 100 percent,'' Ms. Hardy said. ``There
are some people doing fairly well. ... There are a lot of
possibilities as to why, but it's impossible to sort out.''
   The CDC study found nine people diagnosed with AIDS in 1981 or
earlier who were still alive _ but none would agree to blood tests
to confirm that they actually had AIDS, Ms. Hardy said.
   In San Francisco, which has the nation's third-highest number of
AIDS cases behind New York and Los Angeles, the Department of
Public Health tracks individual AIDS patients. Researchers there
said that as of the end of 1988, 24 AIDS patients were believed to
be alive five years or longer after diagnosis, including one who
had survived eight years.
   ``That's a very small number,'' said Dr. George Lemp, chief of
the AIDS Surveillance Branch at the San Francisco Department of
Public Health. ``Our estimate of survival is 3 percent past five
years.''
   Scientists have reported in recent years that the survival time
for some AIDS patients is lengthening. Diagnoses have improved and
doctors now can use drugs to treat some of the deadly diseases let
in by the weakened immune systems of AIDS patients, such as a rare
form of pneumonia and even tuberculosis.
   Still, Lemp said, the prognosis for AIDS patients remains poor.
   ``There are a small proportion of persons who appear to live
beyond five years, but we don't know if there are any specific
reasons for that, other than there may be some individual factor
involved,'' he said.

   A study of five major companies suggests some
of the nation's railroads are underreporting accidents and injuries
and failing to keep proper records on such incidents, the General
Accounting Office said Sunday.
   The study concluded that the shortcomings were due to inadequate
internal railroad procedures, some of which have since been
corrected, the report said.
   The GAO, the congressional investigative agency, did not accuse
any of the railroads of purposely withholding information from the
Federal Railroad Administration, which collects the data.
   Nonetheless, the investigators expressed alarm at the problem,
saying it ``raises questions about the overall effectiveness of
FRA's safety program and the extent to which railroads have become
safer.''
   Dan Lang, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads,
said he could not comment on specifics in the GAO report because he
was not given an advance copy.
   But Lang said ``there could be room for disagreement'' over
whether particular accidents satisfied the thresholds for injury
and damage above which federal regulations require a report to the
FRA.
   ``I really would doubt there's any kind of systematic
underreporting going on,'' he said.
   Investigators audited five railroads: CSX Transportation and
Union Pacific, two of the country's largest freight carriers;
Amtrak, the federally subsidized passenger carrier; and two
regional lines, Chicago and North Western Transportation Co. and
Chicago, Central and Pacific Railroad.
   The five carriers together accounted for one-third of the
accidents and injuries reported to the government in 1987.
   The report said of 521 unreported injuries and 532 unreported
accidents studied, 61 injuries and 52 accidents should have been
reported to the FRA.
   Four of the railroads underestimated the number of lost workdays
resulting from 156 injuries by 269 percent. And estimated damages
resulting from 171 accidents were understated by $3.5 million, or
52 percent, the study said.
   The report was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has urged
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to follow its
recommendations, which include requiring railroads to set up
reporting procedures, and allowing federal officials to take legal
actions against rail lines with inadequate internal controls.

<HEAD>Wife, Daughter See Jailed Husband After Three Years</HEAD>

   The wife and daughter of one of China's most
prominent imprisoned dissidents were allowed to visit him in jail
Sunday for the first time in more than three years.
   Kan Tong and her daughter, Xu Jin, said they visited Xu Wenli
for 30 minutes at Beijing's No. 1 Prison. They were accompanied by
five police officers and one stenographer who scribbled what they
said in a small blue book.
   Police told them not to touch Xu, who was sentenced in 1981 to
15 years in jail for counterrevolutionary crimes. They said
authorities refused Xu's request to kiss his 16-year-old daughter.
   At the end of the meeting, Kan defied the order and shook her
husband's hand.
   ``It was cold and dry,'' she said. ``His hand was shaking.''
   She said her husband had turned into ``a bag of bones.''
   ``His hair is completely white and all the teeth on the left
side of his mouth have fallen out.''
   ``He is this thin,'' said Xu Jin, holding up one of her fragile
arms. ``I have never seen a man so thin.''
   No family member had been allowed to visit Xu since Oct. 10,
1985, after an essay by Xu, titled ``My Self-Defense,'' was
smuggled out of prison. In it, Xu gave details of his arrest and
prosecution in an account critical of the regime.
   Prison authorities further punished him by moving him from an
86-square-foot room to a 43-square-foot cell, she said, citing his
letters and reports from sources in the jail. Guards took away his
bed and forced him to sleep on bricks. Lights were always on.
   Xu, an electrician by profession, was a leader of the Democracy
Wall movement of 1978 and published an unsanctioned periodical
calling for political change. In the journal,``April 5th Forum,''
which was mimeographed in his home, Xu argued that a multiparty
system was not anti-communist and would help the socialist cause.
   The movement was tolerated by China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping,
until he consolidated power. After that a crackdown came.
   Xu is one of China's most famous dissidents, but his fame is
greater outside China, a testimony to the power of China's
state-run press to limit access to information.
   Most of those currently participating in a Beijing student
movement for democracy and a free press don't know who Xu is.
   Since January a growing number of Chinese intellectuals have
called for the release of political prisoners. The government
denies it has any political prisoners.
   Kan said news of the current pro-democracy protests made her
husband happy.
   ``He may be weak but his spirit is still there,'' she said. ``He
is still Xu Wenli.''
   She said prison officials told her Saturday that a request to
see her husband had been approved.
   ``We hope you can help us educate Xu Wenli,'' read a letter from
the prison. ``Therefore we will consider your request.''
   Recently, Xu's treatment appears to have improved since 1985,
Kan said.
   Throughout the meeting, she had trouble looking at her husband,
she said.
   ``We sat there on benches. The police were on high chairs,
sitting above us. Both of us just looked at our hands. He was
shaking, he shook throughout the meeting. Then he cried.''
   Xu Jin said she only looked at her father once.
   ``I asked him if I was a woman yet,'' she said. ``He said I'm
still a little girl. Then I couldn't look at him anymore. I drank
tea.''
   Kan said prison authorities allowed her to give Xu a bag of
goodies, including his favorite fish dish, sesame oil, hot pepper
oil, and a recent book by Richard Nixon.
   ``Thirty minutes went fast,'' she said. ``I don't know whether
there will be a next time.''

   Tickets for The Who's 25th anniversary
concert July 9 sold out within two hours and a second concert was
added for the next day, concert promoters said.
   All 46,000 tickets for the July 9 show were sold by noon
Saturday, said Julie Hittner of Electric Factory Concerts,
co-promoter.
   Members of the British rock band, known for their rock opera
``Tommy,'' and hits such as ``I Can See For Miles,'' said last week
that they were reuniting for the tour.
   They made the announcement at New York's Radio City Music Hall,
where they will perform ``Tommy'' June 27. WMMR, which is also
promoting the Philadelphia concert dates, will broadcast the opera
live. The tour begins in Toronto on June 24.

   Linda Kozlowski, co-star of the ``Crocodile
Dundee'' films, has bought a house in the Hollywood Hills from
Craig T. Nelson, who plays the lead role in the TV series ``Coach.''
   Nelson, who also played the spooked father in the
``Poltergeist'' horror films, and his wife, Doria, sold the
four-bedroom home for about $725,000 and bought an estate in Malibu
for nearly $1.5 million, said Beverly Hills real estate broker
Ronna Brand. They lived in the house for four years.
   Kozlowski, who played a New York journalist opposite Australian
Paul Hogan in both ``Crocodile Dundee'' films, bought the house
after seeing only photographs, Ms. Brand said.
   ``She had seen the area enough to know the house was a
tremendous buy,'' said Ms. Brand, who represented Nelson.

   Rita Coolidge has proved she isn't afraid to
be upstaged, sharing her New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival
stage with Jimmy Buffett, CBS newsman Ed Bradley and New Orleans
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy.
   To top it off, her saxophone player proposed to his girlfriend
during Saturday's performance.
   ``I love having all these people on stage,'' Coolidge said.
   Bradley, who said he tries never to miss the Jazz Fest, and
Barthelemy played tambourines.
   ``I play the tambourine most of the time when I'm in New
Orleans. It's something in the water, I think,'' said Bradley.
``Actually, the mayor has given me permission to play any time I
want in the city limits.''

   Friends and colleagues of jazz
trumpeter Woody Shaw organized a concert at a new jazz club to
raise money for the legally blind musician who was seriously
injured in a train accident.
   Tickets for Sunday night's show at Kimball's East in this town
near Oakland went for $10, opening the door to music by Bobby
Hutcherson, who co-led a group with Shaw in San Francisco for
several years, Cedar Walton, John Handy, Tony Williams, Linda
Tillery, the Calvin Keys quintet and others.
   Shaw, 44, fell in a New York City subway station in March and
was hit by a train. His left arm had to be amputated.
   An earlier fund-raising concert in New York raised about $10,000.

   North Carolina A&amp;T State University got
a national plug last week when the Rev. Jesse Jackson wore a sweat
shirt from his alma mater on a television program.
   Jackson, a 1964 graduate of A&amp;T, wore the sweat shirt during his
guest appearance on NBC's ``A Different World'' Thursday night.
   ``Knowing Jesse, his motive is to plug A&amp;T and the historically
black colleges,'' said Richard E. Moore, assistant vice chancellor
for university relations.
   ``A Different World'' portrays the students and faculty at

   Most of astronaut Mark Lee's friends
and relatives may have to return home to Wisconsin without seeing
their hometown hero lift off into space.
   About 100 people from Lee's hometown of Viroqua, Wis., came to
Florida to watch Friday's scheduled launch of the space shuttle
Atlantis, which was scrubbed 31 seconds before liftoff because of
mechanical problems.
   ``Mark was disappointed, but what can you do,'' said the
astronaut's father, Charles Lee. ``We're going to take one day at a
time and just get some sun and relax. We're going to collect
ourselves.''
   ``Some of our family has to go back to jobs or they just can't
get any more time off,'' Charles Lee said.
   The elder Lee said he and his wife Ruth will probably stay in
Florida through next weekend. If Atlantis has not lifted off by
then, they may return to Viroqua and fly back when a new launch
date is set, he said.

   A woman who spent several years trying
to prove she is the daughter and heir of country music legend Hank
Williams Sr. is back in court again, trying to get a share of her
adoptive parents' estate.
   Cathy Deupree Adkinson has filed a $5 million suit against the
estate of her adoptive parents, Wayne and Louise Deupree of Mobile,
claiming she was defrauded.
   Mrs. Deupree died of cancer in December 1987, shortly after a
will was drawn up cutting the plaintiff out of her estate. Wayne
Deupree died of cancer in 1983. An attorney for other members of
the family denied any fraud.
   A judge in Montgomery ruled in 1987 that Mrs. Adkinson is ``a
natural child of Hank Williams Sr.,'' who recorded songs such as
``Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.''
Williams died in 1953, five days before Mrs. Adkinson was born.

   A local detective took on a case of a
different sort when he was called in on a bird hunt for a
foul-tempered parrot who flew the coop.
   Armed only with a variety of bird calls, police Detective C.D.
Morrison winged it in his search for Charlie, a $2,000 South
American Macaw parrot who ventured from his perch.
   Charlie's owners, Robert and Chris Mort, notified police after
they discovered the bird was missing Thursday evening.
   ``We let her out on the front porch, she's sort of the
neighborhood watch dog,'' Mrs. Mort said.
   Morrison said he tried to attract the bird by making parrot
calls, but there was no response.
   The Morts on Friday asked meter readers, mail carriers, police
and school children to aid in the search for Charlie.
   Morrison returned with a bird in his hand Friday afternoon after
a neighbor became a stool pigeon and turned Charlie in.
   ``She was about a block away in a big tall tree and a lady over
there spotted her,'' Mrs. Mort said. ``She's okay, just a little
wet.''
   The Morts were concerned not only about the parrot's
disappearance but about her mood swings. Charlie, who likes fried
chicken and coffee, can become very foul tempered for no reason,
they say.

   A wallaroo that was apparently not in the
mood for mating may have set a new high jump record when it escaped
from the Walk in the Wild Zoo by leaping a 7-foot fence.
   The animal's caretaker, Mike Cassell, said he was putting a
female wallaroo _ a cross between a kangaroo and a wallaby _ inside
a wire enclosure housing a male wallaroo at the zoo when the male
escaped Friday afternoon.
   Cassell, other zoo workers and Spokane County Animal Control
employees searched for the 3-foot-tall, dark gray animal in the
brushy areas along the Spokane River before it was finally cornered
in the front yard of a residence about two miles from the zoo.
   Zookeeper John McLachlan injected the wallaroo with an
anesthetic, but it took four people to pick up the struggling
animal and put it in a truck to be returned to the zoo.
   Cassell was relieved at the successful recovery.
   ``If the animal is stressed bad enough, I've seen them quiver up
and die,'' he said during the chase. ``They're really docile
animals. ... I'm amazed that he would even try to cross the road,
they're that timid.''
   Wallaroos aren't usually so flighty, and Cassell said this was
the first one to ever bolt from the zoo.
   The animal first escaped the wire enclosure and then, after an
emu started chasing it, ``it jumped over the 7-foot fence,''
Cassell said. ``According to the book, it's not able to jump over
four feet. I guess this one never read the book.''

<HEAD>High-Tech `War Room' Latest Outpost in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``drug war situation room'' unveiled by President
Bush last week and one like it in California may be the nation's
most sophisticated anti-smuggling weapons yet, but some question
whether such high-tech wizardry can do much.
   Bush dedicated the Customs Service-Coast Guard interdiction
center Thursday during a visit to Miami, where he also addressed
top Latin American drug-fighting officials at an international
conference.
   ``Think of this as one of America's drug war situation rooms, as
our early warning network against narcotics,'' Bush said after
watching a computer simulation of a drug interdiction in which
smugglers were tracked through the skies and seas off Miami and
intercepted by jets and speedboats.
   The Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Center, or
C3I, is in a squat, peach-colored building southwest of Miami in a
field dotted with radar antennas.
   Information from a network of land, sea and air radar monitored
by the Federal Aviation Administration, Customs, the Coast Guard
and the Pentagon will be displayed on a video system.
   Specialists will compare radar data with FAA flight plans, field
updates and intelligence reports to keep track of up to 5,000 boats
and planes across more than 12 million square miles in the eastern
United States.
   C3I West in Riverside, Calif., has directed air interdiction
west of Houston since August.
   ``My sources within the Defense Department say they don't have
anything to match C3I from a technical standpoint. It's a very
sophisticated system designed specifically for drug interdiction,''
said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., former chairman of the House
subcommittee responsible for overseeing the drug war.
   ``There's no better way we could spend this $33 million,'' said
Customs Commissioner William von Raab, standing in front of a
Customs Blackhawk helicopter outside the center Thursday.
   ``We were absolutely defenseless in our air borders. Five years
ago, you could fly anywhere into the United States and not stand a
snowball's chance of getting caught,'' von Raab said. ``Now we are
well out in front of the smugglers and we are never going to fall
behind again.''
   Others aren't so confident. They point to longstanding problems
such as inter-agency rivalry, a lack of equipment such as radar,
planes and boats, and a shortage of intelligence.
   ``You have to recognize you're going up against an entity that
is bringing in $150 billion a year _ roughly half of our total
defense spending _ with $6-7 billion a year from the U.S.
government,'' English said.
   Cocaine seizures, virtually non-existent before the 1980s, are
growing nationwide.
   The Coast Guard hauled in 14,591 pounds in fiscal 1988, up from
12,950 in 1987. Customs seized 138,808 pounds in fiscal 1988,
compared to a combined 140,419 in 1986 and 1987.
   Marijuana seizures by both agencies have dropped sharply in what
officials say is a sign that the law is forcing smugglers to move
to lower risk, higher profit cocaine.
   But authorities intercept at best only about 10 percent of the
3,500 flights and 4,500 boat trips smugglers make each year,
according to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   Upwards of 18 million pounds of marijuana, 300,000 pounds of
cocaine and 13,000 pounds of heroin will be smuggled into the
country this year, the office estimates.
   Before the C3I center can improve these numbers, gaps in the
radar network must be filled by AWACS planes and balloons, said
Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost.
   ``Until we have enough of them it will be possible for druggies
to fly around us. The C3I is not going to correct that,'' Yost
said. ``Within the next 12 months we'll double our radars and this
will make a big difference.
   ``It's the most capable air interdiction center in the world,
and if it works the way it's supposed to work, I'll be very
pleased,'' he said. ``But there aren't enough assets in the world
to seal our border to the two to three tons of cocaine that cross
it every week.''

<HEAD>Met Presents One-Week Ring Cycle for First Time in 50 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in 50 years, the Metropolitan
Opera has treated audiences to Richard Wagner's mammoth ``Ring
Cycle'' the old-fashioned way, performing all four operas within a
single week as the composer intended.
   And what a treat it was.
   Seen in its 17-hour entirety last week, the production, though
not as adventurous as some would have liked, bore out most of the
hopes of those who have watched it gradually unveiled over the last
2{ years. And it proved itself an instant crowd-pleaser, drawing
lusty cheers from a standing-room-only crowd of nearly 4,000 who
paid up to $620 apiece for the four performances.
   The staging by Otto Schenk, with strikingly traditional sets and
costumes by Guenther Schneider-Siemssen, brings to life with loving
care Wagner's fantastical world of dwarfs, dragons and demigods.
   Shunning the current habit of squeezing Wagner's untidy
mythmaking into a political, economic or psychological mold,
Schenk, Schneider-Siemssen and conductor James Levine aim to let
the drama and the music unfold on their own terms. They may not
have any new insights into this epic about the theft of a golden
ring and the disasters that befall all who pursue it, but they do a
magnificent job of retelling the story as Wagner wrote it.
   The naturalistic sets and costumes depict the fairy-tale scenes
and characters for what they are and nothing more. The Rhinemaidens
are really mermaids, not prostitutes as in one production, and
their river is not a hydroelectric dam; Wotan is really the king of
the gods, not a 19th century capitalist; Siegfried is really a
noble young warrior, not a garage mechanic.
   Ironically, this literal interpretation has brought down the
wrath of some critics who accuse the Met of pandering to the
reactionary tastes of wealthy patrons who financed the production.
   But Levine, who is also the Met's artistic director, has
defended the conservative choice on grounds that the company needs
a solid production it can live with well into the next century, not
one that will seem dated or ill-conceived within a few years.
   With no external viewpoint to hold the audience's interest, the
singing and orchestral playing must be special indeed if the
production is to work its magic. And here the Met played its strong
suit. The orchestra sounded splendid all week and Levine propelled
the music forward with a fine sense of dramatic tension.
   Among the singers, Hildegard Behrens once again showed that she
is the finest Bruennhilde of the post-Birgit Nilsson era. Though
she lacks the overpowering vocal resources of a great Wagnerian
soprano, she makes up for that with dramatic intensity as she
changes before our eyes from a frisky young Valkyrie to a
passionate and then betrayed lover, and finally to a compassionate
woman whose sacrifice returns the ring to its rightful owners, the
Rhinemaidens.
   James Morris was a superior Wotan, his brilliant high notes
cutting through the heavy orchestration with ease. Another
magnificent bass, Matti Salminen, carried off the rare feat of
appearing in all four operas, as Fafner (a giant in ``Das
Rheingold,'' transformed into a dragon in ``Siegfried''); as
Hunding in ``Die Walkuere,'' and as Hagen in ``Goetterdaemmerung.''
   Other singers who made memorable contributions included Franz
Mazura and Graham Clark as the brother dwarfs Alberich and Mime;
Helga Dernesch as Wotan's nagging wife Fricka (but as Waltraute in
``Goetterdaemmerung'' the high notes were too much for her);
Siegfried Jerusalem as the crafty god Loge; Brigitta Svenden as the
prophetess Erda, and Mari-Anne Haeggender, unusually sweet-sounding
as the goddess Freia.
   As the romantic lovers Siegmund and Sieglinde, Robert Schunk and
Ellen Shade looked convincing and sang acceptably but were no vocal
match for the team who appeared in earlier performances, Gary Lakes
and Jessye Norman.
   A bigger problem was the Siegfried of Toni Kraemer. He acted
with animation but had to press his voice in the upper register and
often sounded harsh or flat. The world is still waiting for a true
heldentenor who can do justice to this killer role.
   The Met is offering one more complete Ring Cycle this week, with
Gwyneth Jones as Bruennhilde, William Johns as Siegfried and Hans
Sotin as Wotan. It will be back three more times next spring, and
will be televised over four consecutive nights in June 1990 by the
Public Broadcasting Service.

<HEAD>Nuclear Fusion Researchers Say Nature's Attack Unjustified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two scientists who have been taken aback
by attacks on their experimental claims of room-temperature nuclear
fusion have lashed out at the source of the latest rebuff _ the
British scientific journal Nature.
   Fusion researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann said
the prestigious journal forced them to withdraw their paper and
made inaccurate statements, and that one editor was ``mumbling in
the dark,'' the Deseret News quoted them as saying in Sunday's
editions.
   On March 23, Pons, a chemistry professor at the University of
Utah, and Fleischmann, of England's University of Southampton,
announced that an experiment involving palladium and platinum
electrodes immersed in heavy water had yielded energy indicating
nuclear fusion had taken place. Heavy water is like ordinary water
except that ordinary hydrogen atoms have been replaced by
deuterium, a heavier cousin or isotope of hydrogen.
   Further, the scientists claimed the so-called ``cold fusion''
experiment had yielded more than four times the energy needed to
produce it. Previous attempts at fusion have involved extremely
high temperatures.
   While laboratories around the world have duplicated the
experiment and reported similar results, others have reported
failures and critics have remained unconvinced.
   Nature, in an April 27 edition that contained several articles
on fusion, speculated that the Utah experiment is fatally flawed
and will never be verified.
   ``The Utah phenomenon is literally unsupported by the evidence,
could be an artifact and given its improbability, is most likely to
be one,'' wrote John Maddox, editor of the 120-year-old magazine.
   Pons said Nature had dipped to ``sensationalism of the worst
type. I have never in my life seen such a scandal by a scientific
journal to discredit two people. They have a privileged position
that they are using.''
   Fleischmann criticized Nature's repeated accusations that he and
Pons leaked to reporters their intent to submit to Nature a
scientific paper on their experiments.
   ``At the (March 23) press conference we stated it was quite
incorrect to disclose the the name of the journal we were
submitting to because it would restrict the freedom of action of
the editor,'' Fleischmann said.
   ``It could have only come from other people submitting papers,
or from reviewers or the staff of Nature itself,'' he said. ``I
think it's an impertinence that Nature feels itself entitled to
repeat an allegation which is untrue.''
   They said that on the same day they made their announcement,
they submitted a preliminary paper to Nature and met Nature's
requirements for submission.
   After their researchers' more lengthy scientific paper was
published in the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, Pons said,
Nature requested substantially more information.
   Nature gave them three days to revise and beef up their original
submission at a time when they had heavy speaking and research
obligations, they said.
   ``They forced us to withdraw it by deadlining us and breaking
their own rules,'' Pons said.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they replied in full to questions
posed by reviewers assigned by Nature to read their manuscript,
sending the replies to Nature. They accused the magazine of not
forwarding the replies to the reviewers, though the publication had
accused them of failing to respond to the reviewers' comments.
   ``We did reply. It is they (the editors) who did not send the
replies to the reviewers,'' Fleischmann alleged.
   David Lindley, Nature's assistant physics editor, said there is
frustration in the scientific world because the experiment hasn't
been confirmed, and that Pons and Fleischmann are inaccessible to
researchers.
   ``I can't understand why if they are so certain, they aren't
helping out other people.''
   Pons called Lindley's statements ludicrous.
   ``The editors of Nature have no idea who we have been talking
to, who has seen the experiment, how many people have been given
our data, how many scientists we are collaborating with,'' Pons
said. ``He (Lindley) is mumbling in the dark.''

   An official takes an hour to lay out Japan's
position on a thorny trade issue, then comes to the bottom line on
Tokyo's response to Washington's demand. ``It's impossible.''
   Not all issues between Japan and the United States are that
difficult. The two countries agreed on how to divide the
development and production of a new fighter based on the F-16 for
Japan's air force _ a matter that involves security and technology
issues as well as trade.
   But enough trade issues fit into the difficult-to-impossible
category that this country is braced for a hard time as Washington
decides on using the hammer of the new trade act to cut Japan's $55
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Virtually simultaneous with President Bush's announcement Friday
of the co-production deal on the fighter, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills hit Japan a double blow:
   _Japan was given more space than any other country in a report
on 34 countries said to have significant barriers to imports from
the United States. The list is to be used to set priorities for
Washington to start intensive negotiations under the 1988 trade act
and eliminate the barriers. Otherwise sanctions may be imposed.
   _In the area of telecommunications equipment, Ms. Hills moved
directly to the verge of sanctions. Charging that Japan had
``failed to live up to all its commitments,'' she declared that
U.S. officials now will consider how to penalize Japanese companies
through higher import duties or other restrictions, Washington
reports said.
   Telecommunications equipment accounts for a big slice of the
U.S. trade deficit. U.S. Commerce Department statistics show a $2.2
billion deficit with Japan in this sector in 1987.
   It was the area described as impossible by Toru Arizono, a
director of the Communications Policy Bureau in the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications.
   Interviewed before the U.S. action, Arizono produced U.S.
Commerce Department documents showing Japan as second only to the
United States in permitting foreign companies easy access to the
telecommunications market.
   He said the problem originated solely with the Motorola company,
which he said was ``trying through political means'' to get what it
had been unable to attain in Japan's market for cellular car
telephones.
   ``Other U.S. companies are not submitting anything to us,''
Arizono said. ``If all were complaining, then we would make a
maximum effort to see that there is fair competition among all
companies.''
   Motorola complains that Japan's failure to allocate a frequency
for its car phones in Tokyo blocks the company from access to a
market it estimated as worth $2 billion during the next 10 years.
   Arizono explained that DDI, the Japanese company marketing
Motorola car phones, agreed several years ago to divide the country
with another Japanese firm, which got the Tokyo-Nagoya area while
DDI-Motorola got the rest of the country.
   The problem was that they were using incompatible systems, and
though technical advice was against it, the ministry agreed to the
establishment of two radio systems.
   Motorola-equipped cars from Osaka, however, cannot connect to
the phone system if they come to Tokyo, Arizono said, and so
Motorola wanted a third radio system to accommodate its demands.
   ``There are no radio spectrum resources in the Tokyo area,'' he
said. ``It's impossible.''
   The best Japan could do, he said, was to have Motorola and other
foreign suppliers help to set worldwide technical standards for the
next step in car phones _ digital operation _ so there would be no
problems of interconnection.
   Digital car phones will be coming in a few years, he said.
   The Bush administration wants faster progress in the short run.
Washington's tough line on trade, however, risks a combative
response from Japan.
   Japanese officials reacted sharply to both U.S. trade moves
Friday. Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno said the threat of sanctions
on telecommunications equipment was ``extremely regrettable.'' He
warned that Japan might charge the United States with unfair trade
practices under the world trade pact called the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
   The minister for international trade and industry, Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, said in a statement as he departed for trade talks in
Washington that the overall report on import barriers showed U.S.
misunderstanding of Japanese trade policy.
   ``It is very disappointing that our intention has never been
understood by U.S. representatives, despite many bilateral talks,''
Mitsuzuka said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Say Pollutants May Have Helped Kill Dolphins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government should reopen an investigation
into the deaths of more than 750 bottlenose dolphins on the
Atlantic Coast to determine whether pollutants weakened their
immune systems, say two New Jersey congressmen.
   The most likely cause of the dolphins' deaths was fish tainted
by a naturally occurring neurotoxin, known as brevetoxin, found in
red tide algae swept north from the Gulf of Mexico, said a report
released jointly last week by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, Office of Naval Research and Marine Mammal Commission.
   But it also said brevetoxin was found in tissue samples from
only eight of 17 beached dolphins tested, accounting for fewer than
half of the tested and only a fraction of the 750 who were stranded
on beaches in 1987 and 1988.
   Citing that discrepancy, Reps. Frank Pallone and Rep. Jim
Saxton, D-N.J., backed by environmentalists, urged that the
investigation be reopened.
   ``It is critically important to find out for certain whether or
not water quality or a man-made chemical contributed to the
dolphins' deaths,'' said Saxton.
   A spokesman for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration acknowledged the need for more study, but said some
politicians and environmentalists were using the issue to draw
attention to pollution.
   ``There are individuals and groups who have a vested interest in
having man-made pollution be the sole cause,'' said NOAA spokesman
Brian Gorman.
   Brevetoxin does not stay in living tissues after three to five
days, Gorman said, which might account for its absence from some of
the tissue samples.
   The report said ``many questions will remain unanswered until
directed studies are pursued,'' including a look at chronic
exposure to the toxin, a determination of environmental conditions
that led to the deaths and examination of a representative sample
of stranded marine mammals for biological toxins.
   ``Equally important is the need to resolve the growing question
of whether contaminants at levels found in the dolphins might have
affected their resilience and rendered them more susceptible either
to the toxin or the the microorganisms that eventually brought them
to their demise,'' the study said.
   Bruce McKay, a marine biologist with Greenpeace, said the
government report found that tissue from the dead dolphins
contained high levels of PCBs, which are known immune system
suppressors.
   ``The levels overall were among the highest levels ever found in
the marine mammal population,'' McKay said, and could have weakened
dolphin immune systems or compromised the dolphins' abilities to
withstand exposure to compounds such as brevetoxin and bacteria.
   The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee subcommittee
on oversight and investigations has scheduled a hearing May 9 to
hear testimony from the author of the report, Dr. Joseph R. Geraci
of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.

<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday
beatified a 19th century woman who protected the Catholic Church
from persecution, lauding her as a model for women and lay people.
   The pope, on the third day of his visit to this African island
nation, also spoke against inequality and corruption.
   The pope beatified Victoire Rasoamanarivo in a three-hour
service before a crowd estimated by local organizers at 500,000,
about half the capital's population.
   Beatification is a first step toward possible sainthood.
   Mrs. Rasoamanarivo, who died in 1894 at 46, is considered the
savior of the Roman Catholic Church in this nation of 11 million
people, 22 percent of whom are Catholic.
   The granddaughter of a prime minister, she converted to the
faith at 13, to the consternation of her pagan parents.
   When Catholic missionaries were expelled from Madagascar in
1883, she fought to keep Catholic schools open, traveled the
countryside to encourage the faithful and appealed to the royal
family to respect religious rights.
   When missionaries were allowed to return in 1886, they found the
church was still thriving.
   ``Those few years of service left a reminder that is still very
much alive,'' said the pope, speaking in French from a raised
cement-and-red-brick altar. ``She is a model for the lay faithful
today.''
   The pope cited her work with the poor, the sick and prisoners,
and held her up as an example for women in the church.
   The pope also hailed the ``courageous fidelity Victoire showed
the sacrament of marriage despite the problems of her marriage.''
   Her husband, Radriaka, son of the prime minister, was a
notorious drinker and womanizer. But before dying, after falling
off a balcony in their 18th year of their marriage, he accepted his
wife's plea to be baptized, church officials said.
   The pope has frequently condemned discrimination against women
and called for their greater participation in church affairs,
though not as priests.
   After the beatification, a dozen barefoot girls and boys
performed a dance beside the altar. The crowd, many wearing yellow
caps emblazoned ``Papa Joany Paoly II,'' sang hymns in Malagasy,
the country's language.
   Among those present was President Didier Ratsiraka, a Catholic.
   Later, the pope offered his blessing to prisoners in Madagascar,
noting, without elaborating, that some face a ``very painful
situation.''
   Amnesty International said it received reports that at least one
prisoner died each day in early 1987 in the main Antanimora prison
because of malnourishment and disease.
   In a speech later to lay people, the pope said Catholics had an
obligation to improve their society.
   The church has been openly critical of Madagascar's government.
   Madagascar is a 225,000-square-mile island off southeast Africa.
Since a communist revolution in 1975, its economy has declined.
   The pope, on his fifth tour of Africa, leaves Monday for the
French island of Reunion, then visits Zambia and Malawi.

<HEAD>Bush Does Not Share View Gorbachev Will Fail, Says Sununu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush does not share Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's view that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will fail in his efforts to reform the Soviet Union, a
senior White House aide said Sunday.
   ``I think the president and Secretary (of State James A.) Baker
... are hoping that Gorbachev's movement towards reform and
restructuring the Soviet Union does succeed,'' Sununu said on the
NBC-TV program, ``Meet the Press.''
   ``It is an opportunity to establish a relationship, continue the
relationship that has begun,'' he said. Referring to Cheney's
prediction that Gorbachev will fail, Sununu said, ``I don't think
that is the president's view.''
   Bush, en route to New York, declined to comment directly on
Cheney's comments, saying ``I never comment until I know exactly
what he said.''
   Pressed for views on Gorbachev, Bush said, ``We want perestroika
to succeed.''
   Cheney predicted in an interview broadcast Saturday that
Gorbachev ultimately will fail and be replaced by a leader less
friendly to the West, and he argued against major unilateral arms
control concessions.
   The conflicting administration assessments of Gorbachev's
chances for success come amid a debate within the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization over whether to modernize short-range U.S.
Lance nuclear missiles stationed in West Germany.
   German chancellor Helmut Kohl has called for immediate
negotiations with the Soviets on eliminating short-range nuclear
missiles, a step the Bush administration opposes on grounds it will
leave NATO ground forces exposed to larger Warsaw Pact armies.
   Gorbachev tightened his grip on power last week by forcing the
retirement of 74 aging members of the 301-member Communist Party
Central Committee. But the party newspaper Pravda subsequently
published speeches by local party leaders saying Gorbachev's
reforms were in trouble and had worsened rather than improved the
economy.
   Against this turbulent backdrop, the Bush administration has
been conducting a strategic review embracing U.S.-Soviet relations,
and plans to resume negotiations in earnest with a planned trip to
Moscow on May 10 by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Cheney, in an interview broadcast Saturday by the Cable News
Network, said he opposed major U.S. troop withdrawals from Europe
because he feared that a more hostile leader might succeed
Gorbachev.
   ``I think it would undo basic commitments to the alliance and,
until we know that Gorbachev is for real and that the changes he
wants to bring about are irreversible, it's be a terrible mistake
for us to withdraw from Europe,'' Cheney said.
   ``I think you really have to distinguish between what he is
trying to do and whether or not he's actually going to be able to
do it,'' Cheney said.
   ``And I think the bottom line is, that if I had to guess today,
I would guess that he would ultimately fail; that is to say, that
he would not be able to reform the Soviet economy to turn it into
an efficient, modern society,'' said Cheney.
   ``And when that happens, he's likely to be replaced by somebody
who will be farm more hostile than he has been in terms of his
attitude toward the West,'' he said.
   Cheney rejected calls by former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and others for an immediate cut of the 100,000 of the
more than 300,000 U.S. troops in Western Europe.
   ``I don't think we ought to move unilaterally in this area,''
Cheney said. ``I think we ought to move in conjunction with the
alliance. The alliance put together a good negotiating posture,
it's on the table in Vienna'' where negotiations on conventional
forces are underway.

<HEAD>Two Polls Show Many Britons Disenchanted with Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two opinion polls published Sunday indicate
growing public disenchantment with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
as she approaches 10 years in power.
   A Harris poll commissioned by The Observer newspaper said 40
percent of the respondents said they would like Mrs. Thatcher to
retire immediately, 8 percent said she should go within a year and
10 percent want her to stand down before the next election.
   Governments are elected for a maximum of five years, so the next
election could be anytime up to 1992.
   Mrs. Thatcher will complete a decade in power Thursday, the
anniversary of when she was first elected Conservative prime
minister. She won re-election in 1983 and 1987.
   Fifteen percent of those questioned said Mrs. Thatcher should
retire within two years after the next election; 13 percent said
five to 10 years from now; and 2 percent by the year 2000. Another
4 percent said Mrs. Thatcher should never retire.
   The newspaper did not account for the remaining 8 percent of
those questioned.
   Two-thirds of the 1,040 people sampled in the April 19-20 poll
said they believe she has ``gone too far with her policies.'' They
cited her reorganization of the National Health Service and tax
cuts for high earners, among other things.
   According to the poll, those questioned said Mrs. Thatcher's
good qualities were, in order, her determination, courage,
strength, leadership and energy. They said her bad qualities were
her voice, uncaring nature, obstinacy, policies and big-headedness.
   A Gallup poll for The Sunday Telegraph, a pro-Thatcher weekly,
said three-quarters of those questioned believe Mrs. Thatcher has
brought about a decline in public services like roads, schools and
public hospitals, while 54 percent thought the phrase ``Thatcher's
Britain'' had derogatory connotations.
   The newspaper gave no details about the size and timing of the
Gallup poll. No margins of error were given for either poll.
   Forty percent of those questioned in the Gallup poll said the
``quality of life'' in Britain had deteriorated in the last decade,
and 75 percent saw a worsening of public services, the poll
indicated. Thirty-two percent believe the quality of life has
improved under Mrs. Thatcher.
   Forty-four percent believe the economy has strengthened under
Mrs. Thatcher, while 35 percent think it has weakened. Seventy
percent approved of labor union laws that make it harder for unions
to stage strikes.

   Jack Cummings, who started as an office boy
at MGM studios and became a producer of such Hollywood musicals as
``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' has died of heart failure. He
was 84.
   Cummings, who also produced ``Teahouse of the August Moon'' and
``Kiss Me Kate!'' during a 30-year career making films, died Friday
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said family friend Simon Menkes.
   ``He had a spark of life that was unequaled by anybody I ever
met,'' Menkes said. ``He was also a master storyteller. He was not
only a renowned filmmaker, but had a personal magnetism and could
hold people spellbound. He was truly one of Hollywood's finest.''
   Cummings was born in New Brunswick, Canada, and worked his way
from a job as an MGM office boy to script clerk, assistant director
and short subject director-producer before he started producing
feature films in 1934.
   Among his dozens of productions, which included comedies and
dramas as well as musicals, was ``Easy To Wed'' in 1946, one of
Lucille Ball's first comedy roles.
   Cummings is survived by a son, four daughters and three
grandchildren, Menkes said. A memorial service was scheduled for
Monday in Los Angeles.

   Tehran television Sunday previewed a new
series called ``Top Secret'' to be broadcast each week, showing
confessions of Iranian agents who allegedly worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   The television, monitored in Nicosia, said it would show the
confession of a different exposed agent in each show, to be
broadcast every Thursday starting this week.
   The preview showed brief scenes of three of the alleged agents
sitting behind a desk talking, but it did not say who they were.
   Looking like an advertisement for a James Bond thriller, the
preview interspersed shots of the alleged agents with shots of the
CIA emblem, American passports, computers allegedly used for
espionage, cameras, and files labeled ``Classified,'' and ``Top
Secret.''
   Last month, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran had
discovered ``many nests of spies'' in Iran, and he claimed the spy
rings were CIA operations.
   He said some spies had been arrested but refused to say how many.

<DATELINE>DEIDESHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain failed Sunday to persuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl to drop
his demand that the superpowers begin talks soon on cutting
short-range nuclear missiles.
   The two leaders, trying to reach a compromise on a stalemate
that has split the NATO alliance, described their talks as frank
and intensive. Both admitted they could not solve the crisis.
   ``We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' Kohl told reporters
during a news conference with Mrs. Thatcher after an afternoon of
talks.
   But Kohl said he was optimistic the disagreement could be
resolved before a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in
Brussels on May 29-30.
   Mrs. Thatcher also expressed optimism, but stuck strongly to the
U.S.-British position that rules out early talks with the Soviets
on short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``Strength must continue not only in words; strength has to be
translated into weaponry,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's visit to the Rhineland-Palatinate town of
Deidesheim was aimed at persuading Kohl to drop his government's
insistence on early talks, a demand that has placed him in a battle
of wills with Mrs. Thatcher and President Bush.
   The West Germans believe superpower arms talks should be
attempted on a broad scale because of the current disarmament
climate in Moscow.
   Washington and London maintain talks on tactical nuclear
arsenals should not begin as long as the Warsaw Pact alliance has a
superiority in conventional forces.
   The United States and Britain also argue that it would be hard
to stop the talks from progressing to the point where they would
address the total elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe
_ a goal of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Under NATO's flexible response policy, the allies could respond
to a Soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons.
   ``Short-range nuclear weapons are absolutely vital for flexible
response,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Mrs. Thatcher said elimination of the weapons would mean that
the ``Soviet Union will have achieved its objective of getting
land-based nuclear weapons out of Europe. This I believe would be
disastrous for us.''
   Mrs. Thatcher at one point appeared to question whether Kohl was
in favor of an outright elimination of tactical nuclear weapons.
``I'm sure Mr. Kohl will correct me if I have misunderstood him on
this issue,'' she said.
   Kohl responded by having his interpreter read a line from his
speech to Parliament last week in which he rejected elimination of
the tactical nuclear weapons under the present balance of military
forces in Europe.
   But Kohl also was adamant that the West German position on early
talks be acknowledged.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons are based in West
Germany and would be used exclusively on German soil in a war.
   Kohl said he hoped a ``joint document which takes our special
situation into account'' could be prepared at the Brussels summit.
   ``And that has nothing at all to do with the Germans having
become unreliable or anything like that,'' Kohl said, referring to
suggestions that West Germany is no longer following agreed-upon
NATO doctrine.
   ``There can be no question of that,'' Kohl said. ``We cannot be
outshone by anyone in NATO in our reliability.''
   Kohl, faced with uncertain election prospects next year, also
wants to delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization and
deployment of rockets to replace NATO's aging short-range nuclear
arsenal.
   Polls show most West Germans no longer believe that the Soviet
Union is a military threat and favor eliminating nuclear weapons
from Europe.
   West European leaders are working to defuse the crisis. Italian
and Dutch leaders are to meet with West German officials after
separate talks with Mrs. Thatcher, and West German authorities are
going to France.
   West Germany claims it has outright support from nearly half the
NATO members: Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Italy, Greece and Spain.
   About 1,000 people gathered in Deidesheim's town square to greet
Mrs. Thatcher as she arrived by motorcade.
   Mrs. Thatcher, accompanied by Kohl, waved at the crowd as she
walked the short distance from the town hall to the Deidesheimerhof
Hotel were the talks were held.
   Many people waved miniature British flags as she passed by. A
handful of protesters carried banners denouncing Mrs. Thatcher's
stand on the missile issue.

<HEAD>Gramm Renews Call For ``National Crime Emergency''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm renewed his call Sunday for
declaration of a ``national crime emergency'' to quickly expand
prison facilities and take other measures to help crack down on
violent crime.
   ``In America today, we have crime without punishment,'' Gramm
said, noting that while 40,000 people were arrested on felony
charges last year in the District of Columbia, only 1,400 of them
went to prison.
   Gramm, appearing on the CBS program ``Face the Nation,''
asserted that no matter what else is done to deal with the root
causes of crime, ``we have got to take violent criminals off the
streets.''
   ``Now what we're trying to do is to build more prisons _ 70,000
more prison beds,'' said the Texas Republican. ``We want a national
crime emergency to allow us to go out on closed military bases,
pitch tents, use temporary buildings, put the violent criminals in
jail and keep them there. And do it now.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that ``it's absolutely
ridiculous to believe that our first line of defense should be
spending the billions of dollars that we are in building jails,
without being willing to spend millions of dollars in finding out
the reasons why people have this anti-social behavior.''
   Also interviewed on the same program was Peter Reinharz, chief
prosecutor of the Juvenile Court in New York City, where several
teen-agers have been arrested in a brutal attack April 19 on a
28-year-old investment banker while she was jogging in Central Park.
   ``It's evident that the juvenile justice system, as it presently
stands, has no deterrent effect whatsoever in light of the
increasing nature of the violence and the increasing severity of
the crimes we've seen over the last several years,'' Reinharz said.
   He said that for juvenile offenders ``there's very little threat
of jail. So maybe that's one of the things that has to change in
order to bring about some sort of deterrent value.''
   Reinharz said he also was particularly concerned about ``the
increase in sex crimes among the very young.''
   ``We have 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds committing
forcible rape, forcible sodomy, aggravated sexual abuse,'' he said.

   A station wagon packed with seven
children and two adults veered off an interstate highway and
crashed into the base of a highway sign Sunday, killing five people
and injuring the other four, authorities said.
   The man driving, a woman and three children were killed, said
Capt. Jim Berger of the fire department in this suburb south of
Chicago. Hospital authorities said three of the injured children,
ranging in age from 4 to 7, were in critical condition.
   Some of the car occupants were related, but authorities could
not immediately determine how many families were involved.
   Several police and fire departments were called to the scene,
where workers had to cut into the badly damaged car to get to the
victims.
   ``We just had to go piece by piece, getting the car apart and
getting them out,'' Berger said.

<HEAD>Middle School Lifts Ban On Rock T-Shirts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Middle school students can go back to
wearing their rock band T-shirts Monday, but their principal says
lifting a prohibiton on the shirts isn't a victory for those who
protested the ban.
   The school last week banned students from wearing T-shirts with
the insignias of the rock bands Guns `N Roses and Black Sabbath
because the two bands' music was tied to recent cult murders in
Matamoros, Mexico.
   ``It is not a matter of winning or losing, it's a matter of
educating youngsters so that we have caring and understanding and
educated young people,'' said J.T. Landes, principal at Washington
Middle School.
   The ban was enacted because of concerns raised by parents, he
said.
   About 150 students protested Thursday, saying the ban violated
their constitutional right to free speech. About 60 pupils served
one-day suspensions Friday for defying the ban.
   ``Just because we're little doesn't mean wer don't know about
the Constitution,'' said one eighth-grader, Kanong Yank, 14.
   School administrators decided this weekend to lift the ban
provided the shirts don't display profanities or other violations
of a dress code established by the Green Bay School Board, Landes
said.
   Parent and student-group meetings will be announced later to
deal with concerns over the dress code, Landes said.

<HEAD>Baby's Doctor Says Father Deserves Lenience For Death Of Comatose
Child</HEAD>

   The family of a comatose baby who died after his
father disconnected his respirator made funeral preparations
Sunday, and the child's doctor said there had been no hope the
infant's condition would have improved.
   Sixteen-month-old Samuel Linares, who had been comatose since
swallowing a balloon last August, died Wednesday. Police said his
father held off hospital workers at gunpoint, tearfully unhooked
the child's respirator and held him until he died.
   Rudy Linares, 23, of west suburban Cicero, faces a first-degree
murder charge. He is free on $75,000 bond.
   Linares said he did it ``because I loved my son ... I love my
wife.'' The funeral was planned for Monday.
   Linares' act revived an ethics debate over whether medicine
should merely prolong life, and it stirred a storm of opinions
about laws governing hopelessly injured or sick children.
   It prompted an outpouring of calls from parents whose children
have died. Though many said they were disturbed by Linares'
methods, most said they sympathized with the emotions that drove
him.
   Even the boy's doctor, Dr. Gilbert Goldman, director of the
pediatric intensive care unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center, said mercy should be used in dealing with Linares.
   ``I kept telling the dad, `I know it's terrible, but it won't
last much longer,''' Goldman said.
   ``Sammy wasn't dead, but he couldn't get better,'' he said.
   ``He remained highly unstable the first week or two, but then he
stabilized,'' Goldman said. ``Tests showed he was no longer at risk
of immediate death. He had brain activity but it was clear he would
not live outside a chronic vegetative state.''
   ``I sincerely hope the dad will not be punished for this action
although it was against the law,'' the doctor added. He also said
he hoped new legislation would result from the incident, to make
law catch up to technological advances.
   In 1988, there were some 100,000 ``technology-dependent''
children, through age 18, meaning they require some medical device
to keep them alive, not always in hospitals, according to the
National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related
Institutions of Alexandria, Va.
   Susan Maher said she can identify with Linares. Her daughter,
Elizabeth, spent the first two years of her life at the University
of Illinois Hospital in Chicago, the victim of cerebral palsy and
chronic lung disease. Ms. Maher says there were times she
considered unplugging Elizabeth's life-support equipment.
   ``A lot of times there is hardly anybody else in the hospital
unit,'' she said. ``You could do it. It enters your mind when you
feel you're being selfish by making a child suffer.''
   Ms. Maher didn't do it and Elizabeth, now 7, lives with the aid
of a ventilator.
   Cynthia Kramer of Calumet City lost her 13-year-old son, David,
to leukemia last December.
   David had developed a lung infection and was on a respirator,
and the hospital asked his parents on Christmas Eve to give
permission to let him die.
   ``His dad and I said we wanted everything to stay on until
David's very last heartbeat _ we didn't want to play God,'' said
Ms. Kramer. ``When God says `Come on,' that's when you come on. He
died on Christmas Day.
   Unlike Lenares' comatose baby, she said, ``David was dignified
and he was brave and he was a fighter and he was an alert,
intelligent person. You don't think about doing that to a person
like that.''

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas claimed Sunday that
they destroyed four airplanes and a helicopter in a rocket attack
on an air force base 30 miles outside Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.
   It brings to eight the number of aircraft the insurgents claim
to have destroyed at the Bagram base since April 21.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said the latest attack
occurred Thursday, the 11th anniversary of the coup that brought
the communists to power in Afghanistan. Guerrillas have been
fighting since then to topple the communists.
   There was no independent confirmation of their claims.
   Rebel sources reported heavy fighting north of Kabul in addition
to the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia and Kandahar.
   Al-Bunyan, a news service of fundamentalist guerrilla leader
Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, said guerrillas have killed 40 government
troops, destroyed four tanks and shot down one jet in Kandahar
since April 15.
   Twenty-five guerrillas died and 32 were wounded during the same
period, Al-Bunyan said.
   The guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan, have said Kandahar
will be their second major offensive. Their first offensive, on the
city of Jalalabad, is at a stalemate after several weeks of
fighting.
   The Jalalabad assault began three weeks after the last Soviet
forces left Afghanistan. The Red Army intervened militarily in
December 1979 to help fight the guerrillas but agreed to pull out
by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-moderated accord.
   The Afghan News Agency said government forces at Jalalabad have
begun shifting their families to Kabul, 70 miles to the west, to
escape the rebel onslaught.
   The capture of Jalalabad would give the rebels a badly needed
victory in their struggle to establish an Islamic republic and a
crucial urban foothold for an assault on Kabul.

<HEAD>In Boston, The Harbor's Cleaner, and Dukakis Asks Where's Bush Now?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston Harbor is getting cleaner, but state
officials say that's in spite of foot-dragging by the man who made
its filth famous: George Bush.
   Bush sailed in during the presidential campaign last September
and accused Gov. Michael Dukakis of neglecting an important
environmental issue in his own state.
   Now, the governor and his top environmental aides are wondering
when President Bush will put his money where his mouth was. They
want the $59 million recommended for the harbor cleanup by Congress
but deleted from Bush's budget.
   ``It's hypocritical of the president to come to New England in
the heat of a campaign and fault the man who began the harbor
cleanup for not doing enough and then, once safely ensconsed in the
White House, to pull the money off the table,'' complained John
DeVillars, state environmental secretary.
   Bush last fall staged a bold raid into Dukakis territory aboard
a boat and accused Dukakis of delays that left the harbor ``dirtier
and dirtier.'' The governor and his supporters scrambled to line up
testimonials about his efforts in 1984 to create the water
authority and give it the clout to end the pollution. But as often
happened in the campaign, Dukakis was put on the defensive.
   By all accounts, the harbor is finally getting cleaner after 350
years of abuse, and decisions have been made on where to locate a
new $6.1 billion sewage treatment plant, the biggest public works
project in the region's history.
   Since February, the agency responsible for the cleanup, the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, has eliminated discharge
of ``floating scum,'' the grease, solids and buoyant plastics that
figured in a Bush campaign commercial.
   ``Thousands of gallons a day were being discharged for the last
hundred years. That has stopped for the first time in history,''
said Paul Levy, head of the agency.
   The federal judge overseeing the cleanup is satisfied with the
pace, and even the Republican regional administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Deland, agrees. ``Overall,
I am delighted with the progress and am optimistic the dates are
going to be met,'' he said.
   Still, the harbor water is so foul that according to Levy, if
you scoop up a bucketful and pour it back in, you would be
violating the Clean Water Act.
   Without federal funds, the full cost of the cleanup falls on the
water authority's 2.5 million customers, who have seen water and
sewer bills rising by 20 percent a year.
   ``I think the thing that concerns us particularly is, after all
the talk about Boston Harbor, the president eliminated funds the
Congress had already appropriated for the harbor,'' Dukakis said in
an interview last week.
   Deland defended the president's budget decision, citing the
deficit and claiming that Massachusetts congressmen were divided
over whether to release the money because they cannot agree on
where to put a sludge processing plant.
   ``In my view, from a national perspective, given the deficit
situation, one has to raise a question, why a bonus for Boston?''
Deland said. Besides, he argued, Massachusetts could have applied
for aid years ago when federal funds were plentiful but chose to
seek a pollution waiver instead.
   Bush, meanwhile, has become enmeshed in a pollution controversy
of his own _ the Alaskan oil spill. Dukakis declined to comment on
the president's response to the spill, but top aides note bitterly
that Bush _ who said ``I am an environmentalist'' during the
campaign _ hesitated in committing federal resources.
   ``I'm sure these are all oversights,'' Levy said sarcastically.
``But some of us are struck by the inconsistency.''

   NASA on Sunday began replacing two
faulty fuel-system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in hope of
making another launch attempt as early as Friday.
   The launch of the shuttle and its $550 million Magellan Venus
probe was scrubbed on Friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of a
power surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel for
one of the shuttle's three main engines.
   Engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line that
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.
   NASA officials Sunday said they would not set a new launch date
until Monday. But they said liftoff could not occur before Friday
afternoon.
   Because of the positions of Earth and Venus, there is only a
32-day launch opportunity ``window'' for sending the Magellan
spacecraft toward Venus.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
will have to be put off for two years, at a cost of more than $100
million, until Earth and Venus are again in proper alignment.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said workers were removing foam
insulation from around both the pump and the hydrogen line and
hoped to have a new pump and a new line installed by Mondayy.
   After the parts have passed pressure, electrical and other
tests, NASA would be ready to restart the countdown, which lasts
two days.
   ``Right now we don't know when we will pick up the count,''
Malone said. ``But we feel comfortable with what we are doing.''
   Had the countdown continued on Friday, a computer to detect such
problems as fuel-line leaks would have stopped the engines from
firing and the five astronauts would have been safe, the space
agency said.
   Shuttle commander David Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe practiced
shuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and then flew to
their home base in Houston. Mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark
Lee and Norman Thagard returned to Houston on Saturday.
   Before returning for another launch attempt, the astronauts will
keep sharp by rehearsing in a simulator.
   Six hours after launch the astronauts are to release the
Magellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, propelling it on a 450-day
journey to Venus. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet and
map up to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface with
high-resolution radar.
   The images relayed to Earth could tell scientists much about the
history of Venus and why it evolved so differently from Earth.

<HEAD>Maverick Politician Launches New Party to Prevent Dictatorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party
Sunday launched a new opposition political movement with the avowed
aim of preventing a dictatorship.
   Edgar Tekere, 52, said the president leadership was ``decayed''
and he vowed to challenge President Robert Mugabe as head of state
in the next elections, which are due before April 1990.
   ``We are going to pursue one another right up to the
presidential election,'' Tekere, chairman of the newly formed
Zimbabwe Unity Movement, told a news conference.
   Tekere, who helped Mugabe establish the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union party in 1963, was fired from the 15-member
politburo and 90-strong central committee in October after lashing
out at top-level corruption and accusing fellow politicians of
weaving a personality cult around the head of state.
   ``I'm in for a war with the ruling party,'' Tekere said as he
unveiled his movement's emblem _ a black, a brown and a white hand
clasped together. ``The election battle lines are drawn.''
   Tekere admitted that the party has yet to be registered, but he
said he did not expect any problems.
   Mugabe led the white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia to
independence as black-governed Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980. He has
said Tekere was welcome to start his own political party.
   Tekere said there was an urgent need for a new party because the
ruling party's leadership was ``throughly decayed,'' the rigidly
controlled socialist orientated economy was ``close to the point of
total collapse,'' unemployment was out of control and most of the 9
million Zimbabweans had lost respect for their government.
   Tekere also expressed concern that Mugabe would go ahead next
year with his avowed aim of establishing a one-party system in
Zimbabwe, one of Africa's few democracies.
   ``The movement seeks to gain control of government by peaceful
and democratic means,'' Tekere said.
   He also issued an invitation to supporters and officials of the
ruling party and all other opposition parties regardless of their
race, tribe, religion or sex to join the movement before a congress
approves a constitution and elects leaders before the end of the
year.
   Tekere said the Zimbabwe Unity Movement would introduce a free
market economy, promote local and foreign investment and guarantee
democracy.
   ``It is time for a drift away to better leadership, a clean
leadership for the survival of our country,'' Tekere said.
   Five Cabinet ministers, a junior minister and a provincial
governor quit their posts last month after being implicated in a
racket involving black-marketeering of motor vehicles.

<HEAD>State Wants Exxon To Push Harder In Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska environmental officials said Sunday
they are frustrated by the pace of oil spill cleanup efforts in
Prince William Sound and are pressuring Exxon to be more aggressive.
   At the same time, a newspaper reported that a company Exxon
hired for the cleanup is scaling back its work force at Seward,
outside the sound.
   The giant oil company has promised to clean more than 300 miles
of shoreline in the sound by Sept. 15, but some people are
skeptical.
   Monday is Exxon's deadline for providing the state with a plan
for waste disposal and cleaning of Gulf of Alaska shorelines hit by
the drifting oil.
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24,
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil
as fishermen prepared for their upcoming seasons and migrating
animals and birds headed into the sound.
   Colleen Burgh, shoreline cleanup coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, said the company should
be experimenting with new clean-up techniques and bringing them to
the state for evaluation.
   ``We get the impression they are sitting back and waiting for us
to tell them which method to use,'' she said Sunday. ``They've been
working two weeks and they don't even have a mile clean.''
   ``They've got to get more aggressive if they're going to get the
job done,'' said Burgh.
   Asked if she was skeptical Exxon could meet its Sept. 15
deadline, Burgh said that ``using the methods I've seen to date,
I'd have to say yes.''
   In a letter to Exxon, the state said the company should examine
all cleanup methods and let state and federal agencies decide
whether they should be used. Burgh said she could envision use of
bulldozers to redo the contours of beaches in some cases.
   The state letter was addressed to Andy Teal, part of Exxon's
shoreline advisory panel. He said his company was working to make
the cleanup more efficient and had been talking with state
officials.
   ``We've had a number of discussions as to enhancing the
operations out there,'' Teal said. ``That letter came as a bit of a
surprise to me. Those discussions were already taking place.''
   He said the company was bringing in new equipment for trials.
During the weekend, crews on Smith Island experimented with the use
of increased water temperatures to remove oil, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Anchorage Daily News reported the oilfield
services company Exxon hired to carry out the cleanup is scaling
back its work force at Seward because of self-proclaimed success in
saving Resurrection Bay, outside Prince William Sound and opening
onto the Gulf of Alaska on the eastern end of the Kenai Peninsula.
   Plans called for about 100 workers in Seward to be put on
rotating schedules Sunday, working one week and taking the next off
without pay. The scheduling change by Veco International Inc. will
halve the number of people on the job on any day, the newspaper
said.
   ``We are not laying off anyone, we're putting them on
rotation,'' said Ron Rolan, general supervisor of Veco's Seward
operations.
   Exxon has said that by midsummer as many as 4,000 people will be
hired to scrub oiled shores.
   Work crews in Prince William Sound mostly have been plugging
away on Naked, Smith and Seal islands, using methods that include
wiping oil off rocks by hand, flushing beaches with cold salt water
and blasting oil with hot water.
   On heavily oiled Smith Island, workers have been inching their
way down a boulder-strewn shore toward an area seals use for
pupping.
   ``The cold water, even at high pressure, cannot get the oil
up,'' said Bill Lamoreaux, the state cleanup coordinator. ``You
have to change methods as you go.''
   The state estimates Smith Island has three miles of heavily
oiled shoreline and a half-mile of beach with moderate oil
contamination.
   There are more than 30 other islands on the cleanup list, some
with more than 50 miles of heavily oiled shoreline.
   Burgh said none of Smith Island's shoreline has been cleaned to
the state's satisfaction. ``There's an incredible amount of oil on
Smith Island. They're going to be there for a while.''

   Transport planes Sunday
repatriated thousands of refugees between Senegal and Mauritania in
an effort to halt violence between people of the neighboring
nations.
   On Sunday, 12 Mauritanians were killed in Touba, 125 miles east
of Dakar, Senegal, sources said. There were no reports of
anti-Senegalese attacks in Mauritania.
   The sporadic violence against expatriate Senegalese and
Mauritanian communities in both countries began last month in a
dispute over border land between the two west African nations. More
than 200 people are thought to have died in the fighting.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew declared Tuesday in Nouakchott remained in
effect but in Dakar, a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew failed to stop
scattered pillaging of Mauritanian shops.
   French, Spanish and Morrocan planes carried 5,000 refugees
between the capitals on Sunday, officials said on condition of
anonymity. A total of 3,000 Senegalese and 5,000 Mauritanians have
been repatriated since the airlifts began late Saturday, officials
said.
   An estimated 20,000 Mauritanians were being held under army
protection at a fairground outside Dakar, awaiting a flight home.
About 6,000-7,000 Senegalese were harbored by the Mauritanian Red
Crescent at a Nouakchott mosque and an exhibition hall.
   Nouakchott airport, surrounded by soldiers and armored vehicles,
became a virtual military base as civilian and military planes
loaded Senegalese for the trip home. Lines of refugees could be
seen walking under military escort to one of six Moroccan planes
Sunday.
   At the fairground in Dakar, customs officials and police
confiscated everything from knives to money and jewels from
Mauritanians preparing to depart, according to Agence
France-Presse. Customs officers told the French news agency they
were ordered to do so and said Senegalese leaving Mauritania were
getting the same treatment.
   Senegal President Abdou Diouf appealed late Saturday for calm
despite what he called the ``inhuman and degrading treatment'' of
Senegalese citizens in Mauritania. That was an apparent reference
to a two-day bloody outburst on Tuesday and Wednesday in which
Senegalese were said to have been mutilated by Mauritanians.
   Diouf, in a radio and television broadcast, said Mauritania
sparked the spiraling violence, which began April 9 when two
Senegalese were killed in a border dispute over grazing land.

   Ehsan Tabari, a founding member of Iran's
outlawed communist party who recanted his Marxist views after the
Islamic revolution, has died in Tehran, the official news agency
said Sunday. He was 72.
   Tabari died Saturday of heart and kidney failure and had been
hospitalized since March 16, said the Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia.
   Tabari was born in 1917 in Sari, a city in the northern
Mazandaran province and joined the communist Tudeh Party when it
was formed in 1941.
   He fled to the Soviet Union when the party was declared illegal
in 1947 and worked as an announcer for Radio Moscow. Fluent in
seven languages, he also wrote and translated poetry and did
research into linguistics, IRNA said.
   Tabari returned to Iran after the 1979 overthrow of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and was arrested in 1983 along with other
members of the Tudeh leadership on charges of spying for the Soviet
Union and plotting to overthrow Iran's fundamentalist regime.
   He admitted the charges in a television broadcast and later
published his disavowal of Marxism, IRNA said.

   West Germany on Sunday strongly denied

West German diplomats from Tehran, calling them ``diplomats
disguised as spies,'' for alleged involvement in a U.S. espionage
network.
   Schumacher refused to comment on details of the Iranian
newspaper editorial.
   West Germany recalled its ambassador from Tehran in February to
protest Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's calls for the
death of British novelist Salman Rushdie. Khomeini said Rushdie
blasphemed Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Schumacher said ``about a dozen'' embassy staff members remain
in Tehran.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced new
anti-acid-rain rules billed as the toughest in the nation, making
good a 1985 vow to implement in-state regulation if the federal
government failed to act.
   The governor made his announcement Saturday at Houghton's Pond,
one of hundreds of Massachusetts bodies of water threatened by acid
rain. New state emissions limits will take effect at the end of
1994, but plans for meeting them must be submitted by Jan. 1, 1991.
   ``We are hoping our action will encourage Congress to adopt a
tough set of national standards and will encourage other states to
take similar action,'' he said in a statement. ``The future of our
lakes, our forests and our natural resources depend on it.''
   New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin are among several states
that have already implemented acid rain regulations, but none has
as yet mandated controls as stringent as those for Massachusetts,
officials said.
   Acid rain is caused by combustion of fossil fuels in power
plants and motor vehicles, which release sulfur and nitrogren
oxides into the air.
   About 25 percent of acid rain in Massachusetts comes from
in-state sources with the remainder coming from the Midwest and
other sources, according to government figures.
   The new program includes limits on sulphur dioxide emissions
from 168 factories and power plants in Massachusetts.
   Officials predict it should result in an annual reduction of
between 68,000 and 87,000 tons of sulphur dioxide emissions _ about
a 20 percent to 25 percent cut in the 370,000 tons of sulphur
dioxide currently emmitted from all sources in Massachusetts.
   The program gives companies several options in reducing
pollution. They can conserve energy, switch to natural gas or
cleaner fuels, or earn credits by making greater reductions in one
part of their operation while leaving another part dirtier than
otherwise allowed.
   Studies have shown 185 Massachusetts rivers, ponds and streams
are already acidified and 800 more bodies of water will be affected
in the next 40 years unless action is taken to curb emissions,
officials said.
   Environmentalists hailed the new regulations.
   ``This represents a landmark victory for the environment and
public health,'' said Jenny Carter, environmental attorney for the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   A spokesman for Boston Edison Co., one of the state's largest
utilities, said the impact the new restrictions was not yet clear.
   ``We knew it was coming down but it's a little too early to
assess the impact on Edison,'' Bill Connolly said. ``We'll have to
wait and see.''

   Six U.S. military experts returned to
Bangkok on Sunday after working with Vietnamese officials to
resolve the fates of missing American soldiers, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Ross Petzing, said the experts divided into two
teams and searched areas of southern Vietnam, but he had no details
of the findings.
   Petzing said they had arrived in Vietnam on April 12 with a
four-man forensic team.
   While the six experts journeyed south for the search, the
forensic team stayed in the capital of Hanoi to examine remains
that the Vietnamese earlier found. The forensic team left Vietnam
on April 22.
   It was the fifth joint investigation aimed at resolving the
fates of 1,730 Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
Previous joint investigations were limited to about 10 days each.
   During the projects, the investigators interview villagers who
witnessed crashes of U.S. warplanes.
   On Thursday, Vietnam returned 21 sets of remains that it
believes may be those of missing Americans. U.S. military personnel
picked up the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi airport and flew them
to Honolulu for analysis.
   That brought to 184 the number of remains Vietnam has returned
since August 1987, when it agreed to speed up work on the issue in
exchange for Washington's help in encouraging private humanitarian
aid to Vietnam.

   Violence from opponents of expanded fishing
rights for Indians will not be allowed, an official warned Sunday,
following seven arrests as crowds gathered to throw rocks and taunt
spearfishers.
   ``We won't tolerate any type of physical abuse like rock
throwing,'' Department of Natural Resources spokesman John Nelson
said. ``We have been tolerating the verbal stuff because people
have a right to their opinion, but that does not extend to the area
of physical violence.''
   Police in riot gear have patrolled boat landings on the northern
lakes where Chippewa Indians are spearfishing under the guarantee
of 19th century treaties. Through Saturday, 67 demonstrators had
been arrested since the tribal fishing season began April 23.
   The seven arrested Saturday night included four accused of
rock-throwing at North Twin Lake, where a crowd estimated at 1,000
people gathered in light snow. No injuries were reported.
   Nelson said protesters have thrown rocks in isolated incidents
in the past but never to the degree that occurred Saturday night.
   Crowds of more than 100 people have gathered at many lakes at
night when Chippewa fishermen use lights and multipronged spears to
take walleyed pike and other fish from northern Wisconsin lakes.
   It is the fifth year that Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands have
spearfished since a federal court ruled the tribe retained the
right to gather food off reservation under treaties that ceded much
of northern Wisconsin to the federal government.
   Treaty rights opponents object to rules that allow tribal
fishermen different fishing methods and seasons than non-Indian
sportsmen. The critics particularly oppose the spears, which are
more efficient than the traditional rod and reel.
   In Boulder Junction on Saturday, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson told
business leaders and treaty rights opponents he'll do everything
possible ``to reduce the suffering and turmoil'' over Indian
spearfishing.
   ``I know every one of you are completely upset,'' Thompson said.
``You're very emotional so am I and I'm very sorry about the
situation.''
   The governor unveiled a multimillion-dollar plan to boost
northern Wisconsin tourism and address business concerns about the
economic effects of spearfishing, including efforts to stock more
pike in northern lakes and to press for a compromise with the
Chippewa.
   In the disturbance at North Twin Lake, about 30 rocks showered
from the crowd Saturday night as one of eight tribal boats entered
the water, said George Meyer, a natural resources department
administrator.
   Most arrests were for disorderly conduct, but one protester who
was on the lake with a boat was arrested on charges he harassed a
spearer by creating a hazardous wake, Nelson said.

<HEAD>Disney In Copyright Spats With Day Care Center, Restaurant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mickey Mouse is up to his ears in
contention, with his copyright owners suing and being sued over
infringement and a children's center here being told to remove
cartoon characters from its walls.
   People from across the nation have expressed outrage that Walt
Disney Productions ordered the day-care center to remove paintings
of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy from the outside
walls of the school, but the company remains firm in its position.
   Support for the day-care center has come from a Phoenix, Ariz.,
grandmother, a New York doctor, a Mississippi beauty shop owner and
the creator of a Saturday morning cartoon television show, an
official said.
   ``I've gotten so many telephone calls from people angry at
Disney that I bet Walt Disney is turning over in his grave right
now,'' said Erica Scotti, executive director of the Very Important
Babies Daycare.
   Disney officials said the school is violating copyright laws and
they want the popular cartoons removed in one month. The company
also has ordered the characters removed at two other Hallandale
day-care centers, Good Godmother's Daycare and Temple Messianique.
   ``The calls have been from people who apparently don't
understand the American copyright,'' said Disney spokesman Chuck
Champlin. He expressed concern that the public would think the
schools were sponsored by Disney.
   Meanwhile in Orlando, Brown Derby Inc., the Ohio-based
restaurant chain, filed a federal lawsuit against Walt Disney Co.
alleging trademark infringement, the day after Disney filed a
similar suit against 75 merchants in the Chicago area.
   The suit filed Thursday accuses Disney with unauthorized use of
the Brown Derby name at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park.
   Disney's signature eatery at the studio's theme park, the
Hollywood Brown Derby, opens at Disney's new attraction Monday.
Disney claims its restaurant pays homage to the famous eatery once
located at Hollywood and Vine streets and has nothing to do with
the chain.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Orlando, seeks $25
million in damages. In Burbank, Calif., Disney spokesman Tom Deegan
said it is Disney policy not to comment on lawsuits.
   ``It surprises me,'' said Brown Derby Inc. lawyer David
Rosenzweig, ``that a company that reveres and recognizes the
importance of its trademarks would do this, but I suppose it
happens.''
   Rosenzweig said the Cleveland company has used the Brown Derby
name at its restaurants across the nation for more than 50 years.
He said the name has been on the chain's restaurants in Florida for
more than 15 years.
   Rosenzweig did acknowledge there has never been a connection
between Brown Derby Inc. and the Original Brown Derby restaurant _
a Hollywood, Calif., landmark in the 1930s and 1940s.
   In an unrelated case, Disney filed its own suit Wednesday
charging the 75 Chicago-area merchants were selling merchandise
bearing the unauthorized likenesses of Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
Goofy and Roger Rabbit.
   On March 31, Disney sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences on March 31, charging that the academy used Disney's Snow
White character without permission at its annual Academy Awards
show. The academy apologized and promised not to use the characters
again without Disney's permission, and the suit was dropped.

<HEAD>The Shoreham License: Symbol of Nuclear Rebirth or Industry Failure?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shoreham nuclear power plant is about to
have its plug pulled without generating a usable kilowatt for Long
Island, but that didn't stop the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from
giving an operating license to the controversial reactor.
   The commission acted with full knowledge the Long Island
Lighting Co. is hoping to rid itself of the $5.5 billion albatross
in exchange for life-sustaining rate hikes and a
multibillion-dollar tax writeoff.
   Some industry-watchers have called awarding the license the
NRC's last, best attempt to salvage anything from a plant whose
name connotes everything cited as going wrong with the nuclear
power industry _ construction delays, fraud, huge cost overruns,
safety problems and endless federal red tape.
   Others hailed it as evidence of a pumped-up NRC, which, backed
by the new administration, will shepherd in a new nuclear age.
   And some said it was an attempt by the NRC to deflect pointing
fingers when Shoreham is laid to rest and Long Islanders experience
their next brownout.
   ``I think the NRC did not want to be blamed for having a corpse
on its own doorstep,'' said James Schlesinger, energy secretary in
the Carter administration, now an analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech has declined to interpret the
commission's action, or to concede that Shoreham's license may have
been the culmination of a long, expensive and ultimately academic
exercise.
   ``We have acted, in my view, very responsibly,'' Zech said April
20, after the commission voted 4-0 to award the license. ``We
wouldn't authorize it to operate if we didn't think it could
operate and if we didn't think it could operate safely.''
   Shoreham's orchestrated demise cannot be completed until LILCO
shareholders sign the death warrant, which they are expected to do
in a vote sometime in mid-June. Last year, the shareholders
approved a buyout, but that deal crumbled when the state
legislature refused to do likewise by a Dec. 1 deadline.
   The next step will be for a state agency to buy the plant for a
symbolic dollar and the New York Power Authority would oversee its
decommissioning and dismantling. In return, LILCO gets annual rate
hikes of approximately 5 percent for a decade, keeping the utility
afloat and guaranteeing Long Island the highest electric rates in
the country.
   But Zech has intimated that the transfer of Shoreham's license
may not be a foregone conclusion, saying the action ``would be a
very formal process,'' complete with hearings and public comment.
   One government agency expected to offer its opinion is the
Department of Energy, which lately has been threatening to create
roadblocks to the transfer.
   However, Schlesinger said the current energy secretary, James
Watkins, has no power to stop it.
   ``He can register his views with the NRC but I think the NRC
appears to have charted its course,'' Schlesinger said.
   Peter Bradford, New York Public Service Commission chairman and
former chairman of the NRC, also discounted DOE's clout in the
Shoreham case.
   Indisputably, the Shoreham case and similar problems at the
Seabrook, N.H. plant drove the NRC to reclaim powers it had
sacrificed to the states after the accident at Three Mile Island on
March 28, 1979.
   When the state and local governments blocked the Shoreham and
Seabrook licenses by refusing to participate in emergency planning,
the NRC changed its regulations. Thus, Shoreham is the first plant
to be licensed based on a utility-created evacuation plan which
assumes that in the event of an emergency, state and local
authorities will cooperate.
   The NRC also streamlined the process for getting a reactor built
and started, passing a regulation that would allow the NRC to award
an operating license at the same time as it approves plant
construction. Part of that ruling also calls for the
standardization of plant design.
   But no utility has ordered a nuclear plant since 1978, and all
those ordered after 1974 have been canceled.
   ``Those rule changes are a complete waste of time,'' said
Bradford. ``Nuclear power's fundamental problem right now is that
it just can't compete economically with the other supply sources
and conservation and in the bidding systems that more and more
states are looking to screen their power supply in the future.''
   But Loring Mills, vice president for nuclear activity at the
Edison Electric Institute, a utilities trade association, predicted
a nuclear renaissance, with the next nuclear plant order coming
sometime between 1994 and 1999.
   Kenneth Alvin Solomon, a nuclear scientist with the Rand Corp.,
a California-based think tank, predicted a turnaround in the
nuclear industry, ``hopefully, in my lifetime.''
   ``The alternatives to nuclear reactors are not necessarily all
that attractive all the time,'' he said. ``Oil plants, coal plants,
have pollution. Oil is something that we have to depend on other
countries for, so there's a whole series of reasons that I see the
picture getting better.''

<HEAD>Stores to Put Some Baby Food Back on Shelves After Check</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supermarket chain said Sunday it will resume
selling canned baby food of the two leading brands because it found
no tampering in a check of its stock following a contamination
scare.
   However, the Tesco company's 375 stores will keep glass jars of
baby food made by H.J. Heinz Co. and Cow and Gate Ltd. off their
shelves while police continue investigating more than 300 reports
of contamination, the retailer said.
   Boot's, a drugstore chain with more than 1,000 stores, and the
Asda food chain also have stopped selling glass jars of the two
brands of baby food.
   Reports of taintings with glass shards, pieces of razor blades
and caustic soda first surfaced April 7. Most reports involved
Heinz or Cow and Gate baby food, but several were in other brands.
   Police said most of the reports of contamination were mistakes,
hoaxes, or copycat crimes. Scotland Yard, which is coordinating the
national inquiry, said several arrests have been made.
   Two cases, one involving caustic soda and another involving
broken razor blades, have been tied to an extortionist who demanded
up to $1.7 million from the Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., police
said.
   John Aspery, a British spokesman for Heinz, said the company has
confirmed five cases of contamination, all involving glass jars.
Two of them are the work of the extortionist, he said.
   Heinz and Cow and Gate are the top-selling brands of baby food
in Britain.
   Officials at Heinz say their company sells 80 million jars and
90 million cans of baby food in Britain each year. Aspery said the
contamination scare had cost Heinz ``a considerable amount'' in
lost sales, but he said the exact amount was still being calculated.
   Heinz has announced it is destroying its stock and introducing
new tamper-proof packaging as soon as possible.
   Tesco withdrew jars and cans of Heinz and Cow and Gate baby food
from its shelves Friday. It said it checked them all and found them
intact.
   The contamination scare has spread to the United States, where
three grocery stores in Springfield, Ill. removed Heinz baby food
products from their shelves after a woman reported finding straight
pins in jars of the food.
   Heinz spokesman Harry Carroll said it was an isolated incident.
   Police said it could be the work of a copycat provoked by
reports of the British scare.

   Americans marked 200 years of the presidency
Sunday with a re-enactment of George Washington's inauguration, a
tribute from his 40th successor, prayers for a few more stable
centuries and, of course, a parade.
   ``It was Washington's vision, his balance, his integrity, that
made the presidency possible,'' President Bush told a crowd outside
Federal Hall National Memorial, in lower Manhattan, after actors
re-enacted the first president's inauguration in 1789. The building
is an 1842 structure on the site of the original hall.
   As he finished his speech, hundreds of red, white and blue
balloons were released into the sky from behind Federal Hall, and
multicolored confetti, streamers and even flowers rained down from
30 stories up in neighboring skyscrapers.
   Bush earlier prayed in Washington's pew and stood beside a
Washington stand-in during the re-enactment of the oath-taking,
which climaxed a week of festivities in New York from fireworks to
symposiums, and in a sense, ended 13 years of bicentennial bashes
that began in 1976.
   After the ceremony, Bush and the first lady, Barbara, briefly
took their place in an inaugural parade, but headed off to the
heliport at the end of Wall Street.
   That left the parade to the other George, as portrayed by actor
William Sommerfield, who gestured grandly to the crowds that lined
Broadway.
   The parade was a thumping, blaring stream of military bands,
fife and drum corps and marchers in colonial dress. Bands from all
four military service branches marched _ a first, organizers said _
along with a police bagpipe band and a kazoo band.
   ``It's so easy to take for granted that we have a democracy,''
said one of the onlookers, Chris McCarthy, 29, of New York.
``Something like this drives home the fact that we've had it for so
long.''
   ``There is a sense of history _ the Constitution lives,'' said
Joan Marshall-Dutcher of King of Prussia, Pa., whose husband, David
Dutcher, played Washington's aide in the re-enactment.
   The day began with a service at St. Paul's Chapel of Trinity
Church, where the Bushes sat in the pew used by Washington after
his inauguration, held when New York City was the nation's capital.
In his sermon, Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore reflected on the
nation's future as well as its past.
   ``It was a review of the events that got us here, but also about
the people left out _ those with AIDS or crippled by poverty and
ignorance, for example,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. ``It
was very moving.''
   A huge stadium-style television screen alongside the red, white
and blue platform gave viewers close-ups of the ceremony, in which
Sommerfield, as Washington, solemnly took the oath of office,
laying his hand on the same Bible used in 1789.
   Sommerfield then delivered excerpts from Washington's Inaugural
Address, which in reality was not spoken to the crowd but to
Congress inside the hall.
   Sunday's clear weather contrasted to the heavy overcast
Saturday, when smallish crowds watched a flotilla of ships in the
afternoon _ including the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal _ and
partially fogged-in fireworks at night.

   Four people, including an infant, were
killed when their small plane crashed and burst into flames in a
rural, mountainous region, authorities said Sunday.
   One passenger, a young girl, survived the crash, said Richard
Coughlin, chief investigator for the Lumpkin County sheriff's
department. She was listed in stable condition Sunday at St.
Joseph's Hospital in Dahlonega, Coughlin said.
   The names of the victims were being withheld pending
notification of their families.
   The plane, a single-engine Beechcraft, was en route to Lumpkin
County from Griffin when it crashed on Gooch Mountain about 9 a.m.
Saturday, Coughlin said.
   Coughlin said county authorities, along with the Civil Air
Patrol and the U.S. Forest Service, were not able to reach the
crash site until 12:30 a.m. Sunday.
   ``We know that the weather conditions on yesterday morning were
poor, but we cannot attribute the crash to the weather,'' he said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.

   President Bush on Sunday retraced the inaugural
steps of another president named George who took the oath two
centuries ago that cemented him in history as ``the father of our
country.''
   Participating in celebrations of the 200th anniversary of George
Washington's inauguration as the first U.S. president, Bush said
his forbearer ``established a precedent for 40 presidents to
follow.''
   ``It was Washington's vision, his balance, his integrity, that
made the presidency possible,'' Bush told a gathering outside the
Federal Hall National Memorial, an 1842 structure built on the site
of the original hall where Washington was sworn in on April 30,
1789.
   The 41st president reflected on the ``awesome prospect'' that
faced Washington on that day.
   ``How unlikely it must have seemed then, that we might become
United States. How uncertain, that a republic could be hewn out of
the wilderness of competing interests,'' Bush said. ``But George
Washington defined and shaped this office.''
   Bush said Washington ``created a living, functioning
government'' based on the Constitution. ``He brought together men
of genius _ a team of giants, with strong and competing views. He
harnessed and directed their energies.''
   On a day awash with historical symbolism, Bush sat in the church
pew where Washington prayed on that first Inauguration Day, trod
the steps of Federal Hall where the first president took his oath,
and waved goodbye to an actor recreating the departure of a newly
inaugurated President Washington.
   The ceremony ended with a rain of brightly colored confetti and
fresh carnations cascading from nearby office towers onto the crowd.
   Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people from behind a
glass wall on the Federal Hall steps, Bush seemed not to notice a
handful of protesters who waved signs reading ``We demand health
care,'' and chanted ``100 days and nothing done, what about AIDS?''
   Bush spoke of Washington's dedication to service and repeated
his own often-stated call for Americans to follow that calling
today.
   ``Today we seek a new engagement in the lives of others,
believing that success is not measured by the sum of our
possessions, our positions, or our professions, but by the good we
do for others,'' he said.
   Bush and his wife Barbara, joined by their daughter Doro LeBlond
and Bush's brother Jonathan Bush, began their day in New York with
church services at St. Paul's Chapel, where Washington attended
services on his Inauguration Day.
   The Episcopal service, which featured several hymns and readings
and ended with the singing of ``America the Beautiful,'' was
attended by about 250 people.
   At the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, where Federal Hall is
dwarfed by the financial district's skyscrapers, Bush was joined at
the podium by New York Mayor Ed Koch and the state's U.S. senators
_ Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato _ and by former
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger.
   Koch, a Democrat, remarked on the name shared by the first
president and the current Republican resident of the White House.
``From George to George, there's no one like George,'' he said.
   Moynihan, commenting on the move of the national capital from
New York to Washington, noted that Washington at the time was
mostly a swamp along the Potomac River.
   But, joked Moynihan, ``Malaria had a calming influence on the
city of Washington.''
   The ceremony attended by Bush included a enactment of
Washington's swearing in by actors in colonial costume standing in
front of the large statue of Washington on the Federal Hall steps.
   ``George Washington'' rode up in a horse drawn carriage,
recreating the first president's arrival after a week-long journey
from his home at Mount Vernon, Va., on the Potomac River.
   After the actor recited Washington's oath of office and made
brief comments, he strode grandly to a waiting carriage doffing his
three-corner hat to the crowd. The Bushes cheerily waved goodbye as
his carriage drove off.
   Other bicentennial activities _ that did not include
participation by Bush _ were a boat flotilla in New York Harbor, a
fireworks display Saturday night, and a President's Ball Sunday
night.

   City officials plan to broaden an
investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings and his
ties to a city-funded task force that hired his daughter,
newspapers reported Sunday.
   Investigators have interviewed some city officials as many as
eight times about the newly re-elected mayor's links to Far East
National Bank, and in coming weeks will examine his relationships
with Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association and the task force,
the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   The newspaper cited unidentified sources in City Attorney James
Hahn's office.
   Hahn is expected to testify Wednesday before the City Council's
Governmental Operations Committee on the status of his
investigation.
   ``We will subpoena everyone involved if we have to,'' said
Councilman Nate Holden, who came close to forcing Bradley into a
runoff in the April 11 election.
   Bradley will not comment until Hahn's investigation is
completed, said Bill Chandler, a mayoral spokesman.
   During appearances Saturday, Bradley refused to discuss
allegations that he was paid to serve on the boards of Far East and
Valley Federal while they did business with the city.
   The mayor also denied knowledge that his daughter, Phyllis
Bradley, 43, was hired by the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles
Relations.
   ``I knew nothing about it, had nothing to do with it,'' Bradley
said. ``She's entitled to conduct her own life and to seek her
employment wherever she wishes.''
   Bradley's daughter was a task force secretary for almost 10
months in 1985 and 1986, said Chandler.
   The task force, which works to improve African business and
cultural ties with the city, is headed by Juanita St. John, with
whom Bradley has real estate investments, the Times said.
   At least twice since 1985, Bradley has intervened to ensure
funding of about $98,000 a year for the task force, despite City
Council objections, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner reported Sunday.
   Hahn, and reportedly the Police Department, are also looking
into Bradley's advisory work for Far East, which earned him $18,000.
   Far East President Henry Hwang told the Los Angeles Times in an
interview Friday that Bradley was the only one of 46 bank advisory
board members who was paid. He said Bradley was considered helpful
to the bank on foreign trade issues.
   Bradley has denied knowing that the bank was doing business with
the city at the time he served as a consultant.
   The mayor, who resigned from the advisory board last December,
said he was unaware of the bank's municipal ties until the issue
was raised during his re-election campaign last month. He has since
returned the $18,000.
   But court documents indicated he made at least two inquiries to
city departments on behalf of the bank last year.
   Bradley also received at least $150,000 while serving on the
board of directors of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association.

   George Bush's administration has just begun, but
Texas universities and his alma mater, Yale, already are squaring
off for the chance to be the home of his presidential library.
   It has the trappings of any good political fight: cities
battling for prestige and a piece of history _ not to mention
revenues from an estimated 400,000 annual tourists. In Bush's case,
the battle is all the more interesting since he has divided
loyalties and familial ties.
   Bush was born in Massachusetts and educated in Connecticut, but
has claimed Texas as home for more than 40 years. That opens the
bidding among several of Texas' finest and Bush's Ivy League alma
mater, Yale.
   ``He's spoken on the campus many times. We just feel that this
is very much a part of his home,'' said Mimi Crossley, a
spokeswoman for Rice University in Houston. Bush has had a ``long
history of involvement'' with Rice, she said, mentioning a
one-semester teaching job he held in 1978 and friendship he has
with Rice officials and supporters.
   Besides, she said, Rice promotes its academic excellence _ only
fitting for a president's papers.
   But so does Yale.
   Jack Siggins, Yale's deputy librarian, said that about four
years ago a Yale professor contacted then-Vice President Bush about
donating his papers to the New Haven, Conn., school, where Bush
graduated in 1948. ``He didn't make a commitment,'' Siggins said.
   Shortly after the November election, Yale repeated its offer,
and the Texas universities chimed in. Both Rice and University of
Houston representatives have written letters to Bush about being
the library site, but Texas A&amp;M is mounting the most ambitious
offensive.
   A&amp;M grad Michel Halbouty, a longtime Bush friend, broached the
matter to Bush after the election, and last week A&amp;M announced a
detailed battle plan to capture the library, including a steering
committee to prepare the bid and the enlistment of graduate
students to help design the building.
   ``I'm flattered (at A&amp;M's interest) and it may be what I want to
do,'' Bush recently told Newsweek. ``The idea has great appeal to
me.''
   But he also cited Rice as a ``logical'' location. At any rate,
he said, ``It's a little premature, but I want Texas to be the
recipient.''
   Both Rice and Houston are touting their Houston location over
the A&amp;M Aggies site at College Station, about 80 miles northwest of
Houston. But A&amp;M officials say College Station lies equidistant
from several metropolitan areas, which would allow it to draw at
least 500,000 visitors a year.
   William McKenzie, chairman of A&amp;M's board of regents, made
another point, saying in a news release that Texas A&amp;M is
``philisophically'' compatible with the conservative Bush.
   Back East, Yale isn't sitting on its hands. Siggins said the
university will quietly pursue the Bush library with the force of
persuasive logic.
   Among other selling points, Yale has a region in which Bush's
family goes back for centuries, impressive collections and scholars
and experience at finding donations.
   ``Let me just say that there's a lot of time. A lot of things
can happen,'' Siggins said. ``You never can tell.''

   A 15-year-old
Palestinian-American pleaded innocent Sunday to charges of
stone-throwing, three months after he was arrested and held without
bail.
   Puerto Rico-born Mansour Abed Al-Samad stood before a three-man
military tribunal and denied charges that on Jan. 23 he helped
erect roadblocks and threw stones at an Israeli army patrol in the
West Bank village of Surda, 13 miles north of Jerusalem.
   The troops shot in the air and chased after the youth. No one
was wounded in the incident and only Samad was caught by the
soldiers.
   Since the beginning of the 14-month-old Palestinian uprising,
more than 20,000 Palestinians, many of them youths like Samad, have
been detained and have faced military trials for throwing stones or
similar crimes.
   The violence has killed 456 Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   Sunday's hearing was the first time Samad appeared in court
since his arrest three months ago. He received two trial dates in
March but the army failed to bring him to the court, giving no
explanation.
   Samad's attorney, Ahmed Sayyad, said he wanted to request bail
but could not because he had to bring his client, who was not
permitted to leave prison.
   Sayyad said he does not expect his client will receive special
treatment because of his U.S. citizenship.
   A representative from the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem visited
Samad while he was imprisoned and a consular official was present
at the trial.
   Samad, wearing faded blue-jeans and a dusty demin jacket, walked
into the courthouse Sunday morning, handcuffed and flanked by two
Israeli soldiers carrying Uzi submachine guns.
   As the soldiers removed Samad's steel handcuffs, his mother
burst into tears and his six-year-old brother ran towards him to
hug him. The soldiers stood aside for a few minutes before
escorting Samad to the prisoner's dock.
   Samad pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. He said he
was walking to the market when the incident occured and was
arrested by soldiers who mistakenly thought he was involved in the
stone-throwing.
   The verdict and sentencing are both expected this Thursday.
Samad faces three to 10 months if convicted.
   Samad was born in Puerto Rico and moved with his mother to her
native village of Surda in 1983.
   The U.S. Consulate said about 7,000 American-Palestinians live
in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, both captured
by Israel in 1967.

Actors Laboratory on Melrose Avenue.
   Among his productions was ``Matka,'' which he staged in 1983 at
the Cast at the Safe Harbor theater.
   Earlier, Dudarew-Ossetynski performed on stages throughout the
United States and Canada and directed several Off Broadway plays.
   His movie credits included ``Walk Don't Run,'' ``The Man in the
Glass Booth'' and ``Alias Mike Fury.''

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have dropped a grand jury
investigation into whether pioneering transplant surgeon Thomas
Starzl gave high-paying foreigners preferential treatment at two
hospitals here.
   The Justice Department told the Philadelphia office of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services in a letter Friday that
investigators had decided not to bring a case against Starzl, said
Judy Holtz, spokeswoman for the social agency's inspector general's
office.
   ``We have no other comment,'' she said.
   The investigation, which lasted nearly three years, followed a
Pulitzer Prize-winning series of reports by The Pittsburgh Press on
transplants by surgical teams headed by Starzl.
   Starzl, the chief of transplantation at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine and head of transplant programs at
Presbyterian-University and Children's hospitals, said his
reputation and that of the hospitals had been cleared.
   ``It's just a clean bill of health,'' he said.
   However, the surgeon said he did not feel vindicated by the
government's action. ``I never really felt beleaguered by the whole
thing, because I knew the stories weren't true,'' he said.
   Madelyn Ross, managing editor of The Pittsburgh Press, defended
the newspaper's series.
   ``It's not a newspaper's job to determine criminality. That's
somebody else's job like the U.S. attorney, and I can't speak for
what his investigation turned up.
   ``But I can speak for what The Pittsburgh Press research showed,
and it showed a clear and demonstrable inequity in the transplant
system. We stand by that information.''
   According to the newspaper's 1985 report, medical records showed
that about 28 percent of the transplants by Starzl's team from
January 1984 to May 1985 were for foreigners who often were not as
ill or had not waited as long as other patients on waiting lists.
   The Press found that foreigners who received kidneys paid four
times more in surgeon's fees than Americans who got the same
operations.
   The federal grand jury began taking secret testimony in August
1986.
   Health and Human Services Inspector General Richard Kusserow had
asked officials to investigate whether a Pittsburgh center violated
the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits selling organs
for profit.
   Kusserow had not named which hospital or surgeon was being
investigated until Friday.
   In its transplant series, the Press said the Starzl team
bypassed hospital policy to ensure that foreign patients received
kidney transplants quickly.
   The policy said donor organs should go ``to locals first,
hard-to-match patients second and then, foreign nationals,'' former
chief of surgery Dr. Henry Bahnson told the newspaper in 1985.
   Following the newspaper's report, transplant surgeons under
Starzl said they would allocate only 5 percent of the slots on
kidney waiting lists to foreigners.
   The hospitals also established an adivsory committee to review
how patients are selected for transplants and designed a point
system that assigns priorities to waiting patients.
   Starzl said Friday that one of the reasons foreigners were
billed differently than U.S. citizens was that they didn't medical
and private insurance.
   ``I'm not a bill collector, and that whole part of the operation
does not concern me,'' he said. ``I am not in a fee-for-service
business.''

   Two Cabinet ministers demanded Sunday that
Jewish settlers be allowed to shoot more freely in clashes with
Palestinians, and Arab reports said a settler shot a 10-year-old
girl in the head as protesters stoned his car.
   The Palestinian youngster, the second reportedly shot by
settlers in the last three days, was hospitalized in fair condition.
   In the West Bank town of El Bireh, the Israeli-appointed mayor
said he was withdrawing his resignation after being asked to do so
by the military government.
   Hassan Tawil, 72, resigned Saturday after arsonists set the door
of his house on fire. He also had been stabbed and wounded in the
chest by a Palestinian on June 7.
   Pro-PLO leaders of the 14-month-old Palestinian uprising have
repeatedly urged Israeli-appointed officials to resign. At least 40
Palestinians alleged to have collaborated with Israel are among the
Arab victims of the uprising.
   The violence, which began in Dec. 1987, has killed 456
Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   The increasing tensions between Palestinians and settlers in the
occupied territories was debated Sunday by the Cabinet. Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin rejected calls that settlers be allowed
freer use of firearms.
   But Rabin also warned the army may have to take harsher measures
against Palestinians unless they accept Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's offer of elections in the occupied territories as a step
toward ending the uprising.
   ``Whoever will oppose the idea of elections ... will force us to
realize that there's no chance to sit around the negotiating table.
Therefore we will have to use more force to put down the violence
in the territories,'' Rabin told reporters.
   Avner Shaki of the National Religious Party, a Cabinet minister
without portfolio, and Transport Minister Moshe Katzav of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc demanded that settlers be allowed to fire
weapons whenever they are the target of stonings.
   ``A rock should be seen as a weapon, like a firebomb, a knife, a
bullet or a bomb. The people of the uprising see rocks as a way of
clearing us out,'' of the occupied territories, Shaki told Israel
television. He proposed that Israel create a ``settler police.''
   But Rabin and other ministers rejected changing self-defense
rules, which allow settlers to fire at stone-throwers only in
life-threatening situations.
   ``They have all the right to defend themselves ... but they
don't have and will not have responsibility for imposing law and
order in the territories,'' Rabin said.
   The Cabinet debate followed the arrest Saturday of a 52-year-old
Jewish settler from Kiryat Arba in the West Bank in the fatal
shooting of a 14-year-old Palestinian boy in nearby Hebron.
   The settler, Chaim Ben-Lulu, said he fired into the air Friday
to free himself from several dozen Arab youths who ambushed his car
with stones, Israeli news reports said.
   Ben-Lulu, brought to Hebron Sunday to re-enact the shooting, was
stoned again, along with police and troops, Israel radio said. It
said soldiers fired in the air to disperse the Palestinians.
   Also in Hebron, a settler whose car was being stoned shot
10-year-old Arij Adnan Natshe in the head, Arab reports said. The
army said it was checking the report.
   The girl was in fair condition at Hebron's Ahli Hospital, an
official there said, adding that the girl appeared to have been
shot from a distance of 200 yards.
   During the night, settlers demonstrated in front of military
government headquarters in Hebron to protest increased stoning
attacks.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Sunday, an Arab Israeli doctor reportedly involved in talks
with Palestinians said Israel may free some Palestinian prisoners
in exchange for an Israeli soldier's body.
   Dr. Ahmed Tibi said in a telephone interview, ``From the
Palestinian side, there is one body. Israel has to exchange
something for this body and will do so, I think.''
   He declined to give details, but the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Ahronot said the body was that of Samir Assad, a Druse sergeant
captured in April 1983 in south Lebanon.
   Rabin denied the report, and an army spokesman refused comment.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson encouraged striking coal
miners Sunday to continue non-violent civil disobedience to force
concessions from Virginia's biggest coal company, saying ``we will
not surrender.''
   ``This is a great moment in which we have come together,''
Jackson told about 10,000 Pittston Coal Group workers and United
Mine Workers union supporters who flooded the Wise County
Fairgrounds.
   ``The tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and John L. Lewis have
come together,'' Jackson said, referring to the slain civil rights
leader and the militant former UMW president. ``The spirit cannot
be defeated.''
   The two-time Democratic presidential candidate wore a camouflage
outfit, which strikers have adopted as a uniform to make themselves
harder to identify.
   About 1,700 UMW members went on strike April 5 against Pittston,
Virginia's largest coal company, after working without a contract
for 14 months.
   Last week, the strikers began blocking roads and entrances to
mines and a coal processing plant. The non-violent strategy has led
to 1,182 arrests, an impromptu rally that sealed off a downtown
area and a walkout by 220 students at two local high schools.
   UMW president Richard Trumka on Sunday promised to keep the
strike going.
   ``We're exercising our right to strike, to protect our families
and we will not go back,'' Trumka said as rain poured onto the
fairgrounds.
   Minutes later, as Jackson was about to speak, the rain stopped.
   In addition to strikers and their families, the rally drew UMW
members from around the region and members of other unions. About
7,000 people packed the fairgrounds, and another 3,000 listened to
speeches through loudspeakers outside. A few sheriff's deputies and
state troopers monitored the rally and directed traffic.
   Earlier, Jackson addressed an overflow crowd of about 350 people
at First Baptist Church in Big Stone Gap, about 30 miles southwest
of here.
   ``You're fighting for your jobs, for worker safety. ... You're
in pain but do not panic,'' Jackson said. ``We don't know how long
the strike will last, but we will not surrender.
   ``We do not want any violence, but we do want job security and
justice,'' he said.
   The union has accused Pittston officials of acting unfairly
during contract talks and trying to break the UMW by refusing to
negotiate in good faith.
   Pittston officials have denied those accusations, and have said
the contract proposed by the UMW, which the other major eastern
coal producers have signed, would threaten the company's stability.
   The major sticking points in the talks are pension and health
benefits, according to UMW officials.
   Trumka said the UMW would continue following its civil
disobedience strategy next week. He said it would continue beyond
the Virginia coal fields, but refused to be more specific.
   Jackson and Trumka said they would soon visit Japan to ask steel
industry officials there to stop buying Pittston coal until the
strike is settled. Pittston is the largest U.S. supplier of
metallurgic coal to Japan, Trumka said.
   Trumka also said that the UMW had formed a coalition with the
Australian Confederation of Mine Workers, and that Australian coal
company officials had agreed not to fill Japanese orders not filled
by Pittston.

reduced a 13,000-acre forest fire near the Georgia border to only a
few smoldering hot spots Sunday afternoon, fire officials said.
   ``We were lucky the storm moved right over us and rained hard
for about 20 minutes,'' said Florida Division of Forestry spokesman
Bill Scaramellino. ``But there's still a chance things can flare
back up.''
   About 200 firefighters and 41 bulldozers remained on the scene
to watch the hot spots that remained from the fire, which doubled
in size Saturday after shifting winds drove an 80-foot high wall
flames northward toward State Road 2.
   The firefighters, including 40 members of a specially trained
squad from the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas, succeeded in
stopping flames from spreading northward Saturday night, ending the
threat to virgin pine land and the Okefenokee Swamp across the
border in Georgia.
   The firefighters used bulldozers and two tank-like vehicles with
wider treads to penetrate the watery parts of the swamp.
Helicopters and planes were also being used to control the blaze,
said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Don Bolinger.
   State forestry division spokesman Kurt Stoughton said the fire
had spread earlier in the week because of dry, hot weather and
windy conditions.
   The land was in open, wooded areas past Pinhook Swamp, a
newly-acquired section of the national forest about 23 miles
northeast of Lake City. The land is almost unpopulated. No serious
injuries have been reported.
   The fire, reported Wednesday, apparently started when the
transmission in a log-moving vehicle used in commercial timber
operations broke down and ignited woods just outside the national
forest.

   A man freed from jail under a court order to
relieve overcrowding was behind bars within an hour of his release
on charges of attempted armed robbery.
   Ronnie Fisher, 30, was released from the Fulton County Jail at
9:40 p.m. Friday, according to Lt. John Eubanks, assistant watch
commander at the jail.
   Thirty-five minutes later, a police officer saw Fisher chase a
man and knock him to the ground, according to a police report.
Fisher was arrested, and at 10:35 p.m. was admitted to the Atlanta
Pretrial Detention Center.
   Fisher, who had been held previously on theft and drug charges,
was one of 263 prisoners released Friday and Saturday to comply
with an order from U.S. District Judge J. Owen Forrester, who set a
ceiling of 1,781 inmates for the jail.
   Fisher's victim said he was attacked after refusing to give
Fisher a dollar for beer. The two had met on a bus.
   Officials have expressed concern the released prisoners might
turn to crime even though the inmates have been provided with
transit passes and money to help tide them over.

<TEXT>
   A man dressed all in black and armed
with a shotgun went on a 15-minute shooting spree Sunday in a
northeastern coastal town, killing one man and injuring 14 people
before being arrested, officials said.
   Police were questioning the man to determine the motive for his
rampage in Monkseaton, about a mile from the Whitley Bay seaside
resort and 250 miles northeast of London.
   The gunman, who was not identified, roamed the streets shooting
at anyone he saw, including one person in a car, another on a
bicycle, one in a garden and one outside a church, said a spokesman
for a local ambulance service.
   ``There must have been about 12 different locations given where
this man had gone round,'' said Ken Heads, superintendent of the
Northumbria ambulance service. ``He was having a go at any person
he met.''
   Witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black, with dark
sunglasses and his hair in a pony tail. They said he wore an
ammunition belt around his waist and prowled the streets for 15
minutes, pausing only to shoot.
   Ten-year-old Ryan Boyd told the British Broadcasting Corp. TV
News:
   ``Across there on the corner there was this man ... all dressed
in black from head to foot. He started walking around here with the
gun. He was all sturdy, rigid. He wasn't frightened or anything, he
was just running around with his gun from side to side shooting
people.''
   Police later said the man they arrested was a 22-year-old from
Whitley Bay. They did not give his name.
   After the shooting spree, he drove to a pub, where authorities
seized him without any gunfire, police said. Detective
Superintendent Bob Benton said the suspect's vehicle contained a
loaded shotgun, cartridges, and a hunting knife.
   Speaking at a news conference, Benton said the arrested man was
not believed to have known personally any of the people he shot.
   The first emergency call came at 12:01 p.m., Heads said. Two
shots were fired at the ambulance as it arrived, and the crew had
to dive for cover, he said.
   A second ambulance was dispatched, and within three or four
minutes the service was inundated with calls reporting a gunman on
the loose and people lying injured in the streets, he said.
   Within seven minutes, five ambulances from Whitley Bay and
nearby Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside were on the scene.
The first crew to arrive found a man lying dead in a street, Heads
said.
   North Tyneside Hospital spokesman Michael Scargill said 14 men
and women were treated for gunshot wounds. He said six were
hospitalized and eight were sent home.
   Police identified the dead man as Kenneth Mackintosh, 41, a
telephone company employee who was married and had two children.
   The Rev. Tom Grant said parishioners leaving his midday service
at St. Andrew's United Reformed Church heard a shot and saw a woman
fall to the ground opposite their church.
   Parishioner Angela Bartle, 45, said the injured woman was
conscious ``and saying `help me,' but I had to leave her lying
there'' because the gunman, 150 yards away, had reloaded his gun
and was aiming it at her.
   Mrs. Bartle said the gunman ``looked very calm. He wasn't
shouting anything.''
   Eric Holloway, 47, said he and his wife and son were in their
car when they saw the gunman load his shotgun and point it toward
them. ``I shouted to my wife, who was driving, to duck down,''
Holloway said.
   ``Then a Ford Granada came up behind and the man driving that
car took the shot intended for us. When he got out of his car he
was screaming with pain.''
   ``He just kept on re-loading and I could see he was experienced
at handling the gun because of the speed with which he did this.
There was no time to get to him while he was re-loading because he
did it so quickly,'' he said.
   Grant said the gunman fired about four shots, then took off in a
vehicle as police officers approached.
   ``We were all so surprised. It was all over in about 15 minutes
so there was no panic or anything, but for a time we didn't believe
it.''
   Britain's worst shooting incident occurred in August 1987, when
Michael Ryan went on a rampage in the town of Hungerford, west of
London, killing 16 people, including his mother, before turning his
gun on himself.
   Britain's already strict gun control laws were then tightened to
outlaw, among other things, semiautomatic rifles like the one Ryan
used.
   The blood bath shocked Britain, where most police are unarmed
and the people believe their society to be relatively free of
violence.

   A fund to help the families of 47 sailors
who died aboard the USS Iowa has received not only money, but
letters, cards, pictures and poems honoring the battleship's
crewmen.
   ``I would like to thank you for doing your job as devoted young
men to protect our country,'' wrote a Navy machinist's mate 1st
class who enclosed a $300 check.
   ``Thank you for always being there. ... Why does it take another
loss to remind us? I will remember you and your 47 shipmates,''
said a note from a Vietnam veteran.
   The letters have been arriving by the hundreds at the Norfolk
office of Shearson Lehman Hutton, which started the fund for the
families of crewmen who died April 19 when an explosion tore
through the ship's No. 2 turret during a training exercise.
   ``I am deeply distressed by the unfortunate and almost
inexplicable disaster in 2 turret,'' wrote a Navy veteran who was
on the commissioning crew of the World War II battleship.
   ``I grieve and mourn with the families of the 47 men who lost
their lives aboard the Iowa. I grieve for each one and share your
sorrow, having lost my son three years ago,'' a woman wrote.
   Other letters have come from schoolchildren, relatives of
veterans, active-duty military personnel and civilians.
   The fund has collected more than $42,500, which will be
distributed equally among the families to use however they wish.
Some families have requested that their money be put aside for
scholarship funds in the crewman's name, said Jeff Sweitzer, branch
manager of the brokerage.
   ``When I first started, I figured to come up with $50,000,'' he
said. ``I think we would far surpass that over the next couple of
weeks.''
   The USS Iowa Veterans Association gave $500 and has printed
6,000 color posters of the battleship firing its guns. Those will
be sold for $10 each to raise money for educating the dead
crewmen's children.
   The letters will be turned over to the Navy to be passed on to
the Iowa crewmen and the victims' families, said Gary R. Compton, a
Shearson Lehman Hutton vice president.
   ``We've read every one that comes in,'' he said. ``Some of them
are really quite poignant, difficult to read.''
   A first-grade class in Michigan sent an envelope stuffed with
handmade cards decorated with drawings of boats and hearts.
   ``We are thinking about you. We want to thank you for making us
safe,'' wrote one student.
   ``We are here if you need us,'' wrote another.

   Vice President Dan Quayle arrived here
on the second leg of his Southeast Asian trip Sunday, poised to
deal with the issues of trade and Cambodia.
   Quayle, who spent most of Sunday scuba diving in the Great
Barrier Reef off Australia's northeast coast, paid a courtesy call
on Vice President Sudharmono after his evening arrival.
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, delayed their departure from
Australia for about an hour so they could play another round of
tennis.
   On Monday, the vice president is to hold talks with Indonesian
officials which were billed as get-acquainted sessions.
   Some of the trade concerns Quayle is expected to broach concern
patent protection and intellectual property.
   The vice president may also raise human rights issues,
particularly the status of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
   Human rights groups say Jakarta has failed to account for
thousands of missing people killed in custody in East Timor.
   An important diplomatic meeting will be Quayle's session with
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former leader of Cambodia who is
supported by the United States in his drive to run the country once
the Vietnamese occupation troops withdraw this fall.
   Sihanouk is in Jakarta to see Hun Sen, head of the Vietnamese
puppet government in Cambodia.
   Washington is considering giving military assistance to the
non-communist groups.
   Quayle has said the United States is adamantly opposed to seeing
the Khmer Rouge, the group that killed over a million people in
Cambodia 1975-1978, return to power.
   On Tuesday, Quayle heads for Singapore and Thailand, the last
stops on his 12-day trip before he heads home.

   An unexplained illness hospitalized five
people and sickened dozens of others after a seminar luncheon at a
hotel Sunday.
   Paramedics were called to the Century Plaza Hotel about 1:15
p.m., said Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   ``We had a group of about 20 or 30 people who came down with
nausea and vomiting'' after the halibut luncheon, but it was
unclear if the cause was food poisoning, said Katie Meyer, a
spokeswoman for the plush hotel.
   ``A doctor who was here with the group said it appeared to be a
chemical reaction,'' she said.
   However, all items offered at lunch were removed from the hotel
menu as a precaution, she said.
   Five women were taken to Beverly Hills Medical Center, where
they were being examined and were listed in stable condition Sunday
afternoon, authorities said.
   The stricken were among 400 people at the luncheon, which was
part of the Los Angeles Radiological Society's 14th annual spring
diagnostic ultra-sound conference, Ms. Meyer said.

<HEAD>Cronkite to Lead Campaign Aimed Against `Ravaging of Free TV'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former CBS newsman Walter Cronkite will
kick of a campaign aimed at keeping the nation's TV sets from being
turned into ``vending machines'' for the pay TV industry, a
broadcasters' group said Sunday.
   The public _ and broadcasters _ have taken free TV for granted
as cable TV and VCRs increasingly eat into the audiences for
sports, news and entertainment programs, said Milton Maltz,
chairman of the Free TV Task Force of the National Association of
Broadcasters.
   The result, he said, will be that viewers will have ``to pay for
what they once got for free through the American system of
broadcast television,'' Maltz told an appreciative audience at the
NAB convention here.
   ``The pay TV industry is a financial creature born by deal
makers and bred on junk bonds,'' Maltz said. ``Local stations are
under attack by cable operators who can decide to drop a station or
change a station's channel location at will.
   ``The ravaging of free TV, however, has yet to begin in
earnest,'' Maltz said.
   He said the chairman of a major cable TV operator told him that
at some point broadcasters will be paying to have their signals
carried on cable systems.
   Maltz said sports on free TV were an endangered species and an
owner of a National Football League team had told him the NFL's
plan was ``to make every TV receiver an extension of the stadium
box office.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised that in his mind he could visualize
every set as the equivalent of a program vending machine,'' Maltz
said.
   ``Indeed, he could probably even hear the machine crying out
every half hour `Feed me, feed me' as the viewer obliges by
stuffing more dollars in the slot,'' Maltz said.
   He urged the broadcasters to act to make the public ``aware of
the danger facing our institution of free TV.''
   Cronkite's message will appear within the next two months
simultaneously on prime time in every TV station in the country,
Maltz said, to launch the Free TV campaign, which also will include
additional on-air promotions by local stations.
   ``The issue is simple,'' Maltz said. ``Is the future pay TV or
is it free TV? There is room _ there is need _ for both.''

   At least 15,000 people, shouting ``victory
or death,'' rallied Sunday at the Capitol and marched in support of
rights for homosexual men and women.
   The ``March on Austin'' began with a colorful, musical parade
downtown to the Capitol a mile away, where demonstrators rallied in
support of legislators pushing bills backed by gays and lesbians.
   Organizers estimated the crowd's size at 30,000, but police put
it at 15,000. The demonstration was considered one of the largest
in the state capital in recent years.
   ``We're not going to go away,'' state Sen. Craig Washington, a
heterosexual supporter of gay rights, said at the Capitol. ``We
must never surrender. We must never retreat.
   ``Victory or death,'' he said, as the crowd picked up the chant.
Washington was joined by three fellow Democratic lawmakers who are
sponsoring gay-supported bills.
   Demonstrators from across Texas and several other states said
they want to increase funding for and access to treatment for AIDS,
abolish the state's anti-sodomy law and enact hate-crime
legislation, which would increase penalties for those who attack
people because of their sexual preference.
   ``I love Texas,'' said former San Antonio resident Letitia
Gomez, co-chair of the National Latino Gay and Lesbian Organization
in Washington, D.C. ``I also hate our history of oppression of
Mexican people ... women and now us, gays and lesbians.''
   She said that remarks made last December by State District Judge
Jack Hampton of Dallas _ who said he gave a convicted killer a
lighter sentence partly because the victims were ``queers'' _
showed the status of gay and lesbian rights in Texas.
   ``The message there was you don't have rights,'' she said. ``Are
you going to accept that?''
   The demonstrators were met by about 31 counterdemonstrators
holding placards with such messages as ``Gay is not OK.''

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders warned of voting
irregularities Sunday as Paraguayans prepared to vote in the freest
elections in decades.
   Polls predict that Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who led a coup Feb. 3
to oust the dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, will win up to
70 percent of the vote in Monday's elections.
   However, Rodriguez's closest challenger, longtime opposition
leader Domingo Laino of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, has
told voters that they could be risking ``a Stroessner system
without Stroessner.''
   ``We are conscious that we are participating in elections that
are marked by flaws, but we're doing it becuase we want a peaceful
transition, not a violent one,'' Laino said Sunday.
   Fernando Vera, the top candidate of the Revolutionary Febrerista
Party, openly predicted Rodriguez and the Colorado Party would win
the presidency and control of congress, and worried that his party
could not even be sure its ballots would be available at every one
of the more than 10,000 voting tables nationwide.
   ``We've distributed our ballots to the main places, but I`m not
sure we've gotten through'' to smaller, more remote villages across
this California-sized South American republic of 4 million, he said.
   The parties are responsible for printing and distributing their
own ballots.
   Rodriguez insists that Monday's voting will be fair. Voters will
cast ballots in private, and their right index finger will be
dipped in indelible purple ink afterward to prevent double voting.
   The general told an international election observer on Sunday,
``Do you like soccer? Well, in a soccer game, the team that loses
usually blames the referee, the lineman and the conditions of the
field.''
   Rodriguez was one of Stroessner's closest aides before bringing
down the 34-year-long regime and taking over as provisional
president. Rodriguez also belongs to the Colorado Party, which has
controlled the government for 42 years.
   Voters also will pick 36 senators and 72 deputies to fill all
the seats of the two legislative chambers.
   The winning party is awarded two-thirds control of congress. The
other parties will split the remaining seats.
   Eight parties, including many banned under Stroessner, have
fielded slates of candidates.
   The main issue of the campaign has been who can best promote
democracy in this country that has never known it. Many Paraguayans
have concluded that Rodriguez, who controls the army and enjoys
great personal prestige, is as good a choice as any.
   Rodriguez has pledged to build democratic government, restore
human rights, and allow freedom of the press.
   However, Laino has urged Paraguayans to choose a complete
political housecleaning rather than ``to continue the Stroessner
system with a few new names.''
   Laino has said his party will pull out of any government that
does not reform the constitution, electoral law and penal code.
   Even many Laino supporters doubt he can win.
   Only the Colorados are likely to have ballots at virtually all
the 10,000 voting tables nationwide.
   The Colorados have dominated the airwaves with commercials.
   They are also most likely to benefit from a bloated, outdated
voter registration list of 2.2 million. Even election officials
acknowledge it may carry 600,000 names too many.
   Voting is obligatory for Paraguayans ages 18 to 60. Polls open
at 7 a.m. (7 a.m. EDT) and close at 4 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT). Unofficial
results are expected late Monday night.

<TEXT>
   Centrist Ulysses Guimaraes defeated a
progressive opponent Sunday to win the presidential nomination of
the governing party at the end of a turbulent convention.
   The selection is considered the formal opening of the campaign
for the country's first direct presidential election in 29 years.
The vote is scheduled for Nov. 15.
   The members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party picked
Guimaraes, a 72-year-old federal congressman and former party
president, over Waldir Pires, governor of the northeastern state of
Bahia. Pires was the choice of the party's progressive wing.
   Some influential party members put up strong resistance to
Guimaraes, arguing instead for a younger, more vigorous figure to
contest the challenge posed by increasingly popular left-wing
candidates.
   The Democratic Movement Party is the country's largest, thus
making Guimaraes a serious contender in the election.
   However, political analysts give the party a slim chance of
sweeping the election, as it has done in past polling. They say it
is associated with the failures of President and party member Jose
Sarney, who has been unable to stop 1,000 percent annual inflation
and reverse public disenchantement with traditional politics.
   Guimaraes' opponents in the race include centrist reformer
Fernando Collor de Mello, governor of the poor northeastern state
of Alagoas. He is forming a new party.
   Other contenders are left-wing populist Leonel Brizola, former
governor of Rio de Janeiro state and a member of the Democratic
Labor Party; and federal Congressman Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of
the Workers Party, a socialist group.
   Brazil returned to civilian rule under Sarney in 1985 after 21
years of military rule. However, Sarney took office after an
electoral college vote controlled by the military regime.
   Under the constitution, he cannot run for re-election.

   Communist guerrillas shot and killed
two of President Corazon Aquino's security guards on Sunday, police
said.
   Two other rebel attacks elsewhere in the country left a total of
15 people dead, officials said.
   In Manila, six men approached the two guards, Cpl. Troy Lampreya
and Pfc. Clemente Requiene, as they sat in their jeep, authorities
said. The attackers shot them in the head, then dragged them from
the vehicle and shot them again, police said.
   The gunmen warned onlookers not to interfere, saying they were
members of the communist New People's Army, said Cpl. Rodolfo
Janer, a police investigator. The urban guerrilla group has killed
scores of police and military men during a 20-year communist
insurgency.
   Janer said the attackers took an M-16 rifle from the slain
soldiers and fled in a commandeered jeep.
   The shooting took place in the early morning about a mile from
the presidential palace, Janer said.
   Lampreya and Requiene were members of the Presidential Security
Group, an elite command that guards the president and foreign
dignitaries.
   In Leon town on Panay island, more than 200 New People's Army
rebels attacked a military outpost manned by a dozen government
troops and 10 civilian militiamen, said Maj. Edgardo Doromal,
Constabulary operations officer in central region.
   Three soldiers and three militiamen were killed in the predawn
attack, along with an 8-year-old boy and a woman who were caught in
the cross fire, Doromal said. The bodies of four rebels were
recovered outside the camp, he said.
   In Pampanga province north of Manila, rebels attacked a militia
outpost near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, but they were repulsed,
the military said.
   Two rebels and a civilian were killed in the gunbattle, the
report said.

   Thousands of high school students will join an
underwater expedition to a Spanish galleon in the Mediterranean Sea
via camera and satellite Monday. But an understudy is taking the
star robot's place.
   The robot Jason, retrieved Saturday after it broke loose from
its tether and sank in the Mediterranean, will be completely
evaluated before being returned to service, said Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution spokeswoman Sonya Hagopian.
   ``Jason will probably be going back in, but not right away,''
Hagopian said Sunday. ``It could be a matter of just a few days.''
   The robot Medea, which helped find the lost robot, will take
Jason's place when the first of 250,000 students in 13 U.S. and
Canadian cities hook up with marine explorers led by Robert Ballard
via two-way satellite. The galleon is located off the Italian coast.
   About 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians were
testing the system last week when Jason, a propeller-driven
submersible equipped with video cameras and maneuverable arms,
disappeared overboard and sank about 2,100 feet.
   Jason, a newer version of the robot Ballard used to examine the
wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic, appeared to have
sustained only minor cosmetic damage, Hagopian said.
   The expedition is scheduled to end May 14.

   Students and workers fought riot
police with firebombs and rocks in downtown Seoul on Sunday after
troopers blocked a rally called by labor and dissident groups to
mark May Day. More than 2,900 people were arrested.
   The clashes were the first major protests on Seoul's streets
since late last year, and they sent terrified pedestrians running
for cover.
   In scattered clashes, bands of protesters battled the 20,000
riot police deployed to block the rally, called on the eve of the
international labor holiday.
   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported
dozens of injuries.
   In Inchon, west of Seoul, and in southeastern Kwangju,
protesters also fought police.
   Police fired warning shots into the air in Sungnam on Seoul's
southern outskirts when about 200 workers and students tried to
firebomb a police station, police said. Five officers were injured.
   Radical students, dissidents and workers are mounting violent
protests to demand the overthrow of the government. They also want
higher wages, better working conditions and a share in South
Korea's growing economic prosperity. Most South Korean workers earn
subsistence wages for long working weeks.
   President Roh Tae-woo's government has warned it may take
emergency steps to halt strikes, which have cost more than $3
billion in lost production this year. Government leaders are
worried that labor unrest could cripple the economy and foment
political unrest.
   Police had no overall figures on the number of protesters in
Seoul, but it appeared below 10,000. Rally organizers had claimed
that 100,000 people would take part, but police blocked off
outlying towns near Seoul and prevented workers from leaving for
the capital.
   Riot police guarded bus and train stations in Seoul to turn back
people arriving for the rally. They also blocked off the meeting
site.
   The worst fighting raged for about four hours around Yonsei
University, when about 2,000 students and workers tried to march
past 5,000 riot police surrounding the campus.
   Protesters, many armed with clubs and iron pipes, marched to the
beat of drums and gongs.
   ``Knock down the dictatorship which suppresses the masses!''
marchers chanted. ``Down with the facist regime!''
   Police armored vans opened fire with multiple tear gas launchers
before the marchers reached the main gate. Enraged students charged
out of the campus and pelted police with hundreds of firebombs and
rocks.
   The police vans fired volley after volley at the charging
protesters and police repeatedly charged to drive the attackers
back. Thick white clouds of choking gas cloaked the campus.
   In the crowded main shopping district, hundreds of protesters
briefly clashed with police blocking the rally site. They tore up
paving stones to use as ammunition as passers-by ran for cover.
   Police seized dozens of protesters in the downtown clashes,
beating and kicking many as they were taken away.
   Labor and dissident leaders vowed to hold more protests.
   Dissident leaders at Yonsei denounced the Roh government as a
front for military dictatorship and called for an anti-government
uprising.
   ``Let's fight and knock down the Roh Tae-woo regime ... We
cannot sit idly. We cannot live like this,'' said dissident leader
Lee Suk-hyung.
   The radical students and dissidents, however, lack public
support because of their extremism and violent tactics.
   About 10,000 conservative veterans who served in South Korean
forces in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War staged a peaceful
rally in southern Seoul to denounce what they said was a growing
leftist threat to the nation.

   A car collided with a tractor-trailer in a Georgia downpour
Sunday, killing six people, and five more died in Illinois when
their station wagon veered off an interstate and into the base of a
sign. Seven of the dead were children.
   Four other children were injured, three critically, in the
accident near Oak Forest, Ill., and two people were hurt in the
wreck in Forsyth County, Ga., officials said.
   The Illinois crash occurred at 6:15 a.m. when the southbound
station wagon, packed with seven children and two adults, ran into
the base of an Interstate 57 exit sign, said Capt. George Hopman of
the Markham Fire Department, which helped in the rescue.
   The driver, Michael Gates, 41, his wife, Mattie Davis, 28, and
their son Ivory Davis, 5, were all dead on arrival at hospitals in
Oak Forest, a suburb south of Chicago. All were from nearby
Kankakee.
   Two other children _ Athyid Swapsy, 3, and Riquisha Banks, 8 _
were dead on arrival at South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest,
said spokeswoman Lynn Foster. Yachiyl Swapsy, 2, was in fair
condition there, Ms. Foster said.
   Yeroubbaal Swapsy, 4, and Shalmon Sanford, 7, were in critical
condition with multiple injuries at Olympia Fields Osteopathic
Medical Center, police said.
   A seventh child, identified as Tamar Swapsy, 5, was in
``extremely critical'' condition with multiple traumas at
University of Chicago Hospital, said spokeswoman Carol Eck.
   Authorities did not know the relationship between the couple and
the other children.
   ``According to eyewitness reports, the car just started drifting
slowly to the right,'' said State Trooper J.K. Howell.
   Alcohol or drugs were not a factor, Howell said. Police said
none of the victims appeared to be wearing seat belts.
   The Georgia accident occurred during a torrential downpour
around 2:40 p.m. near Lake Sidney Lanier, almost 30 miles northeast
of Atlanta, according to State Patrol Cpl. Mike Nash.
   The car was coming down a hill and around a curve on Georgia 20
when the driver ``evidently lost it and got over in front of the
tractor-trailer,'' Nash said. The truck rolled over the car.
   None of the victims' names were released because one of the four
dead children could not be identified, Nash said. Authorities
believed she was being watched for the weekend by one of the adults
in the car and her parents were out of town.

   Three crewmen on a U.S. Navy submarine fell
overboard Monday when a wave swept the vessel as it conducted
surface operations in waters off Japan's southwestern island of
Kyushu, and two remained missing, U.S. military officials said.
   One of the men who fell from the 2,145-ton Barbel was rescued
later, the U.S. Forces Media Liaison Office said in a statement.
   It said the rescued man was picked up by the submarine itself
after a search aircraft spotted him. His identity and condition
were withheld.
   The submarine was conducting surface operations in international
waters when a wave swept away the crewmen, who were standing watch
on deck, the statment said.
   Kiyoshi Harada, spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency,
said the accident occurred about 31 miles southwest of Noma Cape in
Kagoshima Prefecture, or state.
   Harada said three Japanese aircraft and four vessels, including
three Japanese patrol boats, were searching for the two missing men.
   A Japanese defense official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that before the accident, the submarine surfaced
because it was taking on water from a hatch. He refused to
elaborate.
   However, Lt. Jeff Gradeck, a Navy spokesman based in Yokosuka,
denied that report. ``We have no information that there is anything
wrong with the Barbel, and it is taking part in the search,'' he
said.
   In Washington, Defense Department spokesman Maj. John Smith said
he had heard reports of the missing men but he had no further
details.
   There were no reports of injuries of any other crewmen.
   The Barbel, built in 1956 and equipped with 6 torpedo tubes, has
a crew of 77, according to U.S. military officials.
   The 219-foot-long, diesel-electric powered Barbel belongs to the
last non-nuclear combat submarine class built by the Navy.

   The Navy has decided to retire three
short-range nuclear weapons that account for 5 percent of the total
stockpile of U.S. warheads, Navy officials said Sunday.
   By 1991, the Navy will retire the ASROC nuclear depth charge,
the SUBROC missile and the Terrier missile, a total of 1,100
warheads, according to Navy officers and documents released under
the Freedom of Information Act.
   The weapons originally were intended to provide a nuclear
deterrent against attacks on surface ships by Soviet warships and
submarines. But Navy strategists now believe they can protect U.S.
ships from other ships by other means and see a greater threat from
Backfire and Badger bombers based on the Soviet mainland.
   The decision to unilaterally discard the weapons was contained
in documents obtained by an independent analyst, William Arkin, was
first reported in Sunday editions of The New York Times, and
confirmed Sunday by Navy officers who spoke on condition they not
be further identified.

   President Bush on Sunday retraced the inaugural
steps of another president named George who took the oath two
centuries ago that cemented him in history as ``the father of our
country.''
   Participating in celebrations of the 200th anniversary of George
Washington's inauguration as the first U.S. president, Bush said
his forbearer ``established a precedent for 40 presidents to
follow.''
   ``It was Washington's vision, his balance, his integrity, that
made the presidency possible,'' Bush told a gathering outside the
historic Federal Hall where Washington was sworn in on April 30,
1979.
   The 41st president reflected on the ``awesome prospect'' that
faced Washington on that day.

   Political seers from President Bush on down
are predicting widespread fraud in the upcoming presidential
elections in Panama.
   At the same time, a bipartisan consensus, often rare in foreign
policy issues, emerged saying the de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, had to go.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have been on the
skids since February 1988, when Noriega was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Miami on drug trafficking charges. Then-president
Eric Arturo Delvalle a few weeks later attempted to force Noriega
out, only to be ousted himself by the general.
   The United States recognizes Delvalle, who lives in Miami, as
Panama's legitimate president, which has led to a political vacuum
that has caused a host of problems, ranging from snags in Panama
Canal treaty negotiations to incidents against American citizens.

   NASA on Sunday began replacing two
faulty fuel-system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in hope of
making another launch attempt as early as Friday.
   The launch of the shuttle and its $550 million Magellan Venus
probe was scrubbed on Friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of a
power surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel for
one of the shuttle's three main engines.
   Engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line that
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.
   NASA officials Sunday said they would not set a new launch date
until Monday. But they said liftoff could not occur before Friday
afternoon.

   Two Cabinet ministers demanded Sunday that
Jewish settlers be allowed to shoot more freely in clashes with
Palestinians, and Arab reports said a settler shot a 10-year-old
girl in the head as protesters stoned his car.
   The Palestinian youngster, the second shot by settlers in the
last three days, was hospitalized in fair condition.
   The increasing violence between Palestinians and settlers in the
occupied territories was debated by Cabinet, with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin rejecting calls that settlers be allowed freer use of
firearms.
   But he also warned that the army may have to take harsher
measures against Palestinians unless they accept Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's offer of elections in the occupied territories as
a step toward ending the uprising.

   A ``drug war situation room'' unveiled by President
Bush last week and one like it in California may be the nation's
most sophisticated anti-smuggling weapons yet, but some question
whether such high-tech wizardry can do much.
   Bush dedicated the Customs Service-Coast Guard interdiction
center Thursday during a visit to Miami, where he also addressed
top Latin American drug-fighting officials at an international
conference.
   ``Think of this as one of America's drug war situation rooms, as
our early warning network against narcotics,'' Bush said after
watching a computer simulation of a drug interdiction in which
smugglers were tracked through the skies and seas off Miami and
intercepted by jets and speedboats.
   The Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Center, or
C3I, is in a squat, peach-colored building southwest of Miami in a
field dotted with radar antennas.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer and legislative leaders
prepared Sunday to tackle a $700 million budget shortfall after
voters overwhelmingly rejected a tax overhaul he said would lift
Louisiana out of recession.
   Saturday's referendum also left questions about Roemer's
political future just 13 months after he took office as a brash
reformer promising a ``new Louisiana.''
   ``I never worked harder in my life to try to turn this around,''
the governor said. ``We're going to keep building, but not as fast
as I wanted to.''
   Despite a media blitz financed by $1.2 million from backers and
the governor's personal plea for passage in 32 cities and towns,
the plan was rejected 55 percent to 45 percent.

   They're not as glitzy as the stores at other
malls in this affluent suburban shopping mecca, but the shops at
the brand-new Magic Mall have a few things overtheir competitors.
   ``They will teach us kids how to run our own businesses and
avoid bankruptcy,'' said third-grader Warren Johnson. ``I think
they are fun because they offer different ways of learning. And
best of all, they are all my size.''
   Magic Mall, an elaborate wooden structure housing a dozen
enterprises, opened last Wednesday at Kent Gardens Elementary
School with the goal of ``teaching children here a business

   The mall is a $20,000-plus project that takes up a spare

   Boston Harbor is getting cleaner, but state
officials say that's in spite of foot-dragging by the man who made
its filth famous: George Bush.
   Bush sailed in during the presidential campaign last September
and accused Gov. Michael Dukakis of neglecting an important
environmental issue in his own state.
   Now, the governor and his top environmental aides are wondering
when President Bush will put his money where his mouth was. They
want the $59 million recommended for the harbor cleanup by Congress
but deleted from Bush's budget.
   ``It's hypocritical of the president to come to New England in
the heat of a campaign and fault the man who began the harbor
cleanup for not doing enough and then, once safely ensconsed in the
White House, to pull the money off the table,'' complained John
DeVillars, state environmental secretary.
