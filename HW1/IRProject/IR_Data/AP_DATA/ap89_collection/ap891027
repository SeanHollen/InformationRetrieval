<HEAD>Report 3 French Students and Pervian Engineer Slain by Indians</HEAD>

   Three French university students and a
Peruvian mining engineer were killed by members of an Indian tribe
they were filming on a river expedition in Peru's Amazon jungle,
police said Friday.
   Police in Chiclayo said a report from Bagua, a river town 435
miles north of Lima, said the four were shot to death and their
bodies dumped into the Maranon River. The report said the bodies
were seen in the river Oct. 10 near Santa Maria de Nieva, 600 miles
north of Lima, but they were not retrieved.
   The victims were on a filming expedition of Aguaruna Indians on
the Maranon in the northeastern state of Amazonas, according to
Julio Quispe, a telephone company official in Chiclayo, 465 miles
north of Lima.
   Quispe said in a telephone interview that he was in radio
contact with Wilder Sanchez, a telephone company employee and
brother of Ramiro Sanchez, the mining engineer.
   Quispe said Wilder Sanchez went to the area after hearing his
brother had been killed and gave the following account:
   The Frenchmen, all in their 20s, were on a canoe trip following
the Maranon from its source in the Andes to the Amazon basin when
they met Ramiro Sanchez, a 23-year-old engineer working at a gold
mining project.
   The engineer, who spoke French and was familiar with the area,
agreed to accompany the students on their expedition. After being
briefly detained Oct. 6 at an army outpost at Puerto Imazita, 495
miles north of Lima, the four continued down the river and on Oct.
7 stopped at Puerto Nativo de Chipe, a village of Aguaruna Indians
near Santa Maria de Nieva.
   He said the Indians apparently attacked when the group tried to
film members of the tribe.
   The Lima newspaper El Comercio said reports broadcast by a radio
station in Jaen, a town 445 miles north of Lima, said one of the
students was shot when some Indians tried to steal the group's film
equipment. It said the three other victims tried to escape in a
boat but were pursued and slain by the Aguarunas.
   Victoria Pita, spokeswoman for the French Embassy in Lima, said
officials there had no information on the reports and were
investigating. There were conflicting versions of the names of the
students and she said the embassy was attempting to determine the
identities.
   In the same area in 1979, a group of Aguaruna Indians attacked
and burned the camp of German film director Werner Herzog during
the filming of the movie ``Fitzcarraldo.''
   The Aguaruna are a branch of the Jivaro tribe, known for its
poison-dart blowguns and history of head-hunting. Most of the
Indians, who are believed to number about 30,000, are fisherman or
small-plot farmers.
   Quispe said Sanchez told him over the radio that the names of
the Frenchmen were Jaime Terry Paul, 24, Joseph Trichpo Olarf, 28,
and Jean Christophe Monviale, 24.

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
said Friday night he is ending the 20-month-old cease-fire with the
Contras because of ``savage attacks'' by the rebels.
   Ortega's pronouncement threw a shock wave into the celebration
of democracy he was attending in this Latin nation with President
Bush and leaders of more than a dozen other countries from
throughout the Western hemisphere.
   The Sandinista leader, in a speech to 3,000 students and others
at the University of Costa Rica, charged that the Contras have
stepped up fighting in an effort to interfere with the elections
scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Ortega, addressing 3,000 people at the university, said, ``The
drop of water that made the glass spill over was the attack that
the mercenaries launhd on Oct. 22, the last day of voter
registration, when campesinos who wanted to vote were assassinated.
   ``According to our security information, 19 campesinos were
assassinated and six others were injured. This means that the
Contras are trying to deny the Nicaraguan people their right to an
electoral process,'' he said.
   ``After these savage attacks I met with the army high command to
analyze the situation, and the result of the analysis was that the
cease-fire could not be maintained,'' said Ortega.
   ``We have to guarantee the safety of the Nicaraguan people and
the electoral process, which means we have to organize the army
better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm ourselves,''
the Nicaraguan said before departing for a formal dinner with
presidents and prime ministers.
   Earlier, Ortega's press secretary, Manuel Espinosa, said the
Sandinista leader would make the official announcement on Saturday
that he was calling off the cease-fire. Espinosa said Tuesday, Oct.
31, will be the last day of the cease-fire.
   The cease-fire has been in effect since March 1988, but the two
sides never came to a formal agreement and the Sandinistas have
unilaterally extended it on a monthly basis.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, fielding questions from
reporters about the day's diplomacy, said, ``I hope it's not true''
when asked about Ortega's reported intentions. He said it would be
a ``step back'' from peace.
   He said the Nicaraguan leader had not mentioned the subject
during the closed-door sessions with other leaders gathered in
Costa Rica, and said that if Ortega does intend to end the
ceasefire ``maybe he's too ashamed'' to have said so at the meeting.
   On Aug. 7, five Central American presidents agreed to disband
the Contras in exchange for democratization in Nicaragua.
   The Contras were not a party to that agreement and their field
commander, Israel Galeano, said that his troops would move back
into Nicaragua with their weapons rather than disband.
   Galeano, known as Commander Franklin, said his troops would not
launch offensive operations before the Feb. 25 vote, but would
defend themselves if attacked.
   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, Daniel's brother,
said in September that his troops would do the same.
   The Contras have been based at camps in Honduras since the
United States ended military aid to the movement, formally known as
the Nicaraguan Resistance, in February 1988.

<HEAD>CBN Submits Bid For PTL Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christian Broadcasting Network
founded by Marion G. ``Pat'' Robertson has submitted a bid to buy
the PTL Network's cable operation, CBN spokeswoman Frankie
Abourjilie said Thursday night.
   ``All I can tell you is we have submitted a bid,'' Ms.
Abourjilie said. ``There are numerous other bids.''
   She said she could not comment on the amount of the bid because
the bidding is confidential. ``If you divulge information related
to the bid, they eliminate you,'' she said.
   Ms. Abourjilie said she did not know when the bid was submitted,
only that it was sent in time for Friday's deadline.
   She said the PTL cable network reaches 7 million homes, compared
to 47 million reached by CBN. The bid is only for the cable
network, which includes satellites and cameras, Ms. Abourjilie
said. The bid has ``nothing to do with Heritage USA,'' she said.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after
founder Jim Bakker resigned as head of the the ministry amid a sex
and money scandal.
   Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman who had agreed to buy the
ministry's assets, let his purchase contract expire Sept. 30
because he was unable to obtain title insurance for the Heritage
USA Christian campground near Fort Mill, S.C.
   Jim Bakker on Tuesday began serving a 45-year prison sentence
for defrauding members of the defunct PTL Club and television
ministry of $3.7 million.

   Sony Corp. was asked to donate $1 million for
video equipment to Ronald Reagan's presidential library a few days
before the former president said he supported that company's
takeover of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Corp., according to a
report published Saturday.
   The Washington Post, citing an anonymous source familiar with
the negotiations, said Reagan appeared to have changed his position
on foreign ownership of an American movie studio.
   The former president and his wife, Nancy, were told about the
possible contribution from Sony before they left on the trip,
according to the Post's source.
   Sony, which is not one of those sponsors, has not decided
whether to donate to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.
   The Reagans have been criticized for their trip, for which they
are receiving $2 million from the Japanese corporate sponsors.
   Robert Higdon, finance director for the foundation, said there
was ``absolutely not'' any connection between Reagan's defense of
the Sony-Columbia Pictures deal and the solocitation for a donation.
   ``Ronald Reagan is not negotiating with Sony right now,'' Higdon
said. ``The trustees of the library have expressed an interest in
Sony as a donor to the library long before Columbia Pictures was
involved.''

   President Bush sat down with Latin
American leaders on Friday for a celebration of democracy, but the
occasion was marred by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's
decision to end a 20-month ceasefire with U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Bush and Ortega exchanged a ``friendly'' handshake before
joining the other leaders gathered to celebrate a century of
democracy in Costa Rica.
   And Secretary of State James A. Baker said Nicaragua's leftist
leader made no mention of his plans during lengthy talks with heads
of 16 North and South American countries that focused on drugs,
Latin American debt and eagerness to see Panama's Manuel Antonio
Noriega removed from power.
   ``Maybe if he does intend to do that, he was too ashamed to
bring it up with the other heads of state in attendance,'' Baker
said. ``But certainly it would be a step backward in the peace
process.''
   But in between the closed-door diplomatic sessions and the
dinner with fellow leaders, Ortega told a college audience that
Contras had committed ``savage attacks'' against peasants earlier
this month in a move to disrupt elections scheduled for February.
He said he had concluded, ``the cease fire could not be
maintained...we have to guarantee the safety of the Nicaraguan
people and the electoral process, which means we have to organize
the army better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm
ourselves.''
   Salvadoran president Alfredo Cristiani said Ortega's decision
was a ``serious blow to the Central American peace plan; we should
all understand that the solution isn't easy.''
   Ortega's decision spread throughout the delegations as the
leaders turned their attention from closed-door diplomacy to an
evening of dining and socializing. The two-day Costa Rican
conference ends on Saturday with the dedication of a plaza marking
a century of democratic government.
   Host President Oscar Arias said that three hours of private
talks at a resort outside town gave his Latin guests a chance to
express ``their preoccupations, their worries, their frustrations
at their inability to give our people more prosperity, because of
debt, because of war, because of an unjust international commercial
system.''
   Baker said the talk turned to the possibility of a drug summit,
Panama's Noriega _ not in attendance _ and foreign debt.
   Rodrigo Borja, president of Ecuador, said the leaders discussed
the decline in coffee prices that has affected his country, Brazil,
Colombia, El Salvador and Costa Rica, among others.
   But whatever diplomacy there was, the attention was on Bush and
Ortega _ one the head of a government that has spent millions
trying to unhorse the other.
   ``I'm not going to miss this,'' said Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez, leaning in to catch the small talk that Bush and
Ortega exchanged when they shook hands before the first session.
   ``I told President Bush that my government supports the
electoral process and that we are working for peace in Nicaragua,''
Ortega told reporters afterwards.
   Bush arrived in this capital to cheers when he declared, ``I
believe we can create here in the Americas the world's first
completely democratic hemisphere.''
   An extraordinary security force _ 4,000 strong _ was deployed to
protect the leaders at the two-day ``celebration of democracy''
arranged by Arias, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his efforts to
promote democracy in the region.
   The Secret Service imported a two-inch-thick, 75-foot long sheet
of bulletproof glass in front of the National Museum for Saturday's
inauguration of Democracy Plaza to protect Bush, Colombian
President Virgilio Barco and the others. Barco's life has been
threatened by drug barons in his country.
   ``We must do away with all the dictatorships in America because
there will be no peace among us while even one of them remains,''
Arias said in welcoming remarks.
   ``There can be no tranquililty for our people when one
government lends itself to hiding corruption and distributing
drugs,'' he said in an apparent reference to Panama's Noriega.
   Baker said Salvadoran President Cristiani appealed directly to
Ortega to stop shipping arms to rebels in El Salvador but the
Nicaraguan president gave no reply.
   Ortega said 17 or 18 Sandinista soldiers were killed in an
attack by Contra rebels last week, Baker said.
   However, Baker made clear that the United States does not regard
the reported killings as justification for abandoning the
ceasefire. ``There have been deaths on both sides as the result of
skirmishes,'' Baker said.
   He said ending the ceasefire ``could be seized upon as a
desperate effort to cancel the elections'' scheduled for Feb. 25 in
Nicaragua.
   He acknowledged that several thousand Contras have moved back
into Nicaragua from neighboring Honduras, and said, ``We are
opposed and let the resistance know we are opposed to any offensive
action on their part.''
   Bush and Ortega traded barbed comments from afar before the
face-to-face meeting, and the president made a point of giving
Nicaraguan opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro a kiss when they
met. She and Panamanian opposition leader Guillermo Endara were
invited guests, and Bush planned to confer with both over coffee on
Saturday.
   The White House issued a brief statement saying Bush and Ortega
met ``momentarily'' and ``shook hands in a friendly manner,'' but
decided not to release a photo of their encounter.
   Bush began his journey saying, ``Today there are only a few
lonely holdouts against the sweep of democracy through this
hemisphere.''
   He arrived to a bear hug from Arias, and officials announced a
tentative agreement that will allow osta Rica to reduce its $4.5
billion foreign debt burden by $1 billion. Arias called it ``the
best gift we could possibly make to future generations of Costa
Ricans.''
   Two days before traveling here, Bush extended trade sanctions
against Nicaragua. The United States continues to supply non-lethal
aid to the Contras despite a Central American agreement to disband
their forces in exchange for democratization in Nicaragua.
   Other leaders here, in addition to Bush, Arias and Ortega, are
Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Michael Manley of Jamaica, Brian
Mulroney of Canada, Jose Sarney of Brazil, Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela, Julio Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay, George Price of
Belize, Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador, Desmond Hoyte of Guyana, Arthur
Robinson of Trinidad and Tobago, and Rafael Hernandez Colon,
governor of Puerto Rico.

   Despite their tough-guy image, Army drill
sergeants have emotions like anybody else. You don't believe it?
The Army says so, and it also says drill sergeants can suffer from
job-related stress.
   ``We have the image of drill sergeants as rough, dominant,
hard-driving, who can bite nails in half. That guy is also a human
being,'' said Sgt. Maj. James Williams of the Infantry Training
Center at Fort Benning.
   Now the Army is trying to help the sergeants cope with 14-hour
days, family responsibilities and job pressures through a stress
management program that started at Fort Benning on Oct. 11.
   Two other training posts, Fort Sill, Okla., and Fort Leonard
Wood, Mo., have similar programs.
   At Fort Benning, 51 drill sergeants and 18 wives spent most of
one recent day discussing problems in group sessions. The meetings
were moderated by mental health professionals assisted by the
chaplain.
   Williams said the wives learned about the dedication and
responsibilities of drill sergeants and the husbands learned about
the importance of communicating with their wives.
   The seminars will be scheduled quarterly for drill sergeants who
have been on the job between nine and 12 months, Williams said.
Wives are encouraged to attend.
   ``We want to know if we're doing anything wrong, or if there is
something we can do to assist them,'' said Williams. ``We try to
find out if there are stress factors. A person could have stress
and not know it. We make them aware of the indicators.''
   Staff Sgt. Chester Bullard, 29, who is in the 10th month of a
two-year tour as a drill sergeant, said he and his colleagues have
to be stern to maintain discipline and ensure that recruits meet
training goals.
   Bullard and two other drill sergeants are responsible for 56
recruits, who may turn to them for help resolving personal problems
that could affect their performance in basic training.
   ``The image is a tough guy,'' said Bullard, a bachelor. ``But
there are times you have to talk to them one-on-one and tell them,
`Hey, I'm human, too. I've been through those problems. I was a
private.'''
   Bullard said drill sergeants watch each other for signs of
stress and try to help by working longer than usual so that their
buddies can catch up on sleep or spend a few extra hours with their
families.
   About 22,000 recruits arrive at the Infantry Training Center
each year for basic and infantry training. The center has a staff
of 7,800, including 440 drill sergeants.
   ``During the 13 weeks, the drill sergeant probably sees his
soldiers more than his family,'' said Williams. ``The wives become
the family figures to the kids. The wife has to take the kids to
the doctor, get gas in the car, take the dog to the vet, do the
shopping and take care of the mail while dad is away.''
   Williams said there is no evidence of any special spouse abuse
problems among drill sergeants, although some carry their problems
home with them and worry about the performance of their trainees.
   ``During the two years he is a drill sergeant, he molds a lot of
people,'' said Williams. ``That soldier may not remember his high
school teacher ... but he'll remember that first drill sergeant.
That's the guy who gets your attention right away. You see him when
you wake up and you see him when you go to bed. A lot of soldiers
who go through say, `That's what I want to be like. I want to be
like my drill sergeant.'''

<TEXT>
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn's long-banned chronicle of
Soviet prison camps and political repression, ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' is now recommended reading in at least one
11th-grade Moscow history class.
   As recently as last year, high-school history textbooks made no
mention of dictator Josef Stalin's mass repressions. In 1989, the
new 10th-grade text states: ``Tentative estimates put the total
number of deaths in the repressions at about 40 million people.''
   Glasnost, or openness, is rapidly rewriting Soviet history,
sometimes faster than the Soviets can rewrite their children's
textbooks.
   In June 1988, educators were ordered to cancel secondary school
history exams because the tests would have required parroting of
Communist Party dogma at odds with dramatic disclosures in the
press about the nation's recent past.
   A prodigious effort began to rewrite Soviet history, and the
editors' work has begun appearing in classrooms.
   The inclusion of Solzhenitsyn's work on a recommended reading
list is one sign of how quickly barriers are falling. A Soviet
magazine published the first portions of the documentary study in
August. The full book has yet to appear.
   A teacher's guide produced by the Moscow city education
committee charges that Stalin imprisoned millions of people because
his crash industrialization program required that workers move to
harsh environments.
   Since there weren't enough volunteers, ``there appeared dozens
of camps in the necessary places with hundreds of thousands of
prisoners,'' the guide says.
   Inmates ``were turned into a mute labor force, requiring
practically no expenses, easily commanded and easily transferred,''
it continues. At least 5 million people had their property
confiscated and were shipped off to Siberia and other remote places.
   The book admits that ``whole regions died'' in famines during
the early 1930s, caused by Stalin's forced collectivization of
farms.
   ``We don't know the exact number of deaths caused by the
authorities,'' the book says. ``Western scientists estimate 3
million to 10 million people.''
   Back in 1974, when Leonid Brezhnev was in power, a 10th-grade
history text described the 1930s as a period of rapid
industrialization, rife with victories for labor.
   The revised text blames Stalin, once credited with saving the
motherland from Nazi annihilation, for making disastrous mistakes.
   It says Stalin ``repressed'' _ a word used to mean imprisoned or
killed in the purges _ those who favored preparation for war,
including five directors of army intelligence. It notes that on
June 22, 1941, when German troops invaded, many Soviet border
guards had the day off.
   ``This mistake in calculating the time of the attack resulted in
great loss of life,'' the textbook says.
   The new book's candor in describing the purges and the terrible
price exacted by Stalin's belief that Adolf Hitler would never
attack the Soviet Union has startled adults, accustomed to dull
recitations of the party line.
   ``If they wrote this five years ago, they would be in a camp,''
said one former political prisoner, who asked not to be identified
by name.
   But teaching the real past still poses risks. Just last spring,
according to the ex-prisoner's son, a civics teacher disappeared
from his eighth-grade class after using recent magazine articles to
teach about Stalin's repressions, even though officials had advised
teachers to do so.
   ``He was the first guy who wanted us to really know the history
of our country,'' the 15-year-old said. ``The new teacher went back
to rote memorizing.''
   The rush to rewrite history has left today's high school
students with a strange mixture of old and new texts.
   ``Our journalists are continuously publishing new information
about our history, but textbooks must be finished and released for
school,'' said Alexander Samsonov, history editor for the Education
publishing house in Moscow.
   That leaves him in the difficult position of figuring out which
reports are sufficiently supported both by facts and politicians
for presentation to students, he said.
   The new 10th-grade history text walks a fine line between
Western and traditional Soviet versions of the events that
triggered World War II.
   What the Baltic republics consider a Soviet invasion of their
countries is explained with the euphemism, ``Soviet power was
restored in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.''
   The book does not state that the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact
of 1939 divided the Baltics and Poland into Soviet and Nazi spheres
of influence, as a Kremlin official only recently admitted.
   But the textbook does say the treaty ``was unjust because it
took place behind the back of the Polish people.''
   The textbook acknowledges ``abuses of power and violations of
law'' in the Baltics, but doesn't explain that tens of thousands of
Baltic residents were deported to camps in the frozen wastelands of
Siberia and the far north. Estonia's government is now considering
paying damages to the victims and their families.

   Iris Knorr's late husband put something
away for a rainy day and forgot about it.
   The rainy day came with Hurricane Hugo, which badly damaged the
hotel Mrs. Knorr runs in the Caribbean. An unexpected windfall
arrived shortly thereafter _$35,475.69 in stock that her husband
had left behind.
   Mrs. Knorr found out about the unknown assets thanks to an Ohio
state agency. Now, spending the money will be easy, she said
Thursday from the Caribbean island of Nevis, where expensive
repairs to her hotel are underway.
   Warren G. Knorr Sr. had purchased 897 shares of United Cable
Television Co. stock while the couple lived in Mansfield, Ohio.
   In 1980, the Knorrs moved to Nevis, in the Leeward Islands of
the Caribbean. They bought a 14-room inn, the Old Manor Hotel, on
an old sugar plantation. Shortly after they bought the hotel, Knorr
died.
   Mrs. Knorr didn't know about the stock sitting in a brokerage
account. In 1987, the account was declared inactive and the stock
was turned over to the Ohio Department of Commerce's Division of
Unclaimed Funds.
   The division takes responsibility for bank accounts, investments
and other assets left behind by people who move away or die without
claiming the money. The division sold the stock and placed the
money in an account in Knorr's name, where it continued to earn
interest.
   In some states, such accounts are maintained for a few years and
then revert to the state's general fund if no heir is found. In
Ohio, such an account could theoretically keep accumulating
interest forever. The division has 2.2 million accounts worth more
than $77 million. Its oldest account was started in 1865 and was
held by a bank until the division was established in 1968.
   Mrs. Knorr knew nothing of the stock when Hugo slammed into the
Caribbean on Sept. 16-17, with winds blowing at 140 mph. It killed
an estimated 56 people in the Caribbean and 29 more on the U.S.
mainland.
   Mrs. Knorr said the storm was unlike anything she had imagined.
   ``I thought it would never stop,'' she said. ``I've never been
in a tornado, but they're over in a few minutes. But this hurricane
....''
   The hotel suffered extensive exterior damage, also losing a part
of the roof, a poolside cabana and exterior light fixtures. Some of
the damage was covered by insurance, but not all, she said.
   The check from her late husband's stocks arrived a week ago and
will help with repairs to the roof and electrical system.
   Thomas Gerace, director of the Division of Unclaimed funds, said
Mrs. Knorr initially learned of her windfall from her son, who saw
it listed in advertisements prepared by the division and published
in Ohio newspapers.
   ``Being able to return the money to Mrs. Knorr under such
unusual circumstances makes this one of the most interesting cases
we have handled,'' Gerace said.
   Janet Peoples, a division spokeswoman, said Mrs. Knorr never
knew of her husband's dabbling in the market.
   ``She was elated about getting it in the first place ... and
ecstatic about getting it to rebuild,'' Ms. Peoples said.
   The division has paid 20,000 claims this year worth more than $7
million.
   ``I never even knew there was a Division of Unclaimed Funds,''
Mrs. Knorr said. ``I'm amazed that they were so diligent in finding
me.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Birds Thriving Amidst Target Range</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Military jets scream across this
lonely island near Martha's Vineyard and pepper it with dummy bombs
_ but environmentalists don't mind because wildlife is thriving in
spite of the noise.
   The important factor is that there are no people on the island.
   The island, owned by the Navy since 1952, is a crucial resting
spot for migratory birds on their way from Canada and the Northeast
to Central and South America. To protect the rare species found on
the island, the U.S. Department of Interior established the
northeastern third of the island as a wildlife sanctuary in 1975.
   But the rest of the 640-acre island is a target range used by
pilots from the Navy reserves, Marine Corps reserves and the Air
National Guards of Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut.
   ``It's the only air target range in this region,'' said Ensign
Edward Matlock, a spokesman for the Weymouth Naval Air Station,
which runs the island. The closest alternatives are in Maryland or
Canada, he said.
   Pilots are supposed to aim orange practice bombs, bearing no
explosives, at a 200-foot ring of tires with a center point of
large tractor tires arranged like a bullseye.
   Earlier this month, teams had to go tidy up the site because
knee-high grass made it hard for pilots to see the target, said
Capt. John G. Kuchinski Jr., who commands the Weymouth Station.
   ``They end up dropping them (bombs) elsewhere in the island,''
Kuchinski said.
   A recent inspection by a team of environmentalists, military
personnel and engineers did find one bomb inside the sanctuary.
   Kuchinski has warned pilots that they could be stripped of their
wings if they are caught violating the sanctuary boundaries.
   And civilians on Martha's Vineyard, a couple of miles away
across the ocean, keep watch on Noman's, occasionally reporting
when they see a B-52 or an F-111B straying over the sanctuary,
Kuchinski said.
   ``Flight crews are like everybody else,'' Kuchinski said.
``Occasionally you get somebody who thinks he has a license'' to do
anything.
   Despite the jets and bombs, leading wildlife officials say they
actually welcome the Navy's stewardship of the island.
   If the public were not wary of unexploded ordnance left on the
island _ live bombs were used in the past _ and the penalties
threatened trespassers on government property, people would swarm
over the island, they say.
   ``In a very short time, the island would be trashed,'' said
Augustus Ben David II, director of the Felix Neck Wildlife
Sancutary on the Vineyard.
   ``If it were turned over to the Fish and Wildlife Service, its
enforcement against trespassers would go down rather than up,''
said Tom French, head of the state's Natural Heritage and
Endangered Species program.
   When Ben David and French visited the island with the military
clean-up crew, they saw 41 species of birds and eight kinds of
butterflies.
   Ben David said he spotted three species of turtles, Canada
geese, swarms of herring gulls, and ``a wonderful muskrat
population.''
   The vegetation is so rich that crossing a cranberry bog is like
walking on a mattress, he said.
   ``Wildlife is all over, even in the target zones,'' said Ben
David. ``It's absolutely an incredible place. From a naturalist's
standpoint, an incredible place.''
   French said he saw Canadian forest birds, birds of prey, and
even a few peregrine falcons nesting in the 80-foot bluffs along
the shore.
   ``I understand that it sounds terrible to have people bombing
the island,'' said French. ``But what you expect to see and what
reality is are worlds apart.''

   Two more victims of a Phillips Petroleum
Co. plastic plant explosion were discovered Thursday night, and the
search continued for 15 more workers missing since the blast.
   The two bodies were found in the rubble outside a reactor
control room, said Phillips spokesman Scott Carlberg. A total of
seven bodies have been found so far.
   Carlberg also said that one of the bodies has been identified as
Jeffrey L. Harrison, 36, of Houston. None of the others have been
identified yet.
   The search process was slowed earlier in the day when officials
discovered a hydrocarbon leak near the blast site.
   Officials temporarily halted recovery work and ordered reporters
several hundred yards from the scene so other workers equipped with
monitors could determine if the level of vapor was dangerous.
   ``This is the kind of material we said we might encounter,''
said Carlberg. ``We're taking an extremely conservative safety
measure.''
   Phillips spokesman George Minter later said authorities believed
there was no danger.
   A series of explosions ripped through the plant Monday, injuring
more than 100 people.
   Crews manning bulldozers and cranes in the second day of
round-the-clock search work were moving Thursday toward a control
room area beneath a mangled reactor where many of the victims are
believed to have died.
   The victims found in the rubble were burned, and authorities
were using dental records to identify them.
   Three were found on Wednesday and one each on Monday and Tuesday.
   A 15-member federal team from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration began its investigation of the accident Wednesday
but Phillips officials said the company efforts would concentrate
on recovery of victims before trying to find a cause for the blast.
   The plant daily produced 4.5 million pounds of plastic pellets _
about 20 percent of the national output _ used in manufacture of
milk jugs and grocery sacks.

   Singer Tina Turner, who turns 50 on Nov. 26,
says she's a practicing Buddhist who lives ``like a monk,'' doesn't
like being a sex symbol and takes no drugs _ not even aspirin.
   ``I live a very quiet life,'' Turner said in an interview in the
Nov. 13 issue of US magazine. ``There's no television, no music
blaring. I live like a monk, almost. A monk with red lips, short
dresses and big hair.''
   She went on: ``I have at times given off the image of raunchy,
rock sex, but I've tried to turn that energy into something
positive. But I wish it could have been nicer in some way. Maybe I
feel that way because I am an older woman who is grown up. Young
girls, they like all of that crazy image stuff.''
   Turner said that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ``is the lady I
would have most liked to have been.'' Turner said that she was
impressed by Onassis' manners on the one occasion when they met.
   For the past three years, Turner, whose latest album is
``Foreign Affair,'' has been romantically involved with a German
record executive, Erwin Bach, 17 years her junior.
   But the survivor of the Ike and Tina Turner marriage-music duo
isn't interested in wedlock. ``I just wanted to have a man on my

<HEAD>Birth Control Use OK for Nonsmoking Women Over 40, Panel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy women who don't smoke should be able
to take birth control pills until menopause without significantly
increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke, a government panel
of experts says.
   Though these women could face an increased risk of
cardiovascular problems with pill use, this would be outweighed by
the risks of not taking the pill _ namely, abortion or carrying a
pregnancy to term, panel members agreed Thursday.
   ``Older women need contraception, and you have to weigh the
risks and the benefits,'' said Barbara Hulka, panel chairwoman and
head of the epidemiology department at the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health.
   With the hormone levels in currently prescribed pills far lower
than they were in the early birth control pills, medical
researchers believe the risks found with the high-dose pills are
reduced.
   Additionally, studies have shown that pill use offers some
protection against cancer of the uterus and ovary.
   ``When you look at the whole picture, oral contraceptives may be
the best bet for some older, healthy women,'' Hulka said. She
added, though, that more research is needed to better determine the
risks of pill use in older women.
   The Food and Drug Administration will consider the
recommendation Thursday by the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs
Advisory Committee to scrap the current practice of advising
healthy, nonsmoking women to stop taking the pill _ the most
effective contraceptive _ when they turn 40.
   But the panel said the warning against pill use for women over
35 who smoke should remain because of an increased risk of blood
clots, the committee said.
   An estimated 3 million to 4 million women could be affected if
the FDA accepts the committee's recommendation to remove the age
ceiling advisory on pill use by nonsmokers.
   Panel members noted that their decision was based on little new
data on incidence of disease among pill users. Instead, it was
based primarily on ``informed opinion'' and the assumption that the
lower doses prescribed now will carry lower risks.
   Increased risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart
attack and stroke, are the primary concerns for older women on
birth control pills.
   Breast cancer has been linked with use of oral contraceptives at
all ages, but not specifically to use by older women, Hulka said,
adding: ``There's so little data on breast cancer we can't really
address that.''
   Six of the eight panel members attending the meeting agreed on
the recommendations. A single dissenter, Susan A.R. McKay,
associate professor at the University of Wyoming School of Nursing,
said she could not go along with changing the current caution
against women over 40 using the pill because ``I don't think we
have adequate information.''
   The National Women's Health Network opposed lifting the age
ceiling, citing inconclusive studies on health risks and saying
safer contraceptive alternatives are available for this group.
   ``There is no pressing reason to change current prescribing
practices,'' Adriane Fugh-Berman of the network told the panel.
   Judith A. Fortney, an epidemiologist from the Family Health
International in Durham, N.C., estimated that 3 million to 4
million women over 40 might be candidates for the pill. She cited a
survey that estimated that as many as 500,000 women over 40 now are
taking the pill, but she said she doubts the figure is that high.
   Of women 40 to 44 using reversible contraception, she said,
about 3 percent are using the pill, while 35 percent are using
condoms, 19 percent are using intrauterine devices or IUDs, 13
percent are using diaphragms and 12 percent are using the rhythm
method. The rest use other forms.
   But more women use sterilization, which is irreversible, than
all of the reversible methods combined, Fortney said. Some of these
women might have opted for the pill if it were available as an
option.

<HEAD>Idled Farm Acres May be Brought Back Into Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department economist says a
world-class foot race could develop among farmers in 1990 to see
who gets to the fields first if grain supplies tighten further and
prices go up.
   Gregory Gajewski of the department's Economic Research Service
said U.S. farmers have millions of idled acres that could be
brought quickly back into production if prospects brighten.
   ``Other countries also have the potential to expand agricultural
production,'' he said. ``Canada, the EC (European Community),
Brazil, Argentina, Thailand and others could substantially boost
output if producer prices rose enough.''
   In the United States, land used to grow U.S. crops this year is
estimated at 342 million acres, up 14 million acres from 1988,
Gajewski writes in the November issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine.
   Slightly more than 29 million acres were idled this year under
the USDA's annual crop programs. That does not count around 30
million acres of ``highly erodible'' cropland held out of
production under the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   ``Should crop supplies tighten further and prices rise, the
acreage idled under the annual programs could quickly return to
production,'' Gajewski said.
   But at the moment, the need for a large crop production increase
``is in some doubt,'' he added.
   Wheat exports continue to be subsidized by both the United
States and the 12-nation EEC. And prices of soybeans and ``coarse''
grains _ corn, sorghum, oats and barley _ have come down from
earlier high levels.
   ``Moreover, such a surge in worldwide production could come at
some environmental cost,'' Gajewski said. ``But the higher prices
and profits would help farmers absorb the costs of shifting to more
environmentally sustainable farming practices.''
   Gajewski said the experience of U.S. farmers in the 1970s and
early 1980s ``may temper plans for expansion'' in the near future.
   It was a combination of declining supplies and rising commodity
prices that triggered larger production and a rise in global
stockpiles of grain.
   ``But world production growth outpaced demand growth in the
early and mid-1980s, and stagnating prices touched off the farm
financial crisis,'' he said. ``Land values plummeted as farmers'
returns did not keep up with earlier expectations.''
   Gajewski said that a few years ago ``U.S. grain surpluses were
so big that much effort went into devising new ways to store it.''
Now, some analysts are worried about the low levels of food
reserves.
   Farm income has risen dramatically from the ebb of the early
'80s. After allowing for inflation, 1989 income is expected to be
up about 35 percent from 1984, ``when farmers were struggling
through their worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,''
he said.
   Land values have been rising the last couple of years, although
Gajewski noted new survey information showing that farmland prices
are expected to rise much more slowly in 1990.
   Because land values embody profits expected for the next decade,
Gajewski said the recent slowing could reflect concerns about
long-term trends in commodity prices, new farm legislation due in
1990, negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, and future policies under the 1992 European unity plan.
   But he added, ``On a more basic level, the slowing likely
reflects farmers' more cautious attitudes following the financial
crisis'' earlier this decade.

   A proposal by President Bush to overhaul
federal pesticide regulations, including faster action to take
chemicals off the market, has drawn generally favorable reaction
from major farm and commodity organizations.
   The president said Thursday that the plan was partly in response
to public's concern over stories ``alleging the presence of
dangerous levels of pesticides.''
   While claiming the nation's food supply to be safe, he said
``some of the public's perception is based on valid concerns about
the government's slow and cumbersome process for removing
pesticides from the market.''
   Bush mentioned a high degree of awareness by Americans of news
stories earlier this year on the presence of the cancer-causing
chemical Alar on some apples; and, more recently, concern about the
widespread use of the fungicide EBDC on fruits and vegetables.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
paid tribute to a provision in Bush's plan that would impose a
``negligible risk'' standard on pesticides.
   Some had advocated a ``zero tolerance'' standard, which would
ban all traces of suspected chemicals in food.
   ``Those who favor `zero tolerance' and farmers disarming
themselves and surrendering to all pests probably won't be happy
with this,'' Kleckner said. ``But they wouldn't be happy with the
disruptions in the food supply and distribution system that would
result from such policies, either.''
   Five major commodity organizations said in a joint statement
that they supported Bush's effort as a commitment ``to building
consumer confidence in our food supply, which is already the safest
food supply in the world.''
   The statement was issued by the American Soybean Association,
National Association of Wheat Growers, National Corn Growers
Association, National Cotton Council, and U.S. Rice Producers
Legislative Group.

   Carol L. Levy, a special agent in the
Agriculture Department, has been recognized as this year's
outstanding woman in federal law enforcement.
   Levy, a native of suburban Chicago, Ill., on Thursday was
presented the 1989 Julie Y. Cross Award by the Interagency
Committee on Women in Federal Law Enforcement. The award is named
in honor of a U.S. Secret Service agency killed in the line of duty.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Levy, who works for
the department's Office of Inspector General in Hyattsville, Md.,
has ``exhibited great resourcefulness, demonstrated strong
leadership qualities and sound decision-making'' in her career.
   Levy, 35, was born in Evergreen Park, Ill., and began with the
agency in 1976 as an investigator in the Chicago regional office
after graduating from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a
degree in criminal justice and psychology.
   In 1987, Levy became the department's first female assistant
regional inspector general for investigations.

   Congress is taking action in an effort to
resolve the 8-month-old Eastern Airlines strike.
   ``We are delighted that the Senate has approved this
labor-supported proposal, which provides a process that should lead
to a fair and equitable settlement of the Eastern Airlines
strike,'' AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland said about Thursday's
vote.
   President Bush has refused to involve the government in the
dispute despite his well-established power under the Railway Labor
Act. Bush has said he wants management and the employees to resolve
the dispute.
   The Senate, on a 65-35 vote, approved its version of a bill to
create a commission to resolve the strike affecting about 30,000
machinists, flight attendants and pilots who have been off the job
since March. 3.
   The House earlier approved a similar measure.
   The Senate version would create a four-member bipartisan
commission consisting of one House member and one senator from each
party, appointed by the respective party leaders in Congress.
   Fifty-five Senate Democrats were joined by 10 Republicans in
supporting the bill. No Democrats voted against it.
   Bush's Republican allies have tried for almost as long as the
strike to forestall a vote, but Senate Democrats voted earlier this
month to close debate.
   On Thursday, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Bush's
inaction was incomprehensible.
   ``Mr. President, nobody is asking you to come down on the side
of the workers, the strikers,'' Metzenbaum said. ``Nobody is asking
you to come down on the side of management.''
   Metzenbaum cited 34 occasions in which presidents have appointed
emergency boards, settling 26 strikes.
   The panel created by the Senate bill would make recommendations
on how to settle the strike and make further recommendations on
maintaining competiveness in the airline industry. The panel also
would make recommendations on how to protect employee collective
bargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving air carriers.
   The report would be due in 45 days after enactment.
   Five days after the strike began, Eastern filed for protection
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act. The company has continued efforts to
reorganize in bankruptcy court and has said it plans to emerge as a
carrier two-thirds its former size.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer to reduce nuclear
weapons in the Baltic Sea carries little military risk for the
Soviets and fits into their plans to reduce global tension and
justify needed defense cuts at home, say Bush administration
officials.
   Gorbachev faces huge economic problems and needs to reduce
military spending to help solve them, Assistant Secretary of State
Raymond G. Seitz said Thursday.
   And one Pentagon source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Soviets can use nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, bombers
or cruise missiles to hit the same European targets as the missiles
carried aboard the submarines Gorbachev proposed eliminating.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union had removed two Golf-class
submarines from the Baltic and would destroy the remaining four by
the end of the year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Gorbachev's proposal
made in Finland appeared well-intentioned but might require greater
cuts by the Atlantic Alliance than by the Soviet bloc.
   ``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security in
Europe,'' he said.
   Despite the brushoff to the proposed nuclear reduction in the
Baltics, the Bush administration notified the Soviet Union it is
willing to discuss an offer by Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
to curtail military bases in Europe.
   ``We support that aim and are willing to work with them to
preserve their security through political rather than military
means,'' the State Department said in a statement. The statement
noted that previous proposals have appeared aimed at the
elimination of U.S. bases on foreign soil, which the department
said ``we cannot accept.''
   Seitz, addressing a conference organized by the Washington
Journalism Center, withheld final judgment of Gorbachev's Baltics
statement. But he noted that in 1986 and 1987, the Soviet leader
made a number arms control proposals turned out to be ``sleights of
hand.''
   ``There hasn't been much of this in the last six months or so,''
Seitz said. ``In the year or two preceding that, there was almost
an arms control initiative a week. And a lot of them were made for
rather propagandist, political purposes rather than with the
serious intention of dealing with the hard arms control issue.''
   Serious arms control proposals made by Gorbachev, designed to
cut conventional forces or move forward on a proposed Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, reflect his need to cut the Soviet defense
budget, said Seitz.
   Gorbachev is ``driven by two considerations, the first being the
sheer weight of military expenditure,'' said Seitz.
   ``If you had to pick one single explanation for the huge budget
deficit in the Soviet Union, and for the arthritic economic pace in
the Soviet Union, it would be the disproportionate amount of
military expenditure, and that simply has got to be gotten under
control,'' Seitz said.
   The Soviet military consumes up to 17 percent of gross national
product, about twice the ratio spent by the Pentagon, according to
the Central Intelligence Agency. That means that because the U.S.
economy is about twice the size of the Soviet, the superpowers
spend about the same amount on defense.
   Gorbachev's second consideration, said Seitz, has a broader
political purpose: ``Attempting to go through with what is a
massive effort to restructure not only the Soviet economy but
Soviet psychology, requires non-threatening, relatively safe,
stable, predictable external circumstances so that all the energy
and attention can be devoted to attempting to change the Soviet
Union.''
   Gorbachev, addressing a group of Finnish politicians and
businessmen, said Thursday ``we are prepared to come to agreement
with all the nuclear powers and the Baltic states on effective
guarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea.''
   According to the Pentagon, the Soviets had four of the aging
diesel-powered Golf-2 submarines in the Baltic. Each can deliver
three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles on targets in Europe, according the
Pentagon book, Soviet Military Power.
   Pentagon officials declined to say whether the U.S. military had
any nuclear weapons in the Baltic Sea.

   An earthquake more deadly than last week's
jolt is 50 percent likely near San Francisco, and a catastrophic
``big one'' is at least 60 percent probable in Southern California
by the year 2018, scientists say.
   Overall odds for such quakes, which could kill thousands of
people, were listed in a 1988 U.S. Geological Survey study. They
remain unchanged by the Oct. 17 upheaval that claimed at least 63
lives in the San Francisco Bay area, said USGS geophysicist Jim
Dieterich, the report's lead author.
   The report predicted a 30 percent chance by 2018 for a magnitude
6.5 quake on the segment of the San Andreas that caused last week's
quake. That jolt measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, suggesting the
forecast was conservative.
   The earthquake ``makes one realize these forecasts are serious
and reliable,'' said California Institute of Technology geologist
Kerry Sieh, one of 12 co-authors of the study, which represented a
scientific consensus.
   The report said a repeat of San Francisco's magnitude 8.3 great
earthquake of 1906 is less than 10 percent within 30 years. The
1906 quake ruptured the San Andreas Fault and killed at least 2,500
people, according to recent studies.
   The next magnitude 7 major quake will be much more devastating
than the recent jolt because it will be located closer to the city
on either the San Andreas or Hayward faults, Dieterich and others
said.
   ``The chance of another destructive or more destructive
earthquake in the Bay area is still high, and the chances in
Southern California are even higher,'' Sieh said.
   The study listed overall 30-year probabilities of 50 percent for
a magnitude 7 quake in the Bay area, and 60 percent to perhaps 70
percent odds that the ``big one'' measuring 7.5 to 8.3 on the
Richter scale will rupture the San Andreas Fault in Southern
California.
   Last week's quake raised the chance of an earthquake on the San
Andreas Fault between Los Gatos and Daly City, closer to San
Francisco. It slightly lowered the chance of a quake on the segment
south of Los Gatos, which is where last week's quake was centered.
   But the overall odds for a magnitude 7 quake in the Bay area
remain 50-50 by 2018, Dieterich calculated.
   A magnitude 7 earthquake on either the San Andreas or the
Hayward faults closer to San Francisco ``would be much more
devastating than last week's earthquake,'' Dieterich said Wednesday
by telephone from Menlo Park.
   ``Damage for a Hayward Fault magnitude 7 earthquake would be
comparable to a great earthquake occurring along the San Andreas
Fault in Southern California,'' he said. ``The Hayward runs right
through Oakland, Berkeley and the rest of the East Bay.''
   A 1980 report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
estimated a magnitude 7.4 quake on the Hayward Fault could kill
3,000 to 7,000 people, hospitalize 13,000 to 27,000 and cause $44
billion in damage. No estimate exists for a magnitude 7 quake.
   The same report said a repeat of the 1906 catastrophe could kill
3,000 to 11,000 people, hospitalize 12,000 to 44,000 and cause $38
billion in damage. A quake of magnitude 8.3 in Southern California
could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people, hospitalize 12,000 to 55,000 and
cause $17 billion in damage.
   ``Everybody who lives in California should be ready for an
earthquake at any time, and that means tomorrow,'' said Don
Anderson, director of Caltech's seismological laboratory. ``Just
because someone says there is a 30 percent probability of a big
earthquake in the next 30 years doesn't mean it won't happen
tomorrow.''

   Armenian youngsters who survived a
crippling earthquake in their country relived the horror after
coming here for treatment of physical and emotional problems.
   Fifteen-year-old Gayana Kaloustian whose hometown of Leninagan
was heavily damaged in the December 1988 quake in the Soviet
republic, said she was more frightened when the Bay area quake
struck Oct. 17.
   ``I didn't realize what was going on in Armenia, but I did
here,'' she said through an interpreter.
   But after the quake here ended, she said her fears vanished
because ``I was waiting for everything to fall down, but it
didn't.'' Her right leg was crushed in the Armenian quake, which
left thousands dead, injured and homeless.
   The children are staying at homes of Armenians who live in th
San Francisco Bay area and are undergoing treatment at the
Shriner's Hospital here. They were flown here by the Armenian
Relief Society, an international organization that collected $5
million in donations after the Armenian quake.
   Shriner's Hospital spokeswoman Mary Murphy said hospital
staffers and Armenian-Americans who have the children in their
homes feel ``they're responding very well emotionally. ... They're
doing extremely well.''
   The youngsters are ``feeling very safe since nothing fell down
on top of them,'' she said. ``That's what they associate with. We
just had a couple of lights fall on the floor at the hospital. Look
at the scene in Armenia. It was total devastation.''
   But for many of the children, the first reaction to the Bay area
quake was panic.
   One boy bolted outdoors and wouldn't enter a building for
several hours. Another couldn't eat and others cried, expecting the
worst.
   ``When the earthquake happened here, I was very frightened and I
cried,'' Meher Pahahlavian, 12, said. ``I was so scared I couldn't
eat.''
   His 10-year-old sister was killed in the 1988 quake, which
leveled their hometown of Spitak. He was brought here Oct. 1 for
treatment of a bone infection that developed from injuries suffered
when he was trapped in rubble for about two hours.
   ``Over there, it was horrible,'' he said. ``Over there,
everything tumbled down. But over here, nothing came down. ... I
wasn't half as scared as I was over there.''
   Still, the Oct. 17 quake and many aftershocks made a big
impression on the boy. ``When I'm alone, I really worry about
earthquakes,'' he said. ``But when you guys are with me, I seem to
forget.''
   Soviet psychiatrists who studied the emotional problems of
Armenian quake victims visited the children Thursday and said they
were doing well.
   Dr. Yuri Alexandrovsky, director of the National Center for
Neurotic and Borderline Psychiatric Disorders in Moscow, said
through an interpreter, ``The kids who experienced the Armenian
earthquake first were shocked much more than kids of similar age in
America.''
   ``They were afraid the houses here couldn't stand the earthquake
and they were waiting for the roofs to fall down,'' he said.
   ``But they returned to a normal state sooner than American kids
because the most fear for them was the collapse of buildings,''
said Alexandrovsky, who was one of four Soviets here to attend a
meeting of the International Society for the Traumatic Stress
Studies.
   ``It's nice to see the smiling faces of Armenian kids, because
it was awful to see the masks of horror on their faces during the
1988 earthquake when they were taken out of the ruins of their
houses.''

   The stiffest security measures in
Costa Rican history are in effect as hemispheric leaders gather to
celebrate the centennial of this nation's democracy.
   ``The leaders of drug trafficking have put a price on the heads
of some of the presidents,'' said Information Minister Jose Urbina,
trying to explain the security measures to a nation where the
president drives his own car to work and goes unescorted to movies
and restaurants.
   Streets in the center of town and along the 12-mile route to the
airport are closed to all but participants and accredited
journalists today and Saturday.
   This nation has no army, but 4,000 police officers have been
staging drills for weeks, charging across rooftops, closing the
airport, shutting off streets and creating temporary disruption for
almost everybody in this city of 1 million.
   Authorities erected a 75-foot-long glass wall in front of the
National Museum for Saturday's ceremonies dedicating Democracy
Plaza.
   The plaza is surrounded by numerous tall buildings that would
offer good vantage points to anyone who wanted to disrupt the
ceremonies.
   The buildings will be occupied by security forces Saturday, but
officials fearing for the safety of Presidents Bush and Virgilio
Barco of Colombia, as well as the 17 other hemispheric leaders
attending, decided that the best way to cut off any threat was to
build a glass wall 7 feet high across the podium.
   The glass was brought in on a U.S. Air Force transport plane and
erected Thursday under the supervision of U.S. Secret Service
agents.
   A Secret Service supervisor who refused to give his name said
the wall weighs 4.5 tons.
   ``It's pretty good,'' he said. ``It will do the job.''

   The sight of the earthquake-collapsed
section of Interstate 880 had a particularly devastating impact on
the man who designed the structure in the early 1950s. He watched
it crumble on television.
   ``I'm looking at a sandwich, and they're looking at a freeway,''
Clayton R. Giroux, 63, said in an emotional telephone interview
Wednesday with The Tribune of Oakland.
   Watching footage filmed from the Goodyear blimp when the
earthquake struck Oct. 17, Giroux knew before newscasters announced
it that the double-deck freeway had collapsed.
   ``I said, `My God, the blimp is panning over that and there's
got to be cars between there,''' he continued. ``I saw that it was
collapsed and I was horrified.''
   The days since the tragedy have been particularly trying for
Giroux, who has been in seclusion, ``pacing the floor and
fretting'' over what he considered one of his greatest engineering
achievements _ the state's first elevated freeway.
   ``I don't have guilt over it, just a stong sense of
disappointment and tragedy,'' he said. ``I cared very deeply about
doing a good engineering job and doing a job for an outfit that
serves people.''
   Giroux retired from the state Department of Transportation three
years ago. He began his career as a state bridge and highway
designer in 1948.
   Amid the flurry of criticism that the freeway was not built to
the engineering standards of its day, Giroux defended his creation.
   ``We were very proud of what we did,'' he said.
   Groux went on to explain that engineers included several
structural details in the design that quake experts now believe
contributed to the freeway's collapse.
   Steel hoops were placed in the structure's concrete columns to
stabilize the support system, but they ultimately make the pillars
vulnerable to buckling and collapse, experts say. Numerous,
criss-crossed ties are now used.
   ``The fraternity of engineers never knew that earthquakes
behaved in a way that would burst these columns,'' Giroux said.

   The Bush administration says it won't mind if
Congress forgives interest and penalties on an obscure liquor tax
that many tavern and restaurant owners on the deadbeat list say
they've never heard of.
   A Treasury Department official told a House Ways and Means
subcommittee Thursday that the administration ``does not oppose'' a
House plan to erase interest and penalties that accrued before July
on the 123-year-old tax.
   But Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant treasury secretary for tax
policy, stopped short of endorsing a waiver of the tax debts
themselves.
   Protests over the tax grew after a Pennsylvania Elks lodge got a
$9,776 bill last year for 50 years of non-payment and a California
pizza shop owner received a $2,911 bill four weeks ago.
   Owners of both establishments said they had never heard of the
``special occupational tax'' on liquor retailers.
   About 600,000 beer, wine and distilled spirits dealers who sell
directly to the public must pay the annual tax, which was increased
in January 1988 from $54 to $250 per retailer.
   Accompanying the increase has been a vigorous enforcement effort
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which took
responsibility for collections from the Internal Revenue Service in
1986.
   ``Although we continue to believe that taxpayer amnesty programs
are generally inappropriate, this case involves a tax that for
years before 1987 was insignificant and not well publicized,''
Gideon said in prepared testimony before the subcommittee on select
revenue measures.
   ``It appears that non-compliance in years before 1987 was due to
the fact that many taxpayers were simply not aware of the tax.
There is no evidence that dealers were attempting to avoid the
tax.''
   Only about 40 percent of retailers paid before 1987, Gideon
said, adding that the compliance rate has risen to 80 percent.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., proposed earlier that interest and
penalties on the tax accruing before July be forgiven. Rep. Paul
Kanjorski, D-Pa., told the subcommittee Thursday that it should
also forgive tax debts on the books before 1985.
   The National Restaurant Association and the National Grocers
Association, which blamed the large debts on lax enforcement by the
government, backed Kanjorski's approach.
   It was in Kanjorski's district that Elks Lodge 109 of
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., received a $9,776.98 tax bill. The lodge settled
for less than one-tenth that amount after saying it had not been
open and functioning for part of the period for which it was
charged.

<HEAD>Experts Recommend Further Delays in Opening Atomic Waste Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advisers are recommending that Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins order a longer test period before
opening the nation's first permanent dump for long-lived
radioactive waste from nuclear weapons plants.
   The proposed changes, if accepted by Watkins, would force the
Energy Department to arrange ``temporary'' storage of nuclear
wastes for a much longer period than planned, said Leonard Slosky,
one of five members of a blue-ribbon advisory group Watkins
impaneled two months ago to study the problem.
   Watkins already is having trouble persuading any of seven
selected states _ Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico,
Tennessee and South Carolina _ to store extra nuclear weapons waste
for about 2{ years starting in April.
   The waste had been going to Idaho, but Gov. Cecil Andrus banned
further shipments Sept. 1. Watkins had hoped to have a permanent
dump opened in New Mexico by now, but environmental and other
problems have delayed it indefinitely.
   Watkins told Congress earlier this month that he expected to
start ``operations demonstration'' of the permanent waste dump,
known as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, by September 1992. That
would involve loading, shipping, unloading, depositing and
retrieving drums of the nuclear waste to demonstrate that the
system _ the first of its kind in the world _ can work safely.
   The plant is near Carlsbad, N.M.
   On Tuesday, however, four of the five advisory panel members
told Watkins in a private meeting that the operational testing
should be put off for at least four years, Slosky said Thursday.
   That would mean the dump could take only a small amounts of
waste, equal to about 1 percent of its capacity, for the next four
or five years, said Slosky, an environmental scientist based in
Denver.
   Robert Bishop, representing a nuclear industry group, said he
was the lone dissenter on the advisory group. He added, however,
that all members agreed the Energy Department's plans for opening
the repository are probably too optimistic.
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., said in an interview that the
advisory group's conclusions would intensify the political pressure
on Watkins to solve the waste problem.
   ``It removes any pretense that the operational testing was
anything other than a device for getting waste into the ground ...
to relieve the waste storage problem,'' Skaggs said.
   The panel wrote no joint report but, instead, the members
presented their own recommendations in separate papers for Watkins
on Tuesday, Slosky and Bishop said in telephone interviews.
   Energy Department officials familiar with the reports did not
return a reporter's phone calls Thursday. The department has not
published the papers.
   An environmental group said in response to the advisory panel's
recommendations that Watkins faced further delays and political
fights over the dump.
   ``For political and technical reasons, it's not going to open
any time soon,'' said Elizabeth Kassen, a senior lawyer for the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   The panel members also told Watkins they saw serious management
problems that should be corrected before the dump is opened.
   In his written report to Watkins, Slosky stressed the importance
of completing tests to show the repository can handle the wastes
and remove them in the first few years if major problems are
discovered.
   ``However, given the current degree of uncertainty regarding the
ability of (the repository) to meet regulatory requirements, it is
not prudent to transport large quantities of waste'' to the site,
he wrote.

   The International Association of Fire Chiefs
is trying to make the American ritual of resetting the clocks into
an annual lifesaving event.
   The occasion is the switch from daylight to standard time, which
occurs officially at 2 a.m. Sunday.
   For the record, turn the clock back one hour.
   For all but a few Americans this is an event they cannot ignore
without the risk of being an hour early for everything until next
spring.
   The fire chiefs are promoting it as an occasion to make sure
they are safe as well as on time by putting a new battery in smoke
detectors.
   ``Change your clock, change your battery,'' is the simple
message.
   While 80 percent of the homes in America have smoke detectors,
as many as half don't work because the batteries are either old or
missing. A lack of the warning that smoke detectors can give is a
major factor in fire deaths and injuries, fire chiefs say.
   While people are concerned about fires and will buy and install
smoke detectors, it's easy to forget about them, the chiefs warn.
And the batteries will die eventually, leaving the home unprotected.
   Checking and replacing batteries is also a good idea in states
where the clocks don't have to be changed. Those few, which didn't
change to daylight time in the spring, include Arizona, Hawaii,
parts of Indiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American
Samoa.

   Roberts, a furniture builder in this city 45 miles northwest of

   There's only a wooden box with no sales
clerk or cash register at Harold Lineberger's pumpkin stand. You're
on your honor.
   ``Pumpkins $1, Honor System,'' a sign says. Lineberger isn't
worried.
   ``I'd say 99 percent of the people who buy pumpkins are
honest,'' Lineberger said. ``Most are families buying them as a
treat for the kids. People just don't steal with their families in
the car.''
   This week customers have bought scores of pumpkins and dropped a
dollar for each one into the locked box.
   ``I feel if you trust the public and let them know you trust
them, they'll reward you by being honest,'' he said.
   Lineberger has operated the stand off of Highway 275 in this
town about 20 miles west of Charlotte for eight years without a
clerk.
   ``I wouldn't try it with a table full of strawberries,'' he
says. ``But it's a good way to sell what I call low-profit produce
like pumpkins, broccoli and turnip greens. ... People don't like
them enough to steal them.''

   The Bush administration is leading the charge
for German reunification, an issue that conjures up memories of
World War II and makes some of the allies in Western Europe quite
nervous.
   The division of 80 million people between East and West was
never likely to be permanent. But the liberalization that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has fostered in Eastern and Central
Europe _ and a flood of East German refugees _ puts the issue on
the front burner.
   President Bush dealt with it this week in an interview with R.W.
Apple Jr. of The New York Times and he did not hedge.
   ``I don't share the concern that some European countries have
about a reunified Germany because I think Germany's commitment to
and recognition of the importance of the alliance is unsinkable,''
he said.
   Bush was referring to trends to neutralism among the German
people, many of whom recoil in horror from what they heard or
remember about World War II and from the nuclear age it ushered in.
   ``I don't see Germany, in order to get reunification, going off
into what some are concerned about and that is a neutralist path
that puts them at odds, or potentially at odds, with their NATO
partners,'' Bush said.
   Referring carefully to the unspeakable, Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a
Berlin-born analyst and former State Department official, said
recently: ``If one means re-establishing the previous German Reich,
even in a somewhat smaller territory, I think that is probably not
in the cards for any time soon.''
   But, Sonnenfeldt said: ``I think there is a lot of concern in
Europe about the reconstitution of something that resembles the
previous united Germany that existed from 1871 on and especially in
the Hitlerian period.''
   Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president and director of
research at the Heritage Foundation, said Thursday that ``only we
can devise a framework in which a united Germany can emerge that
does not terrify its neighbors _ Eastern and Western.''
   West Germany has been a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization since 1955. Its admission to the U.S.-led alliance
against the Soviet Union confirmed its acceptance as a democracy
and also marked recognition of German rearmament.
   The turnabout since Hitler plunged the world in 1939 into the
worst war in recorded history, and set about to exterminate Jews
and other ``undesirables,'' was complete.
   Only Turkey within NATO has a larger armed force, 600,000
strong. Like the Germans, the Turks also confront the Soviet Union.
   Visiting Washington a few weeks ago, Manfred Woerner, the former
West German defense minister who is now NATO's secretary general,
predicted NATO will continue to exist, with changes.
   He even saw merit in the survival of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact,
calling it a force for stability.
   And yet, East Germany may be catching the democratic fever. Some
60,000 of its citizens have fled to West Germany and those who
stayed behind want a better life. They need only to look to Hungary
to know it is possible within the Warsaw Pact.
   Egon Krentz, the new East German chief of state, was viewed
initially as an anti-reformer. Now some analysts are not so sure.
He appealed Tuesday for public support in overcoming an economic
and refugee crisis. ``Young and old, we must all work together,''
he said.
   If the lines between East and West begin to blur, so also might
the division of the two Germanys, and with it could go both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, asked Monday after a
speech in San Francisco about the German question, replied: ``When
we talk about that we're talking about self-determination for the
peoples of East Germany ... achieved in peace and freedom so that
the people of East Germany ultimately will be integrated into a
community of democratic European nations.''
   Baker did not specify how this could be accomplished, but he
acknowledged that ``the word `reunification' conjures up visions of
a return to 1937 borders or perhaps a reunification that is not
achieved through peace and freedom.''

   When town Fire Marshal Christopher
Siwy married volunteer firefighter Ruth Ann Louise Brydon, they
heard blaring sirens instead of pealing church bells.
   A fire truck's elevated platform became their altar. Hose
nozzles served as vases for bouquets of flowers. And while the
bride wore white, the groom dressed in his fire marshal uniform.
   Brydon, 36, arrived at her wedding Wednesday in the fire
marshal's official car. She and Siwy, 31, stepped into the bucket
of a firetruck's cherry picker as a wedding march played from a
tape machine.
   As he joined them in marriage, Justice of the Peace William
DiBella warned the couple that even the best marriages must endure
storms ``and fires.''
   ``But your ship of life and your firetruck will carry you safely

<HEAD>Money for Drug War Moving Forward Again in Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Almost $3.2 billion to step up the war on
drugs is moving forward again in Congress after agreement between
House and Senate negotiators.
   The money represents the major congressional contribution to the
war that was launched by President Bush on Sept. 5 but appeared
stalled since the plan cleared the Senate on Sept. 27.
   A House-Senate conference committee on Thursday reached
agreement on the funds, which bring to $8.8 billion the total
commitment to the campaign against narcotics, $900 million more
than the administration initially sought.
   The House accepted overall funding levels for the war on drugs
contained in an $11.9 billion transportation bill the Senate
approved Sept. 27.
   Floor action on the bill in the House is expected Tuesday. It
was not immediately certain when the Senate plans to vote on the
measure.
   The Senate accepted a House proposal to change the way lawmakers
will cut other programs to pay for the drug war.
   As approved by the Senate, the bill called for a 0.43 percent
cut in programs throughout the government but only 0.3 percent of
it across the board. Congressional subcommittees were to make
adjustments in programs to get the rest of the money, thus avoiding
excessive cuts in defense.
   The plan agreed upon by the conferees would give the
congressional subcommittees more freedom to choose what would be
cut.
   The compromise also dropped 60 pages of drug-fighting program
authorizations that the Senate harnessed to the money bill.
   The package included measures ranging from requiring each state
to have a drug-fighting plan to programs that would pave the way
for assistance to coca-producing nations in the Andes.
   House members said the authorizations, dealing with substantive
programs, had no business on an appropriation bill.
   Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., sent a letter to Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, promising that the House would
deal with the authorizations later.
   Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., questioned the leader of Senate
conferees, Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., on whether the House would be allowed to vote on the
measures sought by the president in unaltered form.
   ``I accept the assurances of the leadership,'' Byrd said.
   Coughlin said afterward, though, that he remained worried that
the president's programs might come to the House floor packaged
with additional items unpalatable to Republicans and ``lord only
knows what.''
   ``Or the president's program would be so limited and watered
down,'' he added.
   Before the conferees acted, national drug control policy
director William J. Bennett had criticized Congress' slow pace in
acting on the president's proposal.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Criticize Bush's Pesticide Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan to improve pesticide
regulation is being criticized in Congress as doing nothing to make
food safer but praised for promoting needed bureaucratic
improvements.
   ``The president deserves credit for reforming the outdated and
extremely cumbersome procedures for removing dangerous pesticides
from use,'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Thursday. ``But
better procedures are meaningless if the safety standards are
weakened.''
   The president's proposal ``offers absolutely no assurances that
our food will be free of dangerous pesticides,'' he said.
   Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on health and the environment, has introduced legislation of his
own to reform pesticide use and said he would consider Bush's
proposal during hearings within the next three weeks.
   Waxman's bill is among several in Congress that have various
plans for regulating the way chemicals are used in farming.
   Bush's proposal includes:
   _Redefining the criteria to be used for temporarily removing or
suspending from use a pesticide that poses a possible health
hazard, making it easier to get the chemical off the market even
though formal proceedings might still be under way.
   _Streamlining the procedures under which a dangerous pesticide
may be permanently removed from the market. Officials said the
process would reduce by at least half the four-to-eight years it
often takes for a chemical to be banned.
   _Providing tougher enforcement against misuse of pesticides,
including a proposal to increase penalties from $5,000 per day to
$25,000 per day.
   ``President Bush's proposal ... will enhance the government's
ability to remove potentially hazardous pesticides from the
marketplace,'' said Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., ranking Republican on
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
   In the Senate, Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
criticized Bush's plan.
   ``The administration is taking one step forward and two steps
back when it weakens important food safety protections in exchange
for some procedural improvements in pesticide regulations,'' said
Leahy, D-Vt.
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., a member of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee, likened the Bush proposal
to an Impressionist painting.
   ``The closer you get to it, the fuzzier it looks,'' he said.
   Lawmakers complain about Bush's proposal to increase the risk
level allowed before a pesticide is removed from the market. Waxman
said that under the plan, cancer risks of chemicals used on crops
could be as high as 1 in 10,000.
   ``This is 100 times greater than the Food and Drug
Administration says is acceptable,'' Waxman said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said it was ``unacceptable that
the administration is proposing to weaken current federal health
and safety standards, and then prohibit states from setting higher
standards themselves.''
   Uniform pesticide standards are needed for international trade
purposes, said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   ``State governments should not have a standard that is different
from those of the federal government,'' he said.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said Bush's plan was ``a workable approach'' that would ``make the
world's safest food supply even safer.''

<HEAD>US Congress Wants to Help Its Polish Counterpart</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Congress wants to lend a helping hand
to its fledgling counterpart in Poland by providing the hardware
and software of western-style democracy.
   The Senate late Thursday approved a resolution that will send a
team of congressional experts to Poland to study the needs of the
newly formed parliament. They will come up with an aid package that
includes everything from telephones and typewriters to training in
how to write laws.
   ``While we're talking about the bigger issues of loan
stabilization, of economic reform, of food aid, it is quite
appropriate for Congress to give this as a first gift of
democracy,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, a sponsor of the initiative.
   Poland's first open elections since before World War II, held in
April, gave the country its first non-communist-dominated
government in four decades. But the newly elected lawmakers, many
of them workers with no previous experience in government, soon
found they had inherited an empty shell of a legislature, Domenici
said.
   Used only to rubber-stamp decisions of previous communist
governments, the parliament has no mechanism for drafting laws, or
even keeping track of laws already on the books. There is no
organizational structure like the U.S. Congress' system of
committees. There are no workable rules of procedure for the Sejm,
the lower house, or the newly created Senate.
   Domenici and a group of former U.S. lawmakers went to Poland in
September to meet with a select group of the new legislators,
including members of the now-dominant Solidarity party and other
parties.
   The new elected officials are bright, able and motivated, he
said. One is a manager at a tractor factory, another a physician at
the Gdansk shipyards, another a college professor and another a
union leader. The group probably had more experience in organizing
protests than in governing; many had spent time in jail under the
old regime.
   ``We thought we were going to talk about economics, how you
create a capitalist system,'' Domenici, R-N.M., said in an
interview. ``They were interested in that, but they really wanted
to know how to run a parliament.
   ``It boiled down to basics: How do you gather information? How
do you get sufficient information-gathering equipment to keep track
of your laws? They have no library system, no simple computer
system, no copying machines. They don't have a system of producing
reports.
   ``So while we talked about a lot of philosophical things ...
they need some of the basic equipment that we take for granted,''
Domenici said. When the group _ which included former Sens. Walter
Mondale, Thomas Eagleton and Howard Baker, and former Rep. James
Jones _ suggested it could come up with some help, ``they were just
ecstatic,'' said Domenici.
   Congress, in the next few months, will send aides familiar with
computers, legislative research and parliamentary procedure to
Poland to inventory training and equipment needs. Congress then
will seek donations from the U.S. private sector to get the new
Senate and Sejm started.
   Domenici acknowledged he has gotten some ribbing for wanting to
share abroad the expertise of Congress, which is not exactly noted
at home for its own efficiency. But he said there will be no
courses on how to avoid meeting budget targets, or how to cut
pork-barrel deals.
   ``I know some might look at how we conduct our business and say,
`We sure don't want to pass that over to Poland.' But when you look
at this brand-new democracy that has such tremendous respect for
the United States of America ... it seems to me that this is a rare
opportunity to at least say we care.''

<HEAD>Stockpiling of Relief Goods Triggers Voucher System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoarding of disaster relief food,
clothing and other supplies prompted officials at a relief center
to require the needy to obtain vouchers from an agency four miles
away.
   Until Wednesday's crackdown, the donated items were passed out
to anyone who asked at the Salvation Army's downtown relief center.
The system angered some volunteers.
   ``I can't believe it. This is absurd,'' said Antoinette Pilz, a
volunteer from the Church of the Highlands in South San Francisco.
``You've got to trust people. There is enough food in Watsonville
to feed the entire city for two months.''
   But officials said the system will continue, with the needy
required to go to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
headquarters in the northern section of town for the vouchers.
   ``We will continue to do vouchers now,'' said Lt. Clayton
Gardner of the Salvation Army's downtown relief center. ``We are
concerned we will go down to Salinas this weekend and find half our
stuff being sold at the flea market.''
   Gardner and others complained that some residents had loaded up
on much more donated clothing and other items than they could
possibly use. The display of greed prompted the security crackdown,
making it difficult for the people the agencies are trying to serve.
   City Councilman Dennis Osmer said there was undoubtedly some
stockpiling of relief goods.
   ``We do have a lot of hoarding, but if people are hoarding and
we give out four times what they need, we have four times what they
need. Let's give it to them,'' Osmer said.
   Some people were turned away at the downtown relief center
Thursday morning if they didn't have the proper papers.
   ``We realize a lot of these people won't go to the disaster
assistance center because they are illegal aliens, but we want
these people to see the wealth of services available to them and
getting them there is the only way to do it,'' said Gardner, who
conceded the system had caused hardship.
   A Spanish-speaking woman, carrying two young children, asked a
volunteer for a toy and was told she needed a voucher.
   ``It was a giveaway. It got to the point where the Red Cross and
the military started to control that and now people that really
need it are given the runaround and given a hard time,'' said Jose
Luis Fernandez, division director at California Employment Training
here.
   Volunteer Ed Vasquez said the city no longer wanted quake
refugees living in tents. The city estimates 1,200 people were left
homeless by the quake, while the Salvation Army claims there are
closer to 4,000 or 5,000 living oudoors.
   ``The idea is getting them to go to FEMA to find out what's
available,'' said Vasquez. ``We recognize many are going to be
intimidated by going to a federal agency. We are just trying to
make a human effort to get them back in some kind of shelter.''
   One of the unauthorized migrant camps that have sprung up since
the quake is at Callaghan Park, where 250 people are living in
tents and being cared for by Salude Para La Gente, a state and
federally funded Hispanic outreach group.
   At the park, mattresses are set up on wooden pallets to keep
rainwater from soaking people or belongings. The spicy scent of
chili peppers wafted from barbeques. A large green millitary tent
stored the community's supply of food.
   Democratic state Sens. Henry Melo of Watsonville and Art Torres
of Los Angeles toured the Callaghan camp Thursday and assured
residents there would be no check on citizenship.
   FEMA and other relief agenies ``are here to provide humanitarian
aid and are not interested in asking about citizenship status,''
Melo said.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is
disputing the new Securities and Exchange Commission chief's
contention that the SEC doesn't need the power to halt trading in
stock market emergencies.
   Testifying before a Senate panel in support of proposed market
reform legislation, Brady said Thursday taht the Bush
administration supports giving the SEC emergency powers to suspend
or halt trading for up to 24 hours.
   One day earlier, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a House
panel he neither wanted nor needed the emergency power, one of four
changes originally proposed by the SEC in the wake of the 1987
stock market crash.
   Brady declined to comment further on his testimony after the
hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   Breeden, on the job just two weeks, said through a spokeswoman
late Thursday that he had no comment.
   On Wednesday, Breeden said safety mechanisms called
circuit-breakers _ automatic, temporary trading halts in times of
market volatility _ have eliminated much of the need for officials
to halt trading.
   Breeden told the telecommunications and finance subcommittee of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee that he believed the
possibility of arbitrary halts could cause uncertainty and
volatility in the markets. The power to make such a decision should
remain where it is now _ with the president, he contended.
   Brady, in a letter accompanying his testimony, said, however,
that he believed the change is needed.
   The initial governmental response to market emergencies should
come ``from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the
markets,'' Brady said.
   Brady noted that the proposed legislation still gives the
president power to terminate SEC emergency actions and would
require presidential approval for any trading halt longer than 24
hours.
   In other testimony, Brady backed away from a recommendation made
by a commission he headed that investigated the 1987 crash when the
Dow Jones industrial average, a key market indicator, dropped more
than 500 points in one day. Brady said his crash study may have
``overreacted'' in calling for a super-regulator to oversee all the
financial markets.
   In his first testimony to Congress since the 190-point plunge in
the Dow Jones industrial average Oct. 13, Brady said the turmoil
had not altered his belief in the soundness of the U.S. economy.
But it did point out the need for further changes in market
regulation, he said.
   Brady suggested giving the SEC authority to request reports on
large securities and options trades, as well as rules for assessing
the financial soundness of the parent holding companies of
broker-dealers.
   Legislation making such changes, with minor variations, is
before the House.
   A January 1988 report on the previous October's 508-point stock
market crash, the presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms _
headed by Brady _ recommended that one agency should coordinate all
the financial markets. That recommendation was one of several never
acted upon by the Reagan administration.
   Given the different political constituencies of the various
market regulators _ the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Federal Reserve Board _ ``I don't believe that's
a practical possibility,'' said Brady.

   Earthquake survivor Julio Berumen has
been flooded with donations, toys and get-well cards, but the
6-year-old boy still cries out for the one thing no one can give
him _ his mother.
   She died within inches of him when the upper deck of the Nimitz
freeway slammed down on their car in last week's earthquake.
   Rescuers had to amputate Julio's right leg to free him from the
wreckage. And while doctors believe that Julio and his 8-year-old
sister, Cathy, will survive their injuries, friends of the
close-knit family are hoping the quake did not kill the children's
bright spirits.
   When Julio's first-grade teacher brought a toy to him at the
hospital this week, ``he started crying,'' said the teacher,
Manuela Knight.
   ``He was probably wondering, `Why is my teacher coming to see me
and not my mother?' '' Knight said Thursday.
   She said Julio was ``everybody's friend'' in her class _ spunky,
confident, and obviously the product of a warm and supportive
family.
   ``I saw him Tuesday and he's not the same little boy, but I hope
his spirit comes back,'' she said.
   When the quake struck, Julio and Cathy were riding home from the
orthodontist with their mother, Petra Berumen, and a family friend,
Yolanda Orozco. The Berumens' red Ford was crushed by a concrete
pillar when the double-decked Interstate 880 collapsed, trapping
dozens of cars.
   Mrs. Berumen and Orozco were killed. Cathy escaped with head
injuries. But Julio was trapped alive, his legs pinned in the
crumpled car.
   Rescuers used a chainsaw to cut the body of Orozco in half,
allowing a doctor to slide in and amputate Julio's right leg at the
knee to free him.
   Previous reports said the body of the boy's mother had been cut
by rescue workers working to free him, but Joseph Blackwell, a
deputy coroner investigator in the Alameda County coroner's office,
said Thursday that it was Orozco's body.
   Her body was recovered Oct. 19, Blackwell said, and Berumen's
body had to be cut Oct. 20 to free it from the wreckage.
   Julio has been in surgery three times since the quake, and his
sister underwent an eight-hour operation Wednesday for fractures in
her skull and facial bones, said Steve Tiger, spokesman at
Children's Hospital in Oakland.
   Cathy's condition was listed as serious Thursday, but only
because she was recovering from surgery. Otherwise, both children
are in good condition, Tiger said.
   ``They're sturdy little kids,'' said hospital spokeswoman Diane
Lazzari. They'll have plenty of support in their recovery. Their
father, Pastor, has kept a vigil by their bedsides, aided by aunts
and uncles.
   Friends and teachers at San Pablo's Downer Elementary School are
planning a fund-raising spaghetti dinner and raffle when the
year-round school resumes Nov. 7 after a 15-day vacation. An
Oakland elementary school class sent $100 that the children had
raised for a field trip to a pumpkin patch.
   And strangers from around the country have sent Julio and Cathy
cash, checks, cards, toys, and ``more stuffed animals than they
would ever be able to use in a lifetime,'' Tiger said.
   By Thursday, the Julio and Cathy Berumen Relief Fund set up at
Oakland's Summit Bank had collected nearly $48,000.
   The largest contribution was $3,000 from a couple in South
Pasadena, Calif. One of the smallest was from Nissa Kauppila, 7, of
Ferrysburg, Vt., who sent $2.10 and two little pins _ a bunny and a
frog _ for Cathy and Julio.
   ``I'm sorry you got cot in the earthquake,''' Nissa printed in
crooked block letters. ``I hope you feel well soon.''
   A grandmother in Tampa, Fla., who lost her own grandson at age 6
sent $100. A Los Angeles woman whose daughter lost her leg sent
$25. Residents of an apartment complex in St. Petersburg, Fla., got
together and sent $220.
   ``Although I don't know you, our hearts have certainly been
touched,'' Anna Berrier of Huntersville, N.C., wrote to Pastor
Berumen. ``I'm praying the children and you will get through.''
   The letters and donations pour in, hundreds each day. ``I'm
having a hard time keeping my composure, opening these and reading
them,'' said bank worker Cindy Kyte.
   Another fund was set up at Donner School to help the family meet
day-to-day expenses such as mortgage payments, said Principal
Catherine Syverson.
   The Berumens, a proud couple born in Mexico, bought their first
home _ a small one-story house a few blocks from the school _ just
2{ months ago. Friends say their lives revolved around their
children.
   Mrs. Berumen dropped the kids off at school in the mornings and
picked them up in the afternoons, and she was one of a handful of
mothers who was actively involved in school affairs, said Manuela
Knight.
   Even with the death of his wife, the first concern of Pastor
Berumen, a construction worker, is Julio and Cathy.
   ``At the moment he has to concentrate all his energy on his
children. He doesn't even have time to deal with his wife's death
yet,'' Tiger said. ``He does want to get out a thank you to
everyone who has helped. But his concentration is elsewhere right
now.''
   Teachers regard Cathy as one of the brightest children at her
school. Polite and a little shy, she is a protective big sister who
occasionally came into Knight's classroom to check on her brother.
   Julio was an enthusiastic kickball player and possessed
irrepressible energy at an age when many kids are shy, Knight said.
Confident and cheerful, he was proceeding well in his bilingual
studies in English and Spanish.
   ``A little while ago, I told his mother in a parent-teacher
conference, `You don't have to worry about Julio, he's going to be
fine,' '' Knight said.
   ``I think I still feel that way. With support, I expect Julio to
have a full and wonderful life. If we all work to help him and his
father, then there's no reason why he can't.''

<HEAD>Advance Reported in Search for New Whooping Cough Vaccine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An FDA biologist says an Italian scientist's
genetic alteration of the whooping cough bacteria is a reasonable
candidate for use in upcoming tests on children in the search for a
safer vaccine.
   ``It's a significant and exciting step,'' Charles R. Manclark
said Thursday about Rino Rappuoli's recent findings.
   But Manclark, who runs the laboratory where the Food and Drug
Administration studies pertussis, or whooping cough, said he didn't
think it could be called a major breakthrough because tests on
children are months away.
   Rappuoli said in a telephone interview from the Sclavo Research
Center in Siena, Italy, that he had discovered a non-toxic vaccine
that doesn't appear to cause the side effects sometimes associated
with the current vaccine, yet it still protects against the disease.
   Widespread vaccination keeps whooping cough from affecting many
children in the United States, but it causes 1 million deaths a
year and affects 60 million infants worldwide.
   Most U.S. children are vaccinated before age 3, usually at the
same time they receive vaccines for diphtheria and typhoid.
Pertussis is the ``P'' in the DPT shots given to infants.
   Although the vaccine is credited with keeping the incidence of
the disease to around 4,000 cases a year in the United States, some
medical officials link it to cases of brain damage in some
children. Other medical experts say no evidence exists showing that
the vaccine is responsible for neurological disorders.
   Some lawsuits allege neurological disorders were caused by the
vaccine, and some parents have refused to let their children be
immunized.
   The current vaccine is made from whole pertussis bacteria cells
that have been killed. Rappuoli, along with U.S. researchers, has
been trying to find a way to eliminate the toxic effects of the
vaccine while retaining the portion of the dead bacteria that
causes the patient to develop immunity to the disease.
   Rappuoli, using genetic engineering, altered the bacteria to
develop multiple mutants that he said no longer include the toxic
portions but still provided immunity for mice in the study.
   ``Such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safer
vaccines against whooping cough,'' said the research, published in
today's issue of Science, the journal of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   Manclark said the FDA is trying to determine a test site for
clinical studies for the new vaccine. Those studies can't take
place in the United States because the disease is not widespread
enough, he said, adding that Denmark, Germany, Italy, England and
Thailand are potential sites.

   There's more to getting past the killer
earthquake that hit this area Oct. 17 than going to the World
Series and telling victims to ``go back to normal,'' an expert on
stress says.
   Government agencies dealing with earthquake victims must be
especially careful and use ``common sense and wisdom,'' added Dr.
Yael Danieli, president of the International Society for Traumatic
Stress Studies.
   ``Take your time,'' she advised local, state and federal
agencies. ``These are people whose lives are in shambles right in
front of their eyes.''
   ``Just to have an understanding attitude in itself would already
make people feel different,'' said Dr. Danieli. ``Wisdom seems to
be the casualty of bureaucratic stressful response.''
   Dr. Danieli, a clinical psychologist who has done extensive
research on Holocaust victims, said there are big differences
between man-made and natural disasters.
   ``But what victims in general potentially have in common ... is
a conspiracy of silence,'' she said. ``That is, victims are allowed
to be victims for a little while. Then you're supposed to go back
to normal, whatever that means.''
   ``After extraordinary events `normal' changes its meaning,'' she
said. ``But then the instruction, spoken or unspoken, is, `Shut up
already, go back to normal, the past is the past, bygones are
bygones, get down to business, go on with the business of living,
go to the baseball game, continue with the World Series, you
survived, what do you have to complain about?'''
   The problem with that is the continuing impact of ``the grief
and the rage and the fear and the nightmares and the worry about
the next day,'' she said.
   ``That's tough to bear alone, and victims potentially very often
wind up feeling very isolated, very alienated and in fact made to
feel crazy because how come they're still afraid, how come they
still want to cry, how come they're still afraid to feel? And this
all victims share in common.''
   Dr. Danieli said talk, of the sort scheduled at her
organization's meeting here, is valuable because ``the more you
talk, the more you don't need to re-experience without words.''
   ``The more you talk means the more you have people around you.
You don't feel as lonely and you don't feel as scared,'' she said.
``We believe in talking, we believe in the value of talking and
sharing.''
   Some 500 visiting psychologists, psychiatrists and other experts
in stress are attending the society's annual meeting here, and the
agenda was quickly changed to allow for an open forum to discuss
the quake and its impact on people.
   A local newspaper poll has sugested that three out of five San
Francisco Bay area residents are having emotional difficulties
because of the earthquake, including sleeplessness, nervousness,
irritability, difficulty in concentration and depression.

<HEAD>Lobby For Walkers' Rights Formed In Philadelphia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   City walkers tired of drivers nearly running
them down and garbage scattered in their paths now can unite for
safer and cleaner sidewalks.
   The recently formed Pedestrian Council, the second private
advocacy group for walkers in North America, intends to make
Philadelphia more walkable by challenging drivers who stop their
vehicles in crosswalks, seeking wider sidewalks and making sure
streets have enough trash bins.
   It will lobby city government for stricter enforcement of laws
that affect pedestrians and push to make new developments easier
for walkers, said John Higgins, executive director of the
Foundation for Architecture, the non-profit group that formed the
council.
   The council will name 20 board members at its first meeting in
mid-November, Higgins said.
   ``What's clear is that the interests of pedestrians are not the
focus for either public or private decision-makers,'' Higgins said.
``We want to build some understanding of what pedestrians' rights
are.''
   The only other similar group is in Ottawa, Ontario, said
Patricia Archibald, who organizes an annual convention in Boulder,
Colo., of city planners, architects and others responsible for
making cities better places to walk in.
   The Ottawa group is called Ottawalk. Executive Director Chris
Bradshaw said the group lobbies on behalf of pedestrians and
promotes walking as an alternative to driving.
   Ottawalk, formed 19 months ago, has 55 members who paid $10 each
to join.
   The pro-walking movement in Ottawa wasn't taken too seriously at
first, Bradshaw said, but city officials are beginning to listen as
more walkers speak up.
   ``It's really hard to find two or three pedestrians you can rub
together and say, `Let's do something about it,''' he said. ``The
main reaction is they have to shake their head and say `Is this for
real?'''
   The Pedestrian Council in Philadelphia doesn't plan on holding
membership drives. But it is seeking money.
   The group is off to a good first step: the state Department of
Community Affairs awarded it a one-year, $25,000 grant.
   The Philadelphia council has several items on its agenda:
pedestrian safety, sidewalk vendors, landscaping and seating,
noise, garbage bins, sidewalk encroachments by businesses and
access for the handicapped.
   And like the Ottawa group, it would like to see a major change
in the making of cars.
   Bradshaw said strides have been made on auto safety with padded
dashboards and seat belts, but little has been done to change the
design of auto bodies to make them less dangerous for pedestrians.
   ``We assume cars only hit other cars or objects larger than
itself. We never assume it will hit a 4-year-old child or a
policeman directing traffic,'' he said. ``What about the blind
person who's walking on the sidewalk, the poor person who can't
afford a car, the mother who's walking a stoller _ they didn't ask
to get into a world where a 2,000-pound hunk of metal is careening
around.''

<HEAD>French Designers Emphasize Female Glamour For '90s</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French designers sent a message in their fashion
shows over the last week that women for 1990 should be free,
feminine and sexy.
   Gone are the tailored power suits and the frilly little-girl
poufs that came out in the 1980s as a reaction to masculine
tailoring. Female glamour now reigns.
   The Parisian shows to display next summer's styles ended
Wednesday.
   The spotlight was on the bosom, in slashed decolletes and
plunging suit lapels. Some jackets were even flopping open to nude
breasts at Chanel and Saint Laurent.
   Heart-shaped necklines and curvy tulip jackets and skirts
contributed to the female silhouette. The slim waist was often
girdled or sashed in its place.
   Beautiful boleros, swallowtails and trapeze tops contributed to
the latest glamorous looks.
   Shoulders have softened up for next spring's rounded contours,
though discreet padding still gives shape in many outfits,
especially at Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent.
   For evening, off-the-shoulder, tight and low-cut bustier tops,
backless and sometimes frontless styles were paraded.
   Another Paris motto for next summer: legs are made for walking
in the new young miniskirts, hot pants, and flared shorts.
   They were best done with braid-piped hems, waistbands and
pockets by Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel who aimed his talents at a
whole new youth market for the traditionally elegant house.
   Cyclers' tights were popular on the catwalks, but are
forgettable for women over 14. And the many slim skirts to the knee
looked almost stodgy.
   More contemporary and to the point were asymmetrical
draped-front sarong or wrapped skirts _ especially done by masters
like Saint Laurent or Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel.
   Long sheer crepe or chiffon pleated pantskirts or flared pajamas
were prettier than ever. For sporty moments, cropped wide pants
will be a big item.
   The fabric combination of transparent-opaque is a great teaser
for next summer. It's well done as wispy little draped skirts with
strong, long jackets, or the reverse as transparent, billowy tops
over a solid skirt or pants.
   Some themes to remember:
   _ Animal prints seem to be permanent residents in the fashion
zoo. But talented designers like Christian Lacroix and Jean-Louis
Scherrer manage to keep the old cats spry.
   _ Safari styles with bush jackets, sometimes combining with
bare-midriffed sarongs rather than the usual skirts or shorts, were
another Paris favorite.
   _ Fabrics have never been more softly feminine. Linen has a
softly textured appeal, or becomes nearly as sheer as voile. Cool
wools are caressably soft and light, along with cotton poplin and
jerseys. Gossamer-light georgette crepes fluttered around the
runways.
   Organza is the hottest high-style summer fabric, memorable in
the huge bows at Dior and in cloud-like flounces and duster toppers
all over. A fresh white organza blouse or two should be any woman's
romantic staple for summer.
   Chiffon, also known as mousseline, wafted out in several shaded
layers for iridescence.
   Pique and cotton quilting looked especially fine at Lacroix.
Indian silks, satin, lace and brocades took a back seat to the
lighter fabrics, but were still striking.
   _ Colors for summer take off from classics of navy with blazing
white lapels, black-and-white and gray, going into the spicy shades
of curry and cinnamon, plus khaki and cafe au lait or chocolate.
   Contrasting with the sobriety were dusky pastels, celadon,
violet, wisteria, peach, raspberry, forest green and the stronger
shades like mimosa yellow, cornflower blue, tomato, shocking pink.
   Lacroix's cheery cotton hearts-and-stars prints were adorable,
and he still makes outsized houndstooth checks look good in dressy
street wear.
   Dior's smaller checks were interesting. Valentino, Lacroix and a
few others showed glen and tartan plaids. Outsized polka and
pin-dots were still fine in peppy outfits everywhere from Dior to
Saint Laurent.
   Ungaro's garden of prints toned down to prettier shades than
last year. Otherwise, floral motifs were simply sweet or big and
bold.
   Hats and headdresses were less weird than usual. A few boaters,
a top hat at Dior, garden-party sun hats, pillboxes and several
types of sailor hats topped off the clothes.
   Low-heeled or flat pumps, sandals, biking and tennis-type shoes
_ often shown with black or white tights _ were sensible but not
clumpy. High-heeled pumps and sandals gave finesse to the sexier
late-day wear.

<HEAD>Justice Department Seems to be Focusing on Child Porn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal obscenity prosecution statistics
suggest that the Justice Department is focusing more of its
anti-smut efforts on child pornography rather than on material that
involves adults.
   The figures show a sharp drop in the last two years in the
number of federal indictments for violations of federal obscenity
laws, while child-pornography charges soared during the same time
period.
   Indictments for federal obscenity violations dropped from 66 in
1987 to 37 last year, according to figures compiled by the
department's National Obscenity Enforcement Unit.
   The figures may not be complete because U.S. attorneys are not
required to report obscenity prosecutions, said spokesman Joseph
Krovisky.
   But FBI figures reflect a similar trend.
   The number of obscenity cases pending at the bureau dropped from
355 in 1987 to 302 in 1988 and to 194 in the first nine months of
the 1989 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.
   Federal child-pornography prosecutions, meanwhile, jumped from
281 in 1987 to 406 last year, according to the obscenity unit's
figures.
   In a speech to the Religious Alliance Against Pornography on
Thursday, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh pledged to attack all
forms of illegal pornography, including material depicting sexual
acts by adults.
   But the attorney general repeatedly emphasized he considered
child pornography ``the most offensive of all'' and cautioned that
officials must be sensitive to First Amendment protections.
   ``Pornography to me is degrading to human dignity in every form,
but it is most degrading to the human dignity of those who are
innocent and defenseless and who are preyed upon by criminal
actors,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``We must be attentive to the preservation of First Amendment
rights just as we are attentive to the enforcement of laws that
attack those practices that lie outside the area of First Amendment
protection.''
   When the obscenity unit was created in 1987 by Thornburgh's
predecessor, Edwin Meese III, civil libertarians complained that
its prosecutions would infringe on constitutional rights.
   Before the unit was organized, there were very few obscenity
prosecutions against distributors or makers of hard-core adult
pornography, said John Weston, a Los Angeles attorney who
represents distributors of X-rated material.
   Law enforcement officials say that prosecutions of obscenity
cases are sensitive because of the constitutional claims.
   Thornburgh noted difficulties in making obscenity charges stick.
A federal judge in Los Angeles this year dismissed eight obscenity
counts against an accused pornographer because he couldn't identify
a prevailing community standard in the city.
   But the defendant, Rubin Gottesman, was convicted of a
child-pornography violation because a minor appeared as an actress
in many of the videos he distributed, Thornburgh said.
   Gottesman was sentenced last week to a year in prison and fined
$100,000.
   Thornburgh told the conference that he had asked Congress for
more money to increase the size of the obscenity unit. Spokesman
David Runkel said later that Thornburgh had requested Congress add
one person to the 20-member unit.

<HEAD>NASA Restores Signal From Voyager 1 After Partial Loss of Contact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA restored full contact with Voyager
1 after the space probe stopped sending data to Earth this week _
the first such malfunction since it was launched in 1977 to explore
Jupiter and Saturn.
   ``We're relieved, of course. But now there's the question of why
did it happen and is it going to happen again?'' John Tullius,
senior mission controller for Voyagers 1 and 2 at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
said Thursday.
   But flight engineering manager Lanny Miller said the partial
loss of contact ``wasn't too worrisome'' because engineers were
confident of their ability to correct the malfunction.
   The Voyagers were launched from Florida in 1977. They explored
Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 explored Saturn in 1980, followed in
1981 by Voyager 2, which went on to study Uranus in 1986 and
Neptune in August. The twin spacecraft learned so much that
scientists have been forced to revise astronomy textbooks.
   Both probes are continuing their mission, searching for the edge
of the solar system, where solar wind yields to interstellar wind,
and returning data about magnetic fields and electrically charged
particles in space. Barring any unforeseen failure, they are
expected to send information back to Earth until 2015 or 2020.
   Controllers never lost Voyager 1's ``carrier signal,'' a single
tone that allows them to track the probe's location, which is now
above the plane of the solar system some 3.7 billion miles from
Earth.
   But sometime between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 1
stopped sending its ``telemetry signal,'' which transmits
scientific data collected by the probe and information about how
the spacecraft is functioning, Tullius said.
   At noon Tuesday, engineers sent commands to reset Voyager 1's
``telemetry modulation unit,'' ordering it to start working again.
   Even at the 186,000-mile-per-second speed of light, the commands
took 5{ hours to reach the spacecraft. It took the same amount of
time for Voyager to confirm the commands worked, so it was after 11
p.m. Tuesday when engineers knew full contact was restored, Tullius
said.
   Until then, ``there was concern we'd only have one spacecraft
left out of the two,'' Tullius said. ``Voyager 1 is very dear to us
too.''
   Although engineers at times have shut off Voyager telemetry
signals intentionally, this week's partial loss of contact was the
first time it has happened accidentally, he added.
   The cause is under investigation, but Tullius said a cosmic ray
may have hit the telemetry unit, or a circuit simply malfunctioned
because of age.
   A radio station sends out a single tone, but modulates it to
transmit music of different tones, Miller said. Voyager 1's
telemetry modulator adds or subtracts voltage to the probe's
single-tone carrier signal to produce different tones that carry
information, he explained.
   When the modulator malfunctioned, ``What we were receiving was
the equivalent of a single tone or static, when what we wanted to
hear was Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,'' Miller said.

   Tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans
interned during World War II would begin receiving $20,000
reparation checks next year under a bill that may get final
congressional approval today.
   The House voted 249-166 Thursday to begin dispensing $1.2
billion to the 60,000 survivors of the camps. The Senate could
debate the bill as early as today, and it is expected to be passed
and quickly signed by President Bush.
   The measure provides $500 million for the payments in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, the same amount the next year and the
remaining $200 million beginning October 1992.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., a Japanese-American who as a child
was confined to one of the camps, said time was essential because
200 former internees die each month.
   Camp survivors who already have died passed away ``still waiting
for the stigma on their loyalty to be lifted,'' he said.
   The camps, set up in 1942 after war broke out with Japan, were
sparked by fears that Japanese-Americans would subvert the U.S. war
effort. About 120,000 Japanese-Americans spent most of the war in
the camps.
   Conservatives didn't challenge the justification for the
payments, which were authorized in a law last year. But they
objected to language making the disbursements automatic, thus
removing them from competition with other programs for scarce
federal dollars.
   ``Do you elevate these payments above child care?'' asked Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky. ``The defense of the country?''
   The money is part of a House-Senate compromise for fiscal 1990
providing $17.2 billion for the departments of Commerce, Justice
and State.
   In addition to funding for the reparation, the bill leaves
intact the Census Bureau practice of counting illegal aliens.
   Next year's count will be used to redraw House district lines,
and lawmakers from states with few illegal immigrants complain that
including them inflates the number of congressional seats from
border states. The Senate had voted to prohibit counting the
aliens, but House-Senate bargainers dropped the provision.
   The legislation contains new restrictions on the directors of
the Legal Services Corp., the federally subsidized agency that
provides legal aid to the poor. Liberals say the corporation board
is dominated by Reagan-era appointees, and the measure would
prevent changes in regulations until new directors are appointed.
   Conservatives lost two efforts, 206-199 and 223-178, to limit
the corporation's participation in suits on behalf of migrant
workers and erect other constraints.
   The bill also includes:
   _$15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren
Burger for the Supreme Court. Court officials say portraits of the
other 14 chief justices already hang in the building. The money was
obtained by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., an old friend of Burger, and
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who employs a former Burger clerk.
   _A prohibition on the launch of American-built satellites by
China or the Soviet Union. The ban against China would be lifted if
Bush certifies that martial law has been lifted and other reforms
made.
   _A requirement that the government seek treaties with other
countries to protect sea turtles.
   _Many pet projects, including $5.5 million for a clinical law
center at Seton Hall University in Newark, N.J.; $4.5 million for a
health center at Voorhees College in Denmark, S.C.; and $5.2
million for a science research center at the University of Kansas
in Lawrence.

   American courts could impose the death penalty
on terrorists convicted of murdering U.S. citizens under
legislation that has won overwhelming Senate approval.
   Capital punishment is needed for ``the kinds of offenses that
are an affront to humanity,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said
Thursday as the Senate approved the measure 79-20.
   Under the bill, which goes to the House, courts would remain
free to impose prison sentences rather than capital punishment on
the small number of terrorists who are convicted in U.S. courts of
overseas murder.
   A court would not be able to impose the death penalty unless the
attorney general certified that the motive for the killing was to
coerce, intimidate or retaliate against a government or civilian
population.
   The Bush administration has not taken a position on the narrowly
drawn, one-page bill, but it does support a proposal that
prescribes capital punishment for an array of federal crimes.
   The Senate plans to vote on that measure later as part of a
wide-ranging anti-crime package.
   The Senate rejected, 70-29, a move to replace the death penalty
for such terrorist murders with life in prison.
   Specter said courts should have the option of imposing the death
penalty on terrorists such as those who planted the bomb aboard the
Pan American jetliner that exploded over Scotland in December,
killing 259 people.
   Opponents said easing the maximum penalty to life in prison
actually makes the legislation stronger than Specter's proposal,
which they said would allow courts to impose comparatively short
sentences or even fines.
   ``You have a possibility in there which is repugnant, which is
that a person convicted of murdering an American citizen in the
course of a terrorist act will be given a term of years,'' said
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   ``If you want to see the people who murdered Leon Klinghoffer
get a term of years, you vote for the Specter bill,'' Levin said,
referring to an American tourist in a wheelchair who was shot on a
cruise ship and thrown into the Mediterranean.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said executing terrorists would
provide them ``with the publicity they so ravenously seek and give
them martyrdom as reward.'' He urged the Senate not to succumb to
``a lust for revenge.''

<TEXT>
   Experts say this year's drought isn't as
bad as last year's, but that's little consolation for farmers like
Verdun Schauer.
   ``I've never seen a failure two years in a row, but there are no
rules against it, I guess,'' said Schauer, 49, who abandoned about
half the 1,500 acres of barley and wheat this year on his farm east
of Bismarck.
   Although this year's drought is less widespread than last
year's, its effects are more devastating as it reaches deeper into
the soil.
   ``We need a lot of moisture to recharge,'' Schauer said.
``There's no subsoil moisture at all.''
   This year's drought stretches from parts of Illinois through the
Dakotas and parts of Kansas and Nebraska, said Norton Strommen,
chief meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   The soil is so dry in the most severely stricken areas of
northern Iowa, south-central Minnesota and the upper Plains that it
would take 4 to 10 inches of rain to bring moisture to normal
levels, he said.
   ``It's not as bad this year,'' Strommen said. ``This year we got
very timely rains ... and yields are up. But it was only because of
the timing and the distribution of the rains, combined with the
temperature patterns that allowed us to get good crops.''
   Nationwide, producers are seeing yield increases of up to 30
percent over last year, Strommen said. Farmers also planted more
acreage than in 1988.
   Still, parts or all of about a dozen states have requested
disaster asistance. The final loss figures have yet to be compiled,
but states like Nebraska and North Dakota expect to lose about a
third of their cash crops.
   Schauer said he lost almost all his crop in 1988, but had enough
carryover feed to sustain his livestock. This year he has no
carryover and will have to sell cattle.
   ``The second year of a disaster is always worse because you
don't have the cushion to get you through that you had the first
year,'' said economist Dwight Aakre at North Dakota State
University.
   In Iowa, the situation has improved, ``but not in all cases by
any means,'' said Harry Hillaker, state climatologist.
   Officials in Missouri, Montana and Wisconsin say more farmers
have healthy crops. But fall has been unseasonably dry, and some
rivers are at all-time lows.
   ``There were places I walked where you had to swim before,''
said Marshall Ruegger, a forestry official in Madison, Wis. He said
reservoirs on the Wisconsin River were at 20 percent of of capacity
rather than the normal 50 percent at this time of year.
   In Coleharbor, N.D., recharge ponds that held the city's water
supply were so depleted the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to pump
water 3{ miles from Lake Sakakawea on the Missouri River.
   ``We had approximately a month left before we ran out of
water,'' said Clayton Boots, auditor for the town of about 150.
   Twenty of Nebraska's 73 counties find the second year of drought
even more painful than the first.
   Nebraska fared well last year because of a large irrigated corn
crop, said Lynn Lutgen, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln
agriculture economist.
   The 90-day weather forecast calls for near-normal precipitation
and temperatures over much of the nation's heartland.
   ``But that probably won't make it up,'' said Ken Kunkel,
director of the Midwest Climate Center in Champaign, Ill. ``That
would require a couple months of above-normal precipitation.''

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Fighting MCI in Countersuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. is going
to court to fight claims by rival MCI Communications Corp. that
AT&amp;T is using false advertising.
   AT&amp;T filed a countersuit in U.S. District Court on Thursday in
response to MCI's Oct. 10 false advertising suit.
   MCI's ads for long-distance service have ``misled customers
about prices, about the quality and reach of its service and about
its facsimile service,'' Victor Pelson, AT&amp;T group executive, told
reporters.
   ``MCI, instead of cleaning up its own advertising act, had the
gall to file a lawsuit,'' Pelson said. ``We stand by our
advertising.''
   MCI Chairman William McGowan said when his company filed its
suit that AT&amp;T was desperately trying to save its eroding
long-distance business and was losing 100,000 customers a week.
   Pelson said McGowan's claim was ``absurd.''
   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said Thursday that AT&amp;T failed
to challenge that MCI allegation in its countersuit.
   ``The most significant thing about AT&amp;T's countersuit was what
was not in it,'' she said.
   The suits are the latest chapters in MCI's long battle with AT&amp;T
that began in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke AT&amp;T's
long-distance monopoly.
   AT&amp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2
with more than 10 percent.
   AT&amp;T's U.S. District Court suit denies MCI's allegations and
asks the court to enjoin MCI from making false or deceptive
representations. It also asks the court to order MCI to make
corrective ads.
   AT&amp;T seeks unspecified profits ``wrongfully amassed by MCI on
the sale of its products or services during the period in
question,'' plus treble the damages that AT&amp;T has sustained because
of ``MCI's false and-or deceptive ads'' and legal and court costs.
   MCI's suit alleged that AT&amp;T was engaged in maliciously false
and deceptive advertising. It said AT&amp;T launched a counterattack in
January against competitors to regain market share, and in July
began targeting MCI's new Primetime, cut-rate long-distance calling
plan.
   Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T vice president for consumer services, cited
an MCI ad that says ``MCI always saves you money.'' He said MCI was
making ``apples and oranges'' comparisons between its cut-rate
calling plans and AT&amp;T's standard long-distance rates.
   He defended an ad, which had particularly incensed McGowan,
showing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment of
the planet missing, including Europe, the Middle East and North
Africa. The ad copy asks: ``Is this how your worldwide
long-distance company sees the world?''
   McGowan said the AT&amp;T ad implied its competitors didn't serve
Europe.
   ``It's not meant to be Europe,'' Tutton said, adding that MCI
doesn't serve 45 countries, including the Soviet Union and Cuba.
   MCI's suit asked that AT&amp;T be enjoined from making false or
deceptive representations that any AT&amp;T service is superior or that
MCI has misrepresented its services or rates. It also seeks
corrective notices, unspecified profits, interest and legal fees.

<HEAD>GOP Stalling Aid to Poland with Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate's attempt to speed aid to Poland
and Hungary is stalled by a Republican bid to advance an unrelated
and controversial issue _ the capital gains tax cut.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell made clear Thursday that
he would not permit a Republican amendment containing a
capital-gains measure to come to a vote, a decision that threw the
fate of the Poland-Hungary authorization bill into doubt.
   Aides said the Maine Democrat would temporarily shelve the aid
bill and take up a series of appropriations measures, forcing a
delay likely to postpone consideration of the aid bill for at least
several days.
   The Senate on Thursday managed to approve a separate resolution
that will send a team of congressional experts to Warsaw to learn
what the newly elected Polish legislature needs in terms of
training, organization, computers and other office equipment.
   The team then will seek donations from U.S. manufacturers to
provide basic hardware to help the parliament organize, said Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the measure's chief sponsor.
   Mitchell denounced the GOP's action in injecting the capital
gains controversy into the Eastern European aid package, calling it
irresponsible in light of Poland's severe economic problems.
   But Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and other GOP members
said delaying the passage of the aid bill won't affect the flow of
aid to Eastern Europe.
   ``All of this wringing of hands is pure politics,'' Dole said.
``It's the old Democratic game of crying wolf.''
   Domenici said ``no one in Poland should be concerned'' by the
delay because the aid program will be funded only by actual
appropriations, not authorizations that set maximum levels of aid
and spell out policy guidelines.
   In fact, Domenici said, $100 million in food aid for Poland has
already been appropriated and is en route to Poland.
   ``The principal ingredients are either already funded, or will
be funded,'' Domenici said.
   The authorization bill features competing Democratic and
Republican spending levels. Democrats seek $989 million over three
years; Republicans want a leaner, $585 million package.
   Bush's insistence on a capital-gains cut and the Democratic
leadership's opposition to it have overshadowed consideration of
budget issues since June.
   The fight has delayed action on a deficit-reduction bill until
Nov. 1 at the earliest, a full month after the opening of the 1990
budget year. It threatens to delay a bill to raise the government's
borrowing authority past Oct. 31.
   The House voted a capital-gains tax cut as part of its
deficit-reduction plan. The cut being pushed by Senate Republicans
is considerably different from the House plan and includes an
expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts.
   If action on the Poland-Hungary aid bill is delayed past this
week, as appears likely, Republican senators likely will try to add
their capital-gains reduction to legislation boosting government
borrowing authority. Democrats would try to talk the GOP effort to
death, and the borrowing bill would be caught in the crossfire.
   Unless the borrowing authority is raised next week, the
government might be forced into several drastic actions, including
delaying Social Security checks.

<HEAD>Man Charged with Slugging Glenn Was Trying to Reach Pope: Complaint</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials say the man charged with slugging
Sen. John Glenn was trying to reach Pope John Paul II in an effort
to prevent a nuclear war.
   Michael Breen appeared in U.S. District Court on Thursday and
was ordered held without bond and sent to a federal prison hospital
for psychiatric evaluation.
   The 31-year-old Washington engineer told District of Columbia
Detective Tom Johnson that he wanted the pope to reveal the
contents of a message some Roman Catholics believe was received
from the Virgin Mary.
   ``The defendant stated that he wanted the notoriety of the event
to get the pope to read the Fatima message to prevent a nuclear
war,'' Johnson said in a sworn statement supporting the criminal
complaint.
   In 1917, three children in Fatima, Portugal, said they were
visited by the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus.
   They said she made six appearances, telling them to pray and do
penance. Part of the story of Fatima also holds that there was a
secret message never publicly revealed by the Vatican, said R.
Bruce Miller, head of the religious studies library at Catholic
University in Washington.
   Miller said some theologians doubt the existence of a secret
message.
   Breen told the detective he'd been having dreams for about 10
months in which God gave him information about ``possible future
disasters,'' and that he feared last week's California earthquake
could have triggered a nuclear war.
   Defense lawyer Barry Stiller refused to discuss his client's
religious beliefs, saying he'd only spent 30 minutes with Breen
before the court appearance.
   ``He's just a very nice young man who I think is a little
confused,'' Stiller said after the proceeding.
   Breen, an engineer with Martin Marietta Corp., appeared calm
during the proceedings. He looked frequently at family members and
once made the sign of the cross as lawyers conferred with the
Magistrate Deborah Robinson about the location of his 30-day
psychiatric evaluation.
   Robinson sent Breen to a federal prison hospital in North
Carolina despite defense objections that it was too far away from
legal counsel and family.
   The charge against Breen is a felony that carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Glenn, D-Ohio, was struck in the jaw Wednesday while giving an
interview. The incident was recorded by a television camera.
   A day earlier, Breen was detained by U.S. Capitol Police and the
Secret Service after breaking through a police line and trying to
reach out to Vice President Dan Quayle's motorcade.
   Breen told police God guided him to the outdoor tree-planting
ceremony where the 68-year-old Glenn was a participant and ``he
struck Sen. Glenn in order to get mass media attention,'' according
to the statement distributed by the U.S. Attorney's office.

<HEAD>House Seeks Compromise on Minimum Wage Increase</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans and conservative Democrats who
sustained President Bush's veto of an increase in the minimum wage
are pushing the White House to compromise on a scaled-back version
of the bill.
   Administration officials, however, are sending mixed signals,
floating possible concessions one day but insisting the next that
Bush won't budge from last spring's ``best, first and only offer.''
   Compromise or not, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., said Thursday that a bill raising the wage floor to $4.25
from the $3.35 level where it's been since 1981 will be voted on
Wednesday.
   Bush vetoed a bill in June that would have increased the minimum
wage to $4.55 an hour and established a subminimum training wage of
$3.35 for the first 60 days of a first-time worker's employment.
   He vowed to do the same again on any subsequent attempt that
goes higher than $4.25 an hour, hits that level before 1992 or
provides for less than a six-month subminimum scale for any new
hires, regardless of previous job experience.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., and GOP leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois on
Thursday that Bush wouldn't budge.
   ``We didn't reach agreement on anything,'' Foley told reporters
after the White House meeting.
   Michel held out hope ``there may be room for some bending.''
   ``The president will have to bend a little bit'' to avoid a veto
fight, he said. ``I don't think the president would enjoy vetoing a
second minimum wage bill.''
   Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
and Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, also have been urging the
White House to compromise.
   However, lawmakers and lobbyists on both sides said the White
House didn't begin focusing on the issue until late last week and
is scrambling for a way to prevent its allies from jumping to the
other side.
   ``They want to come in at the last minute and make a deal, but
there's no firm decision on what they want,'' said Rep. Timothy J.
Penny of Minnesota, one of 28 Democrats who voted last summer to
sustain Bush's veto.
   Sununu, according to congressional sources and lobbyists,
earlier this week floated as a possible compromise gradually
increasing the wage floor to $4.25 an hour by July 1991 _ six
months earlier than Bush wanted _ with a three-month subminimum for
new hires. But it was not put forth Thursday.
   ``They're floundering all over the place,'' said Robert
McGlotten, the AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist. ``They keep talking like
they want to make some movement. But when we sit down with them, we
get nowhere.''
   A strategist for a business group opposed to any increase
agreed. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, he said
administration officials this week presented one possible training
wage compromise ``that was so convoluted and complicated that it
could never be used.''
   McGlotten said ``there's no give'' by unions on the issue of
achieving a 90-cent increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1991, but
he expressed a willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as
long as employers are prevented from using it as a perpetual source
of below minimum-scale labor.
   Whatever the outcome, liberal Democrats and supporters of Bush's
earlier veto agree that minimum wage supporters have the upper hand.
   Democrats want to have a bill approved by both the House and
Senate and on Bush's desk before the Nov. 13 arrival in Washington
of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, believing his visit will
make a veto more difficult.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness on the part of the White House
that they could look like a mean old ogre, fighting day and night
to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally hard
against raising the minimum wage,'' Penny said.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said supporters still lack a
two-thirds, veto-proof majority for the new bill, which would raise
the wage floor to $3.80 in January and to $4.25 by January 1991
with a 60-day training wage only for first-time workers.
   ``But we're gaining ground,'' Bonior said.

   Michael Flatley knew he had fast feet, but didn't
think about seeking official recognition for his tap-dancing
prowess until Sen. Ted Kennedy suggested he try for a spot in the
``Guinness Book of World Records.''
   Then it became a quest for the 31-year old hoofer, who made it
into the new edition of the record book with a 28-tap-per-second
performance.
   ``I really believed I was the best in the world, and I'm saying
this as modestly as I can, it seemed to me to be a good way to
prove I was the best,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``Tap dancing, for me, is a very powerful, masculine thing,'' he
said. ``That's how I approach it.''
   His feet are enshrined in the Guinness edition that arrived in
bookstores this week. Heel-and-toeing it for a tape recorder and
Guinness judges in a suburban dance studio in May, he beat the
previous record of 24 taps per second, set by Roy Castle on Jan.
14, 1973, on a BBC-TV program.
   Flatley, a native of southwest Chicago, developed his
nimble-legged style through years of Irish step dancing, and won
the world step dancing championship in Dublin in 1975.
   People had suggested he try for a tap record before, but it was
at a performance for the Massachusetts Democrat last year that
Flatley's mind was made up.
   ``Ted Kennedy said, `Your feet should be in the Guinness Book of
World Records,'' Flatley recalled. ``I became obsessed with it. I
had no idea it was going to be that difficult.''
   Since Flatley's training comes from step dancing _ done with
arms rigidly held at the side of the body _ he has his detractors
among purists of dance.
   ``Well, he made 28 sounds with his feet,'' said Lane Alexander,
a noted tap teacher and performer in Chicago. ``That doesn't make
him a tap dancer.''

<HEAD>Senate Sends President Bill to Help Farmers on Disaster Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation is heading to President Bush that
will increase disaster payments to farmers who planted replacement
crops after their wheat and cotton failed because of bad weather
this year.
   The Senate and House gave final approval to the measure
Thursday, and Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., predicted Bush
would sign the bill pushed through by farm-state lawmakers in a
bipartisan effort.
   ``Farmers had a legitimate gripe that producers who moved
quickly to plant a second crop on failed acres shouldn't be
penalized when it came time to qualify for federal disaster aid,''
Dole said.
   The measure will change the way disaster assistance payments are
calculated for farmers who planted a replacement crop after
drought, flooding and other extreme weather destroyed their first
crops.
   Lawmakers have complained that an Agriculture Department formula
will penalize those producers, and in some instances mean farmers
could receive no disaster payments even though they earned little
or no profit on their second crops.
   Winter wheat and cotton farmers will be particularly affected
because many planted grain sorghum and soybeans after their initial
crops failed.
   The problem stems from a nearly $900 million disaster relief
package enacted in August. In an effort to prevent farmers from
reaping double benefits, the law required USDA to reduce assistance
payments to farmers by the value of any crop that replaced one
ruined by bad weather.
   Congress didn't spell out how to determine the replacement crop
value, leaving that to USDA. The agency decided to deduct 75
percent of the gross value of the replacement crop from the
disaster payment a farmer would have otherwise received for losses
on his first crop.
   Lawmakers reacted angrily, contending that USDA's formula was
arbitrary and failed to account for region-to-region differences in
production costs.
   Under the legislation, that system would be modified.
   Farmers would have no payment reductions if their replacement
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average
yield. Those farmers harvesting more than that amount would have
USDA's deduction applied only on the value of their replacement
crop above the 50 percent yield threshold.
   In addition, replacement crop deductions would be applied only
against disaster assistance earned on acres actually replanted.
Farmers would receive smaller payments without those acreage
offsets.

<HEAD>Japanese Americans to Get High School Diplomas 47 Years Late</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA SNOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In June 1942, Hayao Shishino waited for his
diploma with hundreds of other Japanese-American high school
seniors attending graduation ceremonies at an internment camp.
   His wait lasted 47 years.
   Shishino's name, and those of 14 fellow Japanese-American
seniors from Los Angeles High School, were never called.
   Because they were among 120,000 Japanese-Americans forced into
camps after war broke out with Japan, the students couldn't afford
caps and gowns or graduation parties, but they were looking forward
to getting the diplomas.
   ``We waited until the last to hear our names,'' Shishino
recalled this week. ``We waited to hear our school. But we waited
for nothing.''
   On Saturday, a special ceremony will be held at Los Angeles High
in an attempt to redress, at least in part, what today's Los
Angeles Unified School Board members believe was a historical wrong.
   Shishino and 10 of the 15 other former students will finally get
their sheepskins. They will be dated June 26, 1942, but will be
signed by members of the current school board.
   One of the 15 has since died and three others cannot attend the
ceremony, Shishino said.
   Other Japanese-American students imprisoned in the camp at Santa
Anita Racetrack before the end of their senior year in 1942 got
their diplomas at that original ceremony. Shishino blames wartime
anti-Japanese hysteria and the attitudes of the late Paul Webb,
principal of Los Angeles High, for his being left out.
   Webb, who died in 1982, refused to issue the students' diplomas
even though the School Board ordered that all graduating
Japanese-American seniors in good standing be given diplomas,
Shishino said.
   ``He told me flat to my face that I didn't deserve one,''
recalled Shishino, now 64 and a retired cook living in the Los
Angeles suburb of Cerritos. ``He was just prejudiced against
Japanese-Americans.''
   The new ceremony grew out of a letter Shishino wrote earlier
this year to Warren Furutani, a Los Angeles Unified School Board
member and a Japanese-American whose mother-in-law was among the
students who were denied diplomas.
   Furutani had district employees search old records to document
Shishino's claims. Shishino and the other former students received
letters last week announcin gthe ceremony.
   ``It was time to set the record straight,'' said Furutani.
   More important than the diplomas will be the chance to educate
Americans about the injustices suffered by Japanese-Americans
during World War II, said Furutani's mother-in-law, Aiko Yoshinaga.
   ``Some people just don't believe there were such things as
concentration camps in this country,'' said Mrs. Yoshinaga, who
planned to fly out from her Virginia home for the ceremony.
   ``Many young people still don't know the Japanese-Americans were
treated as enemy aliens,'' said Shishino, who was born in Los
Angeles.
   Although upset about being left out of the communal graduation
ceremony, ``getting my diploma was the least of my worries in those
days,'' he said.
   ``Just surviving and thinking about the future were more
important. You see we had lost everything _ our apartment, our
furniture, our cars, my father's flower business,'' said Shishino.
``My parents were just given two weeks to take the most important
things we owned and pack it into one suitcase.''
   The U.S. House voted Thursday to begin making $1.2 billion in
reparation payments next year to the 60,000 surviving
Japanese-Americans confined to camps during World War II. The bill
now moves to the Senate.
   But Shishino says it's more than a matter of money.
   ``Money alone can never repay the injustice we've suffered,'' he
said. ``We were Americans and we were treated like we were spies.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has upheld
President Corazon Aquino's decision banning the return of Ferdinand
Marcos' body to the Philippines, a justice said today.
   The court was responding to a petition by Marcos supporters that
the former president's body be returned from Hawaii, where he died
in exile Sept. 28.
   Mrs. Aquino, citing national security, has refused to allow
Marcos to be buried in the country he ruled until he was ousted in
a popular uprising three years ago.
   But she has said she would abide by the decision of the Supreme
Court.
   Justice Abraham Sarmiento told The Associated Press that the
court upheld the ban by an 8-7 vote. An official announcement has
not been made.
   Marcos' supporters argued that the ban violated the country's
Constitution and international human rights covenants. They asked
that Marcos' widow, Imelda, and other members of his immediate
family also be allowed to come home.
   Marcos was entombed in Hawaii Oct. 15 in what the family said
was a temporary burial.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino told reporters that Marcos' family must
not only return the billions he allegedly embezzled but also accept
guilt for crimes committed during his 20-year rule.
   The Aquino government has accused Marcos, his wife and hundreds
of associates of stealing up to $10 billion in public funds.
   In October 1988, a U.S. grand jury indicted the Marcoses on
racketeering charges in connection with the alleged embezzlement.
Mrs. Marcos is scheduled to stand trial in New York in March.

government regulation requiring standardized absorbency labeling,
health officials say.
   Within four months, all tampon makers will have to use uniform
terms with specified absorbency ranges, allowing women to compare
brands and choose lower-absorbency products, the Food and Drug
Administration said.
   The FDA's announcement of the final regulation Thursday capped
nearly a decade of haggling with industry and consumer groups and
complied with a court order that set an Oct. 30 deadline for
issuing a rule.
   The labeling will require manufacturers to use the terms
``junior,'' ``regular,'' ``super'' and ``super plus'' to describe
the absorbency of their products.
   Each term denotes a specified range of absorbency, and
manufacturers will be required to include an explanation of the
ranges and how women can use the information. They also will be
required to advise on labels that women can reduce risk of toxic
shock by alternating sanitary napkins with tampons.
   The risk of toxic shock syndrome, a rare but sometimes fatal
condition, increases with higher tampon absorbency.
   ``Women who choose to use tampons instead of sanitary napkins,
which have no known risk of toxic shock, should use the lowest
absorbency product that is effective for them,'' said FDA
Commissioner Frank Young.
   Public health officials became aware of toxic shock syndrome in
the early part of the decade.
   In 1982, the agency required that tampon labeling include a
warning about the association between tampon use and toxic shock
and advised women to use the lowest absorbency to control menstrual
flow.
   The labeling also had to list the symptoms of toxic shock:
sudden fever of 102 or more, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting or
near-fainting when standing up, dizziness and a sunburn-like rash.
   The FDA tried unsuccessfully for several years to get tampon
makers to agree on a uniform labeling system. In September 1988,
the agency proposed a labeling regulation that would use a series
of letters to designate absorbency.
   The FDA revised the proposal in June to require use of new terms
to indicate absorbency, though manufacturers could still use their
old terms as well. Consumers and manufacturers argued for
standardizing the terms.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group went to court to force
the FDA to issue a final regulation, and the District Court for the
District of Columbia gave the agency until Oct. 30.

<HEAD>Gingrich Labels New Ethics Charges Baseless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich is calling
new ethics charges filed against him by an Arkansas Democrat
baseless and politically motivated.
   Gingrich said Thursday that the latest ethics complaint by Rep.
Bill Alexander is the product of ``a deeply troubled and desperate
man'' trying to generate publicity.
   Alexander filed his new complaint, along with 670 pages of
supporting documents, late Wednesday, a week after the outside
counsel hired by the House ethics committee to evaluate his first
complaint against Gingrich concluded there was no reason for the
panel to investigate the Georgia Republican.
   The committee will meet Tuesday.
   Gingrich rose to prominence in the House after filing the ethics
complaint that led to the resignation in June of Jim Wright, a
Texas Democrat who was Speaker of the House.
   Gingrich denied several of the allegations, including
Alexander's contention that he funneled $12,000 in advertising and
$20,000 in contributions to the 1986 re-election campaign of
then-Sen. Mack Mattingly, R-Ga., and didn't report either as
required by federal election law.
   Alexander's initial complaint alleged that Gingrich violated
House rules and federal campaign finance laws by getting 21
supporters to invest $5,000 each in a limited partnership to
promote his 1984 book, ``Window of Opportunity.''

<NOTE>Community Colleges Failing to Help Students Transfer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study says community colleges are failing to
motivate poor and minority students to go beyond their two-year
programs.
   ``The transfer function of community colleges is in crisis,''
said the Academy for Educational Development report, funded by the
Ford Foundation and published by the College Board.
   Researchers Fred Pincus and Elayne Archer said two-year colleges
are a critical part of the educational system and have an important
role to play because they have taken ``on the awesome task of
working to salvage hope for so many who have been given up on by
others.''
   But they said it is equally important that community colleges
work to ``provide paths of upward mobility'' by helping students
transfer to four-year colleges.
   The report, ``Bridges to Opportunity,'' said a small percentage
of community college students transfer to four-year schools and
fewer yet actually get bachelor's degrees. It said the transfer
rates are smaller for black, Hispanic, and Indian students than for
white and Asian-American students.
   Pincus said studies show that one-third to one-half of students
say they enrolled in a community college to prepare for transfer to
a four-year school.
   But he said the current transfer rate is 15 percent to 25
percent of all community college students and 20 percent to 30
percent of those students who say they want to transfer. Only 10
percent to 15 percent of all community college students receive a
bachelor's degree, he said.

<NOTE>Average Private Contract Wage Gains Put at 3.1 Percent Annually</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department reports that
private-sector workers who got new contracts through collective
bargaining from January through September won average annual wage
increases of 3.1 percent.
   That compared with average gains of 2.4 percent in their prior
contracts, the department said Thursday.
   The data covers contracts for 1.3 million workers negotiated in
the first nine months of the year.
   If the trend continues for the final three months, 1989 would be
the first year since 1981 in which new contracts provide workers
with better pay raises, on average, than their prior contracts, the
department said.
   The rebound in wage gains was attributed to the restoration of
prior concessions in several industries that were slumping earlier
in the decade, particularly the U.S. steel industry.
   Also, the Labor Department said wage increases given workers in
the health care sector, particularly nurses, were outpacing the
gains provided in prior contracts. Competition for skilled workers
in that sector has pushed wages higher.

<TEXT>
   A British soldier and his
6-month-old daughter were shot and killed in their family car by
two gunmen believed to belong to the IRA, officials said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the slaying Thursday, which
occurred near the Royal Air Force base at Wildenrath, but the IRA
has made similar attacks on British soldiers in recent months.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said authorities were ``pretty certain that
the attackers belong to the Irish Republican Army.''
   The soldier's wife, who was driving the three, was not injured
in the attack but was taken to a local hospital in shock, British
military officials said.
   A British Army of the Rhine spokeswoman identified the slain
soldier as Royal Air Force Cpl. Maheshkumar Islania, 34. Islania's
parents live in London, she said.
   The assailants opened fire with automatic weapons as the family
drove away from a gasoline station, the spokeswoman said. Foerster
said the gunmen drove toward the Dutch border.
   Wildenrath, close to the border with The Netherlands, is one of
Britain's main air bases in West Germany.
   The IRA, outlawed in Britain and Ireland, claimed responsibility
for the September slaying of a British soldier's wife outside
Dortmund. Three bomb attacks since June also been attributed to the
organization.
   The group seeks to drive the British from Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.
   There are 66,000 British soldiers and dependents living in West
Germany.

<HEAD>Most Head Injury Deaths Caused by Motor Vehicles, Firearms and Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Head injuries caused 2 percent of all deaths in
the United States in a recent seven-year period, and the most
common causes were auto crashes, guns and falls, according to
doctors who studied such deaths.
   The death rate for Americans with head injuries was 16.9 per
100,000 people from 1979 through 1986, said Dr. Daniel M. Sosin and
his colleagues at the Division of Injury Epidemiology and Control
of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   They reported in today's edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association that they identified 315,328 deaths associated
with head injuries.
   Of those injuries, 57 percent were suffered in motor vehicle
accidents, most commonly among people younger than 35, the
physicians said.
   Whites ages 15 to 24 had a death rate of 22.7 per 100,000 from
head injuries suffered in motor vehicle accidents, the researchers
said. Blacks of the same age group had a death rate of 9.2 per
100,000 from vehicle accidents.
   Another 14 percent of the fatal head injuries were caused by
guns.
   Among blacks ages 25 to 34, homicides by firearm caused 4.2
deaths per 100,000 _ more than five times the rate for whites in
the same age group.
   The death rate for head injuries from suicidal gunshot wounds,
however, was much higher for whites of all ages _ 1.64 per 100,000
_ than it was for blacks, with a rate of 0.65 per 100,000.
   Falls were the third most common cause of fatal head injuries,
accounting for 12 percent of the total, the physicians found. They
also found that the death rate for falls rose with the age of the
populace.
   The sharpest rise came after age 75, Sosin said, with 20.6
deaths per 100,000 for males in the oldest age group, and 11.3 per
100,000 for women.

   The bus, belonging to a tourism company, was returning from a

passengers were in critical condition. Nine of the dead were

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 state prison inmates
rioted for a second night Thursday, taking eight hostages and
igniting numerous fires and explosions that shrouded the prison in
thick black smoke, authorities said.
   State police and firefighters struggled to regain control of the
Camp Hill medium-security prison early Friday with three cell
blocks and four other housing units ablaze. At least 84 people have
been injured in two days of rioting, but no fatalities were
reported.
   Flames from a huge fire just inside the main gate shot 50 to 100
feet into the air and several explosions were heard. The incident,
which began during a lockdown, started shortly after 7 p.m.
Thursday.
   ``It's total chaos. They lost control,'' said a guard who was in
one of the cell blocks when Thursday's disturbance began. ``The
officers were told to lock the doors and leave. We had to get out.
... They said they were going to kill us.
   ``Last night was a riot. Tonight was war,'' said the guard, a
six-year staff member. He refused to give his name.
   Another guard said an explosion was ignited in the prison's
furniture factory. The force rattled windows up to about a mile
away. Inmates threw rocks at firefighters as they battled the main
gate fire.
   At about 1:30 a.m., there was a large explosion in an area about
300 yards from the inferno. One building inside the complex
collapsed, said Sgt. Alan Taylor of the Mechanicsburg police.
   ``Basically the prison is a total loss. All the buildings are
destroyed,'' said Cpl. David Steffen of the Northern York County
Regional police, who were called in to assist.
   John Palakovich, assistant to the prison superintendent, said
one hostage, a guard, had been released shortly after midnight. He
gave no details.
   Inmates holding the hostages were demanding to talk to Gov.
Robert P. Casey and the human rights group Amnesty International,
said state police Cpl. Raul Ramos, who said negotiations were
taking place by phone. Casey said earlier in the day he would not
talk with the inmates.
   State police, who had about 500 troopers at the scene, began to
retake the prison after midnight, Palakovich said.
   ``It is under way,'' he said. Four cellblocks had been regained
and 700 of the prison's 2,600 inmates were under control, he said.
   Earlier, Palakovich said ``there are more inmates involved at
this point than there were last night,'' when 1,200 prisoners went
on a rampage. A total of nine fires were set Thursday, causing more
extensive damage than the previous night's riot, he said.
   At least 37 eople were injured in the second night of rioting,
most of them firefighters, Palakovich said. Local hospitals
reported treating 20 people. Others were treated at the scene about
4 miles west of Harrisburg, the state capital.
   Palakovich said he couldn't say whether the seven remaining
hostages were guards or support staff and he believed they were
being held in two separate cell blocks. He said there was some
contact between inmates and prison negotiators.
   Inmates had gotten into prison tools, such as screwdrivers,
hammers and saws, Palakovich said. He had no reports that prisoners
had any weapons.
   Inmates milled around the prison yard as flames leaped from at
least two buildings and a police helicopter hovered overhead. Other
police fired warning shots in the air. A firetruck was inside the
prison fence pouring water on one of the fires.
   Just before midnight, five officers on horseback were sent into
the prison.
   Earlier, prison authorities said inmates had been locked in
their cells and a state of emergency was in effect following
Wednesday's rampage, during which four buildings were torched.
   Palakovich said the latest incident started during a feeding
period, but he could not explain how prisoners got out of their
locked cells while being served meals. He said some inmates got
keys and let other inmates out of their cells.
   ``There was a bunch of little fires at first, but they started
putting mattresses on the windows,'' said Steve Tobias of nearby
Lemoyne, who was passing the prison as the new outbreak began.
   He said ``a whole bunch of (inmates) were running toward the
fence. But when they heard the shots, they went back the other
way.''
   Palakovich said fires were burning in three of 10 cell blocks
and four modular housing units _ trailer-like buildings used to
ease overcrowding _ and the education building. Earlier in the day,
Prison Superintendent Robert Freeman said Wednesday's seven-hour
riot may have been caused by overcrowding and inmates' anger over
policy changes.
   During that uprising, eight guards were held hostage for up to
four hours and some guards were beaten. Four guards and one inmate
were still hospitalized Thursday.
   Before Thursday night's eruption, Freeman met for an hour with
six of the inmates who had helped negotiate an end to the siege the
day before. He said inmates were upset by changes in the prison's
medical care policy and over a decision not to allow families to
bring in food during extended family-day visits.
   Overcrowded conditions and a shortage of guards may also have
contributed to the disturbance, he said. Camp Hill, with 2,600
inmates, is about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state
prison system is about 48 percent over capacity.
   Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. said the disturbance at Camp
Hill and a smaller uprising at Huntingdon state prison on Monday
were ``the predictable result of a prison crowding crisis that has
been allowed to fester for too long.''
   Freeman said he did not make any promises during the meeting. He
also said no decision has been made on whether to file charges.
   The new medical policy actually improves access to care, but
inmates viewed the change as an attempt to restrict health care,
Freeman said, adding that the staff could have done a better job
explaining the changes. The change involved assigning routine
examinations to certain days.
   Freeman said that food could no longer be brought in because it
could be used to bring in drugs, cash and other contraband.
   Thirty-five prison guards or staff, nine inmates, two state
police troopers and a firefighter were injured in Wednesday's riot,
said Ken Robinson, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections.
   One of the guards, Glenn L. Koons, 63, of Hershey, was in
serious condition in intensive care at Community General
Osteopathic Hospital in Harrisburg with multiple fractures. The
condition of the others ranged from fair to good, hospital
officials said.
   Freeman said six of the 10 cellblocks were damaged extensively
and the commissary was destroyed in Wednesday's riot.
   This week's uprisings were the latest in a series of problems
within Pennsylvania's prison system. A federal judge in August
ordered the state to close part of the Western Penitentiary in
Pittsburgh because of unsafe and ``unconstitutional conditions.''
The state is challenging that ruling and the prison remains open.

   A freighter that ran aground on a protected coral
reef was refloated and the Coast Guard filed charges against the
vessel's master and its mate, who failed two breath alcohol tests
given five hours after the wreck.
   The mate told the Coast Guard he started drinking only after the
ship ran aground.
   None of the vessel's 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel
leaked, but a few gallons of residue oil from a flooded ballast
tank seeped into the water, the Coast Guard said.
   A commercial tug freed the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland from the
reef in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary on Thursday
afternoon with the help of an incoming tide. The ship had been
stuck 27 hours.
   The ship was returning to Miami for repairs Thursday evening.
   Charges were filed against the captain, Duane Goodwin, 37, and
mate Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, said Coast Guard investigator Lt.
Keith Ward.
   Bishop, at the helm during the accident, was charged with
negligence for running the vessel aground, not maintaining a proper
fix of his position and operating the vessel without proper
license, Ward said.
   Goodwin was charged with allowing an improperly licensed person
to operate the vessel, which ran aground Wednesday afternoon about
five miles off Key Largo at a popular diving spot.
   The ship had been en route from Miami to Mobile, Ala., to pick
up a cargo of heavy equipment. The Alec Owen Maitland is owned by
Maitland Bros. Co. of Littlestown, Pa.
   Preliminary findings by Coast Guard investigators indicated that
Goodwin, the only person aboard licensed to navigate, was asleep
when the ship ran aground, and that Bishop was piloting the vessel.
   Bishop failed two breath alcohol tests administered by the
Monroe County Sheriff's Department five hours after the accident,
registering blood-alcohol levels of 0.10 and 0.11, Ward said.
   Under Florida law, someone with a level of 0.10 is considered
legally intoxicated, while federal law sets a 0.04 percent limit.
   The vessel's hull was gashed on the reef, and the forward
ballast tank took on about 5 feet of water. Gov. Bob Martinez, who
went snorkeling Thursday at the scene to check damage to the reef,
said the ship's propeller and rudder were resting on the bottom.
   Martinez, who has been pressing for a 10-mile shipping-free zone
off the Florida Keys and a permanent ban on all offshore oil
drilling, said he had appointed a special prosecutor to pursue
unspecified legal action.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old friends of the late Robert Penn
Warren remembered him for his personal warmth instead of ``his
great mound of medals'' his poems and novels won.
   ``Though he was frail he was always willing to give of
himself,'' said Alex Szogyi, a student of Warren's at Yale
University in the 1950s. ``That a great writer should have been a
great man is a rarity indeed and Red Warren was one of the rarest
of the great.''
   Nearly 150 people, including authors Ralph Ellison and William
Styron, joined members of Warren's family for a memorial service
Thursday in a faculty room at Connecticut Hall on Yale's campus.
   Warren died Sept. 15 at his summer home in Stratton, Vt., at age
84.
   Born in Guthrie, Ky., in 1905, he grew up hearing stories of the
Civil War from his two grandfathers _ both Confederate soldiers _
and went on to spin his own tales of the Old South. He lived the
last three decades of his life in New England.
   He was the only person to win Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction
and poetry. His novel ``All The King's Men,'' inspired by the
populist governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, won the Pulitzer in
1947. His poetry prizes came in 1957 for ``Promises: Poems
1954-1956,'' and in 1979 for ``Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978.''
   He taught at Yale for 22 years, retiring in 1973. In 1986, he
became the nation's first official poet laureate.
   Ellison; Yale President Benno C. Schmidt, who studied under
Warren as a student at Yale; Warren's editor at Random Books,
Albert Erskine; and historian C. Vann Woodward, a friend since the
1940s, also reminisced about the author.
   Two Yale freshmen recited his poems ``Heart of Autumn'' and
``Bearded Oaks.'' They did so from memory _ as Warren always
preferred his students to do.
   ``He was a great Southerner, but he was a great American,'' said
Cleanth Brooks, his friend and collaborator.
   He said he wanted to speak of Warren the man in an attempt to
``rescue him from his great mound of medals.''
   Warren loved America and ``rejoiced in it for he knew its
failings as he knew the failings of his own section. It was a great
thing to know something so well that you loved it,'' Brooks said.
   Warren's widow, author Eleanor Clark, his son, Gabriel, and his
daughter, Rosanna, attended the service and a reception afterward.

<HEAD>Pat Robertson's Network to Bid on Jim Bakker's Old Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network is among the bidders for the cable TV network
once run by imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker, a Robertson
spokeswoman said.
   The Inspirational Network _ actually a cable distribution system
that reaches 7 million to 8 million homes _ is up for sale because
of the bankruptcy of the religious empire built by Bakker, who was
convicted this week of defrauding his followers.
   Three ``prominent'' bidders are to be considered today,
including the Robertson network, said John McEntee, director of
Heritage Ministries, a spinoff of Bakker's old PTL organization in
South Carolina. McEntee, who valued the network at $10 million,
refused to identify the other potential buyers.
   A sale would require the approval of the federal bankruptcy
judge overseeing the breakup of the PTL empire, McEntee said.
   The Christian Broadcasting Network, which reaches 47 million
households with its for-profit The Family Channel, would add the
old PTL to its operation if its bid were accepted, said CBN
spokeswoman Frankie Abourjilie. She refused to disclose the amount
of the bid.
   ``We're going to make a bid on the cable delivery system and
equipment,'' Ms. Abourjilie said Thursday night.
   Bakker, whose ministry unraveled in a series of sex and money
scandals, got his start on the airwaves when he and his wife, Tammy
Faye, appeared on Robertson's network in the early 1970s.
   Baker has begun serving a 45-year sentence for conspiracy and
fraud at the Talladega, Ala., Federal Correctional Institution. He
entered the prison Tuesday, hours after being being sentenced in
federal court in Charlotte, N.C., and fined $500,000.
   Numerous requests for prison interviews have been referred to
the evangelist's lawyers, said spokeswoman Dana Newell.
   The bidding for Bakker's old TV network doesn't affect Heritage
USA, the Christian theme park and resort near Fort Mill, S.C.
   PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton decline to comment on
plans for sale of the rest of the ministry.
   Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman who had agreed to buy the
PTL's assets after it filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, let his
$64 million purchase contract expire Sept. 30 because he was unable
to obtain title insurance for Heritage USA.

   Because thoughts and convictions alone are no
longer considered crimes by the Soviet government, the KGB has
abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents, a government
newspaper said.
   The Izvestia newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov
Thursday as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had become
narrower, the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a
simple slip of the tongue.
   ``In and of themselves, thoughts and convictions, no matter what
they are, are not considered crimes if they are not realized in
actions included in the law,'' Kryuchkov was quoted as saying.
   He said the infamous 5th Directorate had been abolished and a
new unit would work ``to foil the conspiracies of foreign
intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government
groups in our country.'' It also, he said, would try to ``prevent
mass disorders and other illegal phenomena of an extremist bent.''
   Kryuchkov told Izvestia the new ``Subdivision for the Defense of
the Soviet Constitutional Structure'' would continue to fight
``antisocialist elements in the country.''
   Kryuchkov, who has tried to promote the image of a new and
kinder security service, said the 5th Directorate was founded in
1967 to counter ``ideological sabotage.''
   He acknowledged ``mistakes, shortcomings and, unfortunately,
abuses,'' but said poor laws were partly responsible.
   Yuri Mityunov, a veteran dissident, said Thursday that 5th
Directorate personnel functioned as ideological police.
   ``In its time, it punished people for telling political jokes,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``They're the people who are
listening to us now.''
   Mityunov said he believed the KGB was redistributing some
functions, but still was intent on harassing dissidents and even
assassinating people it viewed as political threats.
   Western sources say the 5th Directorate locked dissidents away
in prisons and mental hospitals, controlled religion in a
clandestine manner and persecuted Jews seeking to emigrate and
other minorities for nationalist activities.

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Destruction of Last Shorter-Range Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today destroyed the 957th and
last of its shorter-range nuclear missiles in keeping with a
superpower treaty banning them, the official Tass news agency
announced.
   Tass said the missile, known in the West as an SS-23, was
destroyed at the Saryozek test range in the Soviet Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan at 9 a.m. Moscow time (1 a.m. EDT). It said
U.S. inspectors were present.
   The missile, designated OTR-23 by the Soviets, had a range of
310 miles and was put into service in the early 1980s, Tass said.
It was among the medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles banned
by the treaty signed at the December 1987 superpower summit in
Washington.
   ``A whole class of nuclear weapons _ shorter-range missiles _
ceased to exist in the Soviet Union today,'' Tass quoted Col. Gen.
Bronislav Omelichev, first deputy chief of the Soviet general
staff, as saying.
   Elimination of the SS-23s began at Saryozek in August 1988, he
said.
   The U.S.-Soviet treaty also mandates the scrapping of the
superpowers' medium-range nuclear missiles, including the American
Pershing 2 and the Soviet SS-20.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoners are kept chained to the walls of
local police lockups for as long as three days at a time because of
overcrowding in regular jail cells, police said.
   Overcrowding at the Baltimore County Detention Center has forced
police to house hundreds of prisoners in nine precinct stations,
which lack the facilities or staff to keep prisoners under constant
observation while in their cells, authorities said.
   The prisoners are chained to horseshoe-shaped bars fastened to a
wall near the booking area of each precinct, where desk supervisors
can watch them, said Stephen R. Doarnberger, a police spokesman.
   Their legs are shackled at the ankles and one arm is attached to
the bar with leg irons to give them enough mobility to sit or
stand, he said.
   At night, the prisoners are given a small mattress and a
blanket, Doarnberger said. They eat in the hallway, but are
released to use the restroom.
   The other prisoners are kept together in a single cell with one
toilet. Most sleep on the floor, with mattresses provided each
night.
   Mark A. Levine, the county undersheriff, said the county
Detention Center, which can properly handle 410 prisoners,
currently houses 697 inmates.
   An annex that will add 228 beds is not expected to be ready for
another three years.
   ``That leaves us between a rock and a hard place,'' said Col.
Michael D. Gambrill, who is in charge of the lockups. ``We are not
really supposed to be in the prison business, but we are.''
   Gambrill said one reason for the added vigilance was to guard
against suicide attempts. Earlier this year, a federal jury awarded
$185,000 to the family of a man who killed himself at a precinct
station in 1987.
   Thirteen prisoners attempted suicide in the lockups this year,
police said, and 33 tried to kill themselves last year, all
unsuccessfully. In 1987, there were 13 attempted suicides in the
lockups and two suicides.

   A 71-year-old woman beat an intruder unconscious
with a hatchet after she and her great-granddaughter were attacked
by the assailant, a female acquaintance.
   ``She picked the wrong woman,'' Elizabeth Butts said Thursday.
``The only thing I hate is that I didn't kill her.''
   The intruder, identified as Terry Westbrook, was taken to
Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition with a fractured
skull and deep facial cuts. She was in fair condition this morning,
a hospital spokesman said.
   She will be charged with armed robbery and aggravated assault,
said Metro-Dade police Lt. Richard Carey.
   Westbrook was an acquaintance of Butts' who stopped by the
four-bedroom house the woman shares with her granddaughter and
16-month-old great-granddaughter, Nicole Williams, and asked for
money, saying she had just gotten out of prison, police said.
   Butts, holding the baby, wouldn't give her any money, so
Westbrook grabbed for Butts' gold chains, said Metro Detective
Donald Blocker.
   The intruder hit Butts on the head with a folding metal chair
and a ceramic lamp. At some point, little Nicole also was struck,
getting a bump on the head.
   As the woman tried to unlock the front door to leave, Butts put
Nicole down, reached into a utility closet and pulled out a
hatchet. She then beat the woman into unconsciousness.
   ``If somebody comes to your house and robs you, what would you
do?'' Butts asked. ``I should have had my gun, but I couldn't get
to it.''
   ``I wouldn't want old people generally doing this kind of
thing,'' Blocker said. ``The average person her age couldn't do
this.''

   A fire visible from two miles away
raged early today in a plastics plant outside Dallas, but
authorities said it posed no danger to residents and hadn't caused
any injuries.
   Meanwhile, the search for victims of a huge explosion at a
plastics plant in Pasadena continued today. Seven are confirmed
dead and 15 missing from the series of blasts that destroyed the
Phillips Petroleum Co. plant near Houston on Monday.
   The blaze today at the Poly-America Corp. factory, which makes
plastic bags and other plastic items, broke out at 11 p.m.
Thursday, said James Smith, assistant fire chief in this Dallas
suburb.
   The plant was closed for the night, and no one was believed
inside, Smith said.
   The fire was burning out of control early today, but didn't
threaten to spread beyond the plant, Smith said, adding that
firefighters expected it to burn through the night though they were
pouring water on the flames.
   ``There wasn't much we could do on this one,'' Smith said
   The cause had yet to be determined, Smith said.
   Flames were seen from two miles away and thick smoke from
burning plastic billowed from the fire, but Smith said evacuations
were unnecessary in the largely industrial area because the smoke
wasn't highly toxic, the nearest homes were a mile away, and the
smoke was blowing toward a 700-acre vacant field.
   At the Phillips plant, the search for victims and for clues to
the cause of the blast was halted for about five hours Thursday
because of a hydrocarbon leak, but sampling showed the leak didn't
pose a danger, said Phillips spokesman George Minter.
   ``We're taking an extremely conservative safety measure,'' he
said as activity was suspended.
   The investigation and clean-up work are being conducted around
the clock at the ruined plant, which produced plastic pellets used
to make milk jugs and grocery bags.
   Two victims' bodies were found Thursday outside a reactor
control room, said Phillips spokesman Scott Carlberg.
   Company experts have said the explosions began in ethylene and
isobutane gases leaking from a chemical reactor, but they have yet
to determine what ignited the gas.
   Phillips has yet to decide on the plant's future, said Lavele
Franz, vice president of human resources and services.

   A bus plowed into a highway
maintenance truck and burst into flames on an expressway south of
Seoul today, killing 16 people and injuring seven, some seriously,
police said.
   Soldiers rescued the injured by breaking the windows of the
burning bus with their rifle butts and dragging victims from the
flames, police told the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Some bodies were burned beyond recognition, police said. All of
the dead were aboard the bus, the agency said.
   The crash occurred when an express bus tried to pass a third
vehicle and crashed into a van that was following a maintenance
crew painting lines in the center of the highway, Yonhap said.
   The bus was traveling from southern Chonju to Seoul. It crashed
on the Honam Highway 100 miles south of the city.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post announced it will stop
publishing its seven-month-old Sunday edition after Nov. 26 because
it hasn't attracted enough advertisers or readers.
   The Sunday Post first hit the stands March 5 amid a blitz of
television ads and other promotions billing the paper as ``a cure
for the common Sunday.''
   The first issues included supplements devoted to books, travel
and television, and long feature stories in the news section. Owner
Peter Kalikow said the first four weeks of ads for the Sunday Post
were sold out.
   But advertising quickly declined and the Sunday Post lost
millions of dollars within a few months.
   On May 28 the paper was reduced to a single section and the
price was slashed from $1 to 40 cents.
   In announcing the decision to cease publication of the Sunday
Post, Kalikow said Thursday the Sunday paper attracted 250,000
readers.
   ``This is still nowhere near the over 500,000 readers who
purchase the paper on a daily basis,'' Kalikow said in a news
release. ``The circulation and advertising revenue mix on Sunday
simply does not lend itself to continued publication of this
edition. The economics just aren't there.''
   Kalikow also said he wanted to ``focus our attention and
resources on ensuring the long-term profitability and viability of
our six-day product.''
   The city's other daily newspapers, The New York Times, the Daily
News and New York Newsday, all publish Sunday editions.
   Kalikow bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Three Americans face prison terms of
10 years to life after being convicted of conspiring with Colombian
drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas to smuggle cocaine into the United
States.
   Two others were acquitted, by a federal jury.
   The so-called ``Son of Lehder'' case grew out of testimony in
last year's trial of of the Medellin cartel boss, who was convicted
and is serving a life term.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 59, who was convicted with Lehder last year
on drug conspiracy charges and sentenced to 15 years in prison, was
found guilty Thursday of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Barry Kane, 52, a Hyannis, Mass., attorney, and Donald Lady, 41,
of Pomona, Calif., were both convicted of conspiracy to import
cocaine, but were found innocent of conspiracy to distribute it.
   The defendants face prison terms of from 10 years to life.
Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 12.
   Kane collapsed after U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II
pronounced him guilty. He was quickly revived and wasn't
hospitalized.
   Kane, Lady and Reed were ordered held pending sentencing,
although Moore said he would consider a motion from Kane's attorney
that his client be freed on bond.
   Acquitted were Thomas H. Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.,
and Samuel T. Stewart, 53, of Anaheim, Calif.
   After the verdicts, a federal prosecutor said he's ready to try
the top leaders of Colombia's Medellin cartel here if they can be
caught. They were charged under the same indictment, but are
fugitives.
   ``It is our hope we can get Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha, Jorge Ochoa, Fabio Ochoa and Gonzalo Mejia. We feel we have
the best case against them,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst
Mueller.
   The prosecutor said Jorge Mario de la Cuesta, who is named in
the indictment, has been arrested in Colombia and may be extradited
to Jacksonville to stand trial. He has been identified as Escobar's
private pilot.
   Thursday's verdicts came after 18 hours of deliberation over
three days.
   The five were accused of conspiring with Lehder either to
smuggle cocaine into the United States or distribute it once it got
here.
   Lehder, 40, is reputed to be a co-founder of Colombia's Medellin
cartel, which is believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine
that enters the United States.
   ``Justice prevailed,'' said Stewart as he left the courthouse
following the 7-week-long trial. ``If it is any consolation, I was
innocent.''
   Kevin Sanders, who represented Stewart, said his client's
health, air-charter business and reputation had suffered as a
result of the trial.
   ``He's just very happy. He was truly innocent,'' he said.
   Herington, a student in engineering physics, refused to comment,
but his attorney, Patrick Hallinan, said, ``It's a great pleasure.
He's very, very happy. He faced the prospect of spending the rest
of his life in prison.''

   Banners and posters celebrate this
tiny town's newest legend _ earthquake survivor Buck Helm.
   ``This One's for You, Buck,'' says a sign in the window of the
New York Saloon. ``Our Thoughts Are With You, Buck and Bay Area,''
reads a banner on the courthouse.
   On the marquee of the Trinity Theater, Helm shares billing with
this week's movie. ``God Bless Family Helm. Cheeta and Friends,''
the sign reads.
   Helm, trapped in his car in the collapse of the double-decked
I-880 freeway during the Oct. 17 quake, survived to be rescued four
days later.
   The 57-year-old longshoreman's clerk, who works the docks in
Oakland and commutes 250 miles on weekends to visit his family
here, remained hospitalized with a fractured skull, three broken
ribs, nerve damage to his leg and kidney problems due to
dehydration.
   Along Main Street, with its covered sidewalks and historic
buildings, shopkeepers have posted handwritten signs in their
windows to congratulate Helm _ and indulge in a little
self-promotion.
   On Thursday, the Chamber of Commerce, the Red Cross and local
officials held a news conference seeking donations for victims of
the quake and predicting that Helm's fame would bring new visitors
to this town of about 3,500 people.
   ``Any recognition doesn't hurt,'' said Trinity County Supervisor
Dee Potter.
   Many local businessmen and officials are pleased with all the
attention Weaverville has gotten because of Helm, a survivor's
story in the 7.1-magnitude quake that killed over 60 people,
injured more than 3,000 and left over 14,000 homeless throughout
Northern California.
   But some townsfolk who moved here for the isolation, aren't
thrilled with efforts to capitalize on Helm's sudden fame.
   ``It's bringing the town a lot of publicity,'' said Nola
Brimhall, a teller at North Valley Bank. ``I'm not sure we want the
word to get too far out there.''

   A 5-year-old girl whose mother tried to
treat her head lice with gasoline was in critical condition today
after the gas fumes were ignited by the pilot light in a stove.
   Crystal Kilgore was burned on her head, hands, neck, back and
arms in the accident Wednesday night, police said. She was in
critical condition at Humana Burn Center in Augusta.
   The mother put gasoline on the girl's head, then took her
through the kitchen to rinse her hair in the sink. On the way, the
child got close to the gas stove and her hair caught fire.
   The mother burned her hands trying to put out the fire. Her
boyfriend managed to smother the fire with a blanket, police said.
   Pendleton Police Chief James Cleveland said the incident was
under investigation, although he doubted officers would file
charges.
   ``Gasoline is not a recommended way to get rid of head lice,''
said Janie King, child health nurse with the Appalachia Health
District. ``It's an old wive's tale which is extremely dangerous.''
   Several over-the-counter medications and prescriptions are
available to kill head lice, she said.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incumbent Kathy Whitmire is banking on her
leadership during the lean years of the oil bust to carry her to a
record-tying fifth consecutive term as mayor of Houston.
   Polls give her a large lead over former two-term mayor Fred
Hofheinz, her main opponent among six challengers in the Nov. 7
election.
   Mrs. Whitmire, a 43-year-old accountant, won her first two-year
term in 1978. A recent Houston Chronicle poll showed Mrs. Whitmire
with a lead of nearly 20 percent over Hofheinz.
   ``It seems like this is going to be a very difficult race for
Mr. Hofheinz to turn around _ very difficult,'' said Bob Stein, a
Rice University political scientist. ``At this point I can't
identify an issue that he can do that with.
   ``The issue he has chosen to campaign on _ drugs _ he is losing.
He is not seen as more capable to fight the war on drugs.''
   Hofheinz contends that ``the current administration has run out
of gas.'' He added that if eight years are enough for a president,
it should be more than enough for Mrs. Whitmire.
   In her 1985 campaign, Mrs. Whitmire easily whipped former Mayor
Louie Welch, whose 1964-1973 tenure set a longevity record she is
trying to match. The city's longest-serving chief executive, Oscar
Holcombe, held office for 22 years, but not consecutively, between
1921 and 1958.
   Mrs. Whitmire said she looks forward to leading the nation's
fourth-largest city into the 1990s.
   She has pledged to make the fight on illegal drugs her highest
priority. ``We need to make this city the least attractive to crack
dealers,'' she said.
   Hofheinz argues that the drug war cannot be won without the
Houston Police Department's support. Two major police unions,
bitterly at odds with Mrs. Whitmire, have endorsed Hofheinz,
although they opposed him when he was in office from 1974 to 1977.
   Hofheinz, 51, an attorney with a doctorate in economics,
attributes low police morale to Mrs. Whitmire's administration.
Until the first police cadet class of 70 began this month, some 500
officers had left the department in the past three years and none
were replaced.
   With city revenues down because of the oil bust, police and
other city workers took a 3 percent pay cut in 1986. Only recently
was the cut restored.
   Mrs. Whitmire took office at the height of the oil boom. When
the bubble burst, unemployment reached almost 13 percent, prominent
businesses filed for bankruptcy, skyscrapers sat empty and the
housing market came to a standstill.
   Mrs. Whitmire said she has steered the city through the tough
times and boasts that unemployment has been lowered to about 5
percent.
   ``Now that Houston is enjoying economic recovery, it is no
surprise that others relish the thought of serving as mayor,'' Mrs.
Whitmire said.
   Another change Houstonians have seen during the mayor's tenure
is with the mayor herself.
   Gone are the dowdy days of dark suits with bow ties, large-frame
glasses and shoulder-length locks that had local wits comparing her
to the female impersonator Dustin Hoffman portrayed in ``Tootsie.''
   The mayor has switched to brighter, fashionable dresses and
suits, contact lenses, and a modified bob haircut.

<HEAD>Massive Rallies For Reform As Authorities Meet with Opposition</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with amnesty for jailed would-be escapees;

<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's new leadership today declared an
amnesty for all citizens accused of illegally trying to escape from
the communist nation, a move expected to free several thousand
people from prison.
   The amnesty also would allow tens of thousands of East Germans
who have fled to West Germany through Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
Poland in recent months to return home without facing criminal
prosecution.
   The announcement came a day after more than 100,000 people
rallied in Dresden and other East German cities for democratic
reform, and a Politburo member began talks with a leading
opposition group.
   The amnesty, which also covers those who took part in illegal
street protests, is the firmest step toward reform since Egon Krenz
replaced long-time leader Erich Honecker as Communist Party chief
on Oct. 18.
   It was announced by the official news agency ADN, which said all
prisoners affected would be freed by Nov. 30. Although East Germany
does not release information on inmate numbers, Western sources
said the measure would affect thousands.
   ADN said the amnesty covered all people accused of border
violations through today.
   Also today, the nation's legendary former intelligence chief,
Markus Wolf, called for greater openness and expressed some
sympathy for the refugees who headed West.
   In an interview with party newspaper Neues Deutschland, Wolf
said, ``the recovery of trust is demanded before we can develop
further,'' indicating Krenz may be open to loosening some
constraints on the media and free expression.
   Late Thursday, the state-run ADN news agency reported the huge
rally in Dresden and said 15,000 people also marched in Erfurt,
25,000 in Rostock and 5,000 more in Gera.
   Earlier, East Berlin Communist Party chief Guenter Schabowski
talked for two hours with scientists Jens Reich and Sebastian
Pflugbeil, founding members of the group New Forum. It was the
first time a member of the ruling Polituro met with the group, the
largest of the new organizations pushing for reform.
   Communist authorities banned New Forum in September but have
tolerated the group anyway.
   Reich described the talks as ``open and constructive. We
presented New Forum's concepts and ideas.''
   He said Schabowski ``told us he wanted to begin a new political
course and wanted to learn about the whole political spectrum
here.''
   Reich, a molecular biologist at East Berlin's Academy of
Sciences, said Schabowski assured him the government's interest in
talks to solve the nation's problems ``was a real change and not a
tactical move.''
   Reich and other New Forum leaders later addressed several
hundred people in an East Berlin church to explain the group's aims
and their talks with Schabowski.
   East German television broadcast a special program on the church
meeting. The television and ADN reports both marked a radical
change from previous practice, when state-controlled media limited
themselves to reporting only official party policy.
   In staging rallies Thursday, demonstrators ignored an earlier
appeal by Communist authorities for citizens not to protest in the
streets.
   In Dresden, however, the demonstration appeared to have the
official blessing of local Communist authorities.
   At the open-air rally in the southern industrial city,
opposition leaders and local Communist Party officials addressed
the crowd from a podium equipped with loudspeakers, ADN said.
   Hans Modrow, the local party chief long believed to be a strong
supporter of reform, told the crowd a process had begun that would
lead to ``revolutionary change,'' ADN said.
   East Berlin's mayor, Erhard Krack, on Thursday invited
``citizens interested in dialogue'' to a discussion at City Hall
and at the capital city's convention center on Sunday, ADN said.
   East Germany's Federation of Lawyers called on the government to
allow multi-candidate elections and demanded reform of the nation's
legal system.

   John Major, who went from welfare recipient to
economic overlord, is a trapeze artist's son whose own climb to
lofty heights has been nothing short of meteoric.
   The former foreign secretary was chosen by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher on Thursday to become chancellor of the
exchequer, replacing Nigel Lawson in the top treasury post.
   Rising from humble origins, the 46-year-old Major is regarded as
a prime example of the ambitious and successful Tories who have
thrived during the Thatcher decade.
   Major is widely regarded as an orthodox monetarist and a
Thatcher loyalist. Political analysts said his appointment likely
won't mark significant changes in British economic policy.
   Major quickly issued a statement in which he vowed to continue
the government's fight against inflation and maintain a tight
monetary stance.
   The appointment came just three months after Major was pushed
into the limelight and made foreign secretary. He had been chief
secretary to the Treasury.
   His appointment as foreign secretary in July, replacing Sir
Geoffrey Howe, was part of one of Mrs. Thatcher's boldest political
strokes. Howe now serves as deputy prime minister.
   But as one of Mrs. Thatcher's current favorites, Major has been
satirized by opposition Labor Party members as her ``poodle.''
   When Major was a child, his father, a circus stuntman who
performed on both tightrope and trapeze, was declared bankrupt.
   Major was brought up in a couple of rooms in Brixton, a tough
south London neighborhood.
   In his teens, he was a soapbox Tory, and after high school, he
joined an accounting firm as a trainee.
   He left to become a construction laborer because, he said,
``there was more money in it.''
   Major is the only Cabinet member to have been on ``the dole,''
or welfare, for eight months.
   He did volunteer work in Nigeria during the civil war there and
survived a car crash over a cliff with only a smashed leg.
   In the hospital, he decided to go into politics.
   ``I came to the conclusion that I wanted to be inside the
goldfish bowl, rather than outside longingly looking in,'' Major
has said.
   Before making his bid for the House of Commons, however, he
established a career at the Standard Chartered Bank.
   He won a seat in Parliament in 1979, and his rise since has been
one of the fastest in recent political history.
   His manner is gentle and conscientious, and he has a reputation
for quickly grasping figures and detail.
   Major's wife Norma has written a biography of opera singer Joan
Sutherland. The Majors have a son and a daughter.
   The family lives in Huntingdon, 59 miles north of London, but
likely will move to 11 Downing St., next door to the prime
minister's residence, where the chancellor traditionally resides.

<HEAD>Chinese Military Officers Ordered Off Joint Arms Project Back to
Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese military officers ordered off a joint
arms project with the United States after the Beijing crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters were allowed back to work this month, a
newspaper reported today.
   The 42 officers are assigned to Project Peace Pearl, a $500
million program to upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes, with China
expected to ultimately buy enhanced aviation electronic technology.
   They were taken off the project at Grumman Corp. in Bethpage,
N.Y., and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, when
President Bush banned high-level contacts with China after the
Chinese army attacked demonstrators in June, killing hundreds and
perhaps thousands in Beijing.
   But early this month the Bush administration quietly lifted the
suspension, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
Seven of the Chinese officers who stayed in the United States
returned to work Oct. 2, and 18 returned from China to begin work
this week.
   ``It was determined by the U.S. government that they are
needed,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman.
``You can assume that the decision was fully coordinated by the
Defense Department, the State Department, the White House and
National Security Council.''
   Project Peace Pearl, which will sell advanced avionics equipment
to the Chinese for the F-8s, is still in the development stage. The
scheduled shipment to China of $500 million in equipment is not due
until 1992, but it is undetermined if the sale will go through.
   In June, Bush announced a $600 million freeze against China
would include the avionics sale, and another $100 million shipment
of military equipment.
   On June 5, immediately after Bush proposed the freeze, Grumman
officials told the 40 Chinese nationals not to return to work, but
kept 250 Americans assigned to the project on the job, said Mariam
Reid, a Grumman spokeswoman.
   Two Chinese military officers working on the project at
Wright-Patterson were not kicked off the base, but told to stay
away from the project office.
   The Air Force oversees the project, which will continue despite
uncertainty about the sale, Lundquist said.

<HEAD>`The Secret Rapture,' A Play by David Hare, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `In London...', to DELETE incorrect reference
to play appearing in London's West End. No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Isobel and Marion are sisters. Isobel believes
in doing the right thing. Marion believes in doing what she thinks
is right.
   Their differences are the foundation of ``The Secret Rapture,''
David Hare's fascinating drama about public and private greed that
opened Thursday at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore Theatre. It's
impressive theater, directed by the playwright himself in a spare,
no-nonsense style.
   What Hare, the author of ``Plenty,'' ``A Map of the World'' and
``Pravda,'' has written is a striking morality play in which the
line between good and evil is fudged, distorted by those domestic
entanglements called ``family.''
   The two sisters are brought together at their father's funeral.
Not only must they come to terms with his death, they must deal
with their young, alcoholic stepmother, Katherine.
   In London, where the play enjoyed a great success at the
National Theatre, ``The Secret Rapture'' was taken by many critics
to be an indictment of Margaret Thatcher's England.
   Marion is a junior minister in the Conservative government. Her
husband, Tom, is president of Christians in Business. ``We try to
do business the way Jesus would have done it,'' he says. Husband
and wife have sanctified success, in business and in politics.
   But the play is more than a political tract, primarily because
of Hare's treatment of Isobel. The woman, who runs a graphic design
business, is a restless, romantic heroine, a do-gooder with doubts.
She hires her stepmother against the advice of Irwin, her boyfriend
and employee. And then she reluctantly agrees to have her company
purchased by Tom's conglomerate, only to learn that Irwin already
has defected to her brother-in-law.
   These decisions have disastrous consequences, both
professionally and personally, for Isobel. She willingly enters
into the agreements; she's not a pushover, coerced into action. But
what makes Isobel different from the other characters is that she
has qualms about what she does.
   Marion has another side, too. She's ruthless and self-pitying
but you can sympathize with her feelings when she complains that
Isobel makes her feel as if she's always wrong. ``We can't all be
perfect,'' Marion snaps. ``We do try.''
   Hare's dialogue is literate, witty and, at times, moving. There
is a sadness around the edges of the play that never really comes
to the forefront until the final curtain. By then, it's devastating.
   Designer Santo Loquasto captures this melancholy in his striking
sets, particularly a red autumnal backdrop, lighted by Richard
Nelson.
   Hare has written three smashing roles for women, and his
challenge is ably met in this production. In the central role of
Isobel, Blair Brown radiates a goodness that is believable, a
goodness rooted more in honesty than in saintliness.
   Frances Conroy, her hair swirled tightly around her head, looks
like a cross between Mrs. Thatcher and Princess Anne. Her wonderful
portrait of the ambitious Marion is cold, astringent and deadly
accurate. And Mary Beth Hurt excels as the devious, acid-tongued
Katherine, who wants sympathy but rarely offers any of her own.
   There is strong support in secondary roles from Stephen Vinovich
as Tom, the smug Christian businessman who's building a swimming
pool in his back yard to baptize converts, Michael Wincott as
Isobel's distraught boyfriend and Jennifer Van Dyck as Marion's
predatory assistant.
   After a swift burst of violence, ``The Secret Rapture'' ends
enigmatically with one of the sisters left alone on stage. It
amounts to a reconciliation of sorts, although the playwright never
settles who was right and who was wrong. But then, that's real
life, and maybe one of the reasons ``The Secret Rapture'' is such a
rich and satisfying play.
   The play opened to mostly unfavorable reviews, with critics
lamenting a loss between the British and U.S. productions. The New
York Post said what in London was poetic, on Broadway is
``obscurantist, pretentious, and annoying.''
   New York Newsday called it a ``flawed'' but ``fascinating''
drama, while the Daily News said the play was ``too calculated, too
schematic.'' The New York Times said, ``The passion and wit that
reside in his (Hare's) script ... are left unrealized in this
production.''

<HEAD>Court Rules That British Tourist Was Murdered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled today that a British tourist
who died last year in a game reserve was murdered, rejecting the
government's contention that she was devoured by animals.
   ``I think the animals are innocent,'' said Chief Magistrate
Joseph Mango, ruling in the case of 28-year-old Julie Ward.
   Ms. Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were
found Sept. 13, 1988, in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a
week after she reportedly left the park.
   Her partly burned personal belongings and ashes also were found
near the remains, 5 miles from her abandoned vehicle.
   ``There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died
of foul play by a person or persons unknown,'' Mango concluded.
   But he said he ``saw no reason'' to direct the attorney
general's office to further investigate her death and rejected
claims by Ms. Ward's family that the state engaged in a massive
coverup either to protect her assassin or Kenya's lucrative tourist
industry.
   ``There has been a strong attack on the quality of the
investigations ... And allegations of a coverup,'' said Mango. ``Of
course the state does not admit this.''
   He further denied that Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's chief
game warden, is a principle suspect in Ms. Ward's slaying.
   Ms. Ward's father, John Ward, and his attorney, Byron
Georgiadis, pointed to Makallah as a suspect. They allege she was
killed by someone who knew the game park well, who had freedom of
movement there and who could have ordered or inspired a coverup of
the circumstances surrounding her disappeareance.
   Makallah found Ms. Ward's remains within hours after her vehicle
was located. Georgiadis alleged he was able to do that only because
he already knew where they were.
   Mango said, however, there was no evidence to suggest Makallah
and Ms. Ward ever met before her death and that he found her
remains ``does not cast suspicion on Makallah.''
   Instead, he said investigators should consider as prime suspects
two men Ms. Ward spent time with in the game park, neither of whom
appeared as witnesses during the inquest.
   The ruling ended an inquiry that began in mid-August and ran
intermittently until Oct. 6.
   The inquest largely was the result of pressure from Ms. Ward's
father who has spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of
hours trying to prove his daughter was murdered.
   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Suffolk, England, said:``It is a
credit to Kenya that they came up with this verdict.'' Ward
maintained, however, there was a coverup.

<HEAD>Playwright Havel Reported Hospitalized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel
was hospitalized after being forced from his sick bed by police and
taken to a police station, a friend said today.
   Vladimir Hanzel said police entered Havel's apartment in Prague
on Thursday evening as he lay in bed suffering from a high
temperature and forced him to accompany them to a police station.
   Havel, 53, insisted that an ambulance be called and he was taken
to the Na Frantisku hospital in central Prague, where doctors
decided he required hospitalization for a bronchial illness, Hanzel
said.
   Havel has suffered from the lung complaint since serving a jail
sentence from 1979 to early 1983.
   Hospital sources who asked not to be identified said Havel was
suffering from a bronchial inflammation and had a temperature of
99.7.
   Eva Kanturkova, another outlawed writer who like Havel was among
the first to sign the Charter 77 human rights document 12 years
ago, also was detained Thursday by police, fellow dissident Vaclav
Benda said.
   It was not known if any more activists were arrested.
   Security forces routinely detain prominent dissidents in advance
of banned demonstrations. Such a protest is scheduled Saturday to
mark the 71st anniversary of the founding of Czechoslovakia.
   Last year, about 5,000 people gathered to mark the anniversary
and were dispersed by riot police using batons, tear gas, dogs and
water cannons. At least 87 people were arrested.
   The authorities have said anybody defying the ban on this year's
demonstration faces prosecution. They scheduled a military ceremony
on the same square a few hours before Saturday's planned protest.

<HEAD>Postal Inspectors Probing Pornographic Mailings to Congress Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Postal inspectors are investigating the use of
apparently stolen congressional envelopes in which pornographic
materials were mailed to House and Senate members at taxpayer
expense, according to published reports.
   Former Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., whose official signature was
imprinted on the envelopes, said he also has asked the Justice
Department to investigate, according to Roll Call, a newspaper
about happenings in Congress.
   The Washington Times today quoted Robert Rota, the House
postmaster, as saying the envelopes apparently were stolen.
   Enclosed in the envelopes which began arriving in congressional
offices on Tuesday were green, dollar-sized coupons imprinted with
obscenities and offering bearers a $1 discount on sexual acts.
   ``Describe them?'' the Times quoted Coelho as saying. ``It's too
gross for that.''
   One of the letters ended up in the hands of Coelho's wife,
Phyllis, a secretary for Rep. Andy Jacobs, D-Ind. ``I got really
angry,'' she said.
   The Times said most of the envelopes addressed to senators were
confiscated Thursday by Senate Postmaster Gayle Cory, who had been
alerted that they might be arriving.
   Coelho resigned from the House in June rather than face a
prolonged investigation into his investments.

<HEAD>Mazowiecki Tells Warsaw Pact to Focus on Less Guns, More Butter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told
Warsaw Pact diplomats today that they should put less emphasis on
their alliance's military role and improve economic ties to reflect
the great changes in the East bloc.
   Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist leader of a Soviet bloc
nation, also sought to assure his Communist allies that the
democratic changes taking place in Poland posed no danger to their
alliance.
   Mazowiecki made the comments during a toast at a dinner for
foreign ministers and foreign trade ministers attending a two-day
Warsaw Pact meeting in the capital.
   He called for ``radically'' restructuring Comecon, the
organization that coordinates economic relations among the seven
pact countries, and stressed the need to respect the internal
sovereignty of pact nations.
   ``These principles take on particular significance at the
present time of changes going on in many of our countries,'' he
said, apparently referring to reforms in Hungary and the Soviet
Union and the beginnings of reform in East Germany.
   The gathering is the first Warsaw Pact meeting to be held in
Poland since Solidarity took control of the government in August.
Other members of the Warsaw Pact are Bulgaria, Romania and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``Our reforms pose no threat to anybody and violate nobody's
interests,'' he said. ``On the contrary, the changes that are going
on in Poland now lead to normalizing the internal situation, and
thus indirectly to stability of European relations.
   ``Poland is true to her commitments as an ally and fulfills her
duties stemming from this.''
   Poland wants to expand and improve political and defense
cooperation in the Warsaw Pact, as well as economic, scientific and
technical cooperation in Comecon, Mazowiecki said.
   But at the same time, Europe should be less divided, he said.
   ``A return to the unity of Europe means not only the common
heritage of culture and civilization, but also the need for joint
development of conditions of detente and peace,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Urging changes within the pact itself, he said, ``The Warsaw
Treaty cannot lag behind the current of transformations. We must
not lose sight of the vision of a world free from opposed military
blocs.''
   He said that system should be replaced by ``by an efficient
system of collective security _ a vision that was outlined in the
U.N. Charter'' in 1945.
   ``Today it is important to put emphasis on the political instead
of the military roles of the treaties.''
   Giving the answering toast was Foreign Minister Ioan Totu of
Romania, a country whose leaders tried unsuccessfully to rally
Warsaw Pact nations in August to prevent Solidarity's government
takeover.
   Totu stressed the need for ``non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries.''
   Apparently referring to repeated Western calls for human rights
improvements in some East bloc countries, particularly Romania, he
said: ``Imperialist, reactionary circles resort to actions and
attempts at interference in the affairs of socialist states and
their destabilization.
   ``It is necessary to reject actions of this kind as flagrantly
discordant'' with the 1975 Helsinki Accords and the U.N. Charter.

<HEAD>Paper Accuses Zhao Aide Of Blocking Deng's Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper said today that a top adviser
to ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang blocked publication of
a collection of speeches and sayings by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The collection, ``Deng Xiaoping on Literature and the Arts,''
was issued Thursday at a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People
and acclaimed by the new culture minister, He Jingzi, as a ``great
event in cultural and publishing circles.''
   A top party official, Li Ruihuan, said the books would be of
great help in eradicating the influence of Western liberal ideas,
and he urged artists and writers to study them to ``unify
thinking.''
   In a front-page editorial, the Guangming Daily said the
collection was put together two years ago.
   ``Because of obstruction from Bao Tong, who grasped some power
then, it could not be published then,'' it said.
   Bao was a key adviser to Zhao and director of the party's
Research Center for the Reform of the Political Structure. He is
believed to be under arrest.
   If Deng had personally wanted the collection to be published
earlier, it is highly unlikely Bao would have been able to stop it.
   Zhao was ousted from his party posts in June after losing a
power struggle triggered by student pro-democracy protests. Other
party officials accused him of supporting the protests and
splitting the party. He has not been seen in public since.
   The publication of the collection is part of an effort since the
protests to lionize Deng as a wise leader on a par with
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung.
   The collection's title echoes that of a famous 1942 speech by
Mao, ``On Literature and the Arts,'' which codified party policy
that the arts must serve socialism.
   The Guangming Daily said, ``Deng Xiaoping's important
composition on literature and the arts is the guiding principle to
prosper and develop socialist literature and the arts.''
   It said the writings criticized extreme individualism, nihilism,
anarchism, abstract humanitarianism, theories of alienation under
socialism, money-worship, pornography and ``all kinds of corrupted
thought and capitalist lifestyles.''
   Under former Culture Minister Wang Meng, a writer who lost his
post in September, the government had stressed the need for
artistic freedom.
   In contrast, a recent People's Daily editorial said Chinese
literature in recent years has become ``wilder than ever before''
as writers imitate ``Western bourgeois literary phenomena such as
black humor, symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, the fantasy
school, stream of consciousness, imagism and so on.''
   It said writers have a lofty mission to write about socialist
realities and the ``beauty of human nature.''

<HEAD>Defense Ends Closing Arguments in McMartin Pre-School Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for two people whose trial on child
molestation charges is the longest in U.S. history has finally
completed his case, pleading with the jury not to believe the
sexually graphic testimony of youngsters.
   ``You can still love children and still want to believe them,
but in a courtroom you can't rely on them,'' attorney Danny Davis
said Thursday as he finished his closing argument.
   Davis represents Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, 62. Both are charged with 65 counts of molestation
and conspiracy involving 11 children at the now-defunct McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   The first arrests in the case came six years ago. The trial of
Buckey and his mother has lasted about 2{ years, the longest trial
in U.S. history. Charges against five others eventually were
dismissed.
   Nine children testified about alleged sexual abuse. Davis called
them ``lovely, rehearsed children'' who were led to believe they
were molested when nothing really happened.
   Davis said the children memorized their testimony after
interviews by therapists and coaching by prosecutors.
   He also questioned the testimony of George Freeman, an admitted
perjurer and jailhouse informant who said Buckey confessed to child
molestations while the two shared a cell.
   ``You should not reward people who bring in perjurers and shaped
children,'' Davis said. ``Did Ray Buckey have to prove his
innocence because the evidence the (prosecutors) looked for to
prove otherwise was not there? He's entitled to the benefit of the
doubt.''
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders imposed a limit of 6{ days
for each side to give closing arguments to expedite the case and
reduce the possibility of a mistrial.
   The defense took all its time for closing arguments after three
days of closing statements from the prosecution. Prosecutors saved
3{ days and will now use the time to rebut Davis.

   Rescuers located 31 badly burned bodies
amid the wreckage of a China Airlines jet today, a day after the
plane crashed in a remote valley with 54 people on board, officials
and news reports said.
   An air and land search for survivors was suspended tonight
because of darkness, and officials said the search would resume
Saturday. A Los Angeles man was believed to have been the only
foreigner aboard.
   ``The plane was broken into many pieces. It is hard to imagine
anyone could have survived,' said Communications Minister Clement
Chang, who toured the crash site by helicopter.
   The Boeing 737-200, belonging to Taiwan's national flag carrier,
slammed into a mountain and burst into flames five minutes after
taking off Thursday from Hualien, a popular tourist resort on the
island's east coast.
   The jet was en route from Hualien to Taipei, about 90 miles
northeast.
   The official Broadcasting Corporation of China said rescuers
found 31 bodies strewn in deep grass in the highlands valley and
began the arduous task of carrying them on the three-hour walk down
the mountain to Hualien. Rescuers also found limbs and other body
parts, the radio said.
   The so-called ``black box,'' which records cockpit conversations
between the pilot and control tower, was recovered from the crash
site, the radio report said.
   China Airlines spokeman Lodge Lo said the company was looking
into any possible ``mechanical or crew'' error that might have
caused the crash of the 3-year-old plane.
   Hualien control tower officials said they instructed the plane
to turn east and fly over the sea after takeoff, but it turned west
toward land. No explanation was given.
   President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Lee Huan both ordered an
investigation into the crash.
   The radio broadcast quoted rescuers as saying they located a
wing and other fragments of the plane, indicating the aircraft
exploded after it crashed. Bits of the plane were strewn over 75
yards, it said.
   ``Small fragments were everywhere. There was hardly a large
chunk in the wreckage,'' rescuer Wang Teh was quoted as saying.
   Television footage showed weeping relatives crowding a Hualien
police station. Monks read Buddhist scriptures, believed to help
the dead in the afterlife, airline officials said.
   A radio report from the crash site said most bodies were burned
beyond recognition. Rescuers were able immediately to identify only
the body of J. Wayne Phillips, 46, vice president of the Universal
Paint Corp. of Los Angeles.
   The airline said Phillips was the only foreigner on the flight.
A Paint Corp. secretary said Phillips was in Taiwan on business.

   Finns cheered and applauded today as Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in this city near the Arctic
Circle to see technological marvels that could help his country's
failing economy.
   At least 5,000 people gathered outside City Hall and hundreds
lined the road from the airport waving Soviet and Finnish flags to
greet Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, after they flew in from
Helsinki, 400 miles away.
   The couple waded into the crowd to shake hands as residents
applauded and cheered.
   ``What a lot of people!'' Mrs. Gorbachev exclaimed.
   School was closed for the day in Oulu, a Baltic Sea city of
100,000 people 140 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
   ``This is such a little town no one ever comes,'' Johanna
Harkonen, 16, told reporters.
   The Gorbachevs, on the last day of a three-day trip to Finland,
headed for the University of Oulu, which features a modern computer
center and an electron optics department; and for Oulu Technology
Park, where companies research electronics and communications.
   Before leaving Helsinki, Gorbachev, who presides over sessions
of the Supreme Soviet legislature in Moscow, tried out the gavel
and electronic voting system at the Finnish Parliament.
   In a speech Thursday, the Soviet leader recognized Finland's
neutrality and announced plans to cut Moscow's nuclear forces in
the Baltic Sea.
   The Kremlin chief also said the Soviet Union has removed all
tactical nuclear missiles that could strike the Baltic region and
would take certain types of sea-launched nuclear weapons out of the
Baltic Sea.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Miners to Meet Next Week for Strike Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ukrainian miners will meet next week to decide
whether to go on strike to protest what they say is the
government's failure to abide by promises made during strikes last
summer, a representative said today.
   The Ukraine's Donetsk basin, the Soviet Union's largest
coal-producing area, and other coal regions were paralyzed by the
summer strikes. Miners went back to work after the Kremlin promised
to meet virtually all their demands for better working conditions,
improved supplies of consumer goods and more financial independence.
   But Ukrainian miners' representatives say those promises have
not been kept. They voted Thursday against immediately resuming the
giant strike but decided to poll workers to see how much support
there was for renewing it.
   Alexander Nikolaevich Tupikin, a member of the Donetsk strike
committee, said by telephone that the decisions of all individual
mines and work shifts should be known by Tuesday.
   On that day, a council representing workers from throughout the
region will meet, ``sum up all the opinions and decide what the
next step should be,'' he said.
   Soviet officials have said a renewed round of miners' strikes
could force a rationing of heat and light as the winter sets in
because of a reduction of coal.
   Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet legislature passed a law
banning strikes in such vital areas as energy, defense and
transport.
   The law didn't stop 18,000 miners in the northern region of
Vorkuta from holding a one-day strike Thursday to demand the
Kremlin make good on the promised benefits, as well as end the
Communist Party's monopoly on power.
   The strikers decided to return to work at all but one mine after
hearings on the illegal strike began in regional court, Vorkuta
strike committee member Sergei Masolovich said by telephone.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday ``strong
administrative measures through the prosecutor and the court''
might be taken to discourage wildcat strikes.

   South Africa and Israel are cooperating on
several programs to develop ballistic missiles, including one with
nuclear weapon potential, a U.S. official says.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
intelligence reports indicated that South Africa last summer tested
a modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho II medium-range
missile at Armaston on the Indian Ocean coast near Capetown.
   Israel test-fired its own Jericho II missile over the
Mediterranean last year, he said. Both missiles have a 900-mile
range.
   The two countries, which have had an extensive defense
relationship since the 1960s, also are cooperating in the
development of a long-range missile that could be used to launch
reconnaissance satellites into space, the official said.
   A long-range version of the Jericho _ known as the Shavit, which
is Hebrew for comet _ was used to launch an Israeli
photo-reconnaissance satellite earlier this year from the Negev
Desert, the official said. Media reports then described the rocket
as a multistage missile having a 2,000-mile range.
   Responding to reports about the nuclear cooperation, the State
Department urged Israel to sign the international Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it has refused to do for fear of
opening its facilities to international inspection.
   ``We have repeatedly urged Israel and other non-signatories'' to
join the pact, the department said in statement issued late
Thursday. ``We reiterate that call.''
   Both Israel and South Africa have denied they are sharing such
technology.
   ``I bear no knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation,'' said
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha.
   In Jerusalem today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the
reports of Israeli-South African nuclear cooperation were designed
to ``tear the fabric'' of U.S.-Israeli relations at a time when
Israel was trying to bridge differences with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III about peace talks with Palestinians.
   Under intense U.S. pressure, Israel announced in 1987 that it
would not sign any new defense contracts with South Africa but
would honor existing ones.
   The State Department and the Pentagon refused to discuss the
matter.
   ``We do not comment on intelligence matters. The U.S. policy of
opposition to the proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons is
well known,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. ambassador in Israel had brought up
similar reports of nuclear proliferation with Israel in the past.
Israel turned down the protest of former ambassador Thomas
Pickering, The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   And when a senior State Department official brought up the issue
with a visiting Israeli delegation last spring, ``he was stiffed,
just absolutely stiffed on it,'' the Post quoted an unidentified
source as saying.
   Israel and South Africa reportedly also are cooperating on
development of a South African jet fighter known as the Cheetah. It
is a modified version of the Israeli Lavi fighter that was scrapped
under strong U.S. pressure in the final stages of its development
two years ago.
   The assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Herman
Cohen, indirectly confirmed recently that there had been some
cooperation between the two countries on intermediate-range
missiles.
   Israel has pledged to phase out its defense ties with South
Africa, Cohen said in a television interview, but added, ``I am
assuming cooperation of intermediate range ballistic missiles comes
under existing contracts.''
   NBC-TV reported that South Africa was providing Israel with
enriched uranium for its own nuclear warheads. Neither country has
admitted having nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Army Blocks Bishops From Delivering Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army blocked three
Christian bishops from delivering truckloads of food today to a
Christian Arab town closed by military order because of its boycott
of Israeli taxes.
   The bishops and two other high-ranking religious leaders also
abandoned plans to visit the town of Beit Sahour _ minus the food
trucks _ when army officers insisted a military escort had to
accompany them.
   Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem, has been the scene of a major
confrontation between Israeli authorities and residents boycotting
Israeli taxes as part of the 22-month uprising against the
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The town, with a mostly Christian population of 10,000, has been
closed to outsiders much of the time since Sept. 20, when the
government began confiscating property in raids aimed at breaking
the tax boycott.
   The religious leaders included the Jerusalem patriarchs, or
bishops, of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian
churches. Accompanying them were representatives of the Greek
Catholic sect and the Franciscan religious order.
   The churchmen had hoped to pray in Beit Sahour and meet with the
mayor, said Roman Catholic Patriarch Michel Sabbah.
   ``They (the soldiers) did not let us do our humanitarian
duties,'' Sabbah complained.
   Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros I called the incident ``an
insult to our ranks and our rights through the ages'' to worship in
the Holy Land, the spokesman for the group said.
   An Army spokesman said the three trucks of sugar, rice, flour
and cooking oil were blocked because the town is a ``closed
military area'' where non-residents cannot enter. While the town is
believed to have some shortages, there is no threat of starvation.
   Army officials also said officers felt the religious leaders and
their aides, totaling about 20 people, could provoke an incident in
Beit Sahour.
   The three bishops rejected an army offer to allow them to enter
the Christian town with a military escort for their own safety.
   ``(The bishops) said `God will protect us.' But the commander of
the area responsible for their safety felt it would be unwise,''
said the army spokesman, who is not identified under military
regulations.
   When told they would not be allowed into the town, the religious
leaders went to the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem and prayed for
Beit Sahour. The church bells were rung to show solidarity with the
nearby town.
   The prayers at the church that is regarded by tradition as the
birthplace of Christ represented a rare show of unity since
Christian sects often squabble over their rights to the church and
other religious sites.
   Meanwhile, police said they were investigating the fatal
shooting Thursday of an 18-year-old Bethlehem youth, Naeem Karim
Daamseh.
   Daamseh was shot in the neck by a policeman after he ignored a
police order to stop, struck a policeman with his car and was
pursued by a police van, police officials said.
   Police spokesman Mordechai Bareket denied a Palestinian witness'
charge that police pistol whipped Daamseh and shot him at close
range.
   Israelis have killed 605 Palestinians since the uprising began
in December 1987. Fellow Arabs have slain an additional 136
Palestinians, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty
Israelis also have died.

   The White House and the Senate Intelligence
Committee agree on liberalized conditions for future U.S.
involvement in coup attempts aimed at ousting Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega, the panel's chairman says.
   The Bush administration and the Senate panel reached ``a meeting
of the minds'' at meetings over the past two weeks, culminating in
a detailed session Thursday with representatives of the CIA, the
Pentagon and the State Department, said Senate committee Chairman
David Boren, D-Okla.
   Boren said his understanding is that U.S. officials will be free
to counsel and consult with potential coup plotters so long as the
plot does not specifically set out to assassinate Noriega.
   Also on Thursday, the intelligence panel approved a bill
authorizing intelligence activities for the next two years and
settling a long-running dispute over how the president reports
clandestine overseas operations to Congress.
   The committee dropped a proposal to force such disclosures
within an absolute 48-hour limit after Bush agreed to put in
writing his policies on informing Congress.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reporters
today on Air Force One en route to Costa Rica, said Bush will send
a letter to Congress as early as next week formalizing the
agreement to notify lawmakers ``within a few days'' of any covert
operation.
   Bush ``doesn't believe in having an artificial deadline'' to
carry out his foreign policy duties, Fitzwater said.
   The compromise followed nine months of negotiations and
essentially restored the understandings on reporting covert
operations that existed 10 years ago, before they were tattered by
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Boren said the committee held a thorough discussion Thursday
behind closed doors with officials of the CIA, State Department and
Pentagon on the Oct. 3 failed Panama coup and what can be done to
prepare for any similar situation in the future.
   Since the coup's failure, Congress and the White House have
traded accusatios over who was to blame for the lack of U.S.
preparation. Administration officials have contended Congress tied
their hands through too strict an interpretation of the
government's ban on participation in assassinations of foreign
leaders.
   ``We have removed any ambiguities'' that may have clouded the
meaning of the 1976 executive order that bans U.S. participation in
assassination plots, Boren said. Bush is referring the matter to
the Justice Department for a new interpretation of the order, said
Boren, adding, ``We start with a clean slate.''
   He added: ``No one feels that the executive order prohibiting
assassinations should be taken to the extreme position that you
have to warn someone (of a coup being plotted against them) or that
you can't participate in planning a coup where assassination is not
the objective.''
   On the subject of congressional notification of covert
operations, the panel also dropped a ban on the CIA's ability to
use its contingency fund to launch new covert operations which had
not been reported to Congress.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the intelligence panel's vice
chairman, had proposed the 48-hour provision after the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings, during which it became clear
President Reagan neglected for more than 10 months to tell the
Intelligence committees of the House and Senate that he was selling
weapons to Iran in hopes of winning the release of Americans held
hostage in the Middle East.
   Cohen said Bush has promised to give the committees prior notice
of covert actions ``on virtually all occasions.''
   In rare cases when prior notice is not given, the president will
let Congress know ``within a few days,'' Cohen said. And should the
president let notification slip beyond that time period, he will do
so only with an assertion of constitutional authority that would
supersede any law written by Congress.
   No president would make such an assertion lightly and risk the
kind of situation that confronted Reagan in the Iran-Contra
scandal, he said. ``It almost undid the Reagan presidency,'' he
said. ``And if it happens again, I'm sure it will undo a future
one.''
   ``This essentially puts us back to the understanding we had in
1980,'' before Reagan took office, Cohen said.
   He called the agreement the best that could be arranged.
Congress would likely have been able to force the strict 48-hour
limit into the bill, but would have been unable to override a
virtually certain presidential veto, Cohen said.
   The bill also writes into the law for the first time
requirements that all covert operations be authorized by a
presidential decision document known as a ``finding'' before they
are carried out, and that the document specify which agencies and
other countries, if any, are to be involved.
   And it would create for the first time an independent inspector
general at the CIA, to be appointed by the president and confirmed
by the Senate. Such an independent investigator would improve
internal CIA management and the ability of Congress to perform its
oversight job, the committee concluded.
   A House-passed version of the intelligence bill does not include
the independent inspector general provision, but instead specifies
that the oversight committees must be given complete access to
investigation and audit reports conducted under the current
arrangement.

   Radical students burning U.S. flags,
carrying a mock coffin of the South Korean president and hurling
firebombs battled riot police today in Seoul.
   One group of 300 students hurled rocks and firebombs at police
after a campus rally in front of Seoul National University. Police
fired tear gas and dispersed the protesters in 90 minutes.
   The other group, consisting of 700 students from a rival group,
held a campus rally at Korea University almost simultaneously to
launch what they called a stepped-up anti-government and anti-U.S.
campaign.
   No arrests or injuries were reported in the protests.
   The protest at Korea University turned violent as students tried
to march off campus. The students fought police near the school's
main gate, throwing rocks and firebombs. About 500 police hurled
tear gas back over the school gate, which was locked by school
authorities.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' the students
shouted.
   The students brought a mock coffin of President Roh Taw-woo and
two large U.S. flags to the gate and torched them. They cheered as
thick smoke rose into the sky.
   The students shouted slogans accusing the Roh government of
suppression and demanded the release of a radical student arrested
for making an illegal trip to communist North Korea in July.
   ``Release Im Su-kyong, flower of unification!'' they shouted,
raising clenched fists into the sky.
   Ms. Im was charged with violating the country's tough national
security law by making an unauthorized trip to the North to attend
a world youth festival there. She was arrested after returning home
in August.
   South Koreans are barred from visiting North Korea, an enemy
country, without government permission.
   South and North Korea have been bitter enemies since their
peninsula was divided in 1945. They fought the Korean War in
1950-53.
   Radicals say the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
hamper reunification of the peninsula. They are a small but vocal
minority on college campuses.

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Posts Weakest Advance in Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending in September posted its
weakest advance in a year, while Americans' personal income grew a
lackluster 0.3 percent, the government said today in a report
raising new concern about the health of the economy.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.2 percent
last month. It was the most sluggish figure since September 1988,
when it fell 0.1 percent, and followed more robust increases of 0.9
percent in August and 0.8 percent in July.
   The income growth of 0.3 percent followed an identical advance
in August and a 0.6 percent gain in July.
   The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits
provided fresh evidence that the economy is continuing to slow. As
measured by the gross national product, the economy grew at a
moderate 2.5 percent in the July-September quarter, but few
economists expect it to match that pace in the last three months of
the year, with a handful saying the nation could slip into a
recession.
   Other signs of weakness in the month include a decline of
103,000 manufacturing jobs and a slight drop in orders for big
ticket durable goods.
   However, the government noted that Hurricane Hugo, which struck
North and South Carolina in September reduced personal income, with
most of the decline coming in rental income. Without te storm,
incomes would have risen twice as much, 0.6 percent.
   Overall, personal income in September totaled $4.47 trillion at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate following a revised rate of $4.46
trillion a month earlier.
   Spending came in at an annual rate of $3.53 trillion following a
revised $3.52 trillion in August.
   The September report showed Americans' income after taxes rose
only 0.2 percent, down from the 0.3 percent gain in August.
   With income growing at the same rate as after-tax income,
Americans' savings rate held steady at 4.9 percent, the same as in
August but significantly less than the 5.6 percent rate in July.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
increased $14.4 billion, compared with a rise of $5.7 billion in
August. Hurricane Hugo reduced wages and salaries by about $2
billion.
   The storm reduced rental income by $9 billion because uninsured
losses are deducted as an expense when figuring rental income.
   On the spending side, the $8.7 billion increase in personal
consumption spending, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, compared with a $33 billion increase in August.
Purchases of durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, dropped $6.1 billion, while non-durable goods purchases
increased $3.6 billion. Spending on services rose $11.3 billion.

<HEAD>Hocke Says Resignation Was His Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. official who resigned amid allegations of
financial impropriety denied any wrongdoing today and said he
stepped down because repeated attacks had made his job increasingly
difficult.
   ``It is quite clear that the function of the high commissioner
requires a total commitment and availability to act, to convince
and to galvanize,'' said Jean-Pierre Hocke, who resigned Thursday
as U.N. high commissioner for refugees.
   Such commitment had been ``reduced by repeated and irresponsible
attacks,'' he said. ``These were the considerations that led to my
resignation which should not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle
of the storm.''
   Hocke's resignation was announced in New York after U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered a broadened
inquiry into allegations that Hocke misused agency funds to
subsidize first-class air travel.
   Calling a news conference only hours after his return from New
York, Hocke read a handwritten statement saying his resignation
does ``not reflect any sentiment of culpability on my part
concerning any of my doings.''
   He said the agency would face a ``formidable challenge in the
next few months when refugee protection and assistance will be more
difficult than ever.''
   Such tasks, he said, could be tackled only with an open mind
which he said he may no longer have because of the ``destructive
intentions of some people here and elsewhere.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Switching between French and English in answering questions, he
said he did ``not feel to have been pressured.''
   The high commissioner is responsible for at least 12 million
refugees worldwide, although there are many more than that. A
separate U.N. agency helps Palestinian refugees.
   Hocke's latest problems began in September, when Swiss
Television reported that internal documents showed he had drawn
$300,000 since 1987 from a special ``educational fund'' set up by
Sweden and Denmark to fly first class instead of business class.
   Hocke admitted he had flown first class, a right reserved only
for Perez de Cuellar under stringent U.N. austerity measures, but
denied any impropriety.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded on a street in Medellin
as a bus carrying policemen passed by, killing five officers and
wounding 16, police said.
   Three more bombs exploded Thursday night and early today in the
capital of Bogota, wounding one person, and another bomb in Bogota
was deactivated Thursday night at a bank, police said.
   Also Thursday, two policemen assigned as guards to the
Ecuadorian consulate in Medellin were shot and killed as they tried
to help another policeman make an arrest, police in the city said.
They blamed street thugs and said the killers escaped.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bus attack late Thursday,
but police blamed drug barons angered by the government's refusal
to negotiate its policy of extraditing traffickers to the United
States.
   ``The traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the
desire to carry out an attack of this size,'' said a police
spokesman in Medellin, the center of Colombia's drug trade.
   In the two months since the government declared a war on
traffickers and the drug lords responded with violent attacks, 169
bombings attributed to the traffickers have killed 21 people and
injured 219.
   The latest attacks came a day after the country suffered its
worst rebel violence in two years, with guerrillas storming two
northeastern towns and slaying at least six people, according to
army reports.
   The bomb in Medellin, packing over 60 pounds of dynamite, was
placed on a curb and detonated as the bus passed. National RCN
radio said 44 officers were on the bus at the time.
   The driver and four others died in the explosion, which severely
damaged the bus and sent it reeling out of control, the police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Many of the 16 injured
were in critical condition, he said.
   The bus finally stopped when it smashed into a parked taxi, the
spokesman said. The right side of the bus was riddled with shrapnel
from the bomb, a Medellin police spokeswoman said.
   The bomb was connected with electrical cable to a plunger two
blocks away, the spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The vehicle was carrying police officers to their posts for
night duty. The attack stirred panic in Medellin's residential
neighborhood of Bello Horizonte.
   ``The terrorists fired automatic rifles as they fled, and people
panicked because they thought the neighborhood was under attack,''
a police spokesman said.
   In Bogota, police said three terrorists threw a bomb packing 10
pounds of dynamite at a telephone office from a passing car. One
person was injured in the blast, which broke the windows of houses
a block away.
   Hours later, unidentifed assailants in a taxi placed a 40-pound
bomb outside a bank in southern Bogota. The blast damaged the bank,
but caused no injuries.
   And shortly after midnight this morning a third bomb exploded at
another Bogota bank, a communique from the national police said.
   The attacks appeared to be in retaliation for the government's
extradition policy. The Supreme Court this week reaffirmed an
earlier ruling that extradition was constitutional, and President
Virgilio Barco pledged to continue.
   Barco has said the government will not negotiate with
traffickers, who until the crackdown received relative impunity by
intimidating or paying off judges.
   The government has extradited four drug suspects since it began
a crackdown against the traffickers Aug. 19, a day after drug lords
assassinated leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan. Nine
alleged traffickers are awaiting extradition.
   Colombia's so-called Medellin and Cali drug cartels are thought
responsible for supplying 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States.
   The army blamed Wednesday's rebel violence on the National
Liberation Army, a shadowy pro-Cuban organization.
   The attacks were the bloodiest since 1987, when more than 50
people were killed during one month of fighting.

   A leading member of the Soviet parliament said
today new legislation is being drafted to limit the power of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to send the Red Army into conflicts
in other countries.
   Referring to the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, the new chairman
of the Supreme Soviet`s Council of Union, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said
``there can be no decision of that sort without the involvement''
of the legislative body.
   He said the invasion was executed by a small group of officials
without the participation of the Supreme Soviet. ``There can be no
repetition,'' Primakov said in answering questions after a speech
at the Brookings Institution, a private research facility.
   The chairman of the Council of Union, the legislative upper and
dominant house, is visiting Washington as head of a Soviet
delegation at the invitation of Sens. George Mitchell of Maine and
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the
Senate.
   ``All international activity will have to go through the Supreme
Soviet,'' Primakov said in his speech.
   He likened the legislation in prepartion to the U.S. War Powers
Act, which restricts American presidents in sending troops abroad _
while providing considerable leeway in the event of self-declared
emergencies.
   Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze acknowledged in a Moscow speech that the invasion was
a mistake. The last of some 100,000 Soviet troops, who fought
alongside the Afghan army of Marxist President Najibullah against
U.S.-armed rebels, left the country last February.
   Soviet weapons are still being provided to the Kabul government
while the United States has continued to back the rebels in a
regional dispute with Moscow that runs counter to a general
improvement in superpower relations.
   On another foreign policy issue, Primakov said East Germans,
like people everywhere, have the ``right of free choice'' in
shaping their government.
   However, he was skeptical of recent U.S. statements of support
for reunification with West Germany as unlikely to contribute to
``international stability.''
   The Soviet delegation met for 40 minutes Thursday with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and other State Department officials.
The parliament is the first chosen in competitive elections in 70
years under new rules engineered by Gorbachev.
   Baker underscored U.S. interest in the ``institutionalization of
respect for human rights'' through enactment of new laws by the
Supreme Soviet, the State Department said in a statement after the
meeting.
   He stressed particular interest in a new Soviet emigration law
that could lead to a waiver of export restrictions under the
Jackson-Vanick amendment, the statement said.
   Mitchell also said the delegation had asked him about ``the
possibility of granting a temporary waiver'' of restrictions on
Soviet exports to the United States. The Soviet Union is barred
from receiving most-favored-nation trading status, and the lower
tariffs that come with it, because of its past restrictive
emigration policies.
   Primakov said the emigration law is being considered by the
Supreme Soviet, but that enactment could be delayed by ``other
pressing business.''
   Baker reaffirmed U.S. support for reconstruction of the Soviet
economy, ``and our readiness to provide technical advice'' as
Soviets try to introduce a more market-oriented economy as part of
its perestroika reforms.
   Primakov told Baker that the Soviets welcomed U.S. support and
were ``seeking to borrow from our experience'' in such areas as
taxation, inflation and antitrust.
   Separate meetings held on economic reform, the political
situation in Moscow and environmental and scientific issues.
   When the delegation appeared on the Senate floor, Mitchell spoke
of the common legislative problems that face both the Soviet
lawmakers and their U.S. counterparts.
   The visiting lawmakers arrived in the midst of Congress' annual
tussle over money bills, featuring hot debates on abortion, taxes,
the death penalty and aid to Poland and Hungary, two East-bloc
countries that are emerging from under Soviet domination.
   ``You will witness ... strong differences of opinion and
vigorous debate between our parties and among our members,'' Dole
said in a welcoming statement. ``It is glasnost, American style.''
   After two days of meetings in Washington, the group was to go to
Maine on Saturday where it was to visit Bangor, Portland, and the
L.L. Bean clothing store in Freeport.
   On Sunday, the delegation was to see tourist attractions in
Dodge City, Kan., and attend a town meeting. Next week will include
a tour of the world's largest grain elevator at Hutchinson, Kan., a
trip to a cattle and wheat farm in Haven, Kan., and visits to Los
Angeles, Pittsburgh and New York.

   Christer Pettersson, recently freed
from prison after an appeals court overturned his conviction in the
slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme, was caught buying drugs and
briefly detained, police said today.
   A duty officer in downtown Stockholm said Pettersson, 42, was
arrested by two policemen Wednesday night while purchasing a small
amount of hashish in a park.
   ``He was taken to the police station for interrogation and was
subsequently released,'' the officer, who refused to give his name,
told The Associated Press.
   The officer added that Pettersson faces charges and would
probably be fined for the possession of drugs.
   Pettersson was arrested in December 1988 and charged in the Feb.
28, 1986, killing of Palme. He was convicted in July, but the Svea
Appeals Court two weeks ago ruled there was insufficient evidence
to uphold the conviction and Pettersson was released.
   Pettersson has a history of drug abuse and criminal convictions,
ranging from manslaughter to minor offenses such as disorderly
conduct.

<TEXT>
   A group of 141 East German
refugees who had been holed up in Bonn's embassy in Prague arrived
in West Germany today, officials said.
   The refugees were taken in two double-decker buses to the West
German border accompanied by West Germany's ambassador, Herman
Huber. An additional 38 East Germans remained in the embassy and
were expected to leave for the West soon, embassy officials said.
   On Thursday, the East German Embassy issued papers to the
refugees allowing them to travel to a third country and formally
revoked their East German citizenship, the East German state news
agency ADN reported. They were given 24 hours to leave the country
and the exodus began at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday.
   Stripping them of their citizenship in Prague allowed the
refugees to travel straight to West Germany, without having to pass
through their communist homeland.
   On two previous occasions, several thousand East Germans in West
Germany's Prague embassy were allowed to leave but were taken by
train through East German territory so that they could be formally
expelled. However, this led to near riots by East Germans at home
wanting to join the exodus.
   About 15,000 East Germans have been allowed to leave after
seeking asylum in the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw,
Poland.
   West German government sources said about 1,800 East Germans
remained in Warsaw and were awaiting similar arrangements to leave
for West Germany.
   An estimated 60,000 East Germans fleeing political repression in
their homeland have arrived in West Germany in the past six weeks
via Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, which opened its borders to
East Germans on Sept. 10.

<TEXT>
   The death rate from colon and rectal cancer is
highest along an arc from Maine to Iowa, say government researchers
who are puzzled by the finding.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday the
highest mortality rates from colorectal cancer in 1986 occurred in
the Northeast and the eastern north-central states _ in virtually
every state from Maine, with a death rate of 25.8 per 100,000
people; south to Maryland, with 27.2; and across to Iowa, with 24.8.
   Nationwide, the death rate from colorectal cancer in 1986 was
23.1 per 100,000 people.
   The District of Columbia had the nation's highest mortality
rate, 32.1. Wyoming had the lowest rate at 16.2, the Atlanta-based
CDC reported.
   In the Northeast, only Connecticut, at 24.5, Delaware, at 23.8,
and Vermont, at 22.4, had colorectal cancer death rates below 25
per 100,000. Other high rates were recorded in New Hampshire, 26.1;
Massachusetts, 26.3; New York, 27.3; New Jersey, 27.1; Rhode
Island, 28.7; Pennsylvania, 26.6; Ohio, 26.4; Indiana, 25.9; and
Illinois, 25.6. No other state exceeded 24.
   ``We don't know enough about the risk factors or their
distribution to say why that region is one with the highest
rates,'' said Dr. Robert A. Hahn, a CDC cancer specialist. ``We
doubt it's just a matter of physical environment, but we just don't
know.''
   Although few risk factors for colorectal cancer have been firmly
established, the CDC said, evidence points to high-fat diets as
risky and suggests that eating fruits and vegetables may help
protect against the disease.
   Obesity and a high-calorie diet also may increase the risk, and
exercise may lower it, the CDC said.
   An estimated 145,000 colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in
the United States each year, Hahn said.
   In 1986, 55,811 Americans died of the disease, accounting for 12
percent of all cancer deaths.
   Hahn said incidence of the disease has risen somewhat in recent
years, from a rate of 49.3 cases per 100,000 Americans in 1979 to
50.5 in 1986. But mortality has dropped, from 24.8 deaths per
100,000 in 1979 to 23.1 in 1986.
   ``Detection of disease at an earlier stage might account for
some of the increase in survival,'' the CDC said.
   Stool blood screening, a relatively cheap technique, is useful
for detecting the disease in its early stages, the CDC said.
   The case rate in 1986 was 61 per 100,000 for men, compared with
43 per 100,000 for women.
   The median age at which the disease is diagnosed, from 1982 to
1986, was 71 years for cancer of the colon and 69 for rectal cancer.
   Just three in 100,000 30- to 34-year-olds developed colorectal
cancer, compared to 532 in 100,000 in the 85-and-older category.

<HEAD>Navy Stands By Conclusion on Iowa Explosion</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 10 grafs new to update with FBI and Pentagon comments. Picks

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI scientists were unable to find conclusive
evidence that the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the USS
Iowa was deliberate, a bureau spokesman said today. But the Navy
stood by its conclusion that the explosion was ignited by a bomb.
   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' said FBI
spokesman Mike Kortan.
   ``That's not to say something wasn't there,'' he added. ``Our
findings were inconclusive.''
   Cmdr. Mark Baker, a Navy spokesman, said the service ``is
convinced that foreign material'' was found in a band of the gun's
projectile.
   ``We are confident about the sophistication of our equipment and
the expertise of our technical personnel'' who conducted the
thousands of tests for the study, Baker said.
   Earlier this month the Navy said the explosion was ``most
probably'' caused by a checmically ignited explosive device that
detonated powder bags in the breech of one of the battleship's
16-inch guns.
   But on Thursday Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of
the House Armed Services Investigative subcommittee, said, ``I
seriously question the conclusion that it was a wrongful,
intentional act.''
   The Navy said Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig was most likely
responsible for the April explosion. The Navy said Hartwig was a
loner who was upset about the breakup of a friendship with another
sailor.
   A ``foreign material'' was found in a ring inside the barrel of
the gun, according to the Navy investigation.
   Mavroules wrote in a letter to Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
that the FBI's investigation did not turn up the same evidence.
   ``The FBI's lab report has been described by some as
inconclusive,'' Mavroules wrote. ``I do not see it that way. It
clearly says that they did not find elements that the Navy
technicians said they found. Why is there this discrepancy?''
   Lt. Melody Bock, a Navy spokeswoman, also said the service
stands by its report.
   ``We can't comment on the FBI's equipment or technology,'' she
said. ``We trust our investigators. We trust that what they found
is correct.''
   Oakar, who represents Hartwig's hometown of Cleveland, has
called for a congressional investigation of the explosion, saying
the Navy relied on circumstantial evidence and an FBI psychological
profile that Hartwig ``took his own life and hoped it looked like
an accident.''
   In addition, other published reports, relying on unidentified
sources, said Hartwig was a homosexual distraught over another
sailor's rejection of his advances.
   Mavroules wrote that he doubts both the suicide and homosexual
angles.
   ``Probably as many people said he was not depressed and not
suicidal as said he had suicidal tendencies,'' Mavroules wrote.
   ``Only a handful of individuals of the hundreds interviewed
avowed any knowledge of Hartwig's homosexuality,'' he wrote. ``No
one had any firsthand knowledge.''

<HEAD>EDS: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf pvs, By early, to update with

   Federal drug officials say they have names and
addresses of thousands of people believed to be growing marijuana
indoors, and they are going after the growers and their illicit
crops.
   ``We are trying to send the message to all those people in the
United States who have been cultivating marijuana that they are
violating the law, they will be caught, they will be prosecuted
and, if found guilty, they will serve time,'' said Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Frank Shults.
   More than 100 people in 46 states, along with 65 stores in 22
states believed to sell equipment intended for use in indoor
marijuana cultivation, were targeted for raids Thursday by the DEA.
   By early today, officials had served 26 stores with search
warrants, of which eight were boarded up as a result, 73 indoor
grove operations containing 7,635 marijuana plants had been seized
and 129 people arrested, according to a federal enforcement
official close to the investigation.
   The biggest bust of an indoor growing operation took place in
Wichita, Kan., where 1,440 marijuana plants were seized, followed
by a raid of a store in San Diego where an owner with 600 growing
plants was arrested, according to the source.
   The source said not all the offices conducting raids had
reported their actions to DEA headquarters this morning, and he
expected the final numbers to be even higher.
   ``The difference between today's marijuana and 1960s marijuana
is like comparing near beer to 190 proof alcohol,'' the source said
in explaining why marijuana growers were being targeted. ``It's so
much more potent, you can't imagine.''
   Asked why the potency has increased so much, he said, ``Because
Americans are the best farmers in the world. They grow the best
marijuana in the world, hands down.''
   Doug McVay of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, said the raids on stores were ``a publicity stunt,
a largely ineffective one,'' and ``silly, really silly.''
   A DEA statement said the agency has obtained ``the names and
addresses of thousands of individuals who are suspected of being
involved in the indoor cultivation of marijuana.''
   In the previous month, the investigation code-named Operation
Green Merchant had resulted in the arrests of 112 people on charges
of cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing
17,000 plants, Shults said.
   U.S. marijuana growers _ who produce about 25 percent of the
supply _ increasingly have been moving their plants indoors because
of extensive aerial surveillance that enables officials to spot
drugs grown outside.
   The stores raided ``specialize in the sale of these otherwise
legitimate products with the knowledge that they will be used to
cultivate marijuana,'' Shults said.
   The DEA used undercover agents in every store targeted for raids
Thursday to determine whether the operators knew the equipment _
such as lighting, irrigation and ventilation apparatus _ was being
used for indoor marijuana cultivation, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The stores raided ``range from mom-and-pop to something
equivalent to a K-mart,'' the source said. ``Some of them have
fairly large warehouses. These are all stores targeting the
marijuana subculture in the United States as their customers'' and
do little advertising in mainstream publications.
   ``We have established through the advertising and other means
that these stores do sell the indoor cultivation apparatus and give
advice about its use for the cultivation of marijuana,'' Shults
said. ``They openly do it.''
   It was not immediately clear where the DEA got the names and
addresses of the thousands of people suspected of growing marijuana
indoors.
   Steve Hager, the editor of New York City-based High Times
magazine, stressed that law enforcement did not get the
publication's mailing list.
   However, he said, ``I believe that they subpoenaed the UPS
(United Parcel Service) shipping records of our advertisers and
have been using that information to build a conspiracy case of some
kind.''
   UPS spokesman Al Winnik said he knew nothing of such subpoenas.
``There's no word here of any subpoenas by DEA ... or any agency of
that type.''
   The DEA would not comment except to say there was an ``ongoing
investigation.''
   Shults said no publications such as High Times magazine were
targets of Thursday's raids.
   ``I can understand the DEA's frustration,'' McVay said. ``It's
true, some of this equipment is being used for (indoor marijuana)
cultivation. On the other hand, dirt is used for indoor
cultivation. I don't think we're going to stop people from selling
dirt.''
   Legitimate manufacturers such as General Electric and Sylvania
sell lights used for growing plants indoors, and Rubbermaid sells a
kit of indoor gardening equipment, McVay said.
   ``These stores and this technology was around way before people
thought about growing pot indoors,'' he said.
   The stores targeted for raids Thursday were located in Alaska,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
   Raids on indoor cultivation sites were planned for all states
except Hawaii, Nebraska, North Dakota and West Virginia, according
to the Justice Department.

   Dean Alfange, who was instrumental in forming
the Liberal Party, a once potent force in New York's city and state
politics, has died of cancer. He was 91.
   Alfange, a lawyer who also ran for governor of New York on the
American Labor Party ticket in 1942, died Tuesday at his home in
Manhattan.
   Alfange also ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for a
congressional seat in 1941. He placed third in the 1942
gubernatorial race.
   After leading the American Labor Party for several years, he
broke ranks with it over pro- and anti-communist factions, and
helped form the Liberal Party in 1944.
   Born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Greek parents, Alfange was brought
to the United States as an infant and was raised in upstate New
York.
   He was active in ethnic organizations and was a past president
of Ahepa, a Greek-American civic group.
   Alfange is survived by his wife, Thalia, and a son, Dean Jr., of
Leverett, Mass.

   A Soviet film curator was denied a visa to

   Yuri Khodjaev, who oversees film festivals in Moscow, Leningrad,
Tashkent and other Soviet cities, was not granted a visa to come to

director of the First Cleveland Film Conference.
   ``Denying a visa to Yuri Khodjaev, who has traveled to the

   Francis Jones, spokeswoman in consular affairs in the State
Department, told The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer that the government
would comment on the matter today.
   ``It is a stupid thing to deny free access to Khodjaev or anyone
else, because it is a matter of humanity,'' said Vitaly Korotich,

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp.'s headquarters shift to a Dallas
suburb should inspire city officials to work even harder to hold on
to other large companies fleeing to lower-cost markets, an analyst
says.
   The move announced Thursday involves only 300 jobs, but should
not be ignored by New York, said Dennis Donovan, a business
relocation consultant.
   ``I would say that certainly any city that loses a corporate
headquarters ought to be worried about it, particularly when
they're moving from high-cost locations to low-cost locations,'' he
said.
   The city has responded to past corporate flights with
incentives, including a $100 million package offered NBC when it
considered moving to New Jersey about two years ago.
   Other companies that decided to stay after getting breaks
include Chase Manhattan, Drexel Burnham Lambert, American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph, Shearson Lehman Hutton and Citicorp.
   ``But there are other corporations that will consider leaving
and New York ought to do everything it can to hold on to them,''
Donovan said.
   The Exxon announcement follows word from J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
and Mobil Corp. that they were moving headquarters out of New York
City.
   Stanley Grayson, deputy mayor for finance and economic
development, points to 4,500 new companies that have come to the
city in the past 10 years.
   ``Although Exxon is certainly a major company in New York, in
the country and the world, the practical matter is they employed
300 people here,'' he said.
   The move comes near the end of one of the most tumultuous years
in Exxon history, marked by the March 24 oil spill by a company
tanker in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Exxon, the world's largest
oil company, has been criticized harshly for what some saw as its
inadequate response to the disaster.
   Exxon's decision to go to Las Colinas, a real estate development
in the Dallas suburb of Irving, had Texas boosters ``tickled
pink,'' as Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Commerce, put it.
   Exxon's corporate headquarters once had up to 4,000 people, but
the number remaining in New York had been steadily reduced since
Exxon moved its international business operations to Florham Park,
N.J.
   The company's domestic operations are based in Houston.
   The Texas economy has been battered since the mid-1980s, when
the price of oil dropped to almost $10 a barrel and scuttled a real
estate boom fueled by expectations of $50-a-barrel oil.
   ``This confirms what we've been trying to say to the rest of the
world for some time: that Texas is on the rise again,'' Murphy said.

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce today
declared ``I committed no illegal or wrongful acts'' while in
office, but he again refused to answer questions from Congress
about scandals in federal housing programs during his tenure.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said his subcommittee's HUD
investigation would end after several scheduled hearings and he
would not offer immunity to two former Pierce aides who refused to
testify.
   The subcommittee hearings have ``demonstrated a colossal
scandal'' at HUD, Lantos declared, and two panel members said they
are seeking a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce.
   The former housing secretary said he was invoking his Fifth
Amendment protections against self-incrimination because he
believed he had unfairly been made a target of the subcommittee
investigation of influence-peddling, fraud and mismanagement at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``I believe I committed no illegal or wrongful acts,'' Pierce
said in a statement he read to the subcommittee before refusing to
answer substantive questions. ``I look forward to the time when
innuendo and rumors to the contrary are put to rest.''
   The panel has heard scores of developers and consultants detail
political favoritism and mismanagement at HUD during Pierce's
tenure but has heard little from former top agency officials of
that period.
   Pierce, who headed HUD during the entire eight years of the
Reagan administration, said he hoped he would soon be able to
defend himself against allegations he mismanaged agency programs
and was involved in political favoritism.
   ``I look forward to the day when I can tell my story, and I
assure you I have a story to tell,'' Pierce said. But he refused to
do so today, contending several members of the subcommittee had
already judged him guilty of ``lies and dishonesty.''
   ``I am constrained to conclude that an atmosphere has been
created in which I have become a target'' of the panel's
investigation, he said. ``I have been unfairly accused.''
   Reps. Charles Schumer of New York and Bruce Morrison of
Connecticut, both Democrats, said they were asking the House
Judiciary Committee to formally request the Justice Department to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce.
   ``Now it's clear Sam Pierce is stonewalling,'' Schumer said.
``If we're going to get to the bottom of this, Justice will have to
appoint a special prosecutor.''
   Pierce appeared before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing voluntarily in May, but his
appearances today and last month, when he first refused to answer
questions, were forced by subpoenas issued by the panel.
   He also has been subpoenaed to appear again a week from today,
but Lantos said he would cancel that hearing because of Pierce's
continued refusal to answer questions.
   Pierce rejected an offer from Lantos to cancel the hearings
today and next week and vacate the subpoenas in exchange for a
pledge that the former Cabinet member would testify voluntarily
before Thanksgiving.
   Pierce said he was snubbing the offer at the advice of his
attorneys.
   At the beginning of today's hearing, Lantos disclosed that
Pierce had asked the government to pay his legal fees, but that HUD
has rejected the request.
   ``The scandals at HUD during the Pierce years have already cost
the American people billions of dollars,'' Lantos said. He praised
new HUD Secretary Jack Kemp for ``rejecting the request that Mr.
Pierce's legal fees at a congressional hearing be paid for by the
American taxpayer.''
   Lantos also said he believed the subcommittee had legal grounds
to force Pierce to testify, because by answering questions in May,
Pierce waived his right to refuse later to testify about related
subjects.
   However, Lantos said the subcommittee would not challenge
Pierce's refusal to answer questions, a battle that would
inevitably end up in court.
   Pierce's continued refusal to answer questions leaves the
six-month House investigation at a crossroads. Three former
deputies to Pierce also have refused to testify, leaving the
subcommittee with scores of accounts from those who did business
with HUD but scant details from those in power.
   Lantos has mulled giving immunity to two of the former Pierce
assistants, including former top aide Deborah Gore Dean, but most
other panel members oppose any immunity grants.
   After Pierce said today that he would not answer questions about
his conduct at HUD, Lantos and the handful of congressmen present
tried anyway. The chairman asked several questions and the other
lawmakers one each.
   Each time Pierce said that on the advice of counsel he was
invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment.
   Pierce had tried Thursday to get the committee to cancel today's
hearing but was told he would have to appear and assert his rights
in person.
   In a letter to the subcommittee, Pierce's attorneys said the
circumstances surrounding the hearings had not changed from last
month, when he first refused to answer questions.
   ``Mr. Pierce is concerned that there continues to be an
atmosphere wherein he remains a target of the subcommittee's
hearings,'' the attorneys said. ``It is our hope that sometime in
the near future the present level of tension may be reduced such
that Mr. Pierce ca reconsider his present position and testify
under fair and mutually agreeable circumstances.''

   The White House said today the U.S. Embassy in
El Salvador is looking into charges by a Salvadoran soldier that he
was part of a death squad responsible for as many as 72 murders
ordered by top military leaders and condoned by American advisers.
   Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, who was meeting today with members
of Congress, says he took part in eight of the killings under
orders to bring leftist guerrillas ``to justice.''
   ``My work was only to execute these people,'' said Joya
Martinez, 28, who fled El Salvador in July seeking asylum.
   The Pentagon, responding to Joya Martinez' allegations Thursday,
called claims of U.S. complicity in death squad activity ``patently
absurd.''
   ``We know of no instances in which U.S. military personne have
been even remotely associated with such morally repugnant
activities,'' the statement said.
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said: ``We have no comment on it.
As a matter of policy we don't comment on intelligence matters.''
   Joya Martinez said that from April into July, he was a member of
a seven-man special forces group of the 1st Infantry Brigade called
GC-2 in the capital of San Salvador. He said two U.S. advisers,
known to the Salvadoran troops only as ``the Major'' and
``William,'' purchased supplies for the group and ``had to know
what was going on.''
   Joya Martinez outlined his allegations for U.S. reporters
Thursday in interviews at a Washington hotel and planned a series
of private visits with members of Congress today.
   The Salvadoran military denies the defector's death squad
claims. But Jeff Brown, an information at the U.S. Embassy in El
Salvador, said Ambassador William Walker ``considers the charges
very serious'' and ``if they are truthful, they must be
investigated.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
accusations today while flying with Bush to Costa Rica, said,
``We're concerned about it. Ambassador Walker is looking into it.''
He does not expect it would come up in the president's talks with
other hemispheric leaders in Costa Rica.
   Joya Martinez, speaking in Spanish, said his orders came in
one-page reports issued by the Salvadoran Joint Chiefs of Staff. He
said the reports went to the commanders of the brigade, Cols. Juan
Orlando Zepeda and Franciso Elena Fuentes.
   He said he took part in eight killings but the reports he saw
indicated 72 people were killed from April to July.
   ``The report did not say kill them, it said `bring them to
justice,' which in simple terms means to kill them,'' Joya Martinez
said. `` My job was to kill or be killed.''
   He said the two American advisers were not in military uniform.
They were assigned to the unit to analyze intelligence data and pay
for supplies ranging from weapons to gasoline, he said.
   ``They had control of the department,'' Joya Martinez said. He
said he did not know exactly what knowledge the Americans had, but
said, ``Obviously they had to know what was going on.''
   There are 55 U.S. military advisers and an unknown number of CIA
agents in El Salvador.
   Joya Martinez said he made the allegations public in an attempt
to stop the killings. Col. Elena Fuentes said in El Salvador two
weeks ago that Joya Martinez is a defector wanted for the murder of
two civilians.
   The former soldier is seeking asylum in the United States. The
U.S. Immigration Service has accused him of ``entry without
inspection'' and he could be deported, said his attorney, William
Van Wyke.
   Van Wyke said the asylum request is based on ``fear of
persecution'' if Joya Martinez were forced to return to El Salvador.
   Joya Martinez said he never knew the identities of his victims
and that a lieutenant in the unit ``made sure the faces were
covered.''
   ``Sometimes they were almost dead from being beaten during
interrogation,'' he said.
   The soldiers usually slit the throats of the victims and hurled
the bodies over a cliff into the Pacific Ocean, he said.
   ``They (the officers) always said we had to do this to end the
war, because they were terrorists,'' Joya Martinez said.
   Asked how he felt about his part in the killings, he said: ``I
feel stupid, that's the word. I realize I was manipulated. I knew
it was me or them.''
   Joya Martinez said he left the country after colleagues in his
own unit were given orders to kill him because of a botched
military sweep to pick up suspected guerillas.
   Human rights and church groups have claimed for years that death
squads run by El Salvador's extreme right-wing political faction
have killed tens of thousands of civilians since 1979, the start of
an ongoing war between Marxist-led guerrillas and the U.S.-backed
troops.
   The United States puts about $1.5 million a day in economic and
military aid into El Salvador.
   Elena Fuentes said two weeks ago: ``There's no such thing as a
death squad. We don't harbor any kind of dark organization.''

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court says a gambler can
sue Trump Castle Hotel and Casino because he hurt his hand while
tossing dice onto a craps table.
   In a ruling Thursday, the Appellate Division of Superior Court
reversed a lower court decision to dismiss plaintiff Vincent
Vecere's negligence lawsuit against Trump Castle.
   Vecere, a resident of Camden County in western New Jersey, said
he injured his hand when he struck a post on a craps table at Trump
Castle.
   ``I made a bet. I picked up the dice and it came out with a
number which I don't remember,'' Vecere testified in an earlier
court appearance. ``When they gave me two dice back, I picked the
dice up, and I wanted to hit that back wall, and I swung to hit the
wall backward and I hit something. It was right here by the table
... I noticed there was a post there and I hurt my hand on the
post.''
   Vecere testified that he didn't see the post before he struck
his hand.
   Saying he thought he could shrug it off, Vecere continued to
play until his hand began to swell about three hours later.

   A magistrate today banned a
protest march by black trade unions, but activists proceeded with
plans for a mass rally featuring recently freed leaders of the
outlawed African National Congress.
   No reason was given for rejecting the application by the
Congress of South African Trade Unions to hold a march Saturday in
Vereeniging, an industrial city south of Johannesburg. The labor
federation, which had sought to protest legislation restricting
unions' ability to strike, threatened to defy the ban.
   Since mid-September, the government has allowed numerous protest
marches nationwide, organized by trade unions and other
anti-apartheid groups. The government has approved Sunday's rally
at a soccer stadium near Johannesburg welcoming the freed African
National Congress leaders.
   Seven of the eight men to be honored were freed unconditionally
on Oct. 15 and the other was released in November 1987. Six were
sentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with
Nelson Mandela, the congress' best-known leader, who remains jailed.
   White extremists have threatened to disrupt the rally with
violence, said Gen. Herman Stadler of the police public relations
division. Stadler said the threats were made in telephone calls
from two men to the Afrikaans-language Free Weekly.
   Organizers hope to draw at least 80,000 people to the rally,
which would make it the largest anti-government gathering ever in
South Africa. Buses and black-owned mini-bus taxis will bring
people from distant communities.
   Dozens of foreign diplomats have been invited to attend, said
Murphy Morobe, one of the organizers. On Thursday, diplomats from
18 countries, including the United States and most of Western
Europe, visited Walter Sisulu, the highest ranking the freed
African National Congress leaders.
   Under South Africa's Internal Security Act, it is crime to
promote the objectives of the African National Congress, which has
waged an anti-government bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961.
   Police will ``closely monitor'' the rally but will allow it to
proceed, said a police spokesman, Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler.
   Several Johannesburg newspapers today ran advertisments for the
rally that made no mention of the African National Congress. But
New Nation, a militant anti-apartheid weekly, carried a full-page
display of the program for the rally, under the heading ``ANC
Lives, ANC Leads, ANC Speaks.''
   In an editorial, New Nation said the rally marks the start of a
new phase ``in which we seek to reveal the ANC's centrality in the
solution of South Africa's problems.''

<HEAD>Dinkins Lead Smaller in New Polls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayoral nominee David Dinkins holds a
slimmed-down lead over Rudolph W. Giuliani in three new opinion
polls, indicating the damage inflicted in a difficult week for the
Democratic frontrunner.
   Dinkins maintained a double-digit lead in two of the surveys,
although the third put the race tighter, with a 5-point Dinkins
edge. The closer poll pushed undecided voters to make a choice and
did not reject unlikely voters.
   Dinkins also held double-digit leads in two polls conducted
earlier and released this week. Additionally, a one-day Daily
News-WABC-TV poll Sunday put the race at its closest: Dinkins ahead
by 45-41 percent.
   One-day polls are sensitive to recent events, such as Dinkins'
struggle last week to answer questions about his personal and
campaign finances. Other differences in method can account for
differences in poll results.
   Dinkins was ahead 49-35 percent in one of the new polls,
conducted among 658 likely voters Monday and Tuesday by the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion. A poll Saturday and Sunday for the
Teamsters union, which backs Dinkins, gave him a 49-34 percent lead
among 600 likely voters.
   A New York Post-WNBC poll conducted Sunday through Tuesday put
the race at 47-42 percent. It had fewer undecided voters,
indicating that those who were uncertain tended to pick Giuliani
when pressed for a choice.
   That poll questioned 600 registered voters, while the Marist and
Teamster polls were conducted among the subset of voters who
appeared most likely to turn out.
   ``You're dealing with a somewhat closer, more competitive race,
but one that still finds Dinkins with a good lead with less than
two weeks to go,'' said Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute
in Poughkeepsie.
   ``He came through what clearly was a low point last week and
seems to have been able to absorb the fallout,'' Miringoff said.
``Dinkins maintains at worst case an edge and at best case a fairly
sizable lead.''
   Dinkins, who would be the city's first black mayor, commanded 95
percent support from blacks, who made up nearly a quarter of the
respondents in the Marist survey. Whites overall favored Giuliani,
51-26 percent, but 21 percent were undecided.
   In the Post-WNBC poll, Dinkins had the support of 91 percent of
black voters, a lower figure than in the Marist poll, and 60
percent of the whites, a considerably higher figure than in the
Marist poll.

<HEAD>A Long Weekend: It's Back to Standard Time Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks who have been a bit tired all summer
will finally get back that lost hour of sleep this weekend, with
the return of standard time.
   The time change occurs officially at 2 a.m. local time Sunday,
the moment when clocks should be set back an hour.
   That switch provides the extra hour for sleep, carousing, toil
or whatever, that was lost last spring when the clocks were moved
ahead.
   The International Association of Fire Chiefs is trying to get
Americans to use a bit of the extra time for the potentially
life-saving act of replacing batteries in smoke detectors in their
homes.
   The change to standard time moves an hour of daylight from the
evening to the morning.
   That means it will get dark earlier at night, but there will be
more light in the mornings.
   The earlier darkness is also a safety consideration for parents
whose children will be going out on Halloween night, and for anyone
driving in the dim light.
   The change affects most Americans, although a few areas do not
change to daylight time in the spring and, thus, don't have to go
back in the fall. These include include Arizona, Hawaii, parts of
Indiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.
   The date of the change is set by Congress, and while it's become
a tradition for most of the nation, the notion of standard time is
only just over a century old.
   Before that, every local city and town had its own time, setting
the town clock according to the sun and expecting residents to
coordinate their watches and clocks with that standard.
   The result was thousands of different times across the nation, a
situation that bothered few people until railroad transportation
became common and the timetables became impossible to coordinate
because of the different clocks.
   The result was that the railroads appealed to Congress, standard
time and the time zones were set up, and the confusion was limited
to twice a year when the switch is made between standard and
daylight time.
   And that didn't begun until World Watr I, in an effort to save
energy by moving some light to the evening and thus saving on
lighting in homes and factories.

   After 13 years of predawn ``Today'' wakeups,
co-host Jane Pauley confirmed to a national audience this morning
that she's leaving the NBC show at year's end. She hugged her
successor, Deborah Norville, and gave her an alarm clock.
   Pauley's farewell announcement, in which she said she'll most
miss working with co-host Bryant Gumbel, was preceded by his
comments in which he criticized ``idle and often erroneous
speculation'' about the troubled, top-rated show.
   Gumbel said the speculation had been ``much to the detriment of
all of us here.''
   Pauley had been reported to be unhappy at recent changes on the
show, including the Sept. 5 arrival of Norville as its news anchor,
succeeding John Palmer.
   Referring to Pauley as ``my buddy'' and that ``it goes without
saying that I'm going to miss her,'' Gumbel said that she's leaving
the show ``sometime at the end of this year or January of next
year.''
   Pauley, who turns 39 on Tuesday, has two years remaining on an
NBC contract reportedly paying her $1.2 million annually. She is
going to co-anchor a prime-time news series next year, she said in
an interview after the show.
   In the interview, she confirmed what she had alluded to in the
show, that she had in fact had asked to leave it.
   She said there were a number of changes that had been made that
had worried her, and Norville's arrival and Palmer's departure to
the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise'' was only one of them. She said
she also thought that NBC executives wanted her to leave.
   She said she had had ``tough'' talks with NBC News President
Michael Gartner and NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, who wears a
second hat overseeing ``Today.''
   Initially, she said, ``we didn't believe each other. They did
not believe that I simply wanted to leave the `Today' show. And I
did not believe that they were committed to my future here at NBC.''
   But eventually, she said, each side reached an understanding and
a deal was worked out for her to leave ``Today'' at the end of the
year and co-anchor a new, as-yet untitled prime time news series
that will premiere next June. The other co-anchor hasn't been
chosen, she said.
   During the show, she said that persuading NBC that it was time
for a change of staff on ``Today'' was ``the hardest thing I have
ever done. It has taken two long months.''
   She took pains to play down reports she was at odds with either
Gumbel or Norville, saying ``it has hurt to see two of my friends,
Bryant and Deborah, assigned roles in this that they did not play.''
   Pauley joined ``Today'' in 1976 when she left NBC-owned WMAQ-TV
in Chicago to succeed Barbara Walters.
   Pauley noted that when she joined the show, her prececessor, the
first full-time female anchor on the 36-year-old program, sent her
a telegram wishing her good luck and a good alarm clock. Then
Pauley smiled, gave Norville an alarm clock, and the two hugged.
   Norville praised Pauley, saying ``You're a tough act to repeat
and I won't even try.''
   Before the show went to a commercial, she, Gumbel and Norville
held hands in a nationally televised show of solidarity.
   No decision has been made on who will succeed Norville, 31, as
anchor of the two-hour program's news segments. The former anchor
of the earlier ``NBC News at Sunrise,'' she swapped jobs last month
with Palmer.
   Although ``Today'' consistently has led in morning-show ratings
over its closest competitor, ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
turmoil on NBC's program began early this year with the leak of a
scathing memo from Gumbel.
   The memo, while not mentioning Pauley, criticized several staff
members on the show, particularly weatherman Willard Scott.
   Scott has eased off the pointed jokes he made to and about
Gumbel after the memo's disclosure, and he denied on Wednesday
speculation that he'll leave ``Today'' shortly after Pauley does.
He joined the show in 1980.
   Gumbel became a ``Today'' co-host in January 1982. Norville
joined NBC News and its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' five years later
from the network's Chicago station.
   This summer, she signed a five-year contract reportedly worth $1
million a year.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Quashed Pessimistic Speech on Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III quashed
a speech by a senior U.S. expert on the Soviet Union that contained
a pessimistic assessment of Mikhail Gorbachev's chances of success
in revamping the Soviet economy, the White House confirmed today.
   On a flight to Costa Rica, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater acknowledged there were various opinions within the Bush
administration about Gorbachev's prospects.
   Fitzwater confirmed a New York Times report that Robert M.
Gates, the deputy national security adviser, had been muzzled.
   While there were assessments ``all over the lot'' about the
future of Gorbachev's attempts to restructure the Soviet economy,
``the point is we want it to endure,'' the spokesman said.
   ``That's the president's policy,'' Fitzwater told reporters
aboard Air Force One as Bush headed to San Jose for a celebration
of Costa Rica's 100 years as a democracy.
   ``It's not really a question of policy,'' Fitzwater added.
``It's a question of analysis and interpretation of events that the
State Department felt was better left unsaid at this point.''
   The State Department ``just felt it's inappropriate to talk
about it at this time,'' he said.
   Baker frequently has said the United States wishes Gorbachev
well in his restructuring policy. But except for offering some
undefined technical advice, the secretary of state has stressed it
is up to the Soviets to determine their future.
   Gates, a former deputy director of the CIA, had been scheduled
to speak to the National Collegiate Security Conference in
Bethesda, Md., a student colloquium.
   Other members of the administration, including Vice President
Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger all, in one form or another, have
registered public skepticism about Gorbachev's prospects.
   Baker, whose top aides initially described Gorbachev as
essentially deft at public relations and adapting U.S. ideas on
arms control, has gradually warmed to the Soviet leader's uphill
campaign to change the Soviet system.
   Gates, in a speech last year, said Gorbachev had ``not really
changed'' the Soviet pattern. ``Russian and Soviet history caution
us to be skeptical and cautious,'' the then-CIA official said.
   The speech disturbed then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
who reportedly complained to Gates after it was delivered.

   It's strange how things happen sometimes. In
October 1974, two months after the Watergate scandal forced
President Richard Nixon to resign from office, the Oakland A's won
the World Series.
   Now, if the A's don't win it again Saturday and have to play a
fifth game Sunday night, ABC will have to postpone until Dec. 17
its scheduled Sunday TV movie _ one that dramatizes Nixon's last
weeks in office.
   Rgeardless of what happens and whenever ABC's three-hour ``The
Final Days'' airs, you'll find it a flawed but fascinating program
with an Emmy-caliber performance by Lane Smith as a tormented,
anguished Nixon.
   It is based on the 1976 book by Carl Bernstein and Robert
Woodward, who chronicled their Watergate exposures in ``All the
President's Men.'' The movie of that book starred Robert Redford
and Dustin Hoffman as the probing reporters.
   In ``Days'' _ Nixon's lawyers complained to ABC last March about
what they said were inaccuracies in the book _ no star reporters
dash about from source to source in dogged search of the story.
   Here, the drama basically is told through the eyes of Nixon's
Watergate-defense attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt, effectively played by
Richard Kiley as a quiet, honest man doggedly seeking the truth
despite what ``Days'' depicts as Nixon's obstructions and
distortions.
   Nixon resigned after once-secret tapes of White House
conversations revealed he knew of a cover-up of political sabotage
by his re-election team against his Democratic opponents in the
1972 presidential campaign.
   The tortured behind-the-scenes events leading up to that after
the famous 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee offices
at the Watergate Hotel are retold in ``Days,'' but in perhaps too
much detail.
   Bit by bit, it all returns _ the famed 18-minute gap discovered
by Buzhardt in a key tape; the spectre of John Dean; the ``Saturday
Night Massacre'' after Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned
rather than obey Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox; the ``smoking pistol'' tape that sealed Nixon's fate.
   All this at times makes you wish scriptwriter Hugh Whitemore had
cut to the chase more briskly, instead of painstakingly adding
layer upon layer upon layer in this Dostoyevskian video visit to
the big house on Pennsylvania Avenue.
   The script appears augmented by excerpts from various memoirs _
those of Nixon's daughter, Julie; his secretary of state, Henry
Kissinger, and Nixon himself, with the actors playing them speaking
their thoughts in narration.
   While this fleshes out the basics of the book on which the show
is based, it tends to distract slightly from the main event _ how
disclosure of the White House tape recording system doomed Nixon's
presidency.
   Another flaw: Its version of Nixon's chief of staff, Alexander
Haig Jr. (David Ogden Stiers), is simplistic, painting Haig as a
loyal, unquestioning subordinate, no matter how dubious the
presidential demand.
   There is no hint of the book's claim that Haig, in conversations
with Kissinger and his aides, ``sometimes referred to the president
as an inherently weak man who lacked guts.''
   To Whitemore's credit, the dialogue is remarkably free of the
wooden, pompous tone that afflicts most dramatizations of
Washington history; the words sound natural, even if their accuracy
can and probably will be debated.
   Blessed with intelligent, restrained direction by Richard
Pearce, the film recreates the book's account of Nixon, during his
last White House night, insisting that Kissinger kneel down and
pray with him, then collapsing on the floor, weeping.
   But it minimizes the book's report of Nixon sometimes drinking
heavily, showing him drinking but never intoxicated. And it doesn't
use the book's claim that Nixon once reportedly was seen talking to
portraits on the White House walls, which he has strongly denied
through his friends and lawyers.
   ``The Final Days'' is unusually well-acted, save for an odd,
almost comical Kissinger played with deep Teutonic somberness by
Theodore Bikel.
   The Nixon of the relatively little-known Lane Smith is a
masterpiece, even though he initially seems a little too
soft-spoken and not forceful enough.
   But gradually, expertly recreating Nixon's awkward, hunch-backed
walk and gestures, Smith becomes eminently convincing as the
driven, agonized man who became the only American president to ever
resign from office.

   Seven people were killed in continuing
Hindu-Moslem clashes Friday in the eastern town of Bhagalpur,
bringing the death toll to more than 90 this week, news reports
said.
   Press Trust of India said at least 109 people suffered injuries
in the violence, which began Tuesday.
   Clashes in the Bihar state town of 300,000 people coincided with
processions by Hindu militants who were collecting bricks to build
a temple at Ayodhya, in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state. Both
Hindus and Moslems lay claim to the same religious site.
   The army was called out in Bhagalpur and given shoot-on-sight
orders Wednesday when arson and looting broke out despite a curfew.
   Police have arrested 200 rioters, the news agency said.
   Bhagalpur, on the Ganges River which is sacred to Hindus, is
about 110 miles east of Patna and 220 miles northwest of Calcutta.

<HEAD>Bush Vetoes D.C. Budget Because of Abortion Provision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush vetoed the District of
Columbia's $3.4 annual spending package today because it permitted
use of city tax dollars for Medicaid-funded abortions.
   Bush's veto, which had been widely expected, was announced by
the White House when the president arrived in Costa Rica for a
two-day visit.
   The veto came two days after the House sustained Bush's veto of
a labor, health and education spending bill that also permitted use
of Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women made pregnant
through rape or incest.
   The veto came despite protests from city officials that the
district's anti-drug efforts would be imperiled unless the spending
package was approved.
   Included in the bill was $32 million in extra federal money to
pay for the hiring of 700 extra police officers, extra judges and a
variety of school-based drug education and prevention programs.
   Congress approved the anti-crime package to help the capital
battle its record homicide rate and drug-related crime wave. The
bill also included a payment of $435 million, to make up for local
tax revenue lost on federally owned property.
   Abortion-rights advocates and local government officials also
complained that if Bush vetoed the bill, he would be exerting
unfair influence over the city's legislative affairs.
   The abortion debate began in July, when the House voted to allow
the district to use its own tax money to pay for Medicaid-funded
abortions. At the time, lawmakers said the city was given the right
because of last summer's Supreme Court ruling that granted states
great latitude in regulating abortions.
   The city traditionally has funded abortions for low-income women.
   In last year's budget, anti-abortion forces in Congress
succeeded in barring the city from using its own taxes for any type
of abortion.
   City officials said earlier this week that they do not expect
Congress to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override Bush's
veto in both the House and Senate.

   Police stormed an overcrowded state prison
this morning to regain control from inmates who seized hostages and
set fires in a two-night riot that left more than 100 people
injured, authorities said.
   Officers fired shots and tear gas in a kitchen building,
wounding one inmate, in the assault that led to retaking of control
less than two hours later at 9:35 a.m., said Ken Robinson, state
Corrections Department spokesman.
   Hospital officials said that at some point a guard and two
prisoners were critically injured.
   Police in riot gear and wielding shotguns pushed surrendering or
captured prisoners to the ground, holding them face-down in the
grass.
   Rioters among about 1,900 inmates who remained loose in their
cellblocks this morning were taken to a holding area at the rear of
the prison grounds, Robinson said.
   There was continuing confusion about the numbers of rioters,
injuries and hostages in the rampages that started Wednesday night.
   Officials initially said there were eight hostages. Later it was
reported there were four and that all were released safely
throughout the night and this morning. But a fifth hostage was
found after order was restored, officials said.
   More than 100 people were injured, including 60 Thursday night
and this morning, Robinson said. He said there were no deaths and
``all employees are accounted for.''
   A 24-year-old inmate was hospitalized in critical condition,
suffering from a gunshot wound to the abdomen, said Deborah Saline,
spokeswoman at Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. A guard, 41, was
in critical condition with multiple stab wounds to the back, she
said.
   An 18-year-old prisoner was in critical condition from a gunshot
wound at Polyclinic Hospital, said spokesman Jim Mulay.
   One of the hostages, a prison guard, was released Thursday night
as a ``good faith'' gesture, and state police freed a second
hostage from a cellblock this morning, Robinson said.
   ``They literally pulled him out of there,'' Robinson said.
   ``At one point, all inmates were out of all the cellblocks,''
said Robinson, though not all inmates were actively involved in the
rioting.
   About 500 state troopers, with local police and firefighters,
moved in early today to retake the 2,600-inmate, medium-security
prison.
   The officers entered through gates in prison walls, at first
occupying areas that weren't held by the prisoners and avoiding
clashes with hostage-holding inmates.
   At the time, Robinson said prisoners were negotiating with
authorities. He said their demands shifted through the night.
   At one point the hostage holders demanded to talk to Gov. Robert
P. Casey and officials of the human rights group Amnesty
International, said a state police negotiator, Cpl. Raul Ramos.
Casey did not comply.
   Earlier, a huge fire in the education building sent flames
rising 100 feet in the air and an explosion at or near a prison
furniture factory rattled windows up to a mile away.
   Inmates pelted firefighters with rocks.
   Officials said 12 of 31 prison buildings were destroyed in the
fires, including two commissaries. Officials had to bring in a
portable National Guard kitchen to provide meals for prisoners not
involved in the rampage. Prison officials also said eight temporary
housing units used to ease overcrowding were destroyed and three of
the 10 cellblocks were damaged by the blazes.
   ``It's total chaos. They lost control,'' said a guard who was in
one of the cellblocks when Thursday's disturbance began as meals
were being served at 7 p.m. ``The officers were told to lock the
doors and leave. We had to get out. ... They said they were going
to kill us.
   ``Last night was a riot. Tonight was war,'' said the guard, a
six-year staffer who refused to give his name.
   The prison had been locked down early Thursday after violence
Wednesday night that caused severe damage to six cellblocks.
   Prison officials had difficulty explaining how the prisoners had
managed to free themselves and erupt in new violence.
   ``There was a bunch of little fires at first, but they started
putting mattresses on the windows,'' said Steve Tobias, a resident
of nearby Lemoyne, who was passing the prison as the new outbreak
began.``A whole bunch of (inmates) were running toward the fence.
But when they heard the shots, they went back the other way.''
   Officials said lock mechanisms on some cells may have been
damaged in Wednesday's riots, and a guard at one cellblock said the
inmates may have stolen some keys during the melee.
   Prison spokesman John Palakovich said most of those injured were
firefighters, but he wouldn't characterize their injuries.
   Inmates had gotten into prison tools, such as screwdrivers,
hammers and saws, Palakovich said. He had no reports of prisoners
with guns.
   Palakovich said state police fired warning shots in the prison
in the early stages of the disturbance. A television view at one
point showed a police officer on top of a firetruck firing a gun
into the air.
   On Wednesday, 47 people were injured during a seven-hour siege
that prison officials estimated involved 1,200 inmates. Palakovich
said even more inmates were involved in Thursday's melee.
   Prison Superintendent Robert Freeman said Wednesday's riot may
have been caused by overcrowding and inmates' resentment over
policy changes.
   Inmates were upset by a decision not to allow families to bring
in food during extended family-day visits. Officials said the food
could be used to conceal drugs, cash and other contraband.
   A new medical policy that prisoners objected to actually
improves access to care, but inmates viewed the change as an
attempt to restrict health care, Freeman said, adding that the
staff could have done a better job explaining the changes. The
change involved assigning routine examinations to certain days.
   Camp Hill is about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state
prison system is about 48 percent over capacity.
   Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. said the disturbance at Camp
Hill, 4 miles west of Harrisburg, and a smaller uprising at
Huntingdon state prison on Monday were ``the predictable result of
a prison crowding crisis that has been allowed to fester for too
long.''

   Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as
a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity.
   His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of
messages and with a Mass in Washington. Radio reports said
Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message
from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome.
   The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and the
French-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of letters
to Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   His sister, Peggy Say, wrote, ``In honor of your birthday on
Friday, we will be in Washington with other hostage families to
mark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom.''
   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of
colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: ``Please believe
that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for
you.''
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a
33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and
former colleagues in Tokyo.
   Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in
Japan 1979-1981.
   Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State
Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria,
attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, where
Mrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be
forgotten.
   Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirut
after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his
reporting on Lebanon's civil war.
   He has not held Sulome, born three months after the morning he
was kidnapped. He probably does not know that his father and
brother died of cancer.
   Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle
between Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates.
   He was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran whose
name means Islamic Holy War. His abductors demand the release of 15
men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies
in 1983.
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American who
was acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut.
Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the
whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year,
reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their
comrades jailed in Kuwait.
   A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to one
released Nov. 4, 1988, after his last birthday.
   The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its
influence to free the hostages if the United States released
Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since
1979.
   Kuwait has refused to free the prsoners, but two members of the
group were released in February after completing five-year
sentences. The United States has said it will not negotiate with
terrorists.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most
believed held by pro-Iranians.
   Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's
revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon. He met with
prominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believed
to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs.
   It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political
rival, came to Lebanon. But the trip underlined his power struggle
with Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate
``pragmatists'' who want to restore relations with the West.
   A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihad
statement was ``a clear indication that the hostage-holders are not
under Rafsanjani's control.''
   Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main
groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as president
July 28. The former interior minister's surprise appearance in
Lebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.
Mohtashemi returned to Tehran on Wednesday via Damascus, Syria.
   Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few
letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper
and television reports about relatives.
   American and French hostages who shared his captivity and were
released have told of his courage and fears, how he has defied his
captors and suffered the agonies of captivity.
   His father, Glenn, and elder brother, Glenn Jr., died of cancer
in 1986. Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths.
   Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but
has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him
to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by
the kidnappers.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Legislation Raising Federally Insured Mortgage Ceiling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today approved and sent to
President Bush legislation raising to $124,875 the ceiling on home
mortgages insured by the federal government in high-cost housing
markets.
   The measure, part of a $67 billion spending bill for housing,
veterans, environmental and space programs, was approved by an 84-6
vote. The House approved the same bill Wednesday.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.;
Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and William V. Roth, R-Del.
   Currently, the ceiling on mortgages insured by the Federal
Housing Administration is $101,250, an amount below the median
price of homes in 18 states and the District of Columbia.
   Proponents said raising the FHA mortgage ceiling will help tens
of thousands of young families cope with higher real estate prices.
   Opponents, however, contended the higher ceiling will only
deepen the exposure of the FHA to losses that will have to be made
up by taxpayers if a large number of the loans turn sour. The FHA
lost $4.2 billion last year in loan defaults.
   The bill provides $12.4 billion for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, including $1.8 billion for the planned space
station, in fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
   It also makes available $5.6 billion for the Environmental
Protection Agency, $11.4 billion for veterans' medical care, and
$15.1 billion for housing programs.

   A 14-year-old newspaper carrier is credited
with saving the life of an elderly woman who had spent 10 days
lying on her back in a bathtub.
   Christy Wenrich alerted police last week after she noticed a
pile of newspapers on the stoop of 83-year-old Ellen Gilmour's
home. Miss Wenrich had just resumed delivering The Record of
Hackensack after her sister had taken over the route for a few days.
   When police went to Mrs. Gilmour's home, they heard faint pleas
for help coming from inside. ``They broke into the back and found
her in the bathtub on her back,'' said Ramsey Police Captain
Anthony Del Colliano.
   Mrs. Gilmour told police she had been cleaning the tub when she
fell in 10 days before her rescue.
   Mrs. Gilmour was in fair condition Friday at The Valley Hospital
in Ridgewood, spokeswoman Marylou Zeug said.
   Ramsey acting police chief Richard A. Franceschi said he doesn't
believe Mrs. Gilmour would have survived if Miss Wenrich hadn't
tipped off authorities.
   The Ramsey Borough Council plans to publicly commend Miss
Wenrich at its meeting Nov. 14.

<HEAD>Court Rules That British Tourist Was Murdered in Game Park</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A British tourist whose charred bones were
found in a game park was murdered, a court ruled Friday,
vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state
investigators who claimed wild animals had killed her.
   The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one
arrested and the judge saying he saw no need for further
investigation. Ms. Ward's father has charged there was an official
cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative tourism industry.
   Ms. Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were
found on Sept. 13, 1988, in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve,
a week after she reportedly left the world-renowned park while on a
wildlife photography expedition.
   The state claimed the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores
after abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home
to lions, vultures, hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters.
   Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England,
contended she was murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He
pleaded with the state to order an inquest and spent tens of
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in a private
investigation of her death.
   ``There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died
of foul play by a person or persons unknown,'' Chief Magistrate
Joseph Mango said at the conclusion of his inquiry, which began in
mid-August and heard 38 witnesses before ending Oct. 6.
   In rejecting the state's contention that Ms. Ward had been
killed by animals, Mango said: ``I think the animals are innocent.
If they are guilty at all, it is in eating what they found.''
   However, he said he ``saw no reason'' to investigate her death
further and rejected claims by her family that the state had
engaged in a cover-up to protect her killer or Kenya's $360 million
annual tourist trade.
   ``There has been a strong attack on the quality of the
investigations ... and allegations of a cover-up,'' Mango said.
``Of course the state does not admit this.''
   He further denied that Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's chief
game warden, is or was a principal suspect in Ms. Ward's murder.
   During the inquest, Ward's attorney, Byron Georgiadis, had tried
to build a case that Ms. Ward was killed by someone who knew the
game park well, had freedom of movement there and could have
ordered or inspired a cover-up of the circumstances surrounding her
disappeareance.
   He pointed to Makallah as a chief suspect, contending the game
warden was able to find the young woman's remains hours after her
vehicle was located six miles away, only because he already knew
where they were.
   Mango, however, said there had been no evidence to suggest
Makallah and Ms. Ward ever met before her death and the fact that
he found her remains ``does not cast suspicion on Makallah.''
   Instead, he said investigators should have considered as prime
suspects two men Ms. Ward spent time with in the game park, neither
of whom appeared as witnesses at the inquest.
   After the ruling, Ward said he was surprised at the outcome and
that he had had ``very serious doubts'' Mango would rule in his
favor. He called the ruling a ``credit'' to Kenya.
   ``At the end of the day, he came up with the verdict that was
required,'' Ward said.
   But asked if he was pleased with the ruling, he said: ``How can
you be pleased to have it confirmed that your daughter has been
murdered? But, yes, I suppose I am pleased.''
   Ward repeated his belief there had been a cover-up and referred
to a British pathologist's report accepted by Mango as accurate
that proved his daughter had been hacked to pieces by a sharp
instrument and not torn apart by animals.
   A state pathologist's report said her remains had been cleanly
cut, but was later altered by a superior to say they had been
cracked and torn _ injuries more indicative of an animal's mauling.
   The British report was presented to Kenya's police commissioner
``months ago and he chose to ignore it,'' Ward said.
   Police have admitted several blunders in the case, including
failing to interview people in the area. In addition, a park gate
keeper admitted forging Ms. Ward's signature on a visitor's book to
show she had left the preserve.
   ``I'm not retracting anything about a cover-up,'' Ward said. He
added that he hoped police would work to solve the murder, despite
Mango's belief that the case did not require further investigation.
   ``This is a solvable crime,'' he said. ``Hopefully, the police
will do this now.''

<HEAD>EDs: New thruout with Senate passage of bill; comments from Sasser.
No pickup.</HEAD>

   The Senate today approved an $8.5 billion
military construction bill that slashes President Bush's request
for bases overseas but adds millions of dollars for domestic
projets.
   By voice vote, the Senate adopted the legislation and sent it to
the president for his signature.
   The bill cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by
$461 million from what was spent during the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30 and is $65 million below what Bush wanted to spend this
year.
   ``I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending
for many years to come,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman
of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction.
``Next year may be even smaller than the bill here today.''
   The bill eliminates $40.8 million Bush proposed for dormitories,
storage facilities and other construction in the Philippines, $15
million for airfield improvements in Honduras and $14.4 million for
an aircraft parking extension and other improvements at U.S. bases
in Panama.
   It also reduces Bush's request for Britain from $108 milllion to
$20 million and the president's budget for NATO infrastructure from
$501 million to $424 million.
   ``Funding for overseas will continue to be a low priority until
our allies substantially improve their contribution to their
defense,'' Sasser said.
   Late Thursday, the House approved the legislation by voice vote.
The bill was the product of House and Senate negotiators working on
separately passed bills.
   In the House, the only controversy focused on an effort by Reps.
Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., and Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., to stop a
land swap deal between the Navy and the state of Hawaii to relocate
the home port of the battleship USS Missouri from Long Beach to
Pearl Harbor.
   ``This is going to eat up millions and millions of dollars that
could be used by the Navy and for military housing to duplicate a
facility that already exists,'' Rohrabacher said.
   But the House accepted the land swap on an overwhelming voice
vote after opponents called the effort to stop it a ``sneak
attack'' on a military base closing and relocation initiative
approved earlier.
   ``This is an attempt to stop the base closure bill, no doubt
about it,'' said Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on military construction.
   The bill calls for the Navy to sell 120 acres on Oahu to the
state, which will build a causeway leading to Ford Island. The
island now is accessible only by ferry.
   The overall legislation includes $4.8 billion for military
construction, $3.2 billion for family housing and $500 million to
begin closing 86 U.S. bases and scaling back five others.
   It provides $105 million the administration requested for a
rail-garrison basing system for the MX multiple-warhead, nuclear
missile at Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming.
   Also included is $11 million for the military construction
aspect of Star Wars and $94 million for construction of bases for
the B-2 stealth bomber. The total for basing the B-2 bomber is $35
million less than the administration requested.
   The legislation increases spending on military facilities in
Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the chairmen of the
Senate and House Appropriations subcommittees on military
construction.
   The administration requested $87.3 million for the Memphis Naval
Air Station, Army National Guard armories and other facilities in
Tennessee. House and Senate conferees put in $109.2 million for
Sasser's home state.
   In North Carolina, the administration proposed $108 million for
Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base and other installations.
But Hefner's home state is slated to receive $133.8 million.
   Significant increases also were made in the military
construction budgets of California and Iowa, the home states of the
subcommittees' ranking Republicans, Rep. Bill Lowery of California
and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa.
   West Virginia, home state of Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd,
chairman of the full Senate Appropriations Committee, will get
$21.5 million, while the administration sought $4.5 million.
   Mississippi, home state of Rep. Jamie Whitten, the Democratic
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, gets $49.7 million,
while Bush requested only $20 million.

   The audience at a tourist attraction that
recreates the 1906 earthquake and fire _ complete with shaking and
smoke _ sat through last week's 7.1 temblor, thinking it was just
part of the act, the show's manager said.
   Employees of ``The San Francisco Experience,'' where the motto
is ``Feel the Earth Shake,'' had to persuade people to leave on
Oct. 17, manager Craig Patterson said.
   ``I was scared when things outside the theater started to fall
and I didn't know what I'd find when I went into the show,'' said
cashier Shirley Hobson-Jackson, the first worker to alert the
audience of 26 people.
   What she found was ``people just sitting there quietly in the
dark.''
   Power was out, but the theater had already been darkened for the
show.
   ``I told them we just had an earthquake and some said they
thought it was part of the show,'' she said.
   The last thing the show needed was competition from the real
thing, Patterson said Thursday, while only three people watched the
show in the 220-seat theater near Fisherman's Wharf.
   On the day before the earthquake 420 people saw ``The San
Francisco Experience,'' he said. Since it re-opened Oct. 19, the
28-minute show has drawn an average of 80 a day.
   Patterson doesn't blame the show's realism, with shaking caused
by blasting bass speakers _ for scaring off customers. He cites a
lack of tourists and the closures of the Bay Bridge and the freeway
near the waterfront.
   The 1906 quake, in which more than 700 people died, hasn't
always been the big draw of ``The San Francisco Experience'' _
brainchild of the late Bing Crosby _ that opened in 1971.
   The seven screens and 32 speakers at the attraction also feature
the Gold Rush, Chinatown, cable cars, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz.
``Feel the Earth Shake'' was added at the suggestion of
consultants, Patterson said.
   Patterson is convinced there's still plenty of drawing power
left in earthquake simulation. So much so, he said, that he's going
to add footage about the quake of 1989.

<HEAD>China Stopping Arms to Guerrillas, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China, one of the major supporters of
the Afghan rebels, has cut its arms supplies to the group and is
slowly normalizing relations with the Soviet-backed government,
Asian diplomats said.
   A Kabul-based Chinese diplomat said Beijing has begun trade ties
with the Afghan government and generally supported President
Najib's attempts to unite the country, torn by an 11-year-old civil
war.
   ``We would like to see a broad-based coalition of forces unite
in this country,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anomymity. ``We don't care who is in power. That is the internal
affairs of Afghanistan.''
   Asian diplomats said the change in policy began this year
following the withdrawal in February of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
   In June, a China-Soviet summit in Beijing _ the first in 30
years _ quickened the pace. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
apparently was assured that China would stop arming the Moslem
guerrillas, who are fighting to establish an Islamic republic in
Afghanistan.
   ``The Soviets have withdrawn from Afghanistan,'' said the
Chinese official. ``That was our main goal. We see no need to
continue our support of the guerrillas.''
   Diplomats said they were not sure how the end of China's support
would affect the guerrillas' ability to fight.
   China began supplying the rebel forces soon after the Soviet
Union intervened in Afghanistan a decade ago. Chinese-made AK-47
automatic weapons, along with Chinese mortars, small rockets,
grenades and other light arms, were the weapons of choice for many
of the rebel bands, diplomats said.
   Chinese support never reached the level of American assistance,
which hovers at an estimated $600 million a year. Asian diplomats
predicted that rebel forces would continue to be supplied with
Chinese arms but that they would be purchased on the international
arms market.
   One high-ranking Asian diplomat, whose country has good
relations with Afghanistan, said his embassy believed Chinese arms
supplies stopped sometime this summer.
   ``Everything in the pipeline was delivered,'' he said, ``but
they made no new commitments.''
   He said the policy shift was in line with recent changes in
China's foreign policy.
   Now that China and the Soviet Union are normalizing relations
and China's ties are also improving with India, Beijing does not
see the need to encourage a civil war in Afghanistan, he said.
   In addition, he said, since the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing, Chinese foreign policy has taken on a more
cautious air.
   ``They are very concerned again with their relations with other
socialist countries,'' he said. ``We perceive this as part of the
Chinese leadership's renewed emphasis on politics.''
   The Chinese diplomat said trade relations have begun with
Afghanistan. China is selling canned goods and some light
industrial products. He also noted the Afghan government has
stopped criticizing China's policy toward the war.
   Indeed, the foreign ministry no longer mentions China when it
discusses the supporters of the guerrillas.

   A recovering Bay area shows America its
mettle tonight with the earthquake-delayed third game of baseball's
World Series, but the victims and the destruction will not be
forgotten in the revelry.
   ``We can enjoy World Series baseball and still remember those
who lost their lives or their property and those who are helping so
much in the recovery effort,'' Mayor Art Agnos said.
   By Thursday, nearly 21,400 people had registered for disaster
aid with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Damages are
estimated at $7.1 billion with nearly 14,000 people still out of
their homes, according to state officials.
   People can talk about the quake at a forum tonight held by the
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, which coincidentally began a
meeting in San Francisco this week. The 500 experts called off
their disaster drill, but offered to help victims of the real thing.
   ``We believe in the value of talking, talking and sharing,''
said Yael Danieli, president of the society. Talking, ``you don't
have to feel lonely and scared. You can re-establish a sense of
community.''
   Relief also came in the form of a $3.45 billion aid package
President Bush signed Thursday, most of it destined for Northern
California. But people also sought lighter restoratives.
   Light as air, in the case of the 59th session of the mock San
Francisco Court of Historical Review. On its docket: Who invented
the doughnut hole? The winner?
   ``Mankind, in its own wisdom, invented the hole in the
doughnut,'' Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas ruled after
an hour of hilarious legal outrage.
   And San Francisco, which treats Halloween as its own special
holiday, begins the celebration this weekend.
   ``It was rather somber for a while,'' said J.S. Gilbert, general
manager of the 10th annual Exotic Erotic Halloween Ball, where
10,000 people are expected Saturday night. Some of the proceeds
will go to quake relief.
   ``But the weekend is important in the sense that people are
looking for a release, an opportunity to go out and enjoy
themselves,' he said Thursday. ``There was a lot of camaraderie, a
lot of good things that came out of the quake.''
   It was 10 days ago that millions of Americans, settling down in
front of televisions to watch baseball's World Series, instead saw
the 7.1-magnitude earthquake jerk Candlestick Park and the Bay area.
   Tonight, baseball returns after the longest break in World
Series history, to Candlestick, and many say it will give San
Francisco a chance to show off and lure jittery tourists back.
   A moment of silence will be observed at 5:04 p.m., the minute
the quake hit. Disaster officials will throw out the first ball,
and the ushers will carry flashlights just in case.
   Fans will be asked to sing ``San Francisco.'' The lyrics are on
one side of a handout, and a message from the San Francisco Giants
is on the other.
   ``Tonight we honor the resilience and indomitable spirit of our
community to rise again,'' the statement says. ``Let us all join
together, not only in prayers for the loved ones lost, but in
tribute to the survivors and selfless volunteers whose lives are
changed forever.''
   Dave Stewart, starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics,
already ahead two games to none, said the players have had trouble
preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
Stewart said.
   Commissioner Fay Vincent said baseball will donate $1.4 million
to the relief effort, including $100,000 from each Series team.
   Rebuilding from such a quake also means tearing down. Crews were
demolishing some of the ``red-tagged'' buildings _ those determined
unsafe _ and demolition went on at a 1\-mile stretch of Interstate
880 in Oakland.
   The crews also put up a chain-link fence around the collapsed
structure to keep people out and with fewer police officers, said
Highway Patrol Officer Ed Moriarty.
   The quake closed the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and parts
of several highways, including a collapsed section of I-880. While
officials have reported record use of mass transit, commuter roads
have been clogged daily.
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian's office announced the
appointment of George Housner to head the state's investigation
into the freeway collapse.
   Housner, engineering professor emeritus at the California
Institute of Technology, ``is the elder statesman of earthquake
engineering in this country,'' said Ian Buckle, who occupied
Housner's post until Monday when Deukmejian decided he had
compromised his objectivity.
   However slowly, the area is recovering, as are some of the
victims.
   Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's Highland General
Hospital. But his kidney function has returned to normal, and he is
conscious most of the time, said spokeswoman Pat Pino.
   Six-year-old Julio Berumen and his sister Cathy, 8, were in good
condition and improving, said Children's Hospital spokewoman Diane
Lazzari. They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About
$48,000 has been donated to a fund for them.
   But police said six people remained unaccounted for, and the
death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old San Mateo
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
Thirty-nine of those killed werein the collapse of double-decked
I-880. The search for more bodies was delayed because the road was
too shaky. On Friday,
   The Bay area's trauma has touched hearts and opened pocketbooks
the world over.
   More than $8 million has been pledged from outside the country,
$7 million from Japan. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias sent 2,500
pounds of coffee Thursday.

   The governor is calling out 100
National Guard troops to expand the search for an 11-year-old boy
abducted at gunpoint five days ago by a masked man, officials said
today.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich decided to activate the troops after he
visited the parents of the boy, Jacob Wetterling, on Thursday
night, said Guard spokeswoman Maj. Lucy Kender.
   The guardsmen, based in St. Cloud, would be deployed Saturday
morning, said Lt. Col. Ron Deppa.
   Stearns County Sheriff Charlie Grafft asked for additional state
help Thursday night, citing the large area the search had to cover.
   Jacob was abducted by a man dressed in black Sunday night on a
rural road less than a mile from his home in this central Minnesota
town of 2,200.
   Authorities said an earlier lead that the kidnapper may have
been driving a small red car turned out to be bogus.
   An art student who owns such a car called authorities to say he
had been driving in the area in search of good material to sketch,
and probably was spotted by several residents who thought the
driver was suspicious.
   ``We believe that was the vehicle we had been looking for,''
said Jim Kostreba, chief deputy sheriff of Stearns County.
   The Fox network's ``A Current Affair'' aired a segment on the
abduction Thursday night, and Kostreba said telephones at search
headquarters began ringing almost continuously as soon as the phone
number was shown.
   ``We had to hook up additional phones,'' he said. ``We're
getting calls from all up and down the East Coast'' from people
volunteering information about similar cases.
   A group of anonymous Twin Cities business leaders Thursday night
offered a $100,000 cash reward for Jacob's return unharmed within
72 hours. The offer ends at 11 p.m. Sunday. St. Joseph community
organizers are offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information
leading to Jacob's safe return.
   Jacob's parents, Jerry and Patty Wetterling, appeared on ``CBS
This Morning'' today to tell their story to a national TV audience.
   FBI spokesman Byron Gigler said 20 agents have been assigned to
the case.
   Jacob was riding bikes after dark with his 10-year-old brother,
Trevor, and an 11-year-old friend in this central Minnesota town of
2,200 people. The trip to a convenience store to rent a videotape
was the boy's first trip out by himself at night, said his father,
Jerry Wetterling.
   On the way back to the Wetterlings' house, the boys were
accosted by a man who had what appeared to be pantyhose pulled over
his head to distort his facial features.
   The two boys who escaped told police the man pulled a gun and
asked them their ages, then ordered them to run away and threatened
to shoot them.
   Jerry Wetterling said he and his wife, Patty, a substitute
school teacher, had warned their four children to be wary of
strangers.
   ``My advice would be to take time to sit down and instruct
children that there are sick people in the world,'' said
Wetterling, a chiropractor and president of the St. Cloud chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The couple described Jacob as an all-around student who loved to
study math and play goalie on a youth-league hockey team.
   Wetterling said they had received no ransom demands and doubted
his civil rights activism was a factor in his son's abduction.
``It's an abnormal situation,'' he said.
   In Washington, D.C., Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., told Senate
colleagues of the abduction and St. Joseph.
   ``It's a little town, guided principally by family values, where
people work together, go to church together, and care deeply for
each other,'' said Durenberger, a native of nearby St. Cloud.
   ``It is a town that symbolizes the best virtues of America's
small towns. Crime as we've come to know it here in Washington,
D.C., is non-existent.''

   Animal protection groups want to make sure
that black cats don't cross the wrong paths this Halloween.
   Several of the groups have asked Florida animal shelters to
prohibit adoption of black cats until after the holiday. Their fear
is that the animals may fall prey to satanic worshippers and evil
pranksters.
   ``It's simply because you get a lot of Halloween parties,'' said
Martha Lentz, acting director of the Humane Society of Orlando.
   ``People want to adopt them for the wrong reasons. There are a
lot of satanic rituals. ... We don't want to be responsible for the
abuse of an animal.''
   ``If somebody wants to be a witch for Halloween, she'll just
call up and ask, `Do you have any in stock?' '' said Lisa Gonzalez,
telephone operator for a Miami shelter. ``When they say `in stock,'
I just tell them `no way.' That does it.''
   Last year, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
in St. Petersburg protested when it learned that a local bar tried
to entice customers by offering free drinks to anyone who brought
in a black cat.
   ``We nipped that in the bud,'' said society spokeswoman Beth
Dall.

   Gerald Alan Yoho knew a name change was
in order when he wanted to open up his own retail jewelry business.
   ``You cannot have `Yoho Jewelers,''' the Crown Point businessman
said recently discussing the change three years ago. ``You've got a
lady sitting at home, and her husband looks her in the eye and
says, `Let me get this straight. You left your $3,000 diamond ring
at Yoho Jewelers?'''
   Yoho's trip to Lake Circuit Court allowed him to flip-flop his
middle name and surname, legally becoming Jer Yoho Alan and opening
Alan Jewelers on Main Street shortly after.
   Alan was one of 110 people who petitioned for a name change in
Lake and Porter counties in 1986. Some, like Alan, simply sought a
less awkward moniker.
   Some had something a little more poetic in mind. Wayne P.
Thornburg, for example, went to court in Crown Point recently to
become Nicolo Vincenzo Antonio Lore.
   ``The law is that anybody can be known by any name they want to
be,'' said Porter Circuit Judge Raymond Kickbush. ``So you can come
in and say you want to be known as Bugs Bunny, and I can say,
`Fine. I'm gonna grant that.'
   ``I recall one case where I had a person come in with a common
first name, a middle initial, and a very long and involved last
name. I said, `Well, what do you want?' The person wanted the
initial changed,'' Kickbush said.
   The former Mr. Yoho says it was no big hassle.
   ``The judge called me into his chambers. He just wanted to make
sure that I wasn't doing it for some devious reason,'' Alan said.
   ``In fact, I did a couple of appraisals on his jewelry while we
were standing there, so he could find out whether or not I really
was a jeweler.''

<HEAD>Committee Asks Dickinson to Explain Deal With Contractor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee has been asked by the House ethics committee to
explain his dealings with a defense contractor who gave him a
one-third interest in a $300,000 investment.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., received a letter from the
committee this week asking for an explanation of his investment
deal with Ben Collier, a Montgomery businessman whose companies did
$50 million in government defense work in the last two years.
   ``He's very happy to explain it,'' Clay Swanzy, Dickinson's
administrative assistant, said Friday. ``He welcomes the
opportunity.''
   In an interview earlier this month, Dickinson acknowledged that
he approached Collier in 1986 with ``what I thought was a good
business opportunity.'' He said Collier agreed to put $300,000 into
a joint venture, with one-third of the profits or losses going to
Dickinson.
   The congressman said he provided the ``contacts'' for the
venture, which became known as the Montgomery Investment Club. He
insisted that there was ``nothing illegal, immoral or unethical''
about the deal.
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts of more than
$100 from any individual with a direct interest in legislation
before Congress. Dickinson contends Collier is not affected by that
rule, and he said Coller has ``never asked me to vote any way.''
   Dickinson said he has promoted Collier's businesses to major
defense contractors, just as he has helped other companies in his
district that are interested in defense subcontracting work. He has
denied any relationship between his promotion of Collier's
businesses and the investment deal.
   Swanzy said the letter to Dickinson from Ralph L. Lotkin, chief
counsel for the ethics committee, was ``fully expected and
welcome.'' He said Dickinson is preparing a response that will
include documents to support his contention that he has not
violated House rules.
   Dickinson did not make any money from the investment venture.
The entire $300,000 was invested with Steven A. Streit of
Huntsville, who was promising investors huge profits through stock
market trading.
   Dickinson had invested some of his own money with Streit before
approaching Collier, but shortly after the $300,000 was turned over
to Streit, the Huntsville man was arrested and charged with
securities fraud. He later pled guilty and was sentenced to 10
years in prison.
   Streit's assets were frozen in early 1987, and Dickinson and
Collier have received about 90 percent of the $300,000 from the
bankruptcy clerk who is serving Streit's creditors.
   Dickinson has said he expects to pay one-third of the losses
from the investment if the final settlement by the bankruptcy court
does not recover the full $300,000.

<TEXT>
   President Bush joined Latin-American
leaders today for talks about drug trafficking, foreign debt and
political strife, and hailed ``the sweep of democracy through the
hemisphere.''
   Even before Bush's arrival from Washington for a two-day
celebration of Costa Rica's 100 years of democracy, Panama's
military government was sniping at the United States from afar and
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was castigating Bush for
refusing to meet with him.
   Bush did not mention either Panama or Nicaragua when he stepped
off his plane, but won applause at a welcoming ceremony when he
declared: ``I believe we can create here in the Americas the
world's first completely democratic hemisphere.''
   Ortega sat at least a half-dozen seats away from Bush when the
17 hemispheric leaders began their first working session this
afternoon at a resort hotel outside San Jose. Each was introduced
to rounds of applause, and their deliberations at a long table were
broadcast live on national television.
   At the airport, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias announced a
tentative agreement that will allow his country to reduce its $4.5
billion foreign debt burden by $1 billion. He said the agreement
would reduce debt service by two-thirds.
   Arias gave no further details, but profusely thanked the United
States for its help in achieving ``the best gift we could possibly
make to future generations of Costa Ricans.''
   Bush and Arias shook hands and then embraced each other with
hearty hugs. Waving at a group of youngsters in the crowd, Bush
paid tribute to Costa Rica's tradition of greeting foreign visitors
``not with the guns of military salutes but with the cheers of
those school children.''
   From the airport, Bush rode through heavily guarded streets to
the Cariari Hotel and Country Club, a resort complex about five
miles outside the capital, for the first of two meetings with
hemispheric leaders lasting more than four hours this afternoon.
   The heads of state, sitting around a long table stretching the
length of a room, were to have lunch together between the two
working sessions, and to attend a black-tie dinner tonight at the
downtown National Theater.
   Bush offered other hemispheric nations ``a new partnership of
mutual respect and mutual responsibility,'' and urged them to join
the United States to ``defeat the new slayers of the democratic
dream, the narco traffickers who poison our children, murder
elected officials and wage war on civil society.''
   Arriving ahead of Bush, Ortega told reporters he hoped the
meeting will be the first step toward talks between North and South
America. ``Without confronting the problems of the economy,
commerce and the rights of nations to live in peace, democracy is
at risk throughout Central America,'' Ortega said.
   Questioned during a photo session with Arias, Bush said he wants
Nicaragua to have free, fair elections resulting in a democratic
government. Asked if he would tell this to Ortega, the president
replied: ``You all are looking for some kind of fight. I'm here to
celebrate democracy.''
   Security was tight as presidents and prime ministers arrived
under cloudy skies. Downtown San Jose was sealed off and patrolled
by 4,000 policemen, and the U.S. Secret Service supervised
installation of a two-inch-thick, 75-foot long sheet of bulletproof
glass in front of the National Museum for Saturday's inauguration
of Democracy Plaza.
   Officials said the 4.5-ton security shield was intended
primarily to protect Bush and President Virgilio Barco of Colombia,
who has been marked for death by drug cartel leaders for his recent
crackdown.
   Nicaragua's Marxist leader said he wasn't surprised that Bush
refused to meet with him. ``That's been Bush's policy,'' Ortega
said. ``He's always trying to trample on Nicaragua.''
   But he added: ``We'll all be sitting down together. There we'll
talk.''
   Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega wasn't invited to
the summit. But in advertisements placed in San Jose's major
newspapers, provisional Panamanian President Francisco Ramirez told
the leaders that democracy in Panama couldn't be considered without
also discussing U.S. economic and political pressure.
   Guillermo Endara, Panama's opposition leader who is here as an
observer, shrugged off a report that Noriega's government was
filing legal charges against him. Endara said he would like to see
Noriega wearing ``wooden pajamas'' _ a coffin _ by the end of the
year.
   Bush regards Ortega's communist-backed Sandinista government as
a threat to U.S. national security. Nevertheless, Arias said
earlier, ``there will be a dialogue among all of us around a
table'' with a common agenda, even though Bush refuses to talk
directly to Ortega.
   Before he left Andrews Air Force Base, Md., aboard Air Force
One, Bush made no direct mention of Ortega. Instead, he said he was
flying to Costa Rica to ``salute the traditions of a nation and a
people that, in many ways, represents the model for our entire
hemisphere.''
   Costa Rica ``is no longer one of the few lonely democracies'' in
the Western Hemisphere, the president said in his departure
statement. ``Indeed today there are only a few lonely holdouts
against the sweep of democracy through the hemisphere.''
   ``I believe history will show that this hemisphere's democratic
resurgence helped set the stage for today's electrifying changes in
the communist world,'' Bush said.
   Arias excluded the governments of Panama, Cuba, Haiti and Chile
_ from the centennial celebration because they were not chosen in
popular elections. But he invited opposition leaders of both
Nicaragua and Panama as observers, including Violeta Chamorro, who
is running against Ortega in Nicaragua's presidential elections
Feb. 25.
   Bush said he would bring up the problems of a fair election in
Nicaragua and arms shipments to El Salvador's leftist guerrillas
``every chance I get.''
   There was no fixed agenda, however, and plans to issue even a
general communique on democracy were scrapped when Bush let it be
known he would not sign a document that had Ortega's name on it.
   Arias said he was not disappointed because ``the communique is
usually put in a drawer and forgotten. What we are trying to get
out of this is a new dialogue, an exchange of opinions.''
   Ortega said the scrapping of the communique was no surprise.
``That's a reflection of Latin-American reality, that there is
always bad feeling among our countries because of the way the
United States behaves, and because of Bush's bad political and
economic policy,'' he said.
   Bush planned to meet with Mrs. Chamorro and Endara, whom the
United States considers the legitimate president of Panama because
of his victory in the May 7 elections, which were annulled.
   Also scheduled to attend were Michael Manley of Jamaica, Brian
Mulroney of Canada, Jose Sarney of Brazil, Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela, Julio Maria Sanguinnetti of Uruguay, Lynden Pindling of
the Bahamas, George Price of Belize, Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador,
Desmond Hoyt of Guyana, Arthur Robinson of Trinidad and Tobago, and
Rafael Hernandez, governor of Puerto Rico.

   Bobby McLaughlin is about to get his due
for the 6{ years he spent in ``the gladiator school'' and other
prisons for a murder he didn't commit.
   But the $1.9 million award made last week by New York Court of
Claims Judge Adolph Orlando will barely begin to soothe the pain.
   ``People think I'm winning the lottery or something,'' the
former New York resident said from his St. Paul apartment. ``Well,
they owe me. If they had given me a choice, I wouldn't have gone
through all this for $50 million.''
   Orlando awarded McLaughlin $1.5 million for ``loss of liberty,
mental stress, anguish and loss of reputation.'' The judge also
ordered payment for lost wages and $225,000 in medical expenses for
treatment of McLaughlin's addiction to cocaine and other drugs that
stemmed from his prison experience.
   ``It's unlikely that he will ever survive the devastating trauma
resulting from incarceration for a crime he did not commit,'' the
judge said.
   McLaughlin, 30, was convicted in 1979 in the New York borough of
Brooklyn for taking part in an armed robbery in which one person
was killed. McLaughlin received a 15-year sentence.
   McLaughlin said he was drinking with friends at a bar in his
neighborhood the night of the killing. He was arrested several days
later because the primary suspect was reputed to associate with a
Robert W. McLaughlin. Detectives mistook that man for Bobby, whose
middle initial is `K.'
   McLaughlin was picked out of a police lineup by a 15-year-old
witness who had been told by police that McLaughlin was a friend of
the other suspect.
   ``I kept telling myself it would end but it never did,''
McLaughlin said. ``I hated the system for not believing me. It just
seemed like they were God _ like they could do whatever they liked
with my life.''
   The conviction was overturned in 1986 after McLaughlin's foster
father, Jarold Hohne, persuaded civil rights lawyer Richard Emery
and a police sergeant to reopen the case. After four years of
relentless work, the only witness who identified Mclaughlin
acknowledged he was wrong.
   ``It's been a nightmare for Bobby from beginning to end,'' Emery
said. ``He faced it down and he survived like one has to, but he's
lost the critical years from 20 to 26{.''
   That's how old McLaughlin was during his prison stays at Rikers
Island, Sing Sing, Elmira and Comstock. The last of those was known
as ``the gladiator school'' because there were so many fights,
McLaughlin said.
   ``They prey on the weak and your body is your weapon,'' he added.
   Going into prison, McLaughlin weighed about 150 pounds. He
emerged after six years of body-building tipping the scales at 200
pounds _ a physique he still maintains.
   McLaughlin said he bulked up to protect himself against constant
aggression.
   He said he kept a bucket of water next to his bunk to defend
against inmates known to start gasoline fires in enemy cells. He
guarded against early morning attacks by waking each day before his
cell doors opened. Late sleepers were often attacked, he said.
   When McLaughlin returned to his Brooklyn apartment he sometimes
slept in the cellar because he feared police would knock on his
door and return him to prison, said Thomas Duffy, the police
sergeant who reopened the investigation.
   ``That kid's finished,'' Duffy said in a telephone interview
from Glendale, Ariz., where he is retired. ``No amount of
counseling will make him normal again.''
   Upon his release from prison, McLaughlin said he reverted to the
life he was leading at age 19 only to find many of his friends had
careers and families and couldn't party with him at Brooklyn bars.
   His cocaine abuse started because he wanted ``to live the fast
life. I was trying to catch up too quick and it caught up with me.''
   The addiction led him to a treatment center in Minnesota, where
he has lived for the past 18 months and worked as a painter and
lawn sprinkler installer. He plans to marry in April.
   ``I've got a long way to go,'' he said. ``I'm 30 years old and I
still don't know what I'm going to do with my life. That hurts.''
   McLaughlin, who still suffers from bouts of depression, said he
may have to settle for less than $1.9 million to avoid a lengthy
appeal of the award by the state. When he gets the money he says
he'll buy a nice car and a place to live.
   ``I'll go from there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Calamari Commotion: Free Squid Offer Causes Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seafood promotion sank like a
cherrystone Friday when thousands of people mobbed a stand passing
out free samples of frozen squid, then chased a truck as it fled
with tons of the coveted calamari.
   An estimated 3,500 rampaged through Lisbon's central Rossio
square trying to get their samples of the tentacled mollusk,
overturning flower stalls that fill the picturesque plaza.
   Police reinforcements were called in to quell the melee. No
arrests or injuries were reported.
   The frozen squid giveaway was part of a promotional campaign by
the Portuguese Institute for Fisheries, which announced Thursday it
would hand out 20 tons of squid around the country in an effort to
boost sales of frozen seafood.
   By 8 a.m., long lines of bargain-hungry citizens surrounded the
flimsy wooden stall where the squid samples were to be given out
two hours later. The truck carrying eight tons of squid showed up
at 10 a.m. and the lines collapsed as thousands mobbed the stall.
   The truck sped away only two minutes after the distribution
began. The crowd chased the truck across the square, overturning
stalls and circling a large ornamental fountain.
   ``I wasn't afraid but I've never seen anything like it since the
revolution,'' said flower merchant Albertina Silva, 57, who hurled
buckets of water at the mob to keep them away from her stall.
   She was referring to the April 25, 1974, overthrow of the
48-year-old rightist dictatorship.

<TEXT>
   Several years ago, Otsego County Sheriff
Martin Ralph put his house, his car and everything else he had in
his wife's name. He wants New York's voters to do something about
that on Election Day.
   ``If she runs away tomorrow, I'm homeless,'' said Ralph. ``It
shouldn't have to be that way.''
   Ralph isn't having a fight with his wife and doesn't expect her
to leave him. Instead he's battling to have what he believes is an
onerous and antiquated provision of the state constitution
eliminated.
   That provision holds Ralph and other state sheriffs personally
liable for the acts of their departments and employees. They are
the only public officials in the state who face such potential
personal liability for official acts.
   When the state's voters enter the ballot booth Nov. 7, they'll
be able to decide on the fate of the provision with ``Proposal
Number One, An Amendment.''
   Should the amendment be approved, residents can still sue the
sheriff, but they won't be able to get his home and car, only money
from the county.
   Peter Kehoe, executive director of the New York State Sheriffs'
Association, said earlier this month there once was good reason for
having the sheriffs held personally liable.
   Until the 1930s, New York state's sheriffs were unsalaried
officials who got to keep all the fees collected by their offices.
   ``The sheriff was essentially a private businessman,'' said
Kehoe.
   Those fees could be substantial. When a sheriff sold property to
satisfy a court judgment, he kept 5 percent of the selling price.
When he served a summons, he got a fee.
   ``They could become very wealthy,'' said Kehoe.
   The job was so profitable that Democrat Al Smith gave up his
state Assembly seat in 1915 to run for New York County sheriff.
   Having salted away between $50,000 and $80,000 in his two-year
term as sheriff, according to a later biographer, Smith ran for and
won the governorship in 1918. He later ran unsuccessfully for
president.
   The state law was later changed to make each sheriff a salaried
employee of the county and to give the county all the fees.
Salaries for sheriffs now range from $85,000 a year in both
Westchester and Monroe counties to the $25,000 paid in rural
Schuyler County.
   What wasn't changed was the constitutional provision making the
sheriffs personally liable for official acts of their departments.
   ``It's a sword of Damocles hanging over the sheriffs' heads,''
said Kehoe. ``Fortunately, the sword hasn't fallen.''
   So far the sheriffs have been lucky enough to have claims
against them covered by the liability insurance that's carried by
the counties, Kehoe said. But insurance companies are questioning
that coverage, he said.
   Another problem, said Kehoe, is the switch by many counties to
self-insurance, a situation that could leave them without the legal
authority to cover judgments against their sheriffs. About
one-third of counties have already become self-insured, he said.
   ``It's not a comfortable situation,'' said Kehoe. ``The sheriffs
are all worried about their families.''
   Putnam County Sheriff Robert Thoubboron said that while he
hasn't put his assets in his wife's name, the liability problem is
a concern.
   ``My predecessor (Raymond Weizenecker) died in office in
February 1985,'' Thoubboron said. ``His estate was tied up in
litigation as a result of a lawsuit brought against him while he
was sheriff. It took three years before that was finally resolved.''
   Such concerns prompted the sheriffs' association to ask the
state Legislature to approve the proposed constitutional amendment
and send it to the voters. Both houses approved the proposed
amendment unanimously.
   ``They were quick to recognize that we were in jeopardy and were
very sympathetic,'' Thoubboron said. ``One of them said to me, `My
God, I don't know how you could take that kind of a job with such a
risk.'''

   The space shuttle Discovery was
moved to the launch pad Friday to be groomed for a Thanksgiving
flight with a secret Defense Department payload.
   Rain pelted the spaceship occasionally as it made the six-hour
trip from an assembly building on the back of a giant tracked
vehicle that covered the 4.2-mile course at a maximum speed of 1
mph.
   Earlier in the week, lightning had forced NASA to delay the
rollout two days and slip the launch date one day until Nov. 20.
   For security reasons, officials refused to disclose the nature
of the military payload to be handled by the crew of five astonauts.
   The flight will be the first of two holiday missions NASA has
scheduled to to close out the year.
   If all goes according to plan, Discovery will be in space on
Thanksgiving and Columbia will be orbiting the earth on Christmas.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off Dec. 20 on a 10-day trip to
deploy a commuinications satellite and retrieve a scientific
payload that has been orbiting for five years.
   The third shuttle, Atlantis, landed at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., on Monday after a five-day flight that dispatched the
Galileo spacecraft to Jupiter. Atlantis is to be flown back here
Saturday or Sunday on top of a Boeing 747 jet liner to be readied
for a mid-February defense department mission.

   Islamic fundamentalist groups called Friday for
an escalation of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands and
rejected U.S.-mediated Middle East peace efforts.
   Also Friday, three Christian bishops abandoned efforts to visit
the Christian Arab town of Beit Sahour in the occupied West Bank
after being told they could go only with an army escort.
   Soldiers also blocked Jerusalem's Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox
and Armenian bishops and two other church leaders from delivering
three truckloads of sugar, rice, flour and cooking oil to Beit
Sahour, saying it was a ``closed military zone.''
   The town near Bethlehem has been declared closed to outsiders
because of its boycott of Israeli taxes, part of the 22-month-old
uprsing against Israeli occupation.
   Repeated tax raids since Sept. 20 have stripped many houses and
shops of furniture, merchandise and machinery.
   Beit Sahour residents pledged Friday to continue the tax revolt.
   ``We will continue using non-violent resistance as a means of
awakening the Israeli people to their need, as well as ours, to
live together in a just peace, two peoples in two free and secure
states,'' said a statement.
   Two Palestinians were reported shot and wounded by Israeli
soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip, including a 14-year-old boy
from the Jabaliya refugee camp who was in critical condition with a
bullet in the stomach, Arab hospitals reported.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 605 Palestinians have
been killed by Israelis. An additional 136 Palestinians have been
slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Forty Israelis have died.
   On Friday, Mohammed Zalaat, 22, of the Tulkarem refugee camp in
the West Bank died of injuries sustained a day earlier when he fell
while jumping from roof to roof to elude soldiers, doctors at
Ramallah hospital said. The army confirmed the incident.
   The calls for escalating the uprising were in leaflets issued by
the Moslem fundammentalist groups Hamas, or Zeal, and Hezbollah.
Both are opposed to compromise with Israel.
   Hamas called for finding ways to escalate the uprising and said
the group ``rejects all peaceful settlements, including Baker's
initiative.''
   It was a reference to the five-point plan put forward by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to try to get a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue under way.
   Hezbollah called for ``underground cells serving as military
units to challenge Satan's schemes and strike at Zionist
interests.''
   It chided peace efforts as examples of ``begging at the gates of
the Knesset and White House.'' The Knesset is Israel's parliament.
   The church leaders trying to visit Beit Sahour also included
representatives of the Greek Catholic sect and the Franciscan
religious order.
   An army officer at the scene, identified only as Colonel D.,
said the army refused to allow a large group of churchmen to enter
because they might cause ``a situation of incitement.''
   He agreed to allow three bishops to go to the town with an army
escort but said their associates and about 15 aides would have to
stay behind. The bishops refused.
   ``They said `God will protect us,' but the commander of the area
responsible for their safety felt it would be unwise,'' said an
army spokesman.
   Roman Catholic Patriarch Michel Sabbah told reporters the
churchmen had hoped to pray in Beit Sahour and meet with the mayor.
   ``They (the soldiers) did not let us do our humanitarian
duties,'' Sabbah complained.
   The religious leaders then went to Bethlehem and prayed for Beit
Sahour at the Church of Nativity, by tradition the site of Christ's
birth. The church bells were rung to show solidarity with the
nearby town.

   The family and friends of Lebanon captive
Terry Anderson celebrated his 42nd birthday today at a ``Mass of
Hope'' where a journalistic colleague said, ``As long as he is a
hostage, we are not free.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has spent five birthdays in captivity since gunmen seized
him on a Beirut street on March 16, 1985.
   But his sister, Peggy Say, said that ceremonies of the kind held
today at Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel have made sure he
has not been forgotten.
   Hope, she said, is the way that she and other families of eight
American hostages in Lebanon have survived their ordeal. ``Hope is
not a way out, it is a way through,'' she said.
   After years of crushed expectations and false alarms, Mrs. Say
said, she still prays every day and night that freedom will come to
here brother.
   ``It is my hope that our hostages will not have suffered for so
long for nothing,'' she said, appealing for peace in the Middle
East.
   Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State
Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria attended
the hour-long mass in the small chapel. Among those attending were
Walter R. Mears, an AP vice president, and Jonathan P. Wolman, AP's
Washington bureau chief.
   The celebrants prayed, listened to psalms and received Communion
at a Mass officiated by the Rev. Lawrence Madden.
   Charles Lewis, Washington bureau chief for Hearst Newspapers,
said other hostages who were in captivity with Anderson recalled
how important his Roman Catholic faith has been to him while
passing the time frequently in a darkened room. Anderson even made
a rosary from fibers in a mat that he sat on, Lewis said.
   Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchorman, implored the Shiite Muslims
who hold Anderson captive to release him. ``No God would sanction
such an act,'' he said, urging the kidnappers to ``reclaim your
place in society.''
   Brokaw said American journalists are among the freest people in
a free society, and all reporters are captive until Anderson is
released.
   Describing Anderson's captivity as ``a special cruelty for a
journalist,'' Brokaw said, ``As long as he is a hostage, we are not
free.''
   Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post,
said all journalists feel an outrage at Anderson's captivity, and
it is way past time the cruel treatment of him and the other
hostages ends.
   Others who took part in the service were former diplomat Bruce
Laingen, once a hostage in Iran; and journalists Peter S. Prichard,
editor of USA Today; Peter Arnett, a CNN correspondent; R.W. Apple,
deputy Washington editor of The New York Times; and David Aikman, a
foreign correspondent for Time magazine.
   A number of relatives of other hostages also attended, including
the family members of Americans Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, Alann
Steen and Robert Pohill and Alec Collett, an Englishman.

   The outgoing U.N. high commissioner for refugees
said Friday he resigned because it was increasingly difficult to do
his job while the target of ``irresponsible'' attacks.
   The resignation of Jean-Pierre Hocke, announced Thursday at the
United Nations in New York, followed allegations he misused a
special U.N. ``educational fund'' to subsidize first-class air
travel for himself.
   Hocke admitted he had flown first class, a right reserved for
the U.N. secretary-general under stringent U.N. austerity measures,
but denied any impropriety. He said he had gone first class on some
long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule.
   A Danish statement said Tuesday the account was opened for use
by Hocke's Danish predecessor, Poul Hartling, and that Hocke showed
a ``lack of judgment'' in believing assurances by a Danish aide
that he also could draw from it to cover travel expenses.
   At Denmark's request, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar ordered that an inquiry into the case be broadened.
   At a news conference after returning to his native Switzerland
from New York, Hocke said his resignation does ``not reflect any
sentiment of culpability on my part.''
   He said he did not feel pressured to resign and decided on his
own to do so.
   Reading a statement, Hocke said ``the function of the high
commissioner requires a total commitment and availability to act,
to convince and to galvanize.''
   That commitment was sapped ``by repeated and irresponsible
attacks'' and ``destructive intentions of some people here and
elsewhere,'' he said without elaborating.
   ``These were the considerations that led to my resignation,
which should not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle of the
storm,'' Hocke added.
   He said the agency will face a ``formidable challenge in the
next few months when refugee protection and assistance will be more
difficult than ever.''
   Asked whether he was the victim of a campaign or realized he had
made mistakes, he said, ``Both.''
   ``I would never claim that I am free from making any mistakes,''
he added.
   Gerald Hinteregger of Austria, head of the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe, was chosen as interim chief of the refugee
agency. The U.N. General Assembly will decide on a successor before
the end of the year. Norway announced Friday it named former
Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg as a candidate for the job.
   Hocke was a former director of operations of the International
Committee of the Red Cross and became the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees in 1986.
   During his tenure, private relief agencies complained that Hocke
was bending to the restrictive national polices of major donor
nations, such as the United States, Japan and West Germany, rather
than speaking out as the protector of refugees worldwide.
   Western nations are adopting more restrictive refugee policies,
accepting only those who can prove they are politically persecuted
and excluding economic refugees.
   Hocke came under particularly strong criticism in January 1988
when he ordered the burning of all 138,000 copies of the agency's
monthly magazine, Refugees, because it contained an article
critical of West Germany's policy. Hocke said the article was
outdated.

   Mosquitoes are the latest scourge to
follow in the wake of Hurricane Hugo, but the Air Force Reserve is
coming to the rescue with an aerial bombardment on the pests this
weekend.
   The Air Force will use C-130 airplanes to swoop down at 150 feet
to douse the first of 10 counties with a pesticide to combat the
burgeoning mosquito population.
   The targeted areas are where high water from the hurricane and
several inches of rain the following week left standing water that
creates a perfect breeding haven for mosquitoes.
   A total of 807,000 acres in the state will be sprayed with the
chemical Dibrom, which Maj. Terry Biery of the U.S. Air Force
Reserve called the safest chemical for the project. The spray kills
living mosquitoes but has no effect on mosquito larvae.
   The swarms of mosquitoes are presenting problems for residents
``and the mosquitoes were so numerous it was hard for some of the
(cleanup) work to be done,'' said Pat Wright, of the state
Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   ``We also had our people out taking what we call landing rate
counts,'' Ms. Wright said. ``It's a warm body who goes out where
mosquitoes are breeding and stands for a minute counting the number
of mosquitoes that land on them.''
   But, she said, most of the reports came back that the mosquitoes
were ``too numerous to count.''
   The spraying that begins this weekend should be completed in
eight to nine days, depending on weather conditions. The $500,000
tab will be picked up by the Federal Emergency Disaster Agency with
Hugo disaster funds.
   It will be an unusual sight because a C-130 airplane, with a
wingspan of 137 feet, seldom flies so close to the ground.
   The colorless, odorless spray poses no danger to humans or pets
although it can kill bees, officials said.
   ``This is one of the safest (chemicals) we could put out at one
of the lowest doses we could put out,'' Biery said.
   After the hurricane struck Sept. 21, the state health department
asked the Centers for Disease Control to check for mosquito-borne
viruses, Ms. Wright said.
   No viruses were found, but local officials reported the mosquito
population was much greater than normal.
   The counties of Berkeley, Dorchester, Georgetown, Sumter,
Clarendon, Williamsburg, Orangeburg, Horry, Colleton and Charleston
will be sprayed, officials said.
   The areas that will be sprayed in Charleston County include
hard-hit Sullivans Island, the Isle of Palms and McClellanville.
   The raid on the mosquitoes will be conducted by crews from the
907th Tactical Air Group, U.S. Air Force Reserve from Rickenbacker
Air National Guard Base in Ohio.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Bill With Big Changes in Bush's Requests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, deliberating less than an hour
Friday, approved an $8.5 billion military construction bill that
makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's request for foreign bases
but adds millions of dollars for domestic installations.
   By voice vote, the Senate adopted legislation that eliminates
money for construction in the Philippines and Honduras while
sweetening the military construction pot in the home states of
ranking members of the appropriations committees.
   The legislation, approved by the House late Thursday, now goes
to the president. The White House has not indicated whether Bush
will sign the bill.
   Overall, the bill includes $4.8 billion for military
construction, $3.2 billion for military family housing and $500
million to begin closing 86 U.S. bases and scaling back five others.
   It cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by $461
million from what was spent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30
and is $65 million below what Bush wanted to spend this year.
   ``I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending
for many years to come,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction,
told his colleagues before the vote. ``It's likely that next year's
military construction budget will be even smaller than the bill we
approved here today.''
   Targeted for elimination was $40.8 million Bush proposed for
dormitories, storage facilities and other construction in the
Philippines, $15 million for airfield improvements in Honduras and
$14.4 million for an aircraft parking extension and other
improvements at U.S. bases in Panama.
   Lawmakers also slashed Bush's request for construction in
Britain from $108 million to $20 million, for work in South Korea
from $86 million to $13.6 million and for work in Italy from $70.8
million to $51.6 million.
   ``Funding for overseas military bases will continue to be a low
priority until our allies substantially improve their contribution
to the common defense and until the results of arms control talks
and base rights agreements are known,'' Sasser said.
   While foreign bases suffered cuts, National Guard, reserves and
military facilities, especially those in Tennessee, North Carolina,
California, Iowa, Mississippi and West Virginia, saw significant
increases.
   The Bush administration requested $87.3 million for an air
station, armories and other construction in Tennessee, Sasser's
home state. Lawmakers approved $109.2 million in the bill.
   In North Carolina, home of Rep. W.G. Hefner, the Democratic
chairman of the House military construction subcommittee, the bill
earmarks $133.8 million for Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune and other
installations. Bush had proposed $108 million for the state.
   In California and Iowa, the home states of the subcommittees'
ranking Republicans, Rep. Bill Lowery of California and Sen.
Charles Grassley of Iowa, lawmakers increased the budget
substantially. Iowa is slated to receive $12.2 million although
Bush proposed only $1.8 million; California spending is $438.5
million over the $427.9 million request.
   West Virginia, home state of Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd,
chairman of the full Senate Appropriations Committee, will get
$21.5 million. The administration sought $4.5 million.
   Mississippi, home state of Rep. Jamie Whitten, the Democratic
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, gets $49.7 million,
while Bush requested only $20 million.

<HEAD>Hugo Depresses Personal Income Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income, dealt a blow by
Hurricane Hugo, rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in September as
consumer spending posted its weakest advance in a year, the
government said Friday.
   The Commerce Department said personal income in September rose
$12.8 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate to $4.47
trillion, the smallest increase in four months.
   Spending increased 0.2 percent, the most anemic gain in 12
months, to an annual rate of $3.53 trillion.
   ``September marks the beginning of the end of the consumer
revival,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``Because
of sluggish income growth and caution in spending, consumers will
hunker down, especially on big-ticket items.''
   Other signs of weakness in the month include a decline of
103,000 manufacturing jobs and a slight drop in orders for
big-ticket durable goods.
   Economists, who this spring were expecting a recession to
develop, were somewhat relieved by a rebound in spending this
summer.
   However, Sinai predicted that consumer spending would shrink
during the October-December quarter, a rare event. That will lead
to sluggish economic growth, as measured by the gross national
product, at an annual rate of less than 1 percent, he said. By the
first half of next year, the nation will topple into a mild
recession, he forecast.
   The government announced earlier this week that the GNP grew a
moderate 2.5 percent in the third quarter, the same as in the
previous three-month period.
   Other economists, however, noted that the September report was
not as bad as it first appeared because consumer spending was held
back by a swing in automobile purchases and incomes were depressed
by one-time losses from Hugo, which struck North Carolina and South
Carolina on Sept. 21.
   ``It's a mixed report, but it wasn't terrible,'' said economist
Michael K. Evans, who heads a consulting firm in Washington.
``Nobody thinks the economy is going to boom. The question is
whether it's heading for a recession. These numbers say `no'.''
   In other economic news, the Treasury Department said the deficit
for fiscal 1989 totaled $152.1 billion, a $3.1 billion improvement
from 1988. Analysts dismissed the decline as negligible, noting
that the deficit has been essentially the same for three years.
   Last month's personal income growth followed an identical 0.3
percent advance in August and a 0.6 increase in July. Spending
posted robust gains of 0.9 percent in August and 0.8 percent a
month earlier.
   The report noted that without the effects of Hugo, incomes would
have risen twice as much, 0.6 percent, in September. The impact
amounted to $13 billion at an annual rate. Most of that came in a
$9 billion drop in rental incomes, which were figured after
deducting uninsured losses from storm damage.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
increased $14.4 billion, compared with a rise of $5.7 billion in
August. The hurricane reduced wages and salaries by about $2
billion at an annual rate.
   On the spending side, the $8.7 billion increase in personal
consumption spending, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, compared with a $33 billion increase in August.
   Purchases of durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, dropped $6.1 billion, while non-durable goods purchases rose
$3.6 billion. Spending on services rose $11.3 billion.
   A swing in new car purchases more than accounted for the
September decline in durable goods and accounted for most of a
$19.4 billion increase in August.
   ``This weakness in consumer spending is the aftermath of the car
promotions this summer,'' said economist Sandra Shaber of the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm. ``Consumer spending is
holding up.''
   The September report showed that Americans' income after taxes
rose only 0.2 percent, down from the 0.3 percent gain in August.
   With income growing at the same rate as after-tax income,
Americans' savings rate held steady at 4.9 percent, the same as in
August but significantly less than the 5.6 percent rate in July.
   Shaber said that if it had not been for the Hugo adjustments to
income, the savings rate would have shot up in September.

   Ed McMahon will share custody of his

spousal support worth $50,000 a month, an attorney said.
   The agreement was reached Thursday in a court hearing, but the
couple's divorce will not be final until at least January 1991
because they agreed to file income taxes jointly this year, said
attorney Robert Kaufman, who represents Victoria McMahon.
   McMahon, Johnny Carson's sidekick on ``The Tonight Show,'' filed
for divorce July 25.
   ``It's a painful situation I'm living through,'' he said. ``I'm

   Ms. McMahon said she was ``very pleased'' with the agreement. Of
the divorce, she said: ``It's unfortunate, but I feel fine.''

   Ford Motor Co. is off the hook in
singer-actress Bette Midler's $10 million lawsuit over a TV car
commercial that used an imitation of her singing voice.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled Thursday there was
insufficient evidence to proceed against Ford, but allowed the
lawsuit to stand against an advertising agency, Young &amp; Rubicam Inc.
   ``We were pleased by the decision and it was a decision we
anticipated based on Ms. Midler's failure to present any evidence

   Miss Midler's lawyers would not comment on the ruling.

   The manufacturer of an inhaler for asthmatics
is recalling the medication after just one month on the market
because of reports of coughing, choking and gagging after use, the
Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
   The drug is a new formula of a commonly prescribed metered dose
inhaler _ alupent.
   The FDA said the medication is being removed from the U.S.
market because there has been a sharp increase in reports of
adverse reactions with the reformulation.
   ``Coughing with a choking or gagging sensation has been the most
commonly reported complaint with the reformulated alupent,'' the
agency said in a statement.
   No deaths or hospitalizations have been reported and experts
have not determined whether the new formula caused the current
problems.
   However, Boehringer Ingelheim, a Connecticut-based company that
is the major supplier of the drug, said it will remove the
reformulation the U.S. market and bring its previous formula back.
   Patients should contact their doctors or pharmacists to
determine if medication they are taking is included in the recall.
   ``In no case should patients discontinue their current asthma
drug treatment unless directed to do so by a physician,'' said FDA
Commissioner Frank E. Young.
   Young said most patients using the reformulation have not
experienced the side effects and ``discontinuing prescribed asthma
therapies could result in life-threatening or fatal asthma
attacks.''

   Canadian news executive Donald F. Hunt has been
named publisher of The Denver Post, succeeding Maurice ``Moe''
Hickey.
   Hunt, 60, a co-founder of The Toronto Sun, was named publisher
on Thursday. He recently was president of MediaNews International
in Toronto, a subsidiary of MediaNews, The Post's parent company.
   ``I'm impressed by Denver,'' said Hunt, adding he will be
involved in community affairs. ``The role of the publisher is to be
involved in the community.''
   Hickey, who had been publisher of the Post since 1987, has
resigned, citing philosophical differences with William Dean
Singleton, chairman of the Denver Post Corp. Hickey has said he
will pursue other opportunities in Colorado.
   Hunt will report to Singleton, who will assume the additional
title of chief executive officer of The Denver Post.
   Hickey became The Post's publisher when MediaNews bought the
newspaper from the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Co.
   Hunt, a native of Canada, began working for the Canadian Press
wire service when he was 17, and later worked as an editor and
reporter for newspapers in Montreal and Toronto. He served as chief
operating officer of The Toronto Sun from its founding in 1971
until 1983.
   When the Sun bought The Houston Post in 1983, Hunt moved to
Texas to serve as publisher. He was still publisher when The
Houston Post was purchased by Singleton in 1987.
   Last year, Hunt left The Houston Post, moving to Toronto to head
a MediaNews effort to buy newspapers in Great Britain.

<TEXT>
   Several House Democrats are asking their
colleagues to stand firm in negotiations with the Senate on a
significant cut in the Strategic Defense Initiative as Congress
moves toward completion of a $305 billion defense bill.
   In a two-page letter to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, sixteen Democratic members of the
House said the spending level for SDI should be $3.28 billion, not
the $3.55 billion congressional negotiators are currently
considering.
   ``It would not be $3.55 billion, a number which credits Senate
posturing by `undistributed reduction' amendments contained in both
the Senate authorization and appropriations bills,'' the lawmakers
said in the letter, which was released Friday.
   ``We should count only SDI authorizations backed by
appropriations, and not based on undistributed reductions,'' they
said.
   House members were referring to Senate action last month on the
defense appropriations bill. Initially, the Senate slashed $900
million from President Bush's request of $4.6 billion for the
proposed anti-missile shield, but two days later, in an attempt to
gain room to manuever in negotiations with the House, the Senate
restored $600 million.
   The House in August approved $2.84 billion for the Pentagon's
share of the program in its authorization bill. The Senate adopted
a total of $4.3 billion in its authorization legislation.
   Currently, House and Senate conferees on the defense bill for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are considering a compromise
total of $3.55 billion for the program popularly known as Star Wars.
   ``Any higher SDI number should be offset elsewhere with
substantial concessions,'' the letter said. ``As (Senate Armed
Services) Chairman Sam Nunn said recently, `SDI is a perishable
commodity and it is going downhill on both sides of Congress. ...
It's a big pot of money ... and the goals are elusive and vague.'''
   Signing the letter were Reps. Charles Bennett of Florida,
Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Ronald Dellums of California, Lane
Evans of Illinois, George Hochbrueckner of New York, Joseph Brennan
of Maine, Jim Olin of Virginia, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Edward
Markey of Massachusetts, Vic Fazio of California, Martin Olav Sabo
of Minnesota, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, Jim Moody of
Wisconsin, Howard Berman of California, Les AuCoin of Oregon and

   A crew of seismologists and geologists
feverishly gathering data on the Oct. 17 earthquake spent little
time giving it a name, and nobody suggested ``The Big One.''
   The 7.1 temblor was named Loma Prieta for a large but relatively
indistinct, flat-topped mountain just three miles from the
epicenter of the rupture. The 3,791-foot high mountain, one of the
largest in the Coastal Range, overlooks the Santa Clara Valley and
is 56 miles south of San Francisco.
   The U.S. Geological Survey almost always names earthquakes for a
geological feature closest to the origin of the first shock,
although there is no policy in place such as the one for naming
hurricanes.
   ``It was a very informal thing done within the first hour,''
said spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson.
   Translated from Spanish, Loma Prieta means ``Dark Hill.''

<HEAD>Deputy Coroner Corrects Report on Rescue of Boy From Collapsed Freeway</HEAD>

CORRECTIVE. It provides more details on rescue of boy, including that the
mother's body was severed the day following the boy's rescue.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A deputy coroner says firefighters who
rescued 6-year-old Julio Berumen from a car in the collapsed
Interstate 880 freeway after last week's earthquake had to cut
through the body of another woman, not his mother's body, to save
the boy's life.
   The Associated Press and other news organizations reported Oct.
19 and subsequently that the body of the boy's mother, Petra
Berumen, was cut by rescue workers to free him. The reports came
from rescue personnel at the scene. But on Thursday, Joseph
Blackwell, a deputy coroner investigator for Alameda County, said
it was the body of a family friend, Yolanda Orozco, who was a
passenger in the car.
   When the quake struck, Julio and his sister, Cathy, 8, were
riding home from the orthodontist with their mother and Orozco. The
Berumens' car was crushed by a concrete pillar when the
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed, trapping dozens
of cars.
   Cathy escaped with head injuries. But Julio was trapped, his
legs pinned in the crumpled car.
   Rescuers used a chainsaw to cut through body of Orozco, allowing
a doctor to reach Julio's right leg and amputate it at the knee to
free him.
   Blackwell said Berumen's body also had to be cut to free it from
the wreckage, and that took place the day after the boy was freed.
   Doctors believe that Julio and his 8-year-old sister, Cathy,
will survive their injuries.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Tampon Absorbency Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
completed regulations to guarantee that tampon absorbency labels
mean the same thing, regardless of what brand you buy.
   ``Today, one brand's `regular' or `super' may designate a much
higher or lower absorbency than the same terms on another brand,''
the agency said in a statement.
   ``In the new system, each term ... will correspond to a specific
range of absorbency, and manufacturers will use a standardized
method to arrive at the absorbency for each type of tampon,'' the
statement said.
   Women use tampons, which are sold in a range of thickness or
absorbencies, instead of sanitary napkins to control menstrual flow.
   Greater tampon absorbency has been associated with toxic shock
syndrome, a rare, but sometimes fatal condition.
   Current tampon labeling requires a warning about the risks of
TSS and tampon use and a list of the symptons of the illness.
   The new labels also must include an explanation of the
absorbency range.
   ``The standardization will permit purchasers to compare brands
and, health officials hope, buy lower absorbency products to reduce
their risk of toxic shock syndrome,'' the FDA added.
   Manufacturers have four months to comply with the new FDA rule.

<HEAD>Western-Style Hotel Stockpiles Light Bulbs, Sugar Before Opening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months' worth of light bulbs have
been stockpiled. So has a month's supply of sugar. Grapes have
begun growing on hothouse vines.
   Before the first Western-managed hotel in the East bloc could
open its doors Friday, owners had to forage across a grim landscape
of perpetual shortages, import the goods it couldn't find and teach
Communist-taught wholesalers about supply and demand.
   They also had to stop the toilet-seat thieves.
   The opening of 520-room Warsaw Marriott marks completion of the
first U.S.-Polish joint venture signed after the 1987 lifting of
U.S. trade sanctions imposed in response to the martial-law
crackdown of 1981.
   It is viewed as a test of the profits and pitfalls awaiting
major Western investors in Eastern Europe.
   Rapid political changes provided a timely break for the
partnership formed by the Washington-based hotelier, the Austrian
ILBAU construction company and the Polish Airlines LOT. A
non-communist government bent on resurrecting the economy has taken
over, and both tourism and business traffic are swiftly growing.
   Marriott managers tried to recreate America in the 41-story
skyscraper, which for the previous eight years had towered
unfinished over Warsaw as an embarrassing symbol of Poland's
economic ruin.
   ``People were sick and tired of seeing this building unfinished.
They felt ashamed,'' said engineering director Jan Zonneveld. ``But
now I think Warsaw residents are pretty happy ... It is a unique
building, the most luxurious.''
   Managers spent about $70 million to put in gleaming marble,
plush carpeting and luxurious decorations seen nowhere else in
Poland.
   They opened the only Italian restaurant in Poland, the only
steakhouse and the first casino, and installed the only computer
controlled air conditioning and heating system and the only hotel
fire sprinkler network.
   To open it, Marriott contractors imported spare parts for carpet
factories, trained waiters to bring the check unasked contrary to
European custom and planted an Italian herb garden in the head
chef's backyard.
   To keep it going, the hotel is girded against scarcity.
   ``No comparison,'' sighed Francois Porte, asked how the
complexities of being the executive food and beverage director in
shortage-plagued Poland compared with his last Marriott assignment:
Amman, Jordon.
   The hotel has 38 walk-in refrigerator-freezers. The storage
rooms keep a month's supply of all dry goods, including coffee,
flour and sugar that cannot be counted on in Poland's
shortage-plagued market. In addition, it has three-months' supply
of light bulbs to keep 52,000 sockets filled.
   A computer monitors supplies and can change menus within a day
in case something runs out.
   ``You go to a hotel restaurant in Poland and say, `Can I have
this,' and they say, `Oh no, we don't have that today, we don't
have this today,''' Porte said. ``I don't want to run into the same
situation.''
   Marriott has agreements with state-run farms and private
greenhouses to grow lettuce, tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables
virtually unavailable during the winter. But it had to supply the
seeds, imported from Holland.
   It has its own canning and freezing plant, provides yeast
supplies to a brewery and sugar to a cola maker, and planted its
own greenhouse grapevines to counter cold-weather fruit supplies.
   ``Meat was a tough problem,'' Porte said. ``No one wanted to
supply us. They said they were already producing whatever they
could produce.''
   Deals finally were struck, but the first day no meat arrived, a
symptom of the business ethic sapped by decades of undersupply and
disregard for captive consumers.
   ``They said simply they didn't have the meat, and we said, `You
promised.' We went back and told them how they could get the meat
and what they could do to supply us,'' Porte said.
   ``We basically are getting involved in their management. We are
not just buying the raw product. We have to be involved in the
production and teaching people how they can supply us,'' he said.
   Room rates are in dollars only _ $135 a night, but the
restaurants deal in zlotys. The prices are high but not out of
sight for better-off Poles, except perhaps for the T-bone steak
imported from the United States offered at 220,000 zlotys (an
average monthly salary), or the equivalent of $29.
   Salaries for the hotel's 1,000 employees are reviewed every
three months to combat the 600 percent inflation rate, and Marriott
went straight to manufacturers to ensure two pairs of shoes for
every waiter and kitchen helper and three suits for each local
manager.
   Although Marriott tries to buy locally produced goods, it still
must order 80 percent to 90 percent of its materials from the West.
That creates a tremendous theft problem, Zonneveld said.
   ``A lot of people are waiting for similar materials, so they
need to be guarded from the moment they get to the airport until
they get to the hotel,'' he said.
   In the first two weeks before the official grand opening, 130
telephones disappeared, along with toilet seats and showerheads.
Guards stopped one television from walking out the front door.
   ``It is understandable,'' Zonneveld said. ``The people are poor
and they are working in an environment where they see a lot of
luxury items available.''

   A baby who was born weighing about 10 ounces,
with feet smaller than her father's thumbs, spent her first night
at home and was ``a little bit tired'' after her big day, her
father said Friday.
   ``We're just real happy to have her home,'' said James Mann,
after his daughter Madeline's homecoming Thursday. Madeline was
born June 27, about three months before her due date, weighing
about 10 ounces.
   ``Normally, the smallest a baby can survive is 500 grams _ about
1 pound 1 ounce,'' said Madeline's doctor, Jonathan Muraskas. ``But
she came out with a little cry and her eyes were open.
   ``Her lungs were immature and she needed a lot of help, but the
best thing is that she developed no ... real significant neonatal
problems.''
   The child, who now weighs 4 pounds, 3 ounces, should become a
``normal, healthy baby,'' said Muraskas. She likely will be normal
size by the time she's 1{ years old, doctors said.
   The family was exhausted after the first night home, Mann said.
   ``She had a rather big day yesterday,'' he said. ``We all did.
But for her, it was one of her biggest. We're all a little bit
tired.''
   ``We are so blessed,'' said Madeline's mother, Robyn Mann, as
they left Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Maywood.
``As long as I'm alive, as long as we're a family, I don't think
I'll ever be able to do anything to deserve this.''
   When delivery-room nurses imprinted Madeline's ink footprint on
the back of her father's hand, it was much smaller than his own
thumb, Mann recalled.
   ``I remember thinking I had never seen anyone so precious, or
small,'' he said.
   Madeline's mother developed a type of hypertension during the
26th week of pregnancy that could have been fatal if she had
carried the baby to term, said Muraskas, a specialist in newborns.
The baby was delivered by Caesarean section.
   Madeline's birth weight of 280 grams, or about 10 ounces, is a
fraction of an ounce less than the baby listed in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the smallest surviving infant.
   ``This size is unheard of,'' said Muraskas. ``But she's never
had any major setbacks. There must be good protoplasm in her
family,'' he joked.

<HEAD>Sheriff Calls for `Goon Squad' Investigation at County Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANFORD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seminole County sheriff ordered an
investigation into reports that guards at the county jail have
formed ``goon squads'' to beat up inmates considered troublemakers.
   ``It really disturbs me, even the thought of a goon squad,''
Sheriff John Polk said.
   The allegations were made by jail workers quoted Friday in The
Orlando Sentinel, which reported that bands of guards have
allegedly punched, kicked and slapped at least five inmates since
June. One was beaten for punching a guard, the newspaper said.
   ``If the statements are true, something will be done,'' Polk
said.
   Jail Director Duane Rutledge said Friday he didn't know of any
goon squads but said his guards are firm with inmates.
   ``We have to be able to work in a safe environment,'' he said.
   Rutledge said he believes the reports are being disseminated by
inmates and corroborated by a few disgruntled employees. The
newspaper said it did not use the names of jail workers it talked
too because they requested anonymity out of fear for their jobs.
   The sheriff appointed Lt. Randy Pittman to investigate the
allegations and asked him to finish the probe by the end of next
week.

<HEAD>Kasparov Beats 15-year-old Soviet Defector</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 15-year-old Gata Kamsky, the match with
world chess champon Garri Kasparov was the peak to a remarkable
year that began with his defection from the Soviet Union.
   For Kasparov, Thursday night's two-game match was just another
exhibition and two routine victories.
   ``I'm world champion. ... He's not even grandmaster,'' Kasparov
said afterward. ``Still, it's different weights, heavyweight boxer
and middleweight.''
   Kamsky was considered one of the Soviet Union's more promising
players when he and his father defected in March. He topped a field
of 15 American players, including 12 grandmasters, to earn the
right to challenge Kasparov.
   The political undercurrent helped attract 300 spectators to the
Maxwell MacMillan World Chess Challenge at the New York Public
Library. Kamsky played with a small American flag on his side of
the table.
   The teen-age challenger said he was distracted because he was
thinking of his stepmother, Bella, who he said is being held in the
Soviet Union against her will.
   ``I didn't know I would play until one day ago and I didn't
prepare right,'' Kamsky said. ``I keep in my mind my stepmother. So
it was not good for me right now. I didn't do my best.''
   Kasparov stayed away from the immigration issue.
   ``I play chess. He was my opponent,'' Kasparov replied when
asked if such matches can further thaw political relations between
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   ``I had to beat him and I had nothing else in my mind. If it
helps relations, OK,'' said the world champion, who last weekend
twice defeated the world's strongest chess computer program, Deep
Thought.
   It took Kasparov less than a half-hour and 51 moves to win the
first game against Kamsky; the second lasted 109 moves.
   Kasparov, 26, of the Soviet city of Baku, in Azerbaijan, is a
former prodigy himself. He became a grandmaster 10 years ago and
won the world championship in 1985.
   Kamsky and his father, Rustem, defected from the Soviet Union in
March while attending a chess tournament in New York.
   The two had scheduled a news conference before the Thursday
chess match to demand the release of Mrs. Kamsky. But the senior
Kamsky said that Kasparov would not have played if they had held
the news conference.
   The match marked the first time since 1907 that a reigning world
chess champion played a head-to-head match on U.S. soil. Kasparov
played the computer via telephone lines.
   Grant McCrea, of the Special Committee for Chess in America,
said the first match between Kasparov and Kamsky reminded him of
Kasparov's handy victory over Deep Thought.
   ``I don't think Gata is used to this kind of pressure. He can
put up a better fight than he did. We saw that earlier this week,''
McCrea said.

<HEAD>Watkins Shakes up Leadership of Nuclear Weapons Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, citing
concern over the stalled nomination of Victor Stello to head
nuclear arms production, has put a close aide temporarily in charge
of the weapons office, according to an internal memorandum obtained
Friday.
   In the memo dated Oct. 25, Watkins told Under Secretary John
Tuck, the No. 3 department official, to immediately take over as
acting assistant secretary for defense programs.
   ``... The vital national security mission of the department can
no longer be carried out under the current management
arrangement,'' Watkins wrote in the memo.
   Stello was nominated for the job July 24, but the Senate has not
even scheduled a confirmation hearing. Many environmental groups
and some prominent members of Congress are strongly opposed to
Stello, contending he is weak on nuclear safety.
   Watkins has publicly defended Stello, and in the memo he said,
``It is my hope that the nomination will be acted upon
expeditiously.'' He did not elaborate, except to say the stalled
nomination was creating a serious leadership vacuum.
   In the memo, Watkins said John L. Meinhardt, who took the post
of acting assistant secretary for defense programs earlier this
year, had told him changes were needed.
   ``I concur in his assessment that Defense Programs has operated
far too long without the leadership and direction that can only
evolve from a duly appointed and confirmed Assistant Secretary,''
Watkins wrote.
   Watkins told Tuck he would take on the additional title of
acting assistant secretary ``for the time being pending
confirmation of the President's nominee to this important post.''
   No mention was made of what job, if any, Meinhardt would take.
   An aide to Meinhardt said he was not immediately available for
comment. Spokesmen for Watkins did not return a reporter's phone
calls.
   The weapons office is in charge of a government complex of 17
major nuclear facilities in 12 states that develop, build and test
nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.
   Stello has worked as a special assistant to Watkins on planning
for the restart of idled reactors at the Savannah River nuclear
weapons complex since July. He came to the department from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where he was chief of staff.
   Greenpeace U.S.A., which has headed a national campaign to block
Stello's nomination, applauded Watkins' decision to put Tuck
temporarily in charge of the weapons program.
   ``We take this as a tacit admission by the DOE of serious
problems with Stello's nomination,'' said Stephen Schwartz, a
Greenpeace spokesman in Washington.
   Greenpeace sent a letter Friday to President Bush urging
withdrawal of the Stello nomination.
   ``There is absolutely no question that the urgent tasks facing
the DOE at its nuclear weapons production facilities demand an
individual of exceptional integrity and ability. Victor Stello is
not that individual,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>FBI Probe Finds No Evidence Devise Used to Trigger Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI said Friday its laboratory studies of
the USS Iowa disaster found no evidence that any device was
deliberately used to detonate the blast that killed 47 sailors.
   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' FBI spokesman
Mike Kortan said.
   ``That's not to say something wasn't there. Our findings were
inconclusive,'' he said.
   But the chairman of the House Armed Services investigations
subcommittee said he reads the FBI's laboratory report as
undermining the Navy's findings of evidence suggesting a detonating
device caused the blast.
   ``The FBI's lab report has been described as inconclusive,''
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., said in a letter. ``I do not see
it that way.''
   ``It clearly says that they did not find elements that the Navy
technicians said they found,'' Mavroules wrote in a letter to Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
   Oakar had requested an investigation of the Navy's findings that
a former constituent, Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, was most
likely responsible for detonating the blast.
   Mavroules assured Oakar that his subcommittee staff would
``aggressively pursue'' its investigation of the Navy's findings.
   ``I seriously question the conclusion that it was a wrongful
intentional act; even if so, is there adequate evidence linking
Clayton Hartwig to the cause of the explosion?'' Mavroules wrote.
   ``We are also looking at the quality of the NIS investigation
and, more disturbing, why was a report released before all
investigative efforts were concluded,'' Mavroules wrote.
   Also on Capitol Hill, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said he has asked the General
Accounting Office ``to inquire more thoroughly into the adequacy of
the investigative effort and to validate the conclusions of the
investigation.''
   In a letter to Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who heads
the GAO, Nunn repeated his plans to hold hearings on the Navy's
investigation of the Iowa blast after the Senate and House complete
work on the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill.
   Nunn said he was concerned ``with certain issues which arose
during the Navy's investigation, but which were not pursued since
they were not considered to be immediately relevant to the specific
task at hand.''
   Specifically, the senator cited the cause of the April 19
explosion once equipment malfunction and accident had been ruled
out.
   The Navy, meanwhile, continued to defend its finding that a
chemically ignited explosive device ``most probably'' was placed in
the breech of one of the battleship's 16-inch guns to detonate the
blast, which killed 47 sailors April 19.
   The Navy ``is convinced that foreign material'' was found in a
band of the projectile of the gun, said Cmdr. Mark Baker, a Navy
spokesman.
   ``We are confident about the sophistication of our equipment and
the expertise of our technical personnel'' that conducted thousands
of tests, Baker said.
   The FBI's tests were conducted as a result of a request from the
Navy to conduct a metallurgical analysis of residue found in the
gun and on the barrel of the projectile, Kortan said.
   The bureau was asked by the Navy to conduct ``an independent
examination of the materials they gave us in an attempt to
determine if there was some evidence of a device.'''
   ``We looked at them and we can't draw that conclusion,'' Kortan
said. ``What they did in their own testing proceure, it is not
appropriate to comment on.''
   Mavroules questioned the Navy's theories about Hartwig and why
it focused its investigation almost entirely on him.
   The Navy concluded that Hartwig, who died in the blast, had been
upset about the breakup of a friendship with another sailor.
   There had been reports, based on unidentified sources, that Navy
investigators theorized that Hartwig was distraught over rejection
of homosexual advances.
   Mavroules said ``I am not sure what the issue of homosexuality
has to do with the matter at hand'' even though the Navy's central
lines of inquiry focused on allegations of Hartwig's homosexuality,
alleged suicidal tendances and knowledge of explosives.
   ``Only a handful of individuals of the hundreds interviewed
avowed any knowledge of Hartwig's homosexuality,'' Mavroules wrote.
``No on had any firsthand knowledge.''

   The Tampa City Council voted 4-2 not to amend
the city's human rights ordinance to protect homosexuals from
discrimination in employment, public accommodations and housing.
   The decision, which followed a volatile 90-minute hearing
Thursday night, was the second defeat for gays in the Tampa Bay
area this month. Two weeks ago, the Hillsborough County Commission
turned down a similar gay rights amendment.
   ``This isn't going away,'' said Keith Roberts, spokesman for the
Bay Area Human Rights Coalition. ``We know time is on our side, and
the trend of social progress is on our side.''
   In Thursday's roll call, council member Linda Saul-Sena, who
along with Larry Smith voted for the amendment, said the measure
was a ``challenge to the council to do what's right and fair and
just.''
   But council member Eddie Caballero said the council should not
protect people ``who have chosen a certain way of life.''
   Council member Perry Harvey abstained from the voting but said
that, as a black man, he could not see voting against the amendment
because any discrimination is wrong.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun on
Friday issued what he termed the ``last call'' for Christian
legislators to return home to discuss a peace plan and said he
might dissolve Parliament if they don't.
   Aoun also indicated he might dissolve Parliament to block the
election of a president, which the plan mandates.
   His statements coincided with brief skirmishing between Aoun's
troops and Syrian-backed Druse militiamen in Souk el-Gharb,
southeast of Beirut. Police reported no casualties.
   Aoun, in a speech to supporters at his shell-shattered palace in
suburban Baabda, accused the Christian lawmakers of reckless
behavior and said, ``If they persist in this behavior, the
government will use its powers.''
   He said his Cabinet has ``many choices _ one of them is
dissolving Parliament.''
   The general, who heads a three-man Christian military Cabinet in
Lebanon's splintered government, apparently still hopes to scuttle
the peace plan reached by Lebanese legislators in the Saudi Arabian
resort of Taif on Sunday.
   Aoun rejected the plan because it did not include a deadline for
the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Christian legislators
do not want to return to Lebanon because they fear Aoun will have
them arrested.
   The accord, sponsored by the Arab League, calls for Parliament
to meet in Lebanon no later than Nov. 7 to ratify reforms that
would give more political power to Moslems and clear the way for
election of a president.
   The plan must be ratified by a Parliament session in Lebanon to
take effect.
   Aoun said at a news conference later that it would be
``illogical'' to try to elect a president in so short a period of
time.
   Asked whether he would block election by dissolving Parliament,
Aoun said, ``That's an alternative among others.''
   Moslems have accused Aoun of trying to prevent presidential
elections so he can remain at the helm in Lebanon's 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, 1988,
when President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended and Parliament
was unable to agree on a successor.
   Gemayel named Aoun head of an interim military Cabinet to rule
pending election of a new head of state, but the Cabinet split
after Moslems pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss.
   Aoun claims that most Lebanese support him and said of the 33
Christian lawmakers who voted for the plan: ``Maybe when they
return from Saudi Arabia, they will not be able to face their
supporters because they have betrayed everybody. So I will have to
protect them by assigning bodyguards for them.''
   He said the legislators are ``under obligation'' to return to
Lebanon to persuade their constituents to accept the plan.
   ``If they manage to convince you, I'll call you to follow them
and I'll follow them too. But if they don't, then they will have to
call off the Taif operation,'' he said.
   His remarks contrasted with a statement Thursday in which he
also urged the lawmakers to return for talks but made no threats.
   A Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
general ``apparently upgraded his attacks again after realizing
that the legislators were not going to listen to him.''
   Also Friday, Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi held talks in
Christian east Beirut with Aoun and Danny Chamoun, commander of the
right-wing National Liberal Party.
   He later crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line into west Beirut
for talks with Moslem leaders.

<HEAD>Foreign Businesses to Enjoy Devalued Ruble for Some Expenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign businesses in Moscow will reap the
benefits of a drastically devalued ruble, a State Bank official
said Friday, meaning they can pay staff and some other bills with
cheaper rubles.
   The Soviet Union on Wednesday announced a devaluation of the
ruble from $1.59 to 16 cents for foreign and Soviet travelers' cash
exchanges starting Nov. 1. The higher rate will remain on
commercial transactions.
   Foreign businessmen living in the Soviet Union also will receive
the more favorable rate when changing cash, said Valery Pekshev,
deputy chairman of the State Bank.
   Asked at a news conference if businesses could use those funds
to pay their Soviet staff, Pekshev said, ``If you have withdrawn
cash from your foreign currency account, you have the right to
exchange your currency, and nobody's going to control how you spend
it.''
   However, the change will have limited effect, because the Soviet
government requires foreigners to use hard currency in paying many
of their expenses, including rent and office telephone bills. Most
Soviets working for foreigners also receive part of their salary in
foreign currency.
   Pekshev said the ruble is being devalued because the official
rate of $1.59 per ruble ``was not realistic.'' He also cited a need
to undercut the black market, where tourists could receive up to 20
times as many rubles for their convertible currency as in state
bank outlets.
   Foreign travelers' largest expenses for hotels and
transportation must be paid in foreign currency to Intourist, the
state tourist agency. But Pekshev said visitors may see a break
here as well.
   ``Intourist will take the new exchange rate into account'' when
negotiating new contracts with tour companies, he said.
   Pekshev said the devaluation had been contemplated in summer but
authorities did not want to disrupt the tourist season.
   The limit on the amount of currency Soviet citizens may exchange
when traveling abroad will be raised so they will continue to
receive about $300 each, Pekshev said. But they will have to pay 10
times as many rubles for that same small cache of spending money.
   This will reduce the number of Soviets traveling simply to buy
coveted Western goods in short supply at home, Pekshev said. Many
Soviets have been able to pay for their trips by bringing home such
highly profitable items as a $2,000 computer and selling it for
50,000 rubles.
   ``We used to give them $318 for 200 rubles, and they would make
4,000 to 5,000 rubles off it,'' he told the labor newspaper Trud.
``If the state takes not 200 rubles from them, but 2,000, it will
be only fair.''
   Although the ruble is still many years from becoming fully
convertible, Pekshev said other adjustments are being made. Soviet
exporters are due to receive a ruble bonus on their foreign
currency earnings starting Jan. 1.
   In addition, a foreign currency auction among Soviet enterprises
is underway. Companies submitted closed bids to the Vnesheconombank
to buy or sell their foreign currency, and next week officials
expect to match them up.
   Gennady Mazonov, a senior researcher in the Institute of World
Social System Economics specializing in ruble convertibility, said
the devaluation was ``a happy, unexpected surprise,'' but said it
should have gone as far as 10 cents to the ruble, to compete with
black market rates.
   As it is, he noted, Soviet tourists will still need more than
$300 each to travel abroad, and ``there will be no effect on the
unsatisfied hunger for foreign currency.''

<HEAD>Israelis See Leak as U.S. Pressure to Accept Baker Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday that
reports of Israeli nuclear cooperation with South Africa were
designed to ``tear the fabric'' of Israel's relations with the
United States.
   Analysts and media reports viewed the leaks as a form of
pressure on Shamir to accept U.S. peace proposals before he visits
Washington in mid-November.
   They also said the reports could affect talks on economic and
military aid for Israel, which totaled $3 billion this year, and
block Israeli requests for supercomputers that could be used to
develop ballistic missiles.
   NBC News reported that Israel provided South Africa with missile
technology in exchange for a steady supply of uranium and use of a
South African missile test range. Israel has denied it.
   In an interview Friday with Israel's Arabic TV program, Shamir
said he believed ``the aim was to tear the fabric of Israeli-U.S.
relations, but I don't think it will harm them.''
   He said Israel was trying to bridge differences with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III about plans for Palestinian-Israeli
talks.
   Yossi Ahimier, the prime minister's spokesman, said the aim of
reports about ties to South Africa was to whip up ``anti-Israeli
public opinion.''
   ``Someone is trying to depict Israel as an enemy of peace or a
negative factor in the region,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Housing Minister David Levy of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
said such pressure contradicted U.S. assurances that Washington
would not ``turn its back or impose on Israel something that is
against the government's interest.''
   ``Should Israel raise its hands and give over its policy on such
a sensitive issue concerning its existence?'' he said on army
radio. ``On no account should it.''
   Dore Gold, a specialist in U.S.-Israeli relations at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said the reports
resulted from increased tensions between Israel and the United
States.
   ``Usually, at a time of tension, past U.S. administrations have
tried to lower Israel's moral credibility in Washington,'' he said.
   In addition to disagreements over the Baker plan, Gold said,
Israel is at odds with the Bush Administration over the sale of M-1
tanks to Saudi Arabia.
   Questioning the veracity of the NBC report, Gold said a joint
project was ``not very sensible'' because Israel did not need an
intercontinental ballistic missile and the main threats to South
Africa were from countries with 1950s and 1960s arms technology.
   Harry Wall, director for Israel of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, said the result was more likely to be a rallying of
Israelis around Shamir than support for U.S. peace proposals.
   ``I think it is more than coincidental that this report was
aired at such a sensitive time,'' he said. ``If this was a leak
intended to soften Israel, I doubt that it will work. The last
thing this government needs to break the impasse is additional U.S.
pressure.''
   A Defense Ministry statement issued Friday denied as ``lacking
all truth'' another NBC report that Israel transferred technology
from the U.S.-financed Lavi fighter plane project to South Africa
after the program was canceled.
   It said Israel had not transferred U.S. technology or systems
with U.S. components to South Africa or any other country.
   Phil Herman, a spokesman for Israel Aircraft Industries, which
made the Lavi prototypes, said he did not know whether Lavi
technicians went to work in South Africa.
   He declined comment on technology transfers, except to say
``there are certain avionics that are on the open market for
approved customers.''
   Israeli officials denounced as ``lies'' the NBC report that
Israel was helping South Africa develop a long-range missile that
was test-fired last summer.
   They said Israel had adopted a policy in 1987 not to sign new
defense agreements with South Africa, in response to a
congressional dewcision to suspend aid to any nation selling arms
to that country.

<HEAD>Deputy Coroner Corrects Report on Rescue of Boy From Collapsed Freeway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deputy coroner says firefighters who
rescued 6-year-old Julio Berumen from a car in the collapsed
Interstate 880 freeway after last week's earthquake had to cut
through the body of another woman, not his mother's body, to save
the boy's life.
   The Associated Press and other news organizations reported Oct.
19 and subsequently that the body of the boy's mother, Petra
Berumen, was cut by rescue workers to free him. The reports came
from rescue personnel at the scene. But on Thursday, Joseph
Blackwell, a deputy coroner investigator for Alameda County, said
it was the body of a family friend, Yolanda Orozco, who was a
passenger in the car.
   When the quake struck, Julio and his sister, Cathy, 8, were
riding home from the orthodontist with their mother and Orozco. The
Berumens' car was crushed by a concrete pillar when the
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed, trapping dozens
of cars.
   Cathy escaped with head injuries. But Julio was trapped, his
legs pinned in the crumpled car.
   Rescuers used a chainsaw to cut through body of Orozco, allowing
a doctor to reach Julio's right leg and amputate it at the knee to
free him.
   Blackwell said Berumen's body also had to be cut to free it from
the wreckage, and that took place the day after the boy was freed.
   Doctors believe that Julio and his sister will survive their
injuries.

<TEXT>
   Terry A. Anderson, a journalist who was
37 years old when pro-Iranian kidnappers shoved him into a car and
sped away, became 42 on Friday _ still in captivity, still with no
prospect of freedom.
   Staff members of the Associated Press bureau in Beirut, where
Anderson was chief Middle East correspondent, held a sad but
resolute birthday party, as they do each year.
   Lebanese newspapers published letters to him from family,
friends and colleagues. Television stations broadcast a videotape
of his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, born three months after he was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The three-minute tape showed Sulome singing ``Happy birthday to
Daddy,'' blowing out candles on a birthday cake and reading a
letter she wrote telling the father she has never seen that she
loves him.
   Likewise in the AP office, staffers sang to their boss, ``Happy
Birthday, dear Terry!'' Thirty journalists invited for the occasion
joined in.
   The party, complete with a cake and candles, was held in
Anderson's office, which his colleagues call ``Terry's room.''
   It remains as he left it, as if he might walk in at any time,
except for one wall covered with the 14 photographs of Anderson
released by Islamic Jihad, the group that holds him, and a few of
Sulome.
   A small color photograph of his elder daughter, Gabriel, playing
with her dog rests on his metal desk. She was 10 when her father
was abducted.
   The Arabic-language An-Nahar and As-Safir and the
French-language L'Orient Le Jour published the letters to Anderson
in English, in hopes his captors would allow him to read them.
Released hostages say Anderson _ the longest-held of the 18 Western
hostages in Lebanon _ has been given occasional access to
newspapers and television.
   ``In honor of your birthday on Friday, we will be in Washington
with other hostage families to mark another sad year in which you
have been denied your freedom,'' his sister, Peggy Say, wrote to
him.
   ``We do our very best for you, Terry, but we come together on
another birthday with feelings of frustration and defeat.
   ``We simply don't know what to do anymore. Our ceremony in
Washington is called a Mass of Hope, and we will all pray together
that a solution will be found soon to end the terrible ordeal.''
   She told her younger brother: ``A resolution has been passed by
the House and Senate, making October 27 National Hostage Awarness
day. Church bells will toll all over the United States at noon on
that day, a message of caring and spiritual support.''
   Mrs. Say assured Anderson he has not been ``abandoned or
forgotten.''
   ``Thousands still pray for you every day and your family and
friends continue to work for your freedom,'' she wrote.
   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson said: ``Please
believe that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray
for you. We realize that a simple wish of happy birthday today is
painfully inadequate.
   ``On this day, we and millions of Americans are joining together
to believe that your next birthday, your 43rd, will be celebrated
in the light and the love of your family and friends.
   ``As always, our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we wish
you and the others Godspeed home.''
   From the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, to which Anderson
belonged in 1979-81, came a 33-foot birthday scroll signed by 59
journalists, including former colleagues in Tokyo.
   On Thursday, the club's press freedom committee issued a
statement saying it had sent a message to President Bush, President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and leaders of Lebanon, Syria and the
Palestine Liberation Organization requesting greater efforts to get
him released.
   ``The international press community in Japan is particularly
saddened and concerned that the nightmare continues daily for our
colleague, a respected and conscientious journalist,'' the message
said.
   ``We appeal to you to accelerate and intensify negotiations to
free Terry and other hostages being held in Lebanon.''

<HEAD>Bulgaria Says Police Brutality Against Activists `Regrettable'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Bulgarian official expressed regret
Friday after police kicked and beat environmentalists who had
gathered in a Sofia park to collect petition signatures, diplomatic
sources said.
   The clash came during a 35-nation environmental conference being
held in Sofia. Western delegations attending the conference
severely criticized police behavior.
   Nikolai Dyulgerov, who heads the Bulgarian delegation to the
environment meeting, said the incident was ``regrettable,'' the
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``In carrying out the forcible measures due to the provocative
behavior of the citizens, public authorities allowed themselves
measures that went beyond their prerogatives,'' Dyulgerov said,
reading a government statement to the delegates, the diplomatic
sources said.
   On Thursday, several dozen members of the group Eco-Glasnost
gathered in a downtown park in the Bulgarian capital to collect
signatures on petitions opposing construction of a hydroelectric
plant in Bulgaria's Rila Mountains.
   Police arrived and began rounding up the activists and putting
them on buses, beating and kicking some of them, the diplomatic
sources said, quoting witnesses.
   They were subsequently dropped off at another park on the
outskirts of town, the sources said. The activist group had been
meeting in the other park since the environmental conference began
on Oct. 16.
   The government said 22 people had been rounded up, but the
diplomatic sources quoted witnesses as saying that 30 to 40 were
detained.
   Dyulgerov reportedly said security officials could have been
more ``restrained, patient and tactful.''
   The conference includes nations that signed the 1975 Helsinki
accords on security, human rights and other European issues. The
environment meeting is one of several follow-up conferences.

   Here is a text of the remarks of Peggy Say,
sister of Terry Anderson, at a ceremony Friday marking the 42nd
birthday of the Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent
who has been held captive in Lebanon since March 1985:
   Once again, I have to grope for words to tell Carmela LaSpada
how deeply grateful I am for No Greater Love's sponsoring of yet
another ceremony on behalf of Terry Anderson and the other
hostages. This is the 20th such ceremony and without Carmela's
devotion and dedication to our cause, I'm afraid the hostage issue
would have been forgotten long ago. Carmela, for Terry and the
other hostages, their families and friends, I thank you.
   To all of you who are participating, and those attending this
ceremony _ bless you. Terry's friends, my friends, members of the
JCTFTA (Journalists Committee to Free Terry Anderson), my AP
family, relatives _ especially my husband David _ and hostage
family members, you are my strength, and without your support, year
after frustrating year, I could not go on.
   I know that each of you shares my pain as we gather here today
to mark Terry's 42nd birthday _ his fifth in captivity _ and to
take part in this Mass of hope.
   I felt it was touchingly appropriate when Carmela christened
this particular ceremony a ``Mass of hope.'' I feel that hope is
the common thread that binds us all together. Our capacity for hope
is remarkable after enduring months and years of this terrible
ordeal.
   I have a plaque in my home that reads, ``Hope is not a way out,
it is a way through.'' It is indeed. It is that hope that motivates
us to approach every ceremony in the belief that it will be the
last. It is hope that compels Carmela to keep her plans for a
``Welcome Home'' party always at the ready.
   Despite years of crushed expectations, false signs and broken
dreams, who among us is not ready to believe that today could be
the day our miracle happens? Whose heart does not flutter when the
telephone rings at odd hours, hoping that this will be THE call,
the one that brings our moment of joy? Hope is our willingness to
believe, against desperate odds, that we will soon board a plane to
Wiesbaden for a reunion with our loved ones.
   Hope is what urges us to plan every day as if we might need to
leave in haste. No long-term projects, no clothing long
unlaundered, no suitcase far from reach. Hope is what sustains us
all, especially those who must live in defiance of chains that bind
them and cloths that blind them.
   It is far easier for us, their families and friends, to maintain
hope _ we have one another _ but for these remarkable men to live
with hope in the face of such desperate conditions is a testament
to their courage, their faith, and the dignity with which they
exist.
   It is with hope that I pray every day, every night, that
something positive will emerge from the rubble and chaos we call
Lebanon. That the hearts of their captors will be softened and our
innocent men will be reunited with their families. I live with the
hope that the release of our hostages will in some way play a role
in the healing of deep wounds between our Arab brothers and
ourselves.
   It is my deepest hope that our hostages will not have suffered
so much for so long, in vain, and for nothing. I hope to see, in my
lifetime, and for my children and my grandchildren, a time of peace
and reconciliation among all countries of the world, for then, with
the psalmists, we will see that ``Kindness and truth shall meet.
Justice and peace shall kiss. Truth shall spring out of the earth,
and justice shall look down from heaven.''
   I pray for our hostages and for us all that we never lose our
capacity for hope, that ability to believe in the potential promise
of each new day. Some day, soon, please God, our miracle WILL
happen. Until then, we will live as we always have, in faith and
hope. Thank you and God bless you all.

<HEAD>Federal Deficit Totals $152.1 Billion in 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit totaled $152.1
billion in 1989, marking the third year of essentially unchanged
fiscal red ink, the government said Friday.
   For the first time, interest on the $2.8 trillion national debt
exceeded Social Security spending, pushing the interest category
into second place, behind military expenditures.
   The budget gap for the year ending Sept. 30 marked a $3.1
billion, or 2 percent, improvement over the $155.2 billion deficit
in 1988, the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and
Budget said in a joint announcement.
   But, it was still more than the 1987 deficit of $149.7 billion.
All three years are well under the record high of $221.1 billion in
1986.
   Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters he was ``not
satisified'' with the deficit, but said, ``The good news is that
the deficits are not heading up.''
   Private economists, however, dismissed the small improvement,
and predicted a rising tide of red ink in 1990.
   They noted that the deficit was nearly $10 billion smaller
simply because the government failed in a last-minute rush to
complete five large savings and loan rescues.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency created to bail out the
S&amp;L industry, spent $9.1 billion by Sept. 30 instead of the $18.8
billion anticipated. The $9.7 billion difference will add to the
deficit in 1990.
   ``The promises that have come out of Washington about budget
balancing have been unfulfilled,'' said economist William V.
Sullivan Jr. of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``We see virtually no progress on the budgetary front and doubt
the government can print $150 billion deficits for the indefinite
future without some sort of adverse consequences for this
economy,'' he warned.
   In August, the Bush administration projected a 1990 deficit of
$116.2 billion. Automatic spending cuts ordered under the
Gramm-Rudman law would reduce that to $100 billion, but the
administration and Congress could avoid the automatic cuts by
agreeing to a spending package with an official budget gap of $110
billion.
   However, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting a
substantially higher deficit of $140 billion and private analysts
say even that's optimistic.
   ``I think Gramm-Rudman is just a fiction. I would say the
deficit this coming year is going to be ... at least $160 billion,
possibly as much as $175 billion,'' said Michael K. Evans, an
economic consultant in Washington.
   He said weak economic growth in 1990 will cut into corporate
income tax payments, which totaled $103.3 billion in 1989. That was
up from $94.2 billion in 1988. However, corporations paid $19.4
billion in income taxes in September, down from $20.6 billion in
June, the previous month in which quarterly payments were due.
   Also, Sullivan said the 1989 deficit was held down by a
one-time, approximately $15 billion surge in personal income tax
payments in April for the 1988 tax year. He said taxpayers deferred
income from 1987 to 1988 to take advantage of a decline in tax
rates provided by the 1986 tax overhaul.
   Evans said interest payments will continue to be a growing
burden on the government.
   ``If you take interest payments out, the deficit pretty much
vanishes. We have spending pretty much under control now, but we
have to pay for the fact that earlier it wasn't under control,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers Affirm Non-Interference Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seven East bloc foreign ministers
affirmed a policy of not interferring in the affairs of each
other's nations as they ended the first Warsaw Pact meeting led by
Poland's Solidarity government.
   The two-day meeting's final communique also urged speeding up
disarmament of conventional, chemical and short-range nuclear
weapons and stressed the inviolability of European borders.
   But no direct mention was made of the touchy area of economic
relations within the East bloc or the problems of East Germany,
where an exodus of citizens and mass protests this month led the
ruling Communists to replace aging leader Erich Honecker.
   ``As much as the situation is undefined, conditions are
ripening'' for a breakthrough that would overcome the division of
Europe and ``definitely eliminate the relics of the Cold War,'' the
communique said.
   Essential is ``the right of every nation to independent decision
making about its ... road to social, political and economic
development, without outside interference,'' it said.
   The foreign ministers met in closed sessions. Their debates were
filled with controversy but no open antagonisms, Foreign Ministry
official Boleslaw Kulski of Poland said at a news conference.
   Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, as well as East Germany to
a lesser extent, are experimenting with radical reforms, but the
remaining Warsaw Pact nations _ Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania _ have resisted change.
   Kulski said some sensitive topics, such as Romania's call only
two months ago for Warsaw Pact action to prevent formation of
Poland's Solidarity-led government, were not even brought up.
   ``No one considered it advisable or desirable to raise this
issue during the meeting,'' he said.
   Although differences surfaced, Kulski said, ``I want to
emphasize that there was no case when the differences led to
antagonizing of the participants, and they never took a form that
would be improper for this friendly meeting.''
   The main sensitive area was economic relations within the East
bloc, he said.
   The nations that are reforming their economies want to put trade
relations on a market basis, using convertible currencies and
allowing economic relations directly between enterprises instead of
only between governments.
   Such changes leave non-reforming countries increasingly isolated
within the East bloc, undermining their access to imports and raw
materials from other Warsaw Pact nations or markets for the goods
they produce.
   Solidarity took control of Poland's government on Aug. 24,
becoming the first non-Communist government since the East bloc
came in existence following the end of World War II.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity
activist and former political prisoner, used the meeting to
reassure alliance members that Poland will respect its East bloc
military and economic commitments and that democracy in Poland does
not threaten the security of its neighbors.
   He also called for ``radically'' restructuring Comecon, the
organization that coordinates economic relations among the seven
pact countries, to make it more market-oriented and stressed the
need to respect the internal sovereignty of pact nations.
   ``The changes that are going on in Poland now lead to
normalizing the internal situation, and thus indirectly to
stability of European relations,'' Mazowiecki said.
   ``Poland is true to her commitments as an ally and fulfills her
duties stemming from this.''

<HEAD>U.S. to Expedite Applications from Soviet Jews</HEAD>

   Immigration applications from Soviet Jews who for
years have been refused exit visas by Soviet officials will be
given special consideration by the U.S. Embassy, Jewish activists
said Friday.
   The plan is to give those Soviet Jews priority over the
thousands of other Soviet citizens now seeking to emigrate to
America and swamping the U.S. Embassy, according to the activists.
   They said the arrangement to help the Soviet Jews, known as
refuseniks because of the Kremlin's refusal to grant them exit
visas, was organized during a visit by a delegation from the Union
of Councils for Soviet Jews.
   The 75-member delegation, representing groups in the the United
States, Israel and Europe, came to the Soviet Union to meet with
the refuseniks and local Jewish organizations.
   They were allowed to come only after they agreed on terminology
making it clear the trip was unofficial, Michah Naftalin, the
organization's U.S. national director, told a news conference.
   Under new American regulations that went into effect Oct. 1
because of the crush of applicants at the U.S. Embassy,
applications are sent directly to Washington for evaluation rather
than being processed by the U.S. Embassy.
   Embassy officials said they expect to receive 300,000
applications next year. The United States, under ceilings set in
Washington, will then accept 50,000 Soviet applicants and another
20,000-30,000 people on a so-called parole system that does not
guarantee government support.
   Soviet Jewish activists fear that if and when exit visas are
issued to longtime refuseniks, who they say number about 100, their
applications to enter the United States will be lost in the flood
of paperwork.
   According to the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee on
Migration, 7,469 Jews left the Soviet Union in September, the
largest outflow since the organization began monthly counts in 1979.
   Leonid Stonov, a Soviet Jew and chairman of the Moscow Refusenik
Legal Seminar, said a group has been organized to work with embassy
officials to make certain Washington is informed when a refusenik
is granted an exit visa by the Soviets.
   He said the operation should be in place in about two weeks.
   Most of the refuseniks have been denied permission to leave on
grounds they have knowledge of state or military secrets from
former jobs. In most cases Soviet officials put a five-year freeze
on exit visas for people believed to have had access to secrets but
the freeze has been for decades in some cases.
   During their 10-day stay in the Soviet Union, the Union of
Council delegates met with human rights leaders in Moscow and
Leningrad.
   They held seminars and meetings to discuss anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union, the plight of refuseniks, proposed emigration reforms
and plans to establish independent organizations to foster Jewish
culture in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Jane Pauley Leaves `Today,' but Stays with NBC</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Pauley became a ready-for-prime-time player
Friday as she told ``Today'' viewers she will leave the NBC program
she has co-hosted for 13 years.
   Pauley, whose move was expected and had been preceded by weeks
of reports that she was unhappy on ``Today'' and wanted out, said
she would leave the show at the end of the year.
   However, she said she had extended her contract at NBC through
1992. And she hugged her announced successor, ``Today'' news anchor
Deborah Norville, and gave her an alarm clock.
   In an interview later, Pauley said there had been a happy ending
to what had been tense talks with NBC News executives. She will
host a prime-time special in March, do special reports for the
``NBC Nightly News,'' and co-anchor a new newsmagazine series
premiering in June, NBC said.
   But she said she once had felt that NBC executives wanted her to
leave the show _ the one in charge of ``Today'' denied this _ and
that she herself had wanted to leave because of various changes on
it.
   Although taking pains not to blame Norville, she said the one
change that probably triggered her thought of leaving came last
month when Norville replaced John Palmer as ``Today'' news anchor.
NBC assigned him Norville's former anchor job on the earlier ``NBC
News at Sunrise.''
   Norville's expanded role on ``Today,'' in which she shared the
same desk and thus exposure as Pauley and co-host Bryant Gumbel,
was only one of a number of changes that had weighed on her mind,
Pauley said. She didn't elaborate.
   But talks with NBC News president Michael Gartner and NBC Sports
president Dick Ebersol, who last summer also was given ``Today'' to
oversee, left her feeling that they weren't thinking of her future,
she said.
   ``We didn't believe each other,'' she said. ``They did not
believe that I simply wanted to leave the `Today' show. I did not
believe that they were committed to my future here at NBC.''
   ``Yes,'' she said when asked if she thought they wanted her to
leave the show. She didn't elaborate.
   NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol, who made the switch that put
Norville on ``Today,'' said this and other changes, accomplished or
planned, were being done ``to position the show for the Nineties.''
   Suggesting that perhaps Pauley had been misunderstood by a
reporter, he insisted that he and Gartner had urged her to stay on
the show.
   A proposal this month for what will be her March special,
``Changes,'' about people who have faced personal and professional
change, proved the breakthrough for what has become Pauley's new
deal at NBC, he said.
   ``I can't tell you what a happy ending this story has had for
me,'' said Pauley, who was 25 when she joined ``Today'' in 1976
after Barbara Walters, the show's first full-time female anchor,
left to join ABC.
   During Friday's broadcast, she took care to play down reports
she was at odds with either Gumbel or Norville, saying ``it has
hurt to see two of my friends, Bryant and Deborah, assigned roles
in this that they did not play.''
   In her post-show interview, Pauley said she will continue
co-hosting the show through the end of year and possibly into early
January. She also will substitute-host in January when Gumbel and
Norville are on vacation, Ebersol said.
   Norville, whose news anchor replacement probably won't be named
until December, according to NBC, said in an interview she was
relieved that all the uproar over the show finally appears to be
ending.
   She also said she was offended by some reports suggesting that
at the heart of the uproar is a situation akin to ``All About
Eve,'' the movie about a young actress scheming to oust an aging
theater star.
   ``It's sexism, pure and simple,'' said Norville, 31, who began
in TV news 11 years ago while attending the University of Georgia
and anchored at NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in Chicago before joining NBC
News in January, 1987.
   ``As a woman and a reporter, I'm offended that the suggestion
would be made, that two capable, competent women can't work in a
collegial way on the same program. In 1989, that's nonsense.''

<HEAD>Diary Indicates Steamy Hemingway Affair With Nurse Just Fiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Did Ernest Hemingway (alias Frederic Henry) really
have the steamy love affair with his Red Cross nurse Agnes von
Kurowsky (alias Catherine Barkley) that his novel ``A Farewell to
Arms'' suggests?
   One of the juicier questions racing around literary circles for
years, its answer is contained in von Kurowsky's diary for 1918,
made public Friday for the first time, a Hemingway scholar says.
   ``Is there any evidence to suggest that they consummated their
relationship at any point?'' Professor James Nagel of Northeastern
University said.
   ``My answer is no.''
   Nagel and Henry Villard, an 89-year-old retired U.S. diplomat
who knew Hemingway and von Kurowsky and donated her diary to the
John F. Kennedy Library's Hemingway archive, say the novel was just
the wishful thinking of a young writer in a more prudish era.
   The slender, yellowing diary provides the basis for Nagel and
Villard's new book, ``Hemingway in Love and War: The Lost Diary of
Agnes Kurowsky, Her Letters, and Correspondence of Ernest
Hemingway.''
   Hemingway was 19 when he met von Kurowsky, a 26-year-old nurse
from Philadelphia.
   After leaving a job as a cub reporter on the Kansas City Star to
see some action in World War I, Hemingway was running a canteen on
the Italian front when shrapnel from an Austrian mortar landed him
in a Milan hospital under von Kurowsky's care _ and under her spell.
   The events of those months in 1918 became the nugget of his 1929
novel ``A Farewell to Arms.''
   Whether the novel's account of a passionate liaison between a
soldier and a nurse was based in fact has long fueled debate among
Hemingway mavens.
   Certainly the diary gives Hemingway prominent mention. In July
1918, von Kurowsky wrote that Hemingway was the first American
wounded in Italy. By August she observed that Hemingway had ``a
case on me.'' In September there was a fuss when another nurse
found a hairpin of Agnes' under ``Ernie's'' pillow, she wrote.
   But she also was dismayed by overtly sexual behavior at the
hospital, a distaste that _ by her account _ Hemingway shared.
   On Sept. 19, von Kurowsky wrote about finding a nurse and a
patient ``having a high old time ... in a chaise lounge on the
balcony.'' She noted: ``Hem. was furious _ &amp; it was so common. I
couldn't get over them.''
   Villard, who was laid up at the time with jaundice and malaria
in a room adjoining Hemingway's, said he and other patients shared
a hankering for the nurse from Philadelphia.
   ``All the boys fell for Agnes,'' said Villard, who was an
18-year-old Harvard freshman at the time. But a dinner date was
about all they could hope for, he said.
   ``Standards were pretty strict and moral in those days,''
Villard said. ``We were all very much virgins in those days.''
   Villard, now living in the Bahamas, said he renewed his
friendship with von Kurowsky after Hemingway's suicide in 1961.
   ``She called her so-called affair `a flirtation,' '' he said.
Hemingway ``was desperately in love with her and wanted her to
marry him. She led him on to believe she would. But as she told me
herself, she was very fickle in those days.''
   When von Kurowsky's ardor for Hemingway cooled, she wrote him a
``Dear John'' letter in March 1919 saying she was sorry for
``unwittingly deceiving'' him and that her fondness was more ``as a
mother than as a sweetheart.''
   ``I can't get away from the fact that you're just a boy _ a
kid,'' she wrote, according to Nagel and Villard's book.
   Villard helped von Kurowsky secure a grave site for herself in a
national cemetery among war veterans. When she died in 1984 at the
age of 92, she bequeathed Villard her World War I papers.
   Nagel said the diary shows the imaginative leap Hemingway made
between his life and his fiction.
   ``It clarifies a great deal about two things _ what really
happened to Hemingway in World War I and how Hemingway used real
experiences and how he transformed them,'' Nagel said.

   Journalist Terry Anderson's friends and
colleagues prayed for an end to his ``special cruelty'' Friday and
vowed not to forget him at a ``Mass of Hope'' on his 42nd birthday,
his fifth in captivity.
   Anderson's relatives, professional colleagues and diplomats
filled a chapel at Georgetown University for an hour-long ceremony
on a day that President Bush and Congress proclaimed ``National
Hostage Awareness Day.''
   The celebrants prayed, listened to psalms and received communion
at a Mass officiated by the Rev. Lawrence Madden.
   ``As long as he is a hostage, we are not free,'' said Tom
Brokaw, the NBC anchorman who said he was ``haunted by Terry's
plight.''
   He implored the radical Moslem Shiites holding Anderson and
seven other Americans to ``reclaim your place in civilization'' by
releasing the hostages. ``No God would sanction such an act,'' he
said.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, has spent 1,686 days in captivity, the longest of any
American hostage. Anderson's father and and brother have died and
his daughter was born since his imprisonment.
   Former hostages who spent time with Anderson said he gained
strength from his Roman Catholicism. He prayed often and made
rosary beads from fibers on a mat.
   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister and a staunch campaigner for his
freedom since he was seized March 16, 1985, said the theme of hope
was appropriate because it sustains both the hostages and those
living without their loved ones.
   ``Despite years of crushed expectations, false signs and broken
dreams, who among us is not ready to believe that today could be
the day our miracle happens?'' Mrs. Say said.
   Calling for warring factions in the Middle East to find peace,
Mrs. Say said, ``It is my deepest hope that our hostages will not
have suffered so much for so long, in vain, and for nothing.''
   After the ceremony, Mrs. Say, accompanied by the wives of
hostages Robert Polhill, Frank Reed and Alann Steen, all from
Beirut, met with State Department officials to find out what the
Bush administration is doing to free the hostages.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher called for the release of
the hostages.
   ``Our hearts and our thoughts are with the families of these
innocent victims still held hostage in Lebanon. All hostages should
be immediately released and returned to their families as quickly
as possible,'' he said.
   ``Nothing can be gained by the taking and holding of hostages,''
he said. ``We will not rest until all of our fellow citizens
illegally imprisoned in Lebanon are free.''
   The three Americans who have died in captivity _ Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins, William Buckley and Peter Kilborn _ deserve a
special honor, he said.
   Generally, administration officials have tried to play down the
hostage issue in an effort to avoid the kind of scandal that
tainted the Reagan administration in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Despite a ban on weapons sales, President Reagan sold arms to
Iran in an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages. Reagan's
aides diverted the proceeds of the weapons sales to the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   Meantime, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that he has asked
two congressional committees to investigate whether the Reagan
administration ignored leads about the hostages in the years
1986-1988.
   ``I studied three separate cases and watched them as they
developed, in which the government, when either presented with hard
and reliable information or with overtures from credible sources,
said not only no, but heck no,'' Grassley said in a speech on the
Senate floor.
   Grassley refused to discuss specifics, but he said he found it
``frustrating to learn that information about the hostages in
Lebanon was being ignored. ...''
   At the Anderson ceremony, Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor
of The Washington Post, said all journalists feel an outrage at
Anderson's captivity. It is ``way past the time for the cruel and
unusual treatment of Terry Anderson'' to end, he said.
   Others at the ceremony were former diplomat Bruce Laingen, once
a hostage in Iran; and journalists Walter R. Mears, vice president
of The AP; Jonathan Wolman, AP Washington bureau chief; Peter S.
Prichard, editor of USA Today; Peter Arnett, a Cable News Network
correspondent; R.W. Apple, deputy Washington editor of The New York
Times; and David Aikman, a foreign correspondent for Time magazine.
   Among those attending were representatives of the embassies of
Lebanon, Algeria and Syria, and State Department officials
including John McCarthy, the ambassador to Lebanon. The United
States has evacuated all Americans from the embassy because of
fighting in Lebanon.
   The ceremony was organized by No Greater Love, a humanitarian
organization which promotes peace and helps victims of war. It was
the 20th such event organized on Anderson's behalf.

   The National Organization for Women went to
court Friday in an attempt to stop an anti-abortion group from
blocking abortion clinics.
   The organization alleges in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District
Court that members of Operation Rescue plan to illegally harass and
intimidate patients and employees at abortion clinic demonstrations
scheduled to begin Nov. 10 in the Washington, D.C., area.
   NOW seeks a preliminary injunction to prohibit ``trespassing on,
sitting in, blocking, impeding or obstructing ... any facility''
offering abortions, family planning or gynecological services.
   If a court order is issued, Operation Rescue will proceed with
its plans, said members of the organization, an evangelical
Christian group with an estimated 35,000 supporters that has
demonstrated at abortion clinics around the country.
   ``We will be in Washington in November,'' Susan Odom of
Operation Rescue told a news conference when asked about NOW's
court case. A preliminary injunction is in effect against Operation
Rescue in Broom County, N.Y., prohibiting the group from
trespassing at two medical facilities or harassing visitors. A
similar court order is in effect in Palm Beach County, Fla., said
Operation Rescue attorney Kyndra Mulder, who said it ``has had no
effect'' at three subsequent demonstrations.
   ``I am tired of listening to my sisters in the National
Organization for Women accuse me of violence,'' Odom said. She said
members of Operation Rescue have ``remained passive'' while NOW and
``their belligerent henchmen'' have assaulted ``rescuers sitting on
the ground.''
   The lawsuit said that Operation Rescue's activities have closed
clinics where abortions are performed and that the group has
``intimidated and harassed patients and employees of the clinics.''
   NOW is asking U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer to fine
Operation Rescue $25,000 a day if the group violates any
preliminary injunction the judge might issue in the case.
   In the last year, there have been more than 500 arrests as a
result of Operation Rescue's actions at the Hillcrest Women's
Surgi-Center in Washington, D.C., and at the Commonwealth Women's
Clinic in Virginia.
   The suit says that a group called the Veterans Campaign for Life
plans disruptions at abortion and family planning facilities on
Veterans Day weekend. The Veterans Campaign is affiliated with
Operation Rescue and is one of the 10 organizations and individuals
against whom the suit is filed.
   Joining NOW in the suit are Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan
Washington and eight other groups, including the Virginia and
Maryland state chapters of NOW and the Hillcrest and Commonwealth
clinics.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Responsibility for Slayings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army on Friday
claimed responsibility for the slaying of a British soldier and his
6-month-old daughter, the ninth attack on British forces in West
Germany this year.
   Cpl. Maheshkumar Islania, 34, and his daughter, Nivruti Mahesh,
were gunned down Thursday night at a gasoline station in
Wildenrath, a town near the Dutch border, British military
officials said.
   The soldier's wife, Smita, was hospitalized with severe shock
``after having seen her husband and baby murdered right beside
her,'' said Alan Patterson, spokesman for the British Army of the
Rhine in Moenchengladbach.
   The family's car was riddled with gunfire.
   In a statement issued in Dublin, capital of the Irish Republic,
the IRA said: ``One of our active service units was responsible for
the gun attack on a member of the British forces in Wildenrath,
West Germany, which resulted in two deaths.''
   ``We profoundly regret the death of the infant of the RAF
officer and are certain that our volunteers were not aware of the
child's presence when they opened fire.
   ``We repeat that there would be no necessity for IRA attacks in
West Germany or anywhere else were it not for the British presence
in the north of Ireland.''
   The IRA seeks to drive the British out of Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.
   The attack was the ninth shooting or bombing blamed on the IRA
in West Germany since June. Four people have been killed and 21
injured.
   ``We cannot let ourselves be intimidated by people who shoot
babies,'' Patterson said. ``We will continue with our duties here.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said the federal
government was ``indignant and filled with consternation'' over the
violence.
   Wildenrath is one of Britain's major air bases in West Germany,
where altogether about 66,000 British soldiers and their dependents
are stationed.
   Islania, of London, was a supervisor in the communications
center at the Royal Air Force base at Wildenrath, where he had been
based for two years.
   He was wearing civilian clothes when he was gunned down.
   Islania joined the RAF in 1974 and earlier this year was awarded
a medal for long service and good conduct, an Army spokeswoman said.
   In London, Defense Secretary Tom King said British military
officials were working closely with West German authorities in the
investigation.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the slaying of the West
German wife of a British soldier on Sept. 7 outside Dortmund. It
said the woman was shot in the mistaken belief that she was a
member of British forces.
   Since June, two car bombs have exploded at British military
housing areas in West Germany, one of which killed a soldier at a
British military housing area near Hanover.
   A third bomb planted in a soldier's car was found Aug. 28 and
defused without incident.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the fatal bomb attack and is
suspected by police in the others.

   It's just like any accident report _
``except multiply it geometrically,'' said one California Highway
Patrol official.
   Investigators have set up a hot line to hear from people who
were on or near Interstate 880 when the double-decked highway
collapsed in last week's earthquake.
   Initial reports already are helping explain just what happened
and how some motorists managed to escape the disaster that claimed
at least 39 lives, Highway Patrol spokesman Sam Haynes said Friday.
The reports also are expected to reveal new tales of bravery as
well as bust a few stories of heroism.
   Take the widely reported story of a heroic Mayflower
moving-truck driver who stopped his truck and flagged motorists off
the still-trembling highway and onto an exit.
   ``The reality was a little different, but interesting in
itself,'' Haynes said.
   The truck, at the southern edge of the collapsed structure,
slammed into a chunk of concrete, forcing another truck behind it
to jack-knife to a halt. The two drivers then persuaded other
motorists behind them to drive down the exit ramp so the
jack-knifed truck could get out, Haynes said.
   But reports persist of another Mayflower truck driver who was
also an emergency medical technician and stayed on the structure to
help stricken motorists. Now, that's hero material, but Haynes said
they haven't heard from that driver.
   In fact, officials haven't heard from many people who were
involved _ or almost involved _ in the highway collapse.
   ``A large number of vehicles (on the upper deck) were able to
get off after the initial collapse,'' Haynes said. ``We're still
trying to determine where those vehicles are and what happened to
those people.''
   The complete report, which may be weeks in the making, will do
the same job as more typical accident reports, helping assess
damage and settle insurance claims.
   But officials also hope to glean clues about how to survive
another such collapse.
   ``We're wondering: What kind of advanced warning did people
have? How long did it take? What were the clues that allowed them
to take evasive action?'' Haynes said.
   Several motorists on the upper deck said they had no sense of
falling. The road surface was twisting and shifting from side to
side, and people found themselves coming to rest without realizing
the road had dropped about 20 feet.
   ``It was kind of like being in an amusement park ride. It's so
violent, you can't tell which way you're moving,'' Haynes said.
   Traffic on the lower deck was light and in clusters, moving 60
to 65 mph in the two left lanes, 50 to 55 mph in the two right
lanes, he said.
   Those reports jibe with the findings of relieved rescue crews
who discovered far fewer cars trapped in the rubble than initially
feared.
   The quake hit at 5:04 p.m., but the normal rush-hour traffic was
light, most likely because people were already home to watch the
World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics, officials said.
   Officials who rushed to the scene the night of the quake feared
the worst, resulting in officials estimamtes of 200 to 250 dead and
scores injured.
   ``We were shooting from the hip,'' Alameda County Sheriff
Charles Plummer told the San Francisco Chronicle. ``A microphone
was pushed in our faces every 10 minutes, and we responded the best
we could.''
   Tourism officials groused this week that the inflated reports of
death and destruction made a bad situation even worse.
   But emergency officials responding to the disaster were more
relieved than upset.
   ``I think our fears were overstated. But if we had
underestimated it, we would have been criticized even more,'' said
David Johnson, an assistant to Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson. ``To
have people mobilized and ready to help is far better than being
undermobilized.''

   Disgraced television evangelist Jim
Bakker will be moved to the Federal Medical Center here to serve
out his 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy, officials said
Friday.
   Bakker, who met his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, in Minnesota, will
be moved from a prison in Alabama to the prison in this
southeastern Minnesota city of 60,000, center spokesman John Chreno
said.
   The Bakkers met while they were students at North Central Bible
College in Minneapolis during the early 1960s. Mrs. Bakker grew up
in International Falls on the Canadian border.
   Bakker, 49, the founder of the PTL ministry, will be on the
medium-security facility's work crew, but no specific assignment
has been made, Chreno said.
   His transfer to Rochester is permanent, although he could be
transferred again, Chreno said. Bakker will serve his sentence as a
member of the medical center's general population, meaning he is
not being assigned to Rochester as a patient for treatment of any
mental or physical illness, he said. Bakker had a breakdown during
his trial.
   Among the criminals at the prison are those convicted of federal
crimes who need medical or psychiatric care.
   Lyndon LaRouche, the political extremist and former fringe
presidential candidate, is serving a 15-year sentence at the
facility on mail fraud and conspiracy charges.
   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 on all 24 fraud and conspiracy
counts he faced and was sentenced in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday,
when he also was fined $500,000. He was charged with diverting $3.7
million from PTL to his personal use.
   His attorney, Harold Bender of Charlotte, has challenged a
decision to keep Bakker in custody while his appeals are pending. A
bail hearing for Bakker was scheduled Monday at the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
   If his appeals fail, Bakker will serve at least 10 years in
prison before being eligible for parole.
   He was taken Tuesday night to the medium-security Federal
Correctional Institution at Talladega, Ala., often a first stop for
federal prisoners. Chreno said the transfer was likely to occur
within the next week to 10 days.
   Unlike most federal prisons, the Rochester facility concentrates
security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative freedom
inside the fences. There are no bars on windows and inmates do not
need passes to move about. Guards do not carry weapons.
   The transfer announcement by Federal Bureau of Prisons Director
J. Michael Quinlan gave no specific reason, but said that the
facility's level of security meets requirements for Bakker.

<HEAD>Officials Puzzled Over Woman's Appearance But Rule Out Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALMOUTH, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>

   A woman who officials at first believed
was a deaf, kidnapped teen-ager is actually 27 years old and was
not abducted, police said Friday.
   The woman initially turned up, frightened and confused, at an
elementary school more than a month ago. She told a teacher through
sign language that she needed help.
   She was taken to a school for the deaf and said her name was
Toby Cole and indicated that she was kidnapped from California
three years ago then moved around the country, possibly by people
with ties to the occult.
   But police and FBI officials said in a statement Friday that the
woman has since been identified as Margaret Louise Herget, 27, from
Oregon and Louisiana.
   Police now do not believe the woman was abducted, said police
Lt. Michael Bouchard. He refused to elaborate how officials reached
that conclusion.
   Herget has used a half-dozen other names at other times, and was
living with her parents in Sandy, Ore., as recently as this past
summer, Bouchard said.
   The woman moved to Louisiana in August and apparently lived
there by herself, he said.
   Herget, whom he described as hearing-impaired but not deaf, was
last seen in Metairie, La., just three days before she turned up in
Portland on Sept. 18, Bouchard said.
   Bouchard would not comment on statements made earlier this week
by law enforcement officials, who had said their investigation
involved checking on a possible kidnapping and hinted at the
involvement with satanism.
   Bouchard said Friday that police were still puzzled by the
woman's appearance in Maine. She does not face any criminal
charges, he said.
   ``We still don't know how she got here,'' he said.
   Bouchard declined to say where Herget was Friday. Officials said
that police had been in contact with her parents, and that the
Maine Human Services Department was involved in the case.

   Membership in the Communist Youth League, or
Komsomol, has dropped by 4 million this year, Tass reported Friday.
   ``Young people's withdrawal from the Komsomol is one of the
signs of the crisis this social-political organization of Soviet
youth is undergoing,'' the official news agency said.
   Chairman Victor Mironenko told a Komsomol congress at its Friday
opening that the organization has 32 million members but is lagging
far behind the political reforms occuring in other parts of Soviet
society. For that reason, Mironenko said, members were deserting
Komsomol for less official groups.
   Komsomol, founded in 1918 by the Communist Party, caters to the
14- to 28-year age group. It works closely with the party,
providing most of its recruits and sponsoring educational,
recreational and political activities.
   The group is considering major reforms in its structure and
elections process in order to win back more young people, Tass said.
   There have also been reports of widespread membership loss in
the Communist Party, but no overall figure has been given recently.

   A man was sentenced to life in prison Friday for
raping a woman after immobilizing her with jolts from a stun gun.
   Robert Charles Grunsfeld, 27, was convicted Thursday of
aggravated sexual assault in an attack on a 21-year-old woman
during a date last November.
   Two other women testified during the sentencing phase of the
trial that Grunsfeld had raped them in May and June after using
handcuffs and tear gas to immobilize them. He is awaiting trial in
those cases.
   During the trial, a former student at the University of North
Texas testified that she agreed to go out with Grunsfeld after
meeting him at a nightclub.
   About a week later, in early November, Grunsfeld took her to
dinner with another couple, then invited her to his parents' home
for cocktails and to watch videotapes.
   Minutes after arriving, Grunsfeld became violent, the woman
testified. When she resisted, he pulled an electric stun gun from
his clothing and shocked her repeatedly on her arms, back, legs and
stomach to subdue her, she said.
   Defense attorney Robert Lively said he planned to appeal the
conviction, adding that he would try to show that prosecutors
withheld evidence.

   A joyful Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias thanked President Bush on Friday for the U.S. role in
restructuring Costa Rica's foreign debt in ways expected to save
his country $100 million a year.
   Arias announced the debt restructuring at an airport welcoming
ceremony for Bush, who arrived for a two-day meeting with
hemispheric leaders.
   Arias said the agreement would reduce Costa Rica's $4.5 billion
foreign debt by $1 billion. The annual cost of paying interest on
the debt will be reduced from $150 million to $50 million.
   ``This is the best possible gift we can possibly make to the
future generations of Costa Ricans,'' Arias said.
   ``For our neighbors in North America, $1 billion isn't much, but
for us down here in Costa Rica, that's all the money in the
world,'' he said.
   With a population of only 2.7 million, Costa Rica has had one of
the highest per capita foreign debts in the world.
   Arias praised his country's economic officials who had engaged
in months of negotiations with international bankers in Washington,
and thanked ``the U.S. government, who gave us so much assistance
within the framework of the Brady plan.''
   The Brady plan is the initiative that Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady announced last March for helping reduce the crushing
$1.3 trillion debts of Third World nations.
   Arias said that without the support of Bush, Brady and Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford, ``it would be very unlikely that we
would have been able to give you this wonderful news today, news
which will allow Costa Rica to develop faster in the years to
come.''
   The Costa Rican pact is the third announced under the Brady
initiative. Previous agreements have been reached with Mexico and
the Philippines.
   In Washington, Brady said in a statement that the agreement
would ``provide important support for Costa Rica's economic reform
program'' and ``represents an important step forward'' in easing
the debts of developing countries.
   The agreement provides funds for repaying part of the Costa
Rican debt will come from the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and several governments, including the United States.
   Costa Rica owed $1.6 billion to private commercial banks and the
rest to other governments, the IMF and other international
institutions.
   Fabian Barrantes, a spokesman for Arias, said it was the debt to
commercial banks that was renegotiated. The country had owed $325
million in past due interest payments alone. The agreement sharply
reduces debt service payments over the next several years.
   Costa Rica will buy back much of the bank debt for less than 20
cents on the dollar, and issue bonds paying 6.25 percent interest
to clear up other debts.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Higher FHA Mortgages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families would be able to buy more expensive
homes with FHA-insured mortgages under legislation approved Friday
by the Senate.
   But a technical disagreement with the House over how much
mortgage insurance the government can write in fiscal 1990 is
delaying final congressional action on the measure.
   On an 84-6 vote, the Senate passed a fiscal 1990 spending bill
that includes raising the lending lid on the government's primary
home mortgage insurance program from $101,250 to $124,875 in
high-cost housing markets.
   The House approved the same Senate-originated FHA measure on
Wednesday as part of a $67 billion package of government spending
on housing, veterans, space, science and the environment for the
current fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Voting against the overall bill Friday were Sens. William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.;
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and William V. Roth,
R-Del.
   The Senate, however, refused to accept a House amendment capping
at $57.3 billion the amount of new home mortages that the Federal
Housing Administration can insure in fiscal 1990.
   Instead, the Senate insisted on its cap of $75 billion. The
action sends the legislation back to a conference with the House.
   FHA-backed mortgages that guarantee lenders against losses if
buyers default are now a source of financing for nearly 900,000
home purchases a year.
   The new higher $124,875 ceiling on FHA-insured mortgages would
allow the financing of up to an additional 100,000 homes a year in
high-cost real estate markets, particularly California and the
Northeast, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The only other dispute over the bill was over a provision
inserted by House and Senate negotiators nearly doubling NASA's
construction budget above what was voted earlier by lawmakers.
   The increase will allow NASA to begin work next year on a
half-billion-dollar plant for building new advanced solid rocket
engines for the space shuttle.
   Negotiators agreed to spend $90 million this year on the plant,
which is to be built in the home district of Rep. Jamie L. Whitten,
D-Miss., and another $90 million on research and development of the
new engines.
   The Bush administration and the House had sought no money for
the new rocket engine plant at Yellow Creek, Miss., and the Senate
had approved only $10 million.
   ``I'm sure this is not a first, but I have never seen anything
quite like this,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. ``I've seen a
little `mickeying' around here and `mickeying' around there but it
never occurred to me that conferees had that kind of latitude.''
   Bumpers, however, did not try to strike the Yellow Creek
project, saying that Arkansas and Mississippi are neighbors and
share the distinction of being poor states in need of just that
type of federal spending.
   The bill provides a total of $12.4 billion for NASA, $1.7
billion more than last year's level but $900,000 less than what the
administration sought. Of the total, $1.8 billion will go to
development of the planned space station.
   It also makes available $5.6 billion for the Environmental
Protection Agency, a $400 million boost over 1989. The Superfund
hazardous waste cleanup program would get $1.5 billion and
anti-pollution efforts would get $817 million.
   Veterans medical care would get $11.4 billion, $551 million more
than last year. And spending on housing program will rise $2.3
billion over the 1989 level of $15.1 billion.

<TEXT>
   Police pulled playwright Vaclav
Havel from his sickbed and arrested other dissidents to try to
stifle a rally set for Saturday, the anniversary of democratic
Czechoslovakia's founding in 1918.
   In a speech to about 250 Czechoslovaks at the U.S. Embassy,
Ambassador Shirley Temple Black made a veiled call for more freedom
in this communist nation, which has resisted the tide of reform
spreading through Eastern Europe.
   Havel, whose works are banned in Czechoslovakia, was taken from
his home to a police station Thursday night, then hospitalized with
a bronchial ailment.
   On Friday, police rounded up more dissidents, a common practice
before banned pro-freedom rallies. At least 11 have been detained
since Tuesday.
   Activists said those detained included John Bok and a leading
dissident in Brno, Jaroslav Sabata. Ludvik Vaculik, a banned writer
and founding member of the Charter 77 human rights group, said
police warned him and others to get out of Prague on Saturday.
   Czechoslovaks gathered in the embassy compound to hear Mrs.
Black honor Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the nation's founding president.
   Masaryk, a Czech, and the Slovak hero Gen. Milan Stefanik had
the support of President Woodrow Wilson in realizing their dream of
an independent Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28, 1918.
   Plaques depicting the three men hang on a wall just inside the
large doors of the ornate embassy building in Prague and a few
hundred Czechoslovaks gather there every year.
   ``These three men were patriots,'' Mrs. Temple Black told the
crowd Friday. ``They helped free Czechs and Slovaks from 300 years
of bondage to an autocratic government.
   ``Let us always remember their faith that political unity and
individual freedom could lead to the new state of Czechoslovakia
and a more prosperous and happy existence for every one of its
citizens.''
   After the speech, several people adorned the plaques with
flowers and ribbons of red, white and blue, then the crowd sang an
anthem and dispersed. One of those present was Masaryk's
granddaughter, Anna.
   Two hours earlier, officials of the National Front, the
Communist-dominated umbrella organization for Czechoslovak social
groups, laid wreaths at Masaryk's grave in Lany, a village 30 miles
from Prague.
   The ceremony reflected a changing official attitude toward
Masaryk, once depicted in textbooks as a bourgeois capitalist. Last
year, the Communist authorities declared Oct. 28 a national holiday.
   An official military ceremony has been scheduled for Wenceslas
Square, Prague's central plaza, hours before the banned Saturday
rally is to be held there. Authorities have said those attending
the rally may be subject to prosecution.
   Riot police dispersed a peaceful gathering of 5,000 in the
square last year and arrested at least 87 people.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
there had been a sharp rise in human rights violations in weeks
leading up to the anniversary celebration.
   ``We expect the Czechoslovak government to respect the right of
its people to assemble for commemorations of this year's
anniversary. The right to assemble is a basic human right,'' he
said.
   Boucher also said the recent crackdown ``calls into question the
seriousness of Czechoslovak authorities' commitment to
international agreements, as well as their stated interest in
improving U.S.-Czechoslovak relations.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Finland's
version of the Silicon Valley on Friday and told his hosts he wants
to build similar high-tech research facilities in the Soviet Union.
   ``We have done good work here,'' Gorbachev said before boarding
his plane at the end of a three-day state visit, during which he
announced a plan to decommission four older model submarines of the
Soviet nuclear-armed fleet in the Baltic Sea.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed the gesture as
insignificant.
   Speaking in Bonn, West Germany, Cheney said the Soviet nuclear
capability in the Baltic ``frankly wasn't all that great.'' Experts
have described the four Golf II-class Soviet subs as dated and
virtually useless.
   The proposal also received a lukewarm reaction from neighboring
Sweden, which supports a ban on nuclear weapons in Northern Europe.
   Gorbachev's proposal was interesting but ``should be studied
closely before drawing conclusions,'' said Sten Andersson, foreign
minister of the neutral nation.
   Swedish opposition leader Carl Bildt said the Golf II-class
vessels were ``the oldest, rustiest and most scraggly subs in the
world.''
   Gorbachev departed for home Friday after a four-hour tour of
Oulu, a remote Baltic Sea city of 100,000 people about 400 miles
north of Helsinki.
   Thousands of Finns lined the streets to cheer and applaud the
Soviet president, who visibly reveled in the attention.
   ``What a lot of people!'' Raisa Gorbachev said of the crowd,
which was larger than any that greeted the couple in Helsinki
during the first two days of the visit.
   Gorbachev waved, shook hands with residents and clasped his
hands above his head in victory.
   The Kremlin leader, who has admitted his strategy to restructure
the economy is in trouble, visited a technological village where 80
science-based companies work on the latest advances in computer
hardware, laser equipment and telecommunications.
   Gorbachev viewed an exhibit by about 30 companies, displaying
curiosity and knowledge in the application of some of the wares,
said Pertti Huuskonen, the director of the village.
   Huuskonen described the village to Gorbachev as Finland's
version of Silicon Valley, a center of high-technology activities
in California. He quoted the Soviet leader as saying he wanted the
Finns to help set up similar projects in his country.
   Gorbachev was presented with an electronic pulse monitor used by
athletes and even racehorses that was invented at the technology
village, associated with the 8,500-student Oulu University. ``Many
joggers in Finland don't go out without it,'' Huuskonen said.
   Soviet businessmen operating in Finland have said they have
access to technology that is denied them in the Soviet Union by
Western export limitations.
   In Bonn, Cheney said he supports retention of the limits on
technology transfers because he said the Soviet arms capability
remains a danger to the West.

   A federal judge dismissed bankruptcy
proceedings brought by the government against three organizations
associated with political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche.
   Judge Martin V.B. Bostetter Jr. in U.S. Bankruptcy Court ruled
that the government had acted in ``bad faith'' in filing the
involuntary bankruptcy petitions against Caucus Distributors Inc.,
Campaigner Publications Inc. and Fusion Energy Foundation Inc.
   In a separate criminal trial, LaRouche was convicted on Dec. 16,
1988, of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than $30
million in defaulted loans, 11 counts of actual mail fraud
involving $294,000 and one count of conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service. He is now serving a 15-year prison term.
   David R. Kuney, a defense attorney for the LaRouche-associated
organizations, said Friday about the Bankruptcy Court decision: ``I
think it's a very important decision because it's probably the
first major victory that these folks have had in their dealings
with the government.''
   ``It reflects that the government simply mishandled the filing
of the (bankruptcy) petitions and was overzealous and shouldn't
have done it,'' Kuney said.
   David Schiller, the federal prosecutor who handled the
bankruptcy case, was in court Friday afternoon and could not be
reached immediately for comment.
   In his ruling handed down on Wednesday, Judge Bostetter said
that ``an evaluation of the government's filing on an objective
level leads this court to conclude that the alleged debtors have
established that the government filed the petition in bad faith.''
   ``It is not the filing of an involuntary petition by the United
States that constitutes bad faith ... but the failure to comply
with the applicable provisions of the (legal) code that compels
this conclusion,'' he wrote.
   Bostetter found that the government was not entitled to bring
the bankruptcy proceedings against Caucus Distributors Inc. and
Fusion Energy Foundation Inc. because they are not commercial
enterprises, but not-for-profit entities.
   He said those groups ``strived more to expose the world to
(their) political viewpoint than attain private monetary gain.''
   ``While the government has alleged that their methods of
fund-raising were reprehensible, that alone does not change the
debtors' status and provide the appropriate basis for the
invocation of this court's jurisdiction,'' the judge said.

<TEXT>
   The Salvadoran army deserter
who told U.S. officials in Washington about death-squad
assassinations took the initiative in the killings, according to
testimony of his former comrades obtained Friday.
   The testimony was given in recent weeks to Judge Miguel Flores
Figueroa of Quetzaltepeque, 12 miles north of San Salvador. It was
in that region that two suspected left-wing guerrillas, Lucio
Parada and Hector Miranda, were killed in July after being captured
by an army unit that included Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez.
   Joya, who deserted from the San Salvador-based 1st Army Brigade
in July, met Friday in Washington with members of Congress. He told
Washington journalists Thursday that he had been part of a death
squad responsible for killing as many as 72 suspected leftists. He
has been charged with the deaths of Parada and Miranda and fled El
Salvador.
   The government and armed forces deny the existence of military
death squads.
   Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes, 1st Brigade commander, called Joya
``a deserter, a murderer and a liar.''
   Joya, 28, told the reporters, ``My work was only to execute
these people. My job was to kill or be killed ... I realize I was
manipulated.''
   He also said some of the people he killed ``were almost dead
from being beaten during interrogation.''
   But some of Joya's former comrades told Judge Flores Figueroa
that Joya was the most zealous of torturers who beat, drowned or
suffocated prisoners.
   Joya has been charged in absentia with premeditated murder in
the deaths of Parada and Miranda. Cpl. Alcides Gomez, in the patrol
that included Joya, also is charged in the slaying of the two men.
Gomez is under arrest.
   Though Joya said he did not know the identities of the men he
killed, his former comrades told the judge that Joya was an
intelligence agent responsible for the capture of specific rebel
suspects he knew by name.
   Lt. Herbert Soriano commanded the Atlacatl Battalion company
operating north of the capital when Parada and Miranda were beaten
or shot to death. The two were among eight guerrilla suspects
captured during an operation around the village of Tres Ceibas.
   According to the testimony of soldiers who took part in the
operation, all eight prisoners were beaten and several were nearly
drowned by Joya over two days of interrogation in the field.
   Both Cpl. Gomez and another Atlacatl soldier, Eugenio Mendez,
testified Soriano had given explicit instructions that prisoners
were not to be tortured. Gomez said he told Joya not to torture the
prisoners but Joya replied, ``If I don't, they won't tell us
anything.''
   Gomez and Mendez said Soriano was not present when Parada and
Miranda were killed. They said that after the deaths Soriano told
Joya, ``You're in big trouble.''
   Gomez told the judge that after the first man died of the
beating he expressed concern to Joya about problems with the army.
   He claimed Joya told him, ``Don't worry. I'm going to kill them
all.''
   In his testimony Soriano said two 1st Brigade soldiers _ Joya
and Humberto Rodriguez _ were attached to but ``working
independently'' of his Atlacatl company.
   Soriano said a squad from his company accompanied Joya and
Rodriguez in making the arrests at Tres Ceibas. He said the squad's
``only mission was to give security to the two 1st Brigade soldiers
so they could perform their intelligence-gathering duty.''
   An estimated 70,000 people have killed in the 10-year-old war
between leftist rebels and U.S.-backed governments. Most of the
victims were civilians. Rightist death squads, allegedly sponsored
or tolerated by the military, have been accused by human rights
groups of killing more than 20,000 suspected leftists in the early
1980s.
   The number of slayings attributed to death squads declined
between 1984 and 1987 but began to increase last year.

   Sen. John Glenn turned the other cheek, in a
sense, with a courtesy call to the family of the man who slugged
him.
   ``He called them and wished them well and said he realized this
was something beyond their control,'' Glenn's press secretary,
Rebecca Bell, said Friday.
   On Wednesday, Glenn, D-Ohio, was punched in the jaw during an
outdoor television interview.
   A day later, Michael Breen, 31, was ordered held without bond
and sent to a federal prison hospital for a mental evaluation.
Later Thursday evening, Glenn talked by telephone to Breen's mother
and sister, Bell said.
   Glenn was encouraged by his wife, Annie, who expressed concern
about the impact the incident would have on Breen's mother, she
said.
   One of Breen's sisters had contacted Glenn's office on Wednesday
to express the family's regrets, she added.
   According to the criminal complaint filed in U.S. District
Court, Breen told police he believed punching Glenn would generate
publicity and catch the attention of Pope John Paul II.
   Breen said his goal was to prevent nuclear war by getting the
pope to reveal the contents of a secret message from the Virgin
Mary, mother of Jesus.
   Some Roman Catholics believe such a message has been kept secret
for 72 years, ever since it was revealed to three children at
Fatima, Portugal.

chemical weapons. No pickup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said Friday a Kremlin pledge to remove nuclear-armed submarines
from the Baltic had little significance because Soviet nuclear
strength there isn't ``all that great.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union announced
Thursday, during a visit to Finland, that subs carrying
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles would be withdrawn by 1991 and
the rockets destroyed.
   Cheney and Gerhard Stoltenberg, West Germany's defense minister,
spoke to reporters after talks Thursday night and Friday on how
NATO defenses should adapt to changing East-West relations.
   The U.S. secretary is on a three-week tour of Europe to meet
allied leaders and visit U.S. troops. He said the announced plan to
withdraw six aging Golf-class subs as a step toward eliminating
nuclear weapons from the Baltic had no relevance for NATO, which
wants to keep a nuclear option.
   ``The notion of nuclear-free zones I don't find all that
significant,'' Cheney said. ``The fact of the matter is that
nuclear weapons continue to be an important part of the successful
strategy of deterrence, a strategy that has worked now for over 40
years.''
   He said Soviet nuclear capability in the Baltic ``frankly wasn't
all that great.''
   Cheney said he supports continued limits on technology transfers
to the Soviet Union. He said the Soviets still deploy nuclear
weapons and the West should not provide them with technical
know-how.
   ``As defense minister, it is important for me to remind people
that the Soviet Union still possesses, in fact it's the only nation
in the world that possesses, the military capability to destroy us
and our allies,'' he said.
   He and Stoltenberg, who also met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
confirmed the agenda included low-level flying maneuvers over West
Germany, sharing of defense costs and burdens and the postponed
modernization of short-range nuclear missiles stationed in West
Germany.
   They gave a display of unity for reporters, and Stoltenberg said
NATO has made clear a Europe devoid of nuclear weapons ``is not our
aim.''
   West Germany bucked Western alliance policy last spring when
Kohl called for superpower negotiations on reducing short-range
nuclear missiles. NATO has delayed a decision on modernizing the
weapons until at least 1992.
   Stoltenberg suggested the missile question was not a major issue
in the talks because the decision on whether to modernize will
depend on the military situation three years from now.
   Kohl's government, faced with growing public opposition to the
presence of U.S. missiles on West German territory, is hoping an
East-West agreement on reducing conventional arms can be reached
before NATO takes up the issue again.
   During the exchange with journalists, Cheney reiterated U.S.
plans to remove chemical weapons from West Germany beginning next
year.
   ``We have made a commitment to move those chemical weapons
stockpiles as rapidly as possible,'' he said.
   Kohl and former President Reagan agreed in 1986 that all U.S.
chemical weapons would be out of West Germany by 1992, and that the
removal would begin in 1990.

   An Arab-American organization said Friday it
will boycott and picket outlets of a national novelty company it
says reneged on a decision to recall two Halloween masks the group
finds offensive.
   The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said its members
will demonstrate this weekend at outlets of Spencer Gifts Inc.
because the company said Friday it had decided to put back on the
market its ``Sheik'' and ``Arafat'' Halloween masks.
   Ronald Mangel, Spencer's general counsel, said in a letter to
Faris Bouhafa, AAADC spokesman, that John Hacala, Spencer's
president, ``after re-reviewing the `Sheik' and `Arafat' masks and
discussing the look of the masks with others, has decided to put
the masks back on sale today.''
   His letter added, ``We will not reorder the masks for next
year.''
   The Pleasantville, N.J.-based company had earlier this month
withdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a three-day
protest and telephone campaign by the committee.
   ``Spencer Gifts is engaging in what we feel is a grotesque
deception,'' said Bouhafa.
   Mangel defended the masks Thursday, saying, ``The essence of
Halloween is exaggeration.''
   ``It's not an ethnic mask, it's a character mask,'' he said.
   The masks depict a hook-nosed Arab wearing a kefiyah, the
checkered black and white headdress worn by Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   In its Halloween catalog, Spencer had urged customers to ``put
on our Arafat mask and terrorize your friends.''
   The Arab group characterized the advertisement as ``an
exhortation that reinforces the negative and increasingly
discredited stereotypical image of Palestinians as terrorists.''
   ``We will use this mask as one of the most glaring examples of
racism against Arab people for years to come,'' said Bouhafa.
   The committee is a 23,000-member organization with 63 chapters
nationwide and is dedicated to the promotion of civil and legal
rights for people of Arab descent.

   In the third fatal air crash in 10 days, a Soviet
military plane slammed into a mountain while trying to land in poor
weather on Kamchatka peninsula, killing all 36 people aboard, Tass
said Friday.
   The Antonov-26 two-engine turboprop transport crashed 22 miles
north of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the main city on the
volcano-dotted peninsula north of Japan, Tass said. It said the
crash occurred Thursday.
   ``The aircraft had an experienced crew,'' Col.-Gen. Stanislav
Kochemasov, chief of staff of the Soviet strategic missile forces,
was quoted as telling Tass. ``Visibility was poor.''
   The plane, carrying missile crewmen and their dependents, hit a
mountain while trying to land at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky airfield,
the general said. The 30 passengers and six crew members were
killed, he said.
   ``The plane was carrying missile crews from distant garrisons
and members of their families,'' Kochemasov said. Tass said a
commission headed by the deputy commander-in-chief of the strategic
rocket forces is investigating the accident.
   One week ago, on Oct. 20, an Ilyushin-76 transport jet carrying
supplies to earthquake-ravaged northern Armenia hit a mountain in
Armenia, killing all 17 people aboard.
   Two days earlier, one of four engines on another Il-76 caught
fire and fell off the plane after it took off in Azerbaijan. The
crippled plane crashed into the Caspian Sea, killing all 57 people
aboard.
   Among the dead were Soviet paratroopers assigned to keep order
in a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Tel Aviv Strangler Reportedly Worked as Shin Bet Informant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian suspected of killing seven
Israelis in Tel Aviv worked as an informant for the secret Shin Bet
security service, newspapers reported Friday.
   The left-wing Al-Hamishmar daily said Mohammed bin Ahmed Halebi,
32, of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp agreed to work for
the Shin Bet in 1985 after serving five years of an 11-year
sentence on charges including drug dealing and prostitution.
   Almost two weeks ago authorities accused him of strangling seven
Israelis, five women and two men, with a nylon rope in what police
said was a criminal dispute. Despite a massive manhunt, Halebi has
eluded capture.
   The independent Yediot Ahronot daily said underground
Palestinian popular committees sentenced him to death for
collaboration after reports of his cooperation with the Shin Bet
were published.
   But it was unclear from the reports what information Halebi
provided for the Shin Bet and whether he had informed on Gaza Strip
uprising activists.
   At least 136 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators during the 22-month-old uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied lands.
   Al-Hamishmar said Halebi was given a special Shin Bet
identification card that allowed him to live in Israel after his
release from prison.
   The card also allows free passage through military checkpoints.
They usually are issued only to collaborators who possess special
information and need refuge in Israel to escape death threats from
Palestinian nationalists, the independent Maariv daily reported.
   Gaza Arabs are banned from staying overnight in Israel and must
have a magnetic card issued by the military administration to pass
through army checkpoints and enter Israel. Those cards are only
granted to Arabs who pass security checks and have paid taxes.
   Maariv said hundreds of collaborators have been issued the
magnetic cards so they can travel freely in Israel, but that only a
small number of Palestinians have been granted cards by the Shin
Bet.
   Halebi worked with the Shin Bet and spent most of his time in
Tel Aviv, where he apparently became involved in drug dealing,
Yediot reported.
   The stranglings sparked outrage in Israel and led several
right-wing politicians to demand tighter restrictions on the travel
of Palestinians in Israel.
   The Shin Bet is responsible for internal security, and there
have been repeated allegations that the service uses petty
criminals as informers in the occupied territories.
   Deputy Inspector Avi Dotan said in an interview with Israel
televison that it was ``not unknown'' for Arabs with criminal pasts
to work for the police or other security services.

   A flatbed truck loaded with
steel beams barreled out of control Friday on a steep hill,
smashing through several vehicles and killing five people,
authorities and witnesses said.
   Gordon Davies, medical director at Royal Inland Hospital, said
the truck hit several vehicles before smashing into a retaining
wall outside the hospital and bursting into flames.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 12 people were hurt and
13 vehicles were involved in the accident. Four people were
admitted to the hospital, one in critical condition, Davies said.
   ``One station wagon was sheared in half, with the rear half
under the truck,'' Davies said.
   Coroner Bob Graham said the man driving the truck, three women
and a preschool child were killed.
   Witnesses said the truck smashed through a line of cars backed
up at a stoplight in front of the hospital about 10:55 a.m.
   ``I just don't believe it. I saw him coming and I tried to pull
out of the way,'' said David McGregor, who narrowly escaped being
hit.
   ``I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw this huge flatbed
truck barreling through cars. They were just exploding as he hit
them,'' McGregor said. ``All I knew is he was going really fast and
he couldn't stop and he just went through like they were Tinker
Toys.''
   Warren Cameron said he was driving down the hill when he looked
in his rear-view mirror and saw the truck bearing down on him. He
managed to change lanes just in time.
   ``He missed my rear bumper by inches,'' Cameron said. ``Then he
hit a pickup truck and killed that lady. Then he hit several more
cars and dragged one them underneath.
   ``Then it exploded. There were bodies all over the place.''
   Cameron said rescuers managed to drag one girl, about 3 years
old, from a car just before it blew up.
   Kamloops, at the junction of the North and South Thompson
rivers, is about 150 miles northeast of Vancouver and 100 miles
north of the U.S. border.

<HEAD>Advisers Raise Doubts About Reactor Restart Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department may be moving too
quickly to restart nuclear reactors that produce material for
nuclear warheads and reactor managers may not be emphasizing safety
enough, advisers told Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Friday.
   In a letter to Watkins, members of the Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Facility Safety said that while prospects for a safe
resumption of production at the Savannah River installation in
South Carolina had improved recently, they were concerned that
reactor operators were not being trained in ``reactor
fundamentals'' like commercial reactor operators.
   The operators are employed by Westinghouse Corp., which runs
Savannah River under contract. The letter did not detail what the
advisers meant by reactor fundamentals.
   The reactors produce tritium, a gas, and are similar in basic
design to most civilian power reactors, though they operate at much
lower temperatures and pressures.
   ``That this omission will remain through restart may belie
Westinghouse's claim that safety is their primary concern and that
early restart of the reactors is not the driving factor in
training,'' the letter said.
   The three Savannah River reactors, built for the government in
the early 1950s, were shut down more than 1{ years ago because of
mechanical problems and safety concerns.
   Watkins said in September that he hoped to restart the first
reactor by late next summer, although he has stressed that
unforeseen problems could change the schedule.
   The advisers told Watkins that while restart planning was
generally good, the absence of operator training in reactor
fundamentals was a serious problem.
   The advisers also said training of Energy Department personnel
at the site ``is not keeping pace with the contractor's training of
its operational personnel.''
   In addition, the committee members said Watkins may be biting
off more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactors
back in operation within a six-month period starting next summer or
fall. They said it might be wiser to concentrate the best talent on
restarting one reactor, then moving on to another when the first is
running smoothly.
   Restarting all three reactors in the six-month period ``will
certainly require a large number of well-trained, competent people
who may not be available,'' they wrote.
   The advisers praised Watkins' efforts to clarify lines of
authority from the department headquarters to Savannah River, and
said other needed management changes were under way.
   Even so, the committee members expressed concern that while top
Westinghouse managers had gotten the message about the need for
greater attention to safety, the ``new safety philosophy'' may not
have reached middle management and below.
   ``Procedural errors and reporting problems continue and indicate
that an emphasis on safety of operations is not yet pervasive,''
the letter said.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS graf 6, which is first bullet graf: ``The Soviets,'' to
clarify Primakov's stance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature is drafting war powers
legislation to prevent another Afghan-style invasion, the speaker
of that parliament told an American audience Friday.
   ``I can tell you quite strongly that at present there would be
no repeat of what happened when our troops were sent into
Afghanistan,'' the speaker, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said at the
Brookings Institution, a liberal Washington think tank. The Red
Army ended its 10-year Afghan intervention last February.
   Primakov said the Supreme Soviet legislature was wresting power
from the Soviet executive branch, but played little role in the
decision this week to declare that a Siberian radar violated a
superpower treaty.
   The meeting was crowded with senior analysts from the Central
Intelligence Agency, scholars and journalists all eager to hear the
comments of Primakov, who in September was named a non-voting
member of the Communist Party Politburo. Previously, he headed the
largest Soviet think tank, the Institute for World Economy and
International Relations (IMEMO).
   In a wide-ranging discussion, Primakov said:
   _The Soviets are not opposed to the eventual reunification of
Germany, if the people of West and East Germany make that choice,
but that neither the capitalist nor the communist state should
``consume the other.'' Primakov's remarks, however, clearly
reflected skepticism about the benefits to Europe of reunification,
which he called ``a matter for the future.''
   _That Communist Party leaders reserved the right to fire or
criticize editors or journalists, as exercised last week by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   _That despite an acute shortage of consumer goods, the
government would continue its compromise course of economic
restructuring, neither retreating to a fully centralized system nor
seeking quick introduction of a free market.
   _The Soviet Union wants to join international economic
activities, such as the International Monetary Fund and the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
   Primakov was asked how the Supreme Soviet solved the dilemma
posed by the U.S. War Powers Act, which allows the president to
send troops to a war zone but requires congressional approval to
leave them there.
   ``We are drafting a mechanism for making a decision of that
kind, but so far it is not in place,'' Primakov said. ``But I can
be quite firm in saying that there can be no decision of that sort
without involvement from the Supreme Soviet.''
   ``There can be no repetition of the situation when a small group
of leaders makes a decision that is not made in accord with the
legislative branch,'' he said.
   As an example of government consultation with the Supreme
Soviet, Primakov cited a speech by Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze this week. Shevardnadze said that intervening in
Afghanistan was a mistake and that a radar station in Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, had been built in knowledge it violated the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Asked whether the decision to destroy the radar had been made by
the ruling Communist Party Politburo or by the legislature,
Primakov said:
   ``As to this latest decision to dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar
... we can only be happy ... that a decision was taken to dismantle
it.''
   Pressed to say who made the decision, Primakov said, ``there is
a separation of powers. In this country, Congress just approves
overall military expenditure, not single individual projects. That
is my answer to your question.''
   Primakov has risen to power at the head of a newly reconstituted
Soviet legislature, whose members were elected this year in the
most competitive balloting in the Soviet Union since the Bolshevik
Revolution of 1917.
   His delegation is visiting Washington at the invitation of
congressional leaders, in part to study the operation of Congress.
   On Thursday, Primakov met with President Bush and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, and was introduced on the floor of the
Senate by his hosts, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   After two days of meetings in Washington, the group was headed
for Maine, Kansas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and New York.

<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Friday called on
Iran and Iraq to ``work constructively'' with a U.N. envoy to be
sent to the region in an effort to break the deadlock in peace
talks.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will send his special
envoy, Swedish Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, to begin shuttle talks
between Baghdad and Tehran on Monday.
   ``He is not taking specific proposals, but he will be listening
to all parties concerned who will be available to him,'' Perez de
Cuellar told reporters. ``Nothing is spectacularly new.''
   Eliasson's mission is expected to last two or three weeks, he
said.
   The 15 council members expressed impatience with the pace of the
Iran-Iraq talks.
   Their statement said in part: ``Members of the council noted
that over two years have elapsed since Security Council Resolution
598 was adopted and that more than 14 months have gone by since the
cease-fire went into effect with the concurrence of both sides.''
   Resolution 598 calls for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of troops
to their own countries, an exchange of prisoners of war and a
negotiated peace settlement. It would establish a panel to
apportion blame for the war that began in September 1980.
   The Iran-Iraq peace talks opened in Geneva in August 1988, but
quickly bogged down. A truce prevails along the 350-mile war front,
supervised by teams of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   It is estimated that about 100,000 prisoners are still being
held in POW camps in Iran and Iraq.
   Iran insists the next step in the peace process must be the
withdrawal of troops. Iraqi forces still occupy about 385 square
miles of Iranian territory.
   Also on Friday diplomats said Iran has stopped flooding a
``no-man's land'' in the southern front near the Iraqi city of
Basra. Iran made no comment.
   Iran began flooding the area in Iranian territory northeast of
Basra in September 1988 just after the cease-fire took effect.
   A large canal was opened, turning the marshy region into
swampland, making it impassable to armored vehicles.
   Last year Perez de Cuellar called it a serious violation of the
cease-fire and reported the flooding covered an area 37 miles long
and about 2 miles wide.
   Iraq and U.N. officials registered complaints over the flooding
but Iran, which claims it is an internal matter, did not respond.

   The first mate of a freighter that ran aground on a
coral reef was charged in the grounding and arrested in an
unrelated Louisiana case while a Coast Guard investigation
continued, officials said Friday.
   Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, was piloting the 155-foot Alec Owen
Maitland on Wednesday when the ship hit the reef in Key Largo
National Marine Sanctuary. The Coast Guard charged him with
negligence in that incident.
   Bishop failed two breath alcohol tests given five hours after
the wreck, the Coast Guard said. He told the Coast Guard he started
drinking only after the ship ran aground.
   No state charges have been filed and Gov. Bob Martinez has
appointed a special prosecutor to investigate.
   Meanwhile, Bishop was arrested Thursday night on a fugitive
warrant from Cameron, La., in an aggravated battery case, said
Florida Marine Patrol Capt. Ed Sharp. Bishop was ordered held
without bond Friday at the Dade County Jail.
   The Coast Guard attempted to hold an informal hearing Friday to
learn more about the grounding, but the session was postponed to
give the five crew members a chance to confer with attorneys.
   Bishop is accused of running the vessel aground, not maintaining
a proper fix of his position and operating the vessel without the
proper license, Coast Guard Lt. Keith Ward said.
   The ship's captain, Duane Goodwin, 37, has been charged by the
Coast Guard with allowing a person without the proper license to
operate the vessel, Ward said.
   None of the ship's 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel leaked,
but a few gallons of residue oil from a flooded ballast tank seeped
into the water, the Coast Guard said.

   The honor guard that greeted leaders
of the Western Hemisphere who arrived here Friday consisted not of
soldiers carrying guns but school children bearing flowers.
   President Bush, the last to arrive, called it ``one of the
wonderful traditions of this great country,'' greeting foreign
visitors ``not with the gune of military salutes, but with the
cheers of those school children.''
   Costa Rica, which disbanded its army in 1948, did post 4,000
police around the capital to safeguard the VIPs, including the
presidents or prime ministers of 15 other countries and the
governor of Puerto Rico, who accepted President Oscar Arias'
invitation to the celebration of 100 years of Costa Rican democracy.
   While Bush arrived under blue skies, the morning sunlight later
gave way to clouds that shrouded 11,000-foot Irazu and the other
volcanoes that surround the lush, green valley. Finally, it rained.
   That was par for the course in this warm, humid Latin country
between Nicaragua and Panama; San Jose is famous for its afternoon
rains.
   The conference room where inaugural ceremonies were held was hot
and humid. The foreheads of several luminaries at the main table
glistened with sweat, and spectators fanned themselves with copies
of Arias' speech.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delighted the crowd by
using three languages _ Spanish, English and French _ to announce
that his nation would join the Organization of American States.
   Violeta Chamorro, the main opposition candidate facing
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega in February's elections, got a
loud burst of applause as she made her way to a section for special
guests.
   Ortega arrived in military garb, a red-and-black Sandinista
bandanna draped around his neck. He managed to shake hands and
exchange a few words with Bush before the first session.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez came up to eavesdrop,
saying, ``I'm not going to miss this.'' But then the entire group
of leaders was ushered into the meeting hall.
   Afterwards, breaking for lunch, some leaders walked and some
drove the hundred yards down a tree-lined street to the conference
center.
   Ortega chose to walk and was immediately mobbed by journalists
who blocked the street. Behind him, Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani's driver leaned on his horn until the crowd parted.
   Many businesses were closed and traffic was much lighter than
usual in the capital, which was spruced up for the occasion.
   Buildings were newly painted and 20,000 roses, chrysanthemums
and tropical flowers were planted along parade routes and at
Democracy Plaza, which is to be dedicated Saturday.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who recently declared
he had given up supporting terrorism, said Friday he will continue
to back ``liberation movements.''
   Gadhafi told a magazine during a visit to Egypt this week that
Libya once aided terrorist groups but halted such support when ``we
discovered these groups were causing more harm than benefit to the
Arab cause.''
   In an interview Friday night with the Italian state network RAI,
Gadhafi was told Italians appreciated the remarks on terrorism.
   ``Yes, certainly,'' said the Libyan leader.
   But when pressed further on the issue, Gadhafi said Libya
continues to make a distinction between terrorism and liberation
movements, which he said he will continue to support.
   He did not elaborate. In the past, Gadhafi has described such
groups as the Irish Republican Army as ``liberation movements''
rather than terrorists.
   The U.S. State Department said Thursday that Gadhafi was still
supplying funds, weapons, safe havens and training facilities to
such groups as the Japanese Red Army, the IRA and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   In addition, the State Department said the Palestinian group
Fatah Revolutionary Council led by Abu Nidal still had headquarters
in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.

<TEXT>
   The Army is grounding most of its CH-47D
Chinook transport helicopters again because of a new problem with
transmission oil cooling fans, the Army announced Friday evening.
   Only eight days earlier, the helicopters affected _ 211 of the
264 in the fleet _ had been cleared to fly after another fan
problem was fixed.
   The fleet was grounded in August as a precaution while fan
failures were studied.
   The Army's Aviation Systems Command and the manufacturer, Boeing
Helicopter Co., determined that vibration most probably was causing
the fans to fail. The 211 machines that had not had failures were
given the green light to fly again on Oct. 19, provided that
modifications had been made, while studies continued on the 53
whose fans had failed.
   During inspection of the first craft to be modified, however, a
new problem was found in the lubrication of the fan shaft spline,
said the Army statement.
   The St. Louis-based Aviation Systems Command and the
manufacturer are now working on the lubrication problem in the 211
newly grounded helicopters and will check the 53 that had not been
cleared to fly, the Army said.

<HEAD>Air Force Chief of Staff Says Stealth Fighter Will Be Unveiled Soon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The radar-evading top-secret stealth fighter
will be shown to the public fairly soon, said a top Air Force
official on Friday.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force chief of staff, also said his
service arm will continue to modernize its fleet to respond to a
Soviet military capability undiminished by recent political changes
in Moscow.
   The Defense Department will decide shortly when to declassify
the F-117A stealth fighter, Welch said. Although the plane has been
flying for eight years, only two official pictures have been
released, one of them a drawing.
   ``Certainly at some point you'll have an opportunity to come and
take a closer look at it. I would think fairly soon,'' he said.
   Based at the Tonopah Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the jets are
carefully screened from public view. At least 52 F-117As have been
delivered.
   Welch insisted the existing fighter and bomber fleet could not
be upgraded to stealth capability to counter increasingly
sophisticated Soviet air defenses.
   Welch spoke to reporters before addressing a meeting of the Air
Force Association.
   The bat-winged B-2 stealth bomber, which was displayed to the
public in its maiden flight in July, and its fighter counterpart,
the F-117A, use sophisticated anti-radar technology.
   Welch said he was optimistic the B-2 stealth bomber, built by
Northrop Corp., will be deployed, despite congressional objections
to the estimated $70.5 billion it will cost to build a projected
fleet of 132 aircraft.
   ``I think there's no question that the B-2 program will go,''
Welch said. ``The issue is what will be the pace over the next two
years.''
   He acknowledged political and budget considerations left open
how many bombers ultimately will be built.
   ``For any one of us to try and predict at this point in time how
we're going to feel about the size of the bomber force four or five
years from now is kind of a futile exercise,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister Upholds 1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union supports the Czechoslovak
leaders who insist that the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
in 1968 was proper, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
said Friday.
   ``We may only change our appraisal of those developments from
the present day perspective by a joint decision (with
Czechoslovaia)'' he said. ``It is a very complicated, delicate and
difficult problem.''
   Shevardnadze made the comments in an intervicew with Adam
Michnik, an editor of the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza.
Michnik is a Solidarity deputy in the legislature and a former
political prisoner.
   He helped draft a resolution adopted by the Polish parliament
this August that condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia by
members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist Party leadership is
resisting reforms being pursued in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet
Union and opposes any revision of its stand that the invasion was
necessary.
   All of the Warsaw Pack members except Romania sent forces that
invaded Czechoslovakia Aug. 21, 1968, ousted the liberal Communist
Party government led by Alexander Dubcek and established a new
administration firmly within Soviet-bloc control.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika,
or restructuring, has been compared to the 1968 reforms in
Czechoslovakia but Soviet leaders have never said the invasion was
a mistake.
   Shevardnadze told Michnik, ``I deem it inadmissible for anyone
to impose his view of that problem (the invasion) on others. We
regard the appraisal made by the Czechoslovak Communist Party and
the Czechoslovak government as binding.''
   ``Czechoslovakia is a sovereign state and has an unquestionable
right to assess its own history independently,'' he added. ``The
appraisals passed by the Czechoslovak leaders then are not
different from their present ones and we respect them.''

   A European Ariane rocket blasted
off Friday night and placed the world's largest telecommunications
satellite into orbit.
   The 44-L rocket lifted off from the European Space Agency center
on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America.
   Less than a half-hour later, Arianespace, a consortium of 11
European countries, said the Intelsat VI satellite had been placed
into orbit.
   In the coming days, the satellite is to move into position over
central Africa to enter service with the Intelsat network of 13
satellites.
   Manufactured by nine international companies under the direction
of the Hughes Aircraft Co. of the United States, Intelsat VI weighs
9,500 pounds and measures 39 feet by 12 feet.
   With 24,000 simultaneous two-way telephone circuits and three
color television channels, the satellite will relay telephone,
television, fax, telex and data transmissions.
   It is the first of a new generation of five satellites planned
to be put into service by the Washington-based International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization, a nonprofit cooperative
of 117 nations.
   The mission marked the 34th launch since 1979 by Arianespace.
The four-stage rocket had been scheduled to lift off Oct. 5 but was
postponed when technicians found problems in the electrical
components that operate the vehicle's command systems.
   Arianespace has launched 33 satellites for orders totalling
$2.14 billion.

   Targets of a federal crackdown on marijuana
growers criticized the search-and-seizure tactics of drug agents
Friday, but officials defended them as necessary to stem the flow
of potent pot.
   ``They made one hell of a mess,'' said Steve Murphy, whose
Indoor Sun Shoppe was one of five Seattle stores raided. He said
agents took everything from his store except plants and baskets,
including two computers containing store records such as invoices
and payroll data.
   ``It seems a little ridiculous to pick on this shop,'' Murphy
said. ``You could start going to all the hardware stores and
lighting stores or just about any other place. We don't carry
anything that they don't have.''
   But Raymond McKinnon, agent in charge of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration in Seattle, defended the raids.
   ``One of the things we were particularly aiming at were the
business records,'' he said. ``Some of these people should be
concerned.''
   After two days of raids, drug agents around the country had
arrested 191 people by late Friday afternoon and seized 20,419
marijuana plants and 290 pounds of packaged marijuana, said a
federal law enforcement source in Washington, D.C.
   They also confiscated 137 indoor marijuana groves and searched
36 stores believed to sell equipment used in indoor marijuana
cultivation, seizing nine of them.
   The agents seized a total of $5.9 million in assets, primarily
the stores and equipment and some cash, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Officials said store records would be used for further
investigation.
   In the previous month, the investigation code-named Operation
Green Merchant resulted in the arrests of 112 people on charges of
cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing
17,000 plants, said DEA spokesman Frank Shults.
   ``The idea of this operation was to reassert to the American
public the idea of accountability,'' McKinnon said. ``There is no
area of drug trafficking that is immune to prosecution.''
   The biggest drug seizure over the last two days was in Columbus,
Ga., where agents discovered 3,400 marijuana plants in a barn on a
farm, the Washington source said.
   Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent John Pike said the
marijuana had an estimated street value of $8 million. The farmer
who is believed to have grown the marijuana was still at large, he
said.
   Agents also seized 1,440 plants at a site in Wichita, Kan., and
600 plants grown by an equipment store owner in San Diego, the
source said.
   Officials said Thursday they were targeting about 100 indoor
marijuana groves in 46 states and 65 stores in 22 states. Raids
will continue ``for as long as it takes,'' the source said.
   ``The point has to be made that anyone dealing drugs in this
community will be dealt with,'' said Mike McKay, U.S. attorney for
western Washington.
   In North Carolina, 76 people were charged with possession or
manufacturing of marijuana.
   Joseph Huberman of Raleigh, who was not arrested, said officers
searched his house because he had ordered a light meter to help
cultivate orchids from a mail-order company suspected by the DEA.
He said he allowed the agents into his home even though they did
not have a warrant.
   ``I feel like it's not good, eroding my civil rights for this
drug program,'' Huberman said. ``It must be a little inconvenient
for them to have to pay attention to the Constitution all the
time.''

   As heavy equipment growls through the
rubble of a collapsed Oakland freeway that killed dozens in last
week's earthquake, engineers Friday said the freeway's Achilles'
heel appears more obvious each day.
   While many factors contributed to Interstate 880's destruction,
engineers say, it appears that the bases of some of the vertical
support columns snapped. That allowed the upper lanes to slam down
on the roadway below, two separate engineering teams, one from the
University of California Berkeley and the other from UC San Diego,
reported.
   Neither team is ready to discount some of the other theories
that surfaced in the days following the Oct. 17 collapse of the
1\-mile section of the Nimitz Freeway.
   And, they added, many factors probably were involved, ranging
from shaky ground to the peculiar way the 32-year-old structure may
have fallen in step with the seismic waves.
   But the critical failure on the state's oldest double-decker
freeway appears to have been at the point where many of the upper
deck concrete columns attached to the lower deck, Jack P. Moehle,
an engineering professor and spokesman for the Berkeley team, said
Friday.
   ``From the sketches I've seen, it makes sense to me,'' said Nels
Roselund, whose South Pasadena engineering firm specializes in
earthquake-proofing old structures.
   The column joints, which Moehle said met construction standards
when they were built, might have held had they contained more
reinforcing steel.
   But engineers have more computer analysis and other testing to
perform before they can be certain, he and others said.
   Moehle added Friday that despite assertions from state
Department of Transportation engineers and others, the once-swampy
filled ground beneath the structure may have played a major role in
its collapse by ``amplifying'' the quake.
   ``We now have readings of ground motion (under the freeway) of
an increase of three-tenths G acceleration,'' he said. In contrast,
acceleration at nearby Berkeley was ``only point zero nine,''
Moehle said. A ``G'' is a unit of acceleration equal to the
acceleration of gravity.
   Subsurface maps released by the transportion department earlier
this week show that many of the structure's 25 miles of steel
pilings are in clay, and none of them reach bedrock. But Caltrans
chief structural engineer Jim Roberts said his geologists believe
most pilings found sufficient anchor on a layer of hard-packed sand
about 250 feet beneath the surface.
   Moehle criticized suggestions from critics that state engineers
who oversaw the project 32 years ago should have required more
steel in columns, and that they should have bolstered the columns'
strength since then.
   He said the work more than met prevailing construction standards
of the time, and Moehle and others expressed doubt that engineers
today could have anticipated the problems in the column joints.
   ``Unfortunately, we only learn about earthquakes from
earthquakes,'' said Clayton R. Giroux, the retired state engineer
who designed the structure.
   Roberts said that once the structure is razed at a cost of about
$10 million, a new freeway eventually will be built at an estimated
cost of $50 million to $100 million.

   Snow fell across the mountains of the Northwest on Friday while
most of the East continued to bask in unseasonably warm weather.
   In Idaho, 3 inches of snow fell during the morning in the
mountains east of Grangeville, and an inch of new snow covered the
ground at Sun Valley and Stanley.
   Winter storm warnings were posted into the night for the
mountains of east central and northern Idaho. As much as 10 inches
were expected at higher elevations, along with strong winds with
colder temperatures.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Friday night for the
northwest mountains of Wyoming, where up to a foot of snow was
expected. Advisories for rain and some snow were posted for the
Wasatch Mountains of Utah.
   Rain fell over the lower Gulf Coast of Texas and over north
central Texas, southwest Oklahoma, western Montana, the lower
elevations of western Idaho, and southwest Oregon. Showers and
occasional thunderstorms were over southeast Minnesota, central
Iowa, western Missouri, eastern Kansas, northeast Oklahoma,
southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico.
   Showers also dampened east central Florida, but skies were fair
and temperatures reached into the 70s in most other areas east of
the Mississippi.
   High temperature records for the date were set in Alpena, Mich.,
and Mansfield, Ohio, where it reached 73 degrees; Marquette, Mich.,
with 71, and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., where a reading of 72 degrees
broke the mark of 71 set in 1947.
   This morning's low for the Lower 48 was 5 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32 degrees at Mccall,
Idaho, to 86 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused Friday to
overturn the ban on allowing Ferdinand Marcos' body to be returned
to the Philippines.
   The ruling appeared to close the last legal move to allow the
former president to be buried in his homeland. But a pro-Marcos
lawyer said he would study the possibility of other legal maneuvers
to allow Marcos' widow, Imelda, and their three children to return
from exile.
   Mrs. Aquino praised the court decision.
   ``Let us now concentrate on solving the remaining problems of
our nation and together work for development and economic growth as
one people bearing one vision for the common good,'' she said.
   Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan told reporters the court ruled 8-7
to reject a petition filed by Marcos supporters Oct. 2 asking that
his body and his immediate family be allowed to return from Hawaii,
where Marcos died in exile Sept. 28.
   Mrs. Aquino banned the Marcoses, citing threats to national
security. Marcos was entombed in Hawaii Oct. 15 in what the family
said was a temporary burial.
   ``The threats to the government, to which the return of the
Marcoses has been viewed to provide a catalytic effect, have not
been shown to have ceased,'' the eight justices said in the
majority opinion.
   They cited recent statements by Marcos' widow, Imelda, that her
husband remained the legitimate president of the Philippines until
his death.
   In the dissenting opinion, Justice Abraham Sarmiento said the
threat allegedly posed by the Marcoses ``is the realm of
conjecture, speculation and imagination.''
   ``It's very unfortunate that the government missed a very rare
chance for reconciling our people,'' said Rolando Abadilla, vice
governor of Ilocos Norte province and a Marcos supporter.
   Abadilla said Marcos' fellow northerners were angry at the court
decision, and some of the women were shouting in the Tagalog
language, ``patayin si Cory!'' or ``kill Cory!''
   Former Solicitor Gen. Estelito Mendoza, one of the lawyers who
filed the petition for the Marcoses, said he will study new legal
strategies to lift the ban on Mrs. Marcos, Ferdinand Jr., and
daughters Irene Araneta and Imee Manotoc.
   ``The decision makes no mention whatsoever of why they are not
allowed to return to the country,'' Mendoza said.
   Lawyer Rafael Recto, another prominent Marcos supporter, said it
was unlikely the ban would be relaxed.
   ``There is no more hope for President Marcos and the family of
President Marcos to return here as long as the Aquino government is
here,'' Recto said. ``And Mrs. Aquino will never change her mind.
They are afraid of the living, and they are also afraid of the
dead.''
   The Aquino government has accused Marcos, his wife and hundreds
of associates of stealing up to $10 billion in public funds.
   In October 1988, a U.S. grand jury indicted the Marcoses on
racketeering charges in the alleged embezzlement. Mrs. Marcos is to
stand trial in New York in March.
   On Tuesday, about 200 Marcos supporters began a 250-mile march
from Ilocos Norte province to Manila to demand his body's return.
   Police said the group had reached La Union province, 150 miles
north of Manila, on Friday and chanted ``Cory is afraid of ghosts''
as it marched through towns.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday it's
``business as usual'' with a revamped cabinet after her treasury
chief quit, but critics and commentators called it the biggest
crisis of her 10 years in power.
   Many of Mrs. Thatcher's staunchest supporters blamed her
high-handed style of leadership for provoking Thursday's
resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and the
ensuing run on the pound and sharp drop on the London stock market.
   ``The City Hit For Billions,'' headlined Friday's Evening
Standard newspaper, saying Lawson's resignation had wiped billions
off share values, shaken the pound and raised the threat of another
interest rate increase.
   The main stock exchange index was off 2.2 percent for the day,
while the pound rebounded slightly from a sharp skid with the
support of the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
   The Independent newspaper's report that Conservative Party
legislators met secretly to discuss challenging Mrs. Thatcher's
leadership could not be confirmed. Conservative and opposition
lawmakers agreed that her authority had been undermined but did not
believe her job was under immediate threat.
   ``Not now. Net yet,'' said Ivor Stanbrook, a right-wing stalwart
in the House of Commons.
   In an interview published in Saturday's editions of the Daily
Express, Mrs. Thatcher was quoted as saying: ``I'm not going to
resign. I'm going to win the next election because everything I say
is in tune with the deep feelings people have.''
   The newspaper said the prime minister had initiated the
interview and that it was conducted Friday morning.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters as she left her home Friday morning
that government policies would continue ``precisely as they were''
despite having new men in charge at the treasury, the Foreign
Office and the Home Office.
   ``We have an excellent new team and it will be business as usual
and we shall go steadily forward,'' she said.
   But the headline in the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph blared
``Crisis For Thatcher'' and the normally pro-Conservative Times of
London said it was her biggest crisis since taking office in 1979.
The Financial Times editorialized she had put Lawson in an
impossible situation and might eventually follow him out of office.
   Lawson resigned because of a clash over currency policy with Sir
Alan Walters, Mrs. Thatcher's private economic adviser. Lawson
believed in a strong and stable pound, Walters advocated
free-floating exchange rates.
   Lawson also advocated joining the European Monetary System,
which Walters opposed and Mrs. Thatcher resisted. Differences over
European policy were also believed to be at the root of Mrs.
Thatcher's decision three months ago to remove Sir Geoffrey Howe as
foreign secretary.
   According to the British media, Mrs. Thatcher would not fire
Walters so Lawson resigned. Then, Walters resigned a few hours
after Lawson.
   Mrs. Thatcher replaced Lawson with his former deputy, John
Major, who had been foreign secretary for just three months. Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd, a former career diplomat, became foreign
secretary and David Waddington, the government's chief whip in the
House of Commons, replaced Hurd.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, blamed the
affair on ``the utter incompetence of the prime minister.''
   Labor's treasury spokesman John Smith asked, ``Why didn't she
get rid of Walters before and keep Lawson? It is something that is
so staggeringly incompetent and inept.''
   Kenneth Baker, the Conservative Party chairman, began the
government's attempts at damage control early Friday, dismissing
any suggestion that Mrs. Thatcher's position was at risk.
   ``She has been in many difficulties and come through them
successfully. There is not an economic crisis. The economy of the
country remains very strong,'' Baker told the BBC.
   Sir William Clark, chairman of the Conservative Party's
parliamentary finance committee, said suggestions of a leadership
change were ``pie-in-the-sky.''
   But Michael Dobbs, former chief of staff at the party's
headquarters, wrote in the Evening Standard that Mrs. Thatcher has
only herself to blame.
   ``A challenge to her leadership is far from inevitable, but it
is no longer inconceivable,'' Dobbs wrote.
   Peter Jenkins, the respected columnist of The Independent who
wrote a book about Mrs. Thatcher in 1987, said that Thursday had
been ``her most disastrous day's work in 10 years.''
   ``There is now a smell of decay in the air,'' Jenkins wrote.

   Uneasiness sat next to humor, anticipation
alongside cheer and bad memories mostly by themselves as the World
Series returned Friday to Candlestick Park and the Bay area's
quake-scarred stage.
   ``Concerned?'' San Francisco postal worker Cliff Cehand said.
``Not on your life. I figure you've got to have a sense of humor
about all this.
   ``If I didn't,'' he added, patting a black construction helmet
with Giants' logo plastered all over it, ``I wouldn't have this
on.''
   An earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale sent shock
waves rippling across the 29-year-old concrete stadium at 5:04
p.m., Oct. 17. A capacity crowd of 62,000, unaware of the
devastation it had wrought elsewhere, reacted almost with
merriment, chanting ``Let's Play Ball, Let's Play Ball,'' and
remaining calm until the park was cleared out three hours later.
   It wasn't until many in the stands heard on transistor radios,
or saw on miniature televisions, that the Bay Bridge had collapsed
that they began to comprehend the enormity of the destruction away
from the park.
   Scores were killed, many along a collapsed section of Interstate
880 in Oakland, and thousands more left homeless.
   On Friday, to remember the victims of the Oct. 17 quake, as well
as celebrate the good fortune of those who escaped unharmed, a
moment of silence was observed at 5:04 p.m.
   It finished with rousing cheers, and fans then joined together
to sing along to ``San Francisco,'' a song from the 1936 movie of
the same title, about the earthquake that ravaged the city in 1906.
   Their thoughts returned to baseball quickly, however, and the
chant ``Go Giants'' was cascading down from the stands just a few
minutes later.
   Baseball officials initially set the resumption of play for
Tuesday, but postponed Game 3 for four more days after a request
from Mayor Art Agnos.
   Earlier in the week, local newspapers carried more classified
ads offering to sell Game 3 tickets than Chevys or Fords. But as
game time neared, ticket scalpers clearly were losing the upper
hand.
   Hector Reyna flew in from Honolulu late Thursday night and after
scanning those same ads, was prepared to pay $50 to $300. He wound
up buying two from schoolteacher Derald Cook for $300 total.
   ``We planned to come in here for Game 5 originally and we were
sitting on a sailboat in the ocean when we heard about it,'' said
Reyna, a paint salesman. ``Once we knew they were starting up, we
were even more certain about going.
   ``I wasn't scared,'' he added. ``In fact, the thing that worried
me most about coming out was the flight. We took a DC-10.''
   Cook found his end of the transaction rewarding as well. He had
attended the Oct. 17 game with his father, but couldn't coax him
into returning.
   ``He said he had something that he had to take care of,''
laughed Cook, ``and he said he had something to take care of every
night for the rest of the week.
   ``I bought tickets for all of the games,'' he added, ``and this
one deal covered my cost for all the rest.''
   Though few in the stadium needed any more reminders of what had
transpired during their last outing to Candlestick, reminders were
everywhere. Ushers carried flashlights, and several ballplayers
carried video cameras.
   ``I'm not worried. It makes sense to go where the bombs last
dropped,'' said season ticketholder Tom Darnell at a tailgating
party in Candlestick's spacious parking lot.
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``I couldn't convince my wife to come
back with me.''
   ``Yeah,'' chimed in his friend, Jim Ferrell, ``the only thing
she said to him was `Honey, are the insurance papers all signed?'
as he tried to get out the door.''

   Buildings housing the Spanish
Trade Mission and Spanish Labor Bureau were damaged by bombs Friday
night and a passerby suffered cuts from flying glass in the second
blast, police reported.
   On Tuesday a bomb destroyed the car of Spanish Consul General
Gil Catalina. There were no injuries in that attack.
   No individual or group has claimed responsibility for the
bombings but Dutch newspapers speculated they were carried out by
terrorists of the ETA Basque separatist organization. ETA
guerrillas have been fighting for years for autonomy for the Basque
provinces in northern Spain.
   Police spokesman Nico Laterveer said the first explosion Friday
occurred at 10:45 p.m. at the Spanish Trade Mission and the second
blast came minutes later at the building of the Spanish Labor
Bureau, about two blocks away.
   The passerby was injured in the Labor Bureau bombing.
   Laterveer said that in both cases explosive devices apparently
were thrown through windows into the buildings.
   The explosion started a fire in the Trade Mission that was
quickly extinguished, he added.
   Police increased security near all Spanish government buildings
in this diplomatic capital after Tuesday's bombing.
   The Spanish Embassy issued a statement Wednesday saying no
threats had been received.
   The initials ETA stand for Basque Land and Liberty in the Basque
language.

   Two members of Congress coaxed a

about missing Americans in Southeast Asia.
   Al Ziegler of Oregon, who has been fasting in the cage since
Sept. 22, said he will keep a vigil there until Veterans Day.
   Reps. Bob Smith, R-N.H., and Denny Smith, R-Ore., said they
would introduce legislation calling for release of government

Southeast Asia.
   Bob Smith said Ziegler lost 23 pounds during the fast, dropping
to 140 pounds.

<TEXT>
   Police are recruiting 2,000 additional
officers for the period leading up to independence, and former
rebels and anti-insurgency police are welcome to apply, a police
official said Friday.
   Maj. Gen. Piet Fouche, acting commissioner of the South-West
African police, said the main reasons for the recruitment drive
were an increase in petty crime and the need to protect political
candidates prior to the Nov. 7-11 pre-independence elections.
   The United Nations is supervising the elections, which will end
South Africa's 74-year rule of Namibia.
   At the insistence of the United Nations, the Namibian
administrator-general, Louis Pienaar, last month ordered that the
anti-guerrilla police unit Koevoet be disbanded.
   Koevoet means ``crowbar'' in the Afrikaans language. The
1,500-member force fought the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the guerrilla group that for 23 years tried to drive
South Africa from the territory. Koevoet was accused of atrocities
in northern Namibia.
   Fouche said former Koevoet members as well as SWAPO guerrillas
who have returned from exile to vote for a constitutional assembly
next month are welcome to join the police force. Applicants with
``prior experience'' could be deployed within two weeks, he said.
   He said the recruitment drive was not an attempt to get around
the U.N. demand that Koevoet be disbanded.
   SWAPO leaders have said that after independence, soldiers who
fought on both sides will have to be reintegrated into a new army
and police force, but they also have insisted that Koevoet men be
excluded during the election period.
   SWAPO is expected to win the most votes in the balloting.

<TEXT>
   A former Navy procurement official was
sentenced to 18 months in prison Friday for accepting $475,000 in
bribes from two defense firms seeking inside bid information on
lucrative contracts.
   Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 60, was sentenced on his guilty plea to
conspiracy, receiving bribes and tax evasion by U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va.
   Tomlin could have received a 25-year sentence for taking
$400,000 from Sperry Corp. and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. in
exchange for confidential information about a multi-million-dollar
contract to maintain electronic components of naval weapons.
   Tomlin pleaded guilty July 14 and has been cooperating with the
Justice Department's continuing investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud, which is nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   As part of his plea agreement, Tomlin returned $385,000 from a
Swiss bank account in which he kept the money.
   Hilton, noting that Tomlin is now penniless, did not impose a
fine.
   Tomlin was the third former Pentagon official to admit taking
bribes in the matter. Stuart E. Berlin, a former naval engineer,
and Jack Sherman, a one-time Marine Corps official, have also
pleaded guilty and been sentenced for their involvement in the
procurement scandal.
   As a result of Tomlin's cooperation, Frank J. Lavelle, a former
Sperry Corp. marketing executive, pleaded guilty last week to
charges he initiated the scheme by his company to bribe Tomlin.
   Investigators are trying to piece together evidence to bring
charges against an unidentified Sperry executive who approved the
payments at the request of a former vice president, Charles F.
Gardner.
   Gardner last month was sentenced to 32 months in prison for his
involvement in a separate bribery scheme.
   Sperry Corp. became part of Unisys Corp. following a 1986
takeover by Burroughs Corp.
   Tomlin has also identified a Honeywell official to whom he gave
four boxes of documents that included bid submissions from
competing companies, according to court papers.
   The Honeywell official, not identified in the court papers, told
Tomlin that the $75,000 bribe had been approved by his superiors.

<HEAD>Reports 1,087 Detained for Anti-Government Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman said Friday that
1,087 people have been detained for ``disruptive activities'' since
army commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in September 1988.
   Western diplomatic sources said the number of political
prisoners is much higher.
   Col. Than Tun told a weekly news briefing that the figure of
1,087 detentions since the Sept. 18, 1988, coup did not include
common criminals.
   Saw Maung has ruled by martial law since the coup.
   Some Rangoon-based Western diplomats, contacted by telephone,
estimated the government had detained several thousand people since
it intensified its crackdown on dissidents in July. The diplomats,
speaking with the condition of anonymity, said they did not have
specific figures.
   A week ago a government spokesman said civilian courts and
military tribunals had sentenced 100 people to death in the past
three months for various crimes. He said 24 of the defendants were
convicted by military courts set up to deal with martial-law
violations.
   The diplomats said Burma's leading opposition group, the
National League for Democracy, has been hardest hit by the
political suppression.
   On July 20 the government put league chairman Tin Oo and general
secretary Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest on charges of
subversion.
   The government allowed the formation of some 200 political
parties after it announced plans to hold multiparty elections next
May _ the first such elections in Burma for a quarter of a century.
   But the opposition ``has very little opportunity to talk or to
organize'' because of the crackdown on dissent, one of the
diplomats said, and many of the parties are not active.
   The military junta has said it will not support any party in the
campaign but the diplomats said it obviously favors the
pro-military National Unity Party, successor to the Burma Socialist
Program Party that ruled from 1962-88.
   Two other groups, the League For Democracy and Peace led by
former Prime Minister Nu and the Union National Democracy Party
headed by Aung Gyi, apparently are more free to operate than the
National League for Democracy, the diplomats said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has shown other
countries a draft United Nations resolution calling for a
moratorium on the use of high seas drift nets by the summer of
1992, a State Department official said Friday.
   ``The text has been circulated to a number of countries and we
are now in a consultative process in the U.N.,'' said Ed Wolfe, the
State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries.
   Under the proposed resolution, the moratorium would take effect
``unless or until it is agreed based on scientific data that the
unacceptable impact of such practices can be prevented and the
conservation of the world's living marine resources can be
ensured.''
   Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is
expected to formally introduce the resolution within the next few
weeks.
   The resolution notes that thousands of vessels use drift nets in
the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.
   American fishermen say drift net vessels from Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea have been snaring millions of U.S. salmon in the North
Pacific and that fish runs in the Washington state, Oregon and
Alaska have declined as a result of the illegal harvest.
   The fishermen also insist the U.S. tuna catch has fallen as a
result of drift net fishing in the South Pacific.
   The small-mesh, monofilament nets, ostensibly used to catch
squid, snare anything they come in contact with and
environmentalists have charged they kill thousands of marine
mammals, sea birds and other marine animals annually.
   The nets can stretch more than 30 miles in length and on any
given day can cover more than 30,000 miles of ocean.
   Earlier this year, the United States signed bilateral
enforcement and monitoring agreements with Taiwan, Korea and Japan
and the Bush administration has been reluctant to seek an
international ban on drift nets until those pacts expire next year.

   Jamie Fiske, whose 1982 liver transplant
helped shape the nation's organ transplant policy, is going home in
time for Halloween after recovering from spleen removal surgery, a
hospital spokeswoman said Friday.
   The 7-year-old and her mother, Marilyn, are scheduled to fly
home Saturday to East Bridgewater, Mass., said Mary Stanik,
spokeswoman for the University of Minnesota Hospital.
   ``She has been just great for two weeks'' since being readmitted
to the hospital after suffering internal bleeding, Stanik said.
   Jamie was admitted on Oct. 5 after suffering three bouts of
internal bleeding within a month. Doctors removed Jamie's spleen,
which doctors said was seven or eight times its normal size.
   The day after she left the hospital, however, Jamie suffered
more internal bleeding and was readmitted. Stanik said Jamie has
had no more bleeding since then.
   Charles Fiske said his daughter often asked if she would be home
in time for Halloween, her favorite holiday. She plans to dress as
the Queen of Hearts.
   Jamie was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition
in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the
Fiskes learned only a liver transplant could save her life.
   In 1982, Fiske made an emotional appeal for a donor during a
convention at the American Academy of Pediatricians. A few days
later, a Utah family offered to donate the liver of their
11-month-old son, who was killed in an accident.
   Jamie's case raised questions about the procedures for determing
who should receive organ transplants and the properiety of awarding
organs on the basis of publicity. One result was the National
Transplant Act, which created a national computer system that
matches donors to recipients.

<TEXT>
   Abortion opponents Friday dropped
efforts to put proposed abortion restrictions before the General
Assembly this fall but pledged to renew their efforts in the spring.
   Ralph Rivera, chairman of the Illinois Pro-Life Coalition, said
there appears to be no chance of getting the bill through the House
Rules Committee, which blocked the measure by a one-vote margin
earlier this month.
   ``As of this time, we haven't been able to get the 10th vote
based on the makeup of the committee,'' Rivera said.
   The decision likely postpones any action on abortion legislation
until the General Assembly's spring session, which begins in early
April.
   Gary LaPaille, chief of staff to House Speaker Michael Madigan,
confirmed that the measure would not be scheduled for consideration
in the Rules Committee this week, the last scheduled week of the
fall session.
   The proposal, drafted to mirror Missouri restrictions upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court in July, would require doctors to determine
the viability of any fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older
before performing an abortion.
   It also would require a second physician to be present at the
abortion of any fetus determined to be viable, and would bar public
employees and public facilities from being involved in abortions.
   Pam Sutherland, executive director of Planned
Parenthood-Illinois, said the announcement was a clear signal
lawmakers had responded to lobbying by abortion rights supporters.
   ``They heard from a lot of people,'' she said.
   Rivera said anti-abortion groups would work to defeat
abortion-rights lawmakers in the statewide primary in March.
   ``We're going to be working very strongly to secure more votes _
not just in the committee, but the General Assembly as a whole,''
he said. ``Those who haven't been with us we are going to have to
replace if we can.''
   Ms. Sutherland said pro-choice groups are prepared to work
actively on behalf of their candidates as well.
   ``My reaction is, isn't it wonderful that Illinois families
don't have to worry about this this fall, but they will later this
spring,'' she said.

   A two-night rampage at a state prison
ended Friday with a guard and three inmates seriously injured, five
hostages freed and much of the overcrowded institution destroyed or
damaged by fire, authorities said.
   It also left Pennsylvania corrections officials scrambling to
find cells for 960 prisoners from the State Correctional
Institution at Camp Hill, which was 45 percent over its capacity at
2,600 inmates, according to Attorney General Ernie Preate.
   The state prison system as a whole is 48 percent over capacity.
   The first 10 buses carrying inmates to other prisons across the
state left Friday night from Camp Hill, in a rural area west of
Harrisburg.
   There were no deaths and no escapes, officials said. More than
100 people were injured, one hospitalized in critical condition, in
the battle to take back the medium-security prison.
   ``It was a lot of waiting, but when we do it, we do it,'' said
one state trooper, who declined to give his name.
   Five staff members taken hostage were either released by inmates
or rescued by police, Corrections Department spokesman Ken Robinson
said.
   Police stormed a kitchen building with guns firing, wounding one
inmate as they began taking back control of the prison Friday
morning after fires spewed eye-burning smoke into the early morning
darkness, officials said. The officers also used tear gas.
   Robinson announced at 9:35 a.m. that officials were ``again in
control of the institution,'' nearly 15 hours after inmates somehow
freed themselves during a lockdown imposed because of a seven-hour
riot Wednesday.
   State police in riot gear and wielding shotguns pushed
surrendering or captured prisoners to the ground, holding them
face-down in the grass of a prison courtyard.
   ``At one point, all inmates were out of all the cellblocks,''
Robinson said.
   The Corrections Department late in the afternoon said 960
inmates from Camp Hill would be moved to five other prisons in the
state. The department said inmates were being sent to the
Graterford, Mercer, Pittsburgh, Smithfield and Waymart state
prisons.
   Fourteen of 31 buildings were gutted by fire, Robinson said,
including eight modular housing units.
   Although officials initally believed eight hostages were taken,
the number turned out to be five, Robinson said.
   None of the hostages suffered life-threatening injuries,
officials said.
   Robinson said more than 100 people were injured during the two
nights. They included 34 prison employees, 32 inmates and 10 state
police or firefighters.
   An 18-year-old inmate was in critical condition with a gunshot
wound to the upper torso, said Marianne Benjamin, a spokeswoman for
Polyclinic Medical Center in Harrisburg.
   A 24-year-old inmate was listed in serious condition after at
least three hours of surgery for a small-caliber gunshot wound to
the abdomen, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center spokesman Steve
Bortner said.
   A 41-year-old guard who was listed as critical was upgraded to
serious condition with multiple stab wounds to the back, Hershey
spokeswoman Marybeth Bruchwalski said.
   Another inmate was in fair condition at Harrisburg Hospital,
also with a gunshot wound, said supervisor Gail Kraus. She said she
did not have an age.
   Only four hours before violence broke out a second time,
Superintendent Robert M. Freeman had said the first night's
problems might have been linked to a decision to prohibit families
from bringing food to inmates during extended visits. He also said
inmates were upset by a change in the way they received medical
care.
   ``You always expect something like this could happen,'' said
Mattie Humphrey, a prison volunteer whose son, Milton, is an inmate
serving 10 to 20 years on a weapons offense. ``I think the change
in the rule that denied family members to bring prisoners
home-prepared food was one of the reasons for the rioting.''
   A state trooper, who said he was on duty all night and had been
inside the prison, described the complex as ``totally trashed.''
   ``The cellblocks I was in, two cellblocks, are completely
demolished,'' said the trooper, who refused to give his name.
   Shortly after dawn, a state police helicopter swooped over the
prison, and a trooper using a loudspeaker urged any inmate who
wanted to surrender to lie on the ground. One inmate was seen
waving a white bed sheet at a window inside and a short time later
three more white ``flags'' were seen in more windows.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III blocked
a speech by a senior White House official that gave a pessimistic
assessment of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's prospects of
revamping the Soviet economy, the White House said Friday.
   On a flight to Costa Rica, White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater acknowledged there were various opinions about
Gorbachev's prospects within the Bush administration.
   But, Fitzwater said, even with opinions ``all over the lot''
about the future of perestroika, ``the point is we want it to
endure.''
   The White House spokesman added: ``That's the president's
policy.''
   The speech had been scheduled by Robert M. Gates, the deputy
national security adviser. The New York Times gave the first
account of his muzzling.
   Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Bush
headed for a hemisphere summit meeting in San Jose: ``It's not
really a question of policy. It's a question of analysis and
interpretation of events that the State Department felt was better
left unsaid at this point.''
   In a San Jose news conference, Baker said ``there is no division
of opinion whatsoever about policy.''
   ``I suggested the timing was not the very best'' for Gates'
speech, he said, coming soon after two Baker speeches sounding a
very positive tone toward the Soviets and a speech by Vice
President Dan Quayle that Baker said he had been reported as
harder-line than was really the case.
   ``This is strictly a question of timing,'' Baker said.
   ``This speech dealt with the durabilty of reforms, not the
desirability of the reforms. It did not deal with the policy
question _ Do we, should we, want to see perestroika succeed?''
   Quayle, in an interview on the Cable News Network ``John
Mclaughlin's One-on-One'' show taped Friday for weekend broadcast,
said, ``I think the decision was correct'' to stop the Gates'
speech.
   Baker frequently has wished Gorbachev well in his reconstruction
effort. But except for offering some undefined technical advice,
the secretary of state has stressed it was up to the Soviets to
determine their future.
   Gates, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, had been scheduled to speak to the National Collegiate
Security Conference in Bethesda, Md., a student seminar.
   Some other officials of the Bush administration, including
Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger, have registered public skepticism about
Gorbachev's prospects.
   Baker, whose top aides initially described Gorbachev as mostly
deft at public relations and adapting U.S. ideas on arms control,
has gradually warmed to the Soviet leader's uphill campaign to
change the Soviet system.
   Gates, in a speech last year, said Gorbachev had ``not really
changed'' the Soviet pattern. ``Russian and Soviet history caution
us to be skeptical and cautious,'' the then-CIA official said.
   The speech disturbed George P. Shultz, who was then secretary of
state. According to a knowledgeable U.S. official, Shultz
complained to Gates after it was delivered.

<HEAD>Inventor of Pull-Tab Can Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrialist Ermal Cleon Fraze, who during
a night of insomnia invented the removable pull-tab opener used on
beer and soft drink cans, has died at the age of 76.
   Fraze died Thursday of a brain tumor at Kettering Memorial
Hospital in Dayton, the hospital said.
   Fraze, who obtained his first patent for the pull tab-can in
1963, was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., and sold newspapers as
a child.
   He later moved to Dayton, where his first job was assembling
novelties for boxes of Cracker Jack candy. In 1950, he started
Dayton Reliable Tool and Manufacturing Co., which has five plants
and 360 workers in Dayton.
   In 1959, while on a family picnic with some friends, Fraze
became frustrated when, lacking a can opener, he had to use a car
bumper to open a can of beer, said Fraze's son, Mark.
   ``And he said, `There must be a better way,''' Mark Fraze said.
   The inspiration came one night when Fraze couldn't sleep. He got
up at 1:30 a.m. to work on a way to attach an opening lever to a
can.
   ``I was only going to work on this thing for an hour,'' he said
later. ``But I was up all night and it came to me _ just like that.
It was all there. I knew how to do it so it would be commercially
feasible.''
   Fraze's removable top was replaced in the 1970s by a
non-removable tab.
   A patent for the later model was transferred to him by its
inventor in 1978, but a patent for a similar item was issued the
next year to Continental Can Co. Inc. of Delaware.
   Fraze sued Continental for patent infringement and lost.
   Besides his son, Mark, Fraze is survived by his wife, Martha,
and another son.

<HEAD>Survey: Kids Would More Likely Heed Parents' Advice if Past Use Admitted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighty-six percent of children say they'd be more
likely to listen to parents' advice about drugs if parents were
honest about their own drug use, according to a nationwide survey
released Thursday.
   Ninety-seven percent of the 500 parents polled said they discuss
drugs with their children, but 70 percent agreed most parents are
ill-equipped for such talks.
   Yet 95 percent of both parents and children reported a
``positive impact'' from the talks, which was not defined.
Eighty-nine percent of the 500 children surveyed said they had
discussed drugs with their parents.
   The survey was conducted by The Gallup Organization for Waste
Management Inc., the world's largest waste handler.
   The random interviews involved parents of children 8 to 17 years
old and children 10 to 17 years old. The survey had a margin of
error of plus or minus six percentage points, Gallup said.
   ``Talking can be the most important element to avoiding drug
problems,'' said Dr. Martin Goldstein, a child psychologist at
Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. ``But God knows, it's more than telling
kids to `Just say no.'''
   If all such efforts were successful, ``I don't think we'd have
as many teens in crisis as we do,'' Goldstein said.
   The survey said 66 million Americans have tried drugs and that
many parents don't know whether to acknowledge their own use while
discouraging their children from it.
   But most children surveyed agreed at least somewhat that ``if
your parents told you that they had used drugs in the past, you
would be more likely to listen to what they have to say.''
   ``If the message is, `I had a problem and I got help,' it's very
helpful because it teaches kids there are solutions,'' Goldstein
said. ``But it's just hypocritical if they say, `Do as I say, not
as I do.'''
   George Gallup Jr., co-chairman of the polling company, said he
was surprised so many parents had talked to their children about
drugs.
   ``The good part of all this is that it may be opening up deeper
channels for communication between parents and children,'' Gallup
said in a telephone interview after a Chicago news conference
Thursday.
   Waste Management, based in suburban Oak Brook, said it
commissioned the study partly because some job applicants were
failing drug-screening tests. An estimated 700 failed this year out
of a total of 10,000 applicants.
   ``In my view, an alarming number of employees are failing these
tests,'' company Chairman Dean L. Buntrock said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   ``We're aimed at children because that's where we can make the
greatest impact with education at a vulnerable age,'' he said.
``Time goes fast, and very quickly they'll become part of the labor
force in this country.''
   The company has produced a videotape, available free through
schools and some video stores, to encourage discussions between
parents and children.
   The Gallup survey also found:
   _ Fifty-eight percent of the children surveyed felt they knew
more about drugs than their parents, while 40 percent of parents
felt they were better informed.
   _ Both parents and children believe drug education should have
begun sooner in their case. Parents suggested it start when
children are 5{; the youngsters suggested 8{.
   _ Nearly 75 percent of parents agreed that ``it doesn't matter
what you say, some kids will have drug problems anyway.''
   _ Twenty-two percent of all children and 34 percent of 10- and
11-year-olds agreed with the statement, ``My parents don't have
time to talk to me about drugs.'' Fourteen percent of parents said
their children don't have time.

   A landlord accused of discrimination for
denying housing to an unmarried couple paid a $700 fine under
protest Friday, but said he would take his case to the U.S. Supreme
Court if necessary.
   Layle French, 33, of Marshall, and his attorney James Anderson
delivered the money in $1 bills to the office of Attorney General
Hubert Humphrey III.
   ``I'm being force to allow people, who in my opinion are living
in sin, on my property,'' said French.
   On June 7, French was fined $1,048 by an administrative law
judge who held that French violated the state's anti-discrimination
law when he reneged on an agreement to rent his former house to Sue
Parsons. She said she intended to live in the house with her fiance
and French decided it would violate his religious beliefs to rent
to the couple before they were married.
   French said he willingly paid $348 in compensatory damages
earlier because he broke a verbal contract to rent the house to
Parsons. He said the $700 to pay the civil penalty was raised in
individual contributions of $1 each.

   Fernando Collor de Mello held a
2-to-1 lead over his closest rival three weeks before the
presidential election, according to a poll published Friday.
   However, support rating for the right-of-center candidate
dropped from 45 percent in early September to 29.3 percent by the
first week of October, according to the poll by the Gallup
institute, the daily O Globo reported.
   On Nov. 15, 82 million Brazilians are to choose a successor to
President Jose Sarney for a five-year term, the first popular vote
for president since 1960. Free elections were banned during a
1964-1985 right-wing military regime.
   If no candidate wins a majority, the two top vote-getters will
face each other in a runoff in December.
   For the poll, Gallup questioned 4,922 people in 226 cities
between Oct. 18-25 across this nation of 145 million. Surveyors
interviewed people at random in the street and their homes. The
margin of error was 3 percent.
   Left-wing populist Leonel Brizola, a former governor of two
states, was in second place with 13.7 percent support, roughly what
he polled a month ago, according to the survey.
   Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the radical-left Workers'
Party polled 12.4 percent. Sen. Mario Covas of the left-of-center
Brazilian Social Democratic Party received the support of 8.2
percent of those surveyed.
   Eight percent of voters were unsure of who they would vote for
and 3.5 percent said they would cast blank ballots.
   Collor de Mello, of the National Reconstruction Party, has held
a large lead in the polls since April. His image as a political
``outsider'' and promises to fight corruption won him national
appeal.
   But analysts say charges of corruption during his tenure as
governor of Alagoas state caused Collor de Mello's popularity to
slip.

   Engineers this summer discovered and
were moving to fix a seismic design flaw on three San Francisco
double-decker freeways _ a flaw that scientists believe caused the
deadly collapse of a similar double-decker, a top state engineer
acknowledged Friday.
   Oakland's Interstate 880 was overlooked, despite the fact that
it was the oldest of five such double-decker freeways in Northern
California, because ``nobody in the Department'' of Transportation
remembered until after last week's earthquake that I-880 might also
share the flaw in its upper support column ``hinges,'' Caltrans
chief structural engineer Jim Roberts said.
   Two scientific teams from the Universities of California at
Berkeley and San Diego have tentatively decided that the
``hinges,'' or joints, sheared off during the quake, permitted
I-880's upper deck to slam down, killing more than three dozen
motorists on the lower deck.
   Would the repair planned for San Francisco's double-deckers have
prevented Oakland's I-880 collapse? Roberts was asked during a
daily press briefing.
   ``The answer, I believe, is affirmative,'' he said. ``I think it
would have gone a long way.''
   But, Roberts said, even if I-880 had been on the list for
repair, it would not have been done prior to Oct. 17.
   Hinge repairs on the other three will be expedited following the
I-880 collapse, he said. The three, the Embarcadero, the China
Basin, and the Central viaducts, all were damaged in the quake and
are temporarily closed.
   Engineers discovered the hinge flaw in the Embarcadero Viaduct
during an August review on whether it more earthquake-proofing
work, Roberts said. He confirmed the contents of an Aug. 21
internal memorandum brought to his attention Thursday.
   The memo, from one of his engineers to another, turned up in a
flood of departmental documents turned over to the news media this
week.
   Roberts, who said Thursday he was not aware of the memo and
questioned its acccuracy. On Friday, he confirmed the memo's
statement that at his request, the other two San Francisco viaducts
would be added to the list because state engineers recalled that
they too contained the flaw.
   Asked how I-880 could be overlooked, Roberts said, ``Maybe it
was the lack of foresight.'' And later he said, ``That's
hindsight.''
   Roberts also acknowledged that repair on the three was not
awaiting development of ``technology'' to strengthen
``multicolumn'' bridges, despite his and other Caltrans' officials'
assertions to the contrary earlier this week.
   While this remains the case with most of the state's 700
multicolumn structures that need column bolstering, engineers
planned to  a physician stabilizes a leg, he said.
   But the splints ``are not very good looking, and you're not
going to leave them up permanently,'' he said.

   Four Air Force reconnaissance planes are
searching the Hawaiian Islands for marijuana fields as the crews
are flying training missions there, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The RF-4C reconnaissance planes are from the 67th Tactical
Reconnaissance Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas, said
Defense Department spokesman Army Maj. John Smith.
   Smith said he did not know how many missions the planes have
flown or whether they've found any marijuana.
   The four planes, along with 50 support personnel, are operating
out of Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii during the operation, he
said.
   Smith said National Guard planes have flown similar operations
over the islands as far back as the 1970s but he did not know if
federal armed forces had done so in the past.
   At Bergstrom, Sgt. Vern Paul, a spokeswoman, confirmed that
flights were being made over Hawaii and said she did not know when
they started.

   Noah Robinson, the half brother of Jesse Jackson,
was charged Friday with hiring members of a gang to kill a business
associate, defrauding a restaurant chain and supplying narcotics to
the gang's drug operation.
   In addition, 65 top leaders and members of the El Rukn street
gang were indicted on charges including racketeering, murdering 20
people, attempting to kill seven others, witness intimidation,
kidnapping and obstruction of justice, U.S. Attorney Anton R.
Valukas announced at a news conference.
   The El Rukns were charged with controlling a major part of
Chicago's drug market over the last 24 years. The indictment also
charged five Robinson associates with fraud, racketeering and
conspiracy.
   A number of El Rukns also were charged with racketeering and
traveling across states to acquire an M-72 Series Light Anti-Tank
Weapon, known as a LAW rocket, to carry out terrorism activities in
the United States for the government of Libya.
   ``The El Rukns developed from a street gang into a paramilitary
organization which acquired money and power ... (through) murder,
narcotics distribution, terrorism, robbery, extortion,
intimidation, fraud, bribery, kidnapping and obstruction of
justice,'' Valukas said.
   The arrests could help solve up to 50 unsolved slayings dating
to the late 1960s, said Dot Koester, spokewoman for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Washington.
   Robinson, 45, was arrested at his South Side home Friday,
Valukas said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 249 years in
prison.
   Robinson and Jackson, a Democratic candidate for president in
1984 and 1988, have the same father, but Jackson has described
their relationship as strained.
   Robinson's associates face an average of 160 years in prison if
convicted. The El Rukns face anywhere from four years to life in
prison.
   The indictment charged that Robinson sold heroin and cocaine to
a drug operation that controlled hundreds of markets in Chicago and
Milwaukee and had ties to several states including New York, South
Carolina, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Wisconsin and Mississippi.
   The drug operation netted millions of dollars in profits,
Valukas said.
   Robinson is charged with paying El Rukn leader Jeff Fort $10,000
to kill business associate Robert Aulston in 1985. It also alleges
that Robinson offered $10,000 to kill Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber in
Greenville, S.C.
   Barber was killed Jan. 3, 1986. Robinson was convicted and
sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison in connection
with the murder-for-hire of a witness to the Barber killing. He is
free on a $1.1 million bond pending an appeal.
   Fort is serving 155 years in a federal prison on a 1988
conviction for offering to commit terrorism for Libya. Four other
gang members also were convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorism
and conspiracy to violate federal firearms and explosives laws.
   Robinson and five associates also were charged with skimming
$650,000 from the profits of three Wendy's International Inc.
restaurants on Chicago's South Side through the management company
they controlled.
   Seventeen of the El Rukns and the five Robinson associates
charged were in custody. The remaining defendants were being sought
in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, South Carolina, Ohio and New York,
Valukas said.

   The White House and the Senate Intelligence
Committee agree on liberalized conditions for future U.S.
involvement in coup attempts aimed at ousting Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega, the panel's chairman says.
   The Bush administration and the Senate panel reached ``a meeting
of the minds'' at meetings over the past two weeks, culminating in
a detailed session Thursday with representatives of the CIA, the
Pentagon and the State Department, said Senate committee Chairman
David Boren, D-Okla.
   Boren said his understanding is that U.S. officials will be free
to counsel and consult with potential coup plotters so long as the
plot does not specifically set out to assassinate Noriega.
   Also on Thursday, the intelligence panel approved a bill
authorizing intelligence activities for the next two years and
settling a long-running dispute over how the president reports
clandestine overseas operations to Congress.

   An earthquake more deadly than last week's
jolt is 50 percent likely near San Francisco, and a catastrophic
``big one'' is at least 60 percent probable in Southern California
by the year 2018, scientists say.
   Overall odds for such quakes, which could kill thousands of
people, were listed in a 1988 U.S. Geological Survey study. They
remain unchanged by the Oct. 17 upheaval that claimed at least 63
lives in the San Francisco Bay area, said USGS geophysicist Jim
Dieterich, the report's lead author.
   The report predicted a 30 percent chance by 2018 for a magnitude
6.5 quake on the segment of the San Andreas that caused last week's
quake. That jolt measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, suggesting the
forecast was conservative.
   The earthquake ``makes one realize these forecasts are serious
and reliable,'' said California Institute of Technology geologist
Kerry Sieh, one of 12 co-authors of the study, which represented a
scientific consensus.

   Federal drug officials say they have names and

United States who have been cultivating marijuana that they are
violating the law, they will be caught, they will be prosecuted
and, if found guilty, they will serve time,'' said Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Frank Shults.
   More than 100 people in 46 states, along with 65 stores in 22
states believed to sell equipment intended for use in indoor
marijuana cultivation, were targeted for raids Thursday by the DEA.
   By early evening, 22 stores had been served with search
warrants, and seven or eight boarded up as a result, 65 cultivation
operations had been confiscated and 119 people had been arrested,
Shults said.

   A bomb exploded on a street in Medellin
as a bus carrying policemen to night patrol duty passed by, killing
five officers and injuring 15, many critically, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack late Thursday, but
police blamed drug barons angered by the government's refusal to
negotiate its policy of extraditing traffickers to the United
States.
   ``The traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the
desire to carry out an attack of this size,'' said a police
spokesman in Medellin, the center of Colombia's drug trade.
   Hours later, two bombs exploded in Bogota, the capital, injuring
one person.

   Healthy women who don't smoke should be able
to take birth control pills until menopause without significantly
increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke, a government panel
of experts says.
   Though these women could face an increased risk of
cardiovascular problems with pill use, this would be outweighed by
the risks of not taking the pill _ namely, abortion or carrying a
pregnancy to term, panel members agreed Thursday.
   ``Older women need contraception, and you have to weigh the
risks and the benefits,'' said Barbara Hulka, panel chairwoman and
head of the epidemiology department at the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health.
   With the hormone levels in currently prescribed pills far lower
than they were in the early birth control pills, medical
researchers believe the risks found with the high-dose pills are
reduced.

   The U.S. Congress wants to lend a helping hand
to its fledgling counterpart in Poland by providing the hardware
and software of western-style democracy.
   The Senate late Thursday approved a resolution that will send a
team of congressional experts to Poland to study the needs of the
newly formed parliament. They will come up with an aid package that
includes everything from telephones and typewriters to training in
how to write laws.
   ``While we're talking about the bigger issues of loan
stabilization, of economic reform, of food aid, it is quite
appropriate for Congress to give this as a first gift of
democracy,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, a sponsor of the initiative.
   Poland's first open elections since before World War II, held in
April, gave the country its first non-communist-dominated
government in four decades. But the newly elected lawmakers, many
of them workers with no previous experience in government, soon
found they had inherited an empty shell of a legislature, Domenici
said.

<HEAD>Confrontation In The Stock Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A confrontation among the institutional big boys
may be developing in the stock market, and it has a lot to do about
the little guy. It could come to a head shortly.
   At the heart of the dispute is program trading, usually in the
form of massive, short-term, computer-triggered buying and selling
to exploit brief market inconsistencies. It can have an explosive
impact.
   It is practiced for profit or protection by some of the biggest
brokers in the business _ and it is outraging some of the others,
who say the brokers' own customers are being hurt.
   Mostly behind the scenes, some brokers and big investors have
been pleading for a cessation. Brokers Charles Schwab &amp; Co. and
Dean Witter have publicly stated their disapproval. Now a big
customer has done the same.
   The conflict became further defined this week when the New York
Stock Exchange made plans to offer its own product for program
traders, multi-million-dollar baskets of stocks that big traders
could buy or sell as a unit.
   The exchange action follows within two weeks the Oct. 13 slide,
when program trading was believed largely responsible for a
financial earthquake, a one-hour, 150 point, 5 plus percent drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   While the market rebounded on the following trading day, many
investors had had their fill. Such volatility, they said, had in it
the chemistry of a larger collapse. It was frightening investors.
It was stripping them of assets.
   Tired of attempts to stop the practice by means of moral
persuasion, Kemper Financial Services Inc., which manages about $8
billion in stocks, much through mutual funds, decided to hit the
big boys in the pocketbook.
   This week Kemper told four of its brokers they would receive no
more of its stock transactions, thus depriving them of millions of
dollars in commissions. Kemper's chief investment officer, Stephen
B. Timbers, had several reasons for doing so.
   To begin, he said, program trading creates volatility that leads
to a loss of confidence. It is ruining the market, he said,
upsetting even the longer-term strategies of big investors such as
Kemper.
   It isn't true, he suggested, that program trading is just a
brief jolt that in the long run leaves the market back where it
was. ``Does it?'' He stated the question as a challenge.
``Entirely?'' he added in the same vein.
   The affect is contagious too, he said. Why should a financing
problem in an attempted buyout of UAL Corp. last week have brought
down Phillip Morris, one of the market's premier issues? Mindless
program trading, he suggested.
   Program trading tends to ignore fundamental investment values.
Stocks aren't so much ownership in a company as pieces in a deadly
serious game. It is concerned more with market mechanics that the
outlook for corporate profits.
   ``If the market is dominated by program trading, why should we
spend so much money on research?'' Timbers asked. ``It makes no
sense,'' he said, and it can badly damage sophisticated, long-term
investors as well as the little guy.
   Timbers feels the marketplace isn't seeing much of the little
guy these days, and that it's been that way since October 1987,
when the stock market took a nosedive, one that program trading was
said to exacerbate if not create.
   The individual investor, once the substance of the market but a
shrinking force for more than a decade, looks at the carnage and
concludes, says Timbers, that ``I might as well go to Las Vegas _
maybe the odds are better.''
   At the very time Timbers was stating Kemper's decision, the Big
Board set plans for its own program trading vehicle. What did he
think of the move? ``It's the most bizarre thing I've ever heard
of,'' he said.
   Since his announcement, said Timbers, he has been inundated with
telephone calls. Most of them, he said, were in the nature of ``God
bless you.''
   Earlier, he had heard from some other institutional investors,
some of whose opinions, he said, were expressed with even greater
vehemence than his own.
   Based on this knowledge, he said, ``we'd be surprised if other
institutions don't follow us.'' If they don't, he said, ``maybe
we'll look foolish.'' But his tone indicated he didn't expect that
to happen.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist candidates have gained
popularity in the campaign for Brazil's presidential election Nov.
15 and conservatives and some top businessmen are voicing concerns.
   The conservative, pro-business candidate Fernando Collor de
Mello, the front-runner in the polls, has slipped from a high of 44
percent in August to 31 percent in late October, according to a
survey by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics.
   At the same time, pollsters have recorded a sharp rise for Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva, a former labor union president and candidate
of the radical Workers Party, and a lesser one for Leonel Brizola,
a veteran populist of the center-left Democratic Labor Party.
   The institute's poll gave Lula da Silva 15 percent in late
October, up from 5 percent in August, and Brizola 14 percent, up
from 13 percent. Other private surveys had similar figures.
   Their gains have strengthened the possibility of a runoff in
December between the two top vote-getters _ most likely Collor de
Mello on one side and either Lula da Silva or Brizola on the other.
A runoff is called for if no candidate wins a majority Nov. 15.
   The long-outlawed Brazilian Communist Party is in the race for
the first time since 1945 but its candidate, Roberto Freire, has
only 1 percent of the vote in polls.
   The bearded, 44-year-old Lula da Silva _ popularly known simply
as Lula, a nickname he legally made part of his formal name before
the campaign _ most frightens many of the businessmen and
conservatives about the outcome of Brazil's first direct
presidential election in 29 years.
   Not all businessmen are as concerned, however, as those such as
Mario Amato, president of the Federation of Industries of the
sState of Sao Paulo.
   ``If Lula takes office there will be chaos in the country,''
Amato said in a comment typical for those expressing the most
concern.
   He predicted capital flight would increase and ``800,000
businessmen will flee the country if Lula becomes president.''
   Edson Vaz Musa, president of the Brazilian subsidiary of Rhodia,
the French chemical and textile company, differed with that outlook
in an interview published by the Jornal da Tarde newspaper.
   ``Brazil will continue to exist and businessmen and government
will have to adjust to a new reality,'' he was quoted as saying.
``This has happened in other countries, such as France, and their
economies were not destroyed.''
   In a television debate, Lula called Amato's statement an
``imbecility.'' He said ``productive capitalism'' would be welcome
in a Workers Party administration but not ``speculative
capitalism.''
   In the campaign, Lula has promised that if elected he will
sharply raise workers' salaries and limit profits, nationalize
banks, expropriate big ranches and farms for poor peasants, suspend
payment of Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt and restrict profit
remittances by multinational companies.
   Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state who spent 15
years in exile during Brazil's 1964-1985 right-wing military
regime, favors what he describes as a European-style socialism. But
he also proposes expropriation of some private companies and
non-payment of the foreign debt, much of which is owed to U.S.
banks.
   ``I'll simply show up there and say, `Look, our people don't
want to pay any more,'' Brizola told a recent rally.
   Right-wing candidates have sought to capitalize on fears of a
leftist victory.
   ``This is also an ideological election,'' said Paulo Maluf of
the rightist Social Democratic Party. ``We must repudiate communism
and candidates like Leonel Brizola and Lula, who are supported by
communists.''
   Jose Alvaro Moises, a political scientist at the University of
Sao Paulo, disputes contentions such as Maluf's.
   He said in an interview such fears are ``unfounded and
exaggerated, because Lula and his party are not naive enough to
want to destroy the capitalist system.''
   ``He has made it clear that what he wants is to correct the
distortions that exist in Brazilian capitalism _ distortions that
have led to an extremely unfair distribution of income, low
salaries and an almost total lack of social priorities such as
health, education, housing and transportation,'' Moises said.
   He maintained that Lula's rise in popularity is due to ``the
people's desire for a change, for something new, for a president
with no links to the corruption-filled political past of this
country.''
   Emerson Klapaz, president of a large plastic-products industry,
said, ``A possible Lula government will be different from the one
he has described in his campaign. He will have to tune into what is
happening in the rest of the world, especially in communist
nations.''
   If the choice comes down to Brizola or Lula, some businessmen
have said they would prefer Brizola.
   ``We could deal with Brizola because he defends capitalism and
free enterprise. Lula doesn't,'' said supermarket tycoon Joao
Carlos Paes Mendonca.
   Carlos Alberto de Oliveira, president of the Commercial
Association of the southern state of Parana, said Lula ``defends
communist ideas that are out-of-date and this makes him even more
dangerous than Brizola.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They draw six-digit salaries performing in this
entertainment capital's glitzy showrooms. But when stars like Frank
Sinatra, Bill Cosby, Barbara Mandrell and Wayne Newton go on
national television to tout the city itself, the tab is $1.
   More than 20 celebrities are popping up on TV screens across the
country, singing the praises of Las Vegas, where they perform
annually.
   Under most circumstances, the talent fees would run in the
millions. Not so for Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
commercials carrying the message: ``Las Vegas: The American Way to
Play.''
   When R&amp;R Advertising sought out show business heavyweights for
the TV and print ads four years ago it asked them to do it for $1.
   Considering the fact the celebrities earn a healthy chunk of
their annual income in Las Vegas' showrooms, it stands to reason
they're willing to sing the city's praises for a buck.
   The ads were the brainchild of R&amp;R owner Sig Rogich and Billy
Vassiliadis, the agency's president.
   Rogich was a member of the Tuesday Team that produced former
President Reagan's campaign advertising in 1984. And he was
advertising director for the George Bush campaign in 1988. He
placed his interest in the agency in a blind trust earlier this
year when he went to Washington as a special assistant to Bush,
handling media relations.
   The idea of using stars evolved in 1985 when R&amp;R, blocked by
Federal Communications Commission rules that prohibit gambling
advertising, was looking for fresh ideas to sell the city.
   ``Surveys by the Convention Authority show that, next to gaming,
entertainment is the city's leading attraction,'' Vassiliadis said.
   The agency contacted Sinatra, the city's highest-paid
entertainer at a reported $500,000 a week. He is also the star most
identifiable with Las Vegas, having performed here for 38 years.
   ``It was presented to him as a way of selling Las Vegas,''
Vassiliadis recalled. ``He was very amenable to the idea. The
town's been very good to him, and he's been very good to the town.''
   Or, as Sinatra put it himself, through spokeswoman Susan
Reynolds: ``I have been married to the city of Las Vegas since 1951
and there will never be a divorce. I love it.''
   Once Sinatra accepted the $1 deal, other stars fell into place.
Today, the list of celebrities promoting the city reads like a
Who's Who in Entertainment.
   They include Cosby, Newton, Mandrell, Kenny Rogers, Rich Little,
Joan Rivers, Paul Anka, Sammy Davis Jr., Jay Leno, the Pointer
Sisters, David Brenner, the Judds, Lee Greenwood, the McGuire
Sisters, Siegfried and Roy, the Smothers Brothers, Smokey Robinson,
Natalie Cole, Don Rickles, Norm Crosby, and boxers Sugar Ray
Leonard and Tommy Hearns.
   Working with the celebrities has been a pleasant surprise,
Vassiliadis said. ``We had been warned that some of the people
would be terrible to work with, but they've just been great. You
hear these horror stories about how tough they'll be to deal with,
all the things you read in the rags. But they've been super.''
   Rogers interrupted filming of a movie in Oklahoma to fly to Las
Vegas to do his spot when the movie ran longer than expected.
   R&amp;R is always searching out special environments to showcase the
stars.
   Newton was filmed with one of his prize Arabian horses at his
Las Vegas ranch. Greenwood, well-known for his hit ``God Bless the
U.S.A.,'' is shown getting into the cockpit of an F-14 at Nellis
Air Force Base here. Illusionists Siegfried and Roy, who live in
Las Vegas, are shown walking across the Strip at night with one of
their rare white tigers.
   The agency spends about $250,000 a year making the
celebrity-theme commercials, then spends about $4 million annually
airing them in major Las Vegas market areas, including Los Angeles,
San Diego, Phoenix, San Francisco, Denver, Dallas, Chicago and
Detroit.
   The commercials are also shown on cable television.

<HEAD>Is Greenspan Chasing Butterflies?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is Alan Greenspan so intent on netting the
fluttering butterfly of inflation that he'll run off a cliff and
take the economy with him?
   That's one cartoonist's view of the Federal Reserve chairman,
whose pursuit of inflation is his No. 1 priority. In effect, he
told Congress that last week, saying he was even willing to endure
subpar economic growth for several years.
   Another view, however, depicts Greenspan as a patient economic
scientist, carefully laying a trap for the evil insect of inflation
that, unless killed, could spread a debilitating virus throughout
the economy.
   In between is probably the real Greenspan, a man who is indeed
willing to see the economy operate below its potential but who is
ready to suspend his efforts, temporarily of course, to avert any
economic calamity.
   If Greenspan is successful in lowering inflation to near zero by
the mid-1990s, as he seeks to do, the economy at that time quite
likely would be positioned for healthy growth. But the price would
be high.
   Some of that price already is becoming evident. While inflation
has been moderating, the weakened performance of American industry
is showing up in various statistics, most ominously in a
merchandise trade deficit.
   Inflation might be the No. 1 issue with the Fed chairman, but
closing that deficit is No. 1 with other groups, including some in
the White House. It had been declining, but shot back up in the
third quarter.
   That situation raises the question of whether a below-par
economy is an important cause of the trade problem.
   During the third quarter, for example, industrial production
slowed to a 2.8 percent gain, vs. 4.2 percent in the second
quarter. Could some of that lost production be equated with the
worsening export situation?
   The capacity utilization rate for manufacturing also has been
falling. Earlier this year it was feared that plants were operating
at an inflationary rate. No longer; the rate retreated to 83.7
percent in September, well below the mythical, and much disputed,
inflation-causing rate of 85 percent.
   An industrial slowdown means lost jobs. That impact is showing
up clearly in automotive industry layoffs, although the jobless
rate remains steady because of hiring in the service sector. A
continuation of the industrial slowdown, however, inevitably will
mean layoffs sufficient to push up the jobless rate.
   Corporate profits are declining too, and have been since the
first quarter of the year. That situation could force some
companies to rely more heavily on debt rather than internal
financing, putting upward pressure on interest rates.
   Inventories are rising. When inventories rise it can mean two
different things: one, that business is bullish and expects higher
sales, or two, sales are weakening and unsold goods are piling up.
In this instance, blame No. 2.
   Weaker corporate sales are bad news for the stock market too,
and that institution already is unsettled by its own shenanigans.
Incredible nosedives of late must be watched, lest one of them
trigger a financial collapse.
   Greenspan's pursuit of inflation, therefore, is not without
great costs and constant dangers. It might put a stronger
foundation beneath the economy in the mid-1990s, but in the
meantime it will take its toll.
   If that toll becomes more painful, the Greenspan course will
raise doubts, some of which might be expressed in a plea to suspend
the experiment and allow a little inflation in exchange for
additional growth.
   In the long run, and considering that politics inevitably butts
heads with economic theory, it could be the biggest threat of all
to the Fed chairman's scientific ideal of the near perfectly
stable, non-inflated economy.

<HEAD>Chris Van Allsburg: An Imagination Running Wild</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BEZDEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chris Van Allsburg, who recently shared in one of
the largest advances ever paid for a children's book, didn't
hesitate when asked to cite an important influence on his work.
   ``Harold and the Purple Crayon,'' he announced with speed and
surety.
   It was upon reading that Crockett Johnson book as a child in
Grand Rapids, Mich., that Van Allsburg, one of America's most
successful children's book authors and illustrators, set sail on
his wild imaginings that have led in recent years to such works as
``Jumanji,'' ``The Wreck of the Zephyr,'' ``The Garden of Abdul
Gasazi'' and ``The Polar Express,'' which just sold its millionth
copy.
   His latest venture marks his first collaboration. He was paid
part of an $800,000 advance to do the illustrations for Mark
Helprin's ``Swan Lake'' (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95). Helprin and the
``packager'' who cut the deal also shared in the $800,000. The
80-page book was recently published.
   In this derivative of the Tchaikovsky ballet, Van Allsburg tried
to give his illustrations the look and flavor of a 19th century
picture book to accompany the story of an ill-fated prince and
princess.
   Helprin's rich, although sometimes strained, style, and Van
Allsburg's satiny portraits with a Far Eastern tinge largely make
for a nice fit.
   But most youngsters will need an adult to get them through the
work, marked by passages such as ``... the forest was in its own
way inviolable _ a domain of hearth smoke in unwavering columns
against a flawless blue sky, of mountains clad in wind-buffed ice,
of the thinnest air, of rivers running white and bursting with
oxygen.''
   Van Allsburg, an admirer of Helprin's New Yorker pieces and
especially his novel ``Winter's Tale,'' stumbled only once as he
tried for the first time to put pictures to someone else's script.
When he was called upon to supply a picture of the old emperor
reclining on pillows on the floor, Van Allsburg kept shaping the
pillows into the form of dogs.
   ``We talked and he said if I needed the dogs OK,'' Van Allsburg
said. ``The pillows just looked too much like dogs and I had to go
with the pitch.''
   The scene remains slightly imperfect; the text says the emperor
has a book beside him, but the illustration shows him reading it.
   The hardest part for Van Allsburg began when the book was
completed.
   Houghton Mifflin decided on an enormous first run of 275,000
copies, including book club printings. Van Allsburg was asked to
handle East Coast promotions and Helprin the West. That meant 25
days on the road.
   Van Allsburg, a soft-spoken and retiring man of 40 who says one
reason he teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design is to force
himself out of the studio, is not particularly fond of public
appearances.
   But he is most engaging, and likely to be a fine salesman.
   An encounter with him is like bumping into Peter Pan at the A&amp;P
and talking about the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge _ or
vice versa _ and the ways of the imagination.
   As a teacher, he forces students to stretch their imaginations
by such assignments as composing their own version of ``The Star
Spangled Banner'' and singing it to the class.
   As a writer and illustrator, he tries to fit the pieces of his
own wonder, sometimes in pastel, sometimes in pencil, sometimes in
pen and ink. ``Sometimes I actually see an image in my mind's eye
which is puzzling to me, and then the story comes from it as I try
to figure it out.
   ``My stories are a little like encountering a missing
illustration.''
   He avoids conventional story resolutions with the hope that
``you close the book but your mind stays engaged,'' thus prolonging
fantasy.
   ``Society encourages giving up those beliefs. But I'm in favor
of stretching them out,'' he says.
   About the child's trip to see Santa Claus in ``The Polar
Express,'' he says: ``If the mean age (of giving up the notion of
Santa Claus) is, say, 7 years, 9 months, I like to think that maybe
it (the book) pushed it back to 7 years, 10 months for some.''
   Santa Claus and the tooth fairy ``make the world have greater
potential.''
   His books are an open heart, at times whimsical, at times sad,
at times even perplexing. And even after 10 popular works in as
many years, an American Book Award and two Caldecott Medals, he has
set no pattern and has no idea of exactly where he is going.
   The most he can say about his next book is that ``I'm sort of
working on something.''
   Like Harold, who used his purple crayon to draw his way in and
out of many adventures.

   When the stock market staged a brisk rally right
after its scary slide on Oct. 13, most onlookers were relieved and
impressed. There evidently wasn't going to be a Crash of 1989 after
all.
   But that performance failed to reassure some Wall Street
analysts, who found almost as much cause for concern in the rebound
as they did in the drop.
   After the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 190 points
on Friday the 13th, the optimists' rallying cries began almost
immediately.
   The selloff was an ``aberration,'' caused mainly by the
spreading realization that the mergers-and-buyouts boom of the past
several years was coming under increasing strains.
   The squeeze on takeover credit, furthermore, would ultimately
prove beneficial by restoring investors' attention to the
traditional values that make the stock market go, such as earnings
and dividend growth.
   Besides, everybody with memories of the Crash of 1987 had
learned that bargain-hunters in big market drops could be
handsomely rewarded when confidence was restored.
   While any or all of these points may be valid, the skeptics now
say, investors rushed to embrace them with an eagerness bordering
on unreality.
   ``Just because Monday, Oct. 16, wasn't a repeat of Black Monday
1987 doesn't mean that all is well,'' contends Joseph Feshbach,
technical analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``This isn't the worst of all possible investment worlds, but it
certainly isn't the best.''
   Two years ago, Feshbach noted, ``pessimism abounded, and
pessimism proved wrong. Today, optimistic investors are comparing
1989 with 1987, although the fundamentals and the internals of the
market are very different this year from what they were two years
ago.''
   Those differences have been widely described as favorable for
the market outlook now. For instance, price-earnings ratios of
stocks are much lower now than the lofty levels they reached in the
summer of '87.
   Similarly, there appears much less danger now of an accelerating
economy that would prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   But many analysts view the contrasts in sentiment between
October 1987 and October 1989 much differently.
   The Crash of '87 was almost universally viewed as a fearsome
event. Friday the 13th this October was dismissed by many as just a
brief dizzy spell.
   If the past is any guide, significant market declines don't end
in periods of eagerness to shop for bargains in stocks, but rather
when ``sentiment surrenders its enthusiasm and becomes scared,'' in
the words of Justin Mamis at Cowan &amp; Co.
   The 1989 selloff and its aftermath prompted Joseph Barthel,
technical analyst at Hopper Soliday &amp; Co., to recommend that
investors reduce their exposure to the stock market.
   ``The burden of proof that Friday, Oct. 13, was just a fluke
remains squarely on the shoulders of the bulls,'' he asserts.
   Whatever the eventual outcome, analysts who see the market's
recent antics in a negative light say the prevailing optimistic
view was self-contradictory.
   On the one hand, the selloff was described as unlike the '87
crash because it occurred in such different circumstances.
   On the other, it was embraced as a ``buying opportunity'' very
similar to what occurred two years before.
   Either one of those interpretations could turn out to be true,
the skeptics say, but not likely both.

<HEAD>Jaclyn Smith Deep in Money, Intrigue in ABC Mystery Series</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaclyn Smith is up to her neck in money in
her new ABC mystery series ``Christine Cromwell'' _ old money, new
money and stolen money.
   She stars as a San Francisco investment counselor who keeps
getting involved in crimes in the show that begins this weekend on
``The ABC Saturday Mystery Movie.''
   ``It's a different feeling from the movies and miniseries I've
been doing,'' said Smith, whose last series was ``Charlie's
Angels'' in 1976-81.
   ``It's regular, but it's not every week. It's a character who
can change and develop and that I can put more of myself into. I've
been playing so many victims, so many emotional roles. This is much
more intellectual. The mysteries are quite complex. I have to read
the scripts twice to understand them, but I think the viewers will
find them easier to follow visually through the eyes of the
characters.''
   ``Christine Cromwell,'' along with the newly added ``Kojak,''
joins ``Columbo'' and ``B.L. Stryker'' in the rotating movie
series. It gives the mix a glamorous element and lighter mystery.
Peter Falk is the diamond-in-the-rough Columbo, Burt Reynolds is
the reluctant Florida private eye Stryker and Telly Savalas is back
as the tough, flashy detective Theo Kojak.
   Smith's show originally was called ``Amanda Vanderbilt.'' That
caused conflict because of a line of designer clothes, and it
became ``Christine Claiborne.'' Conflict arose again because of
another line of clothes and a fragrance. Wanting a name that
conveyed elegance, glamour and old money, everyone finally agreed
on ``Christine Cromwell.''
   ``It's about the charmed life of the very rich,'' said Smith.
``It's somewhat reminiscent of the movies of the 1930s. Christine
is from old money back East. She's very bright, involved in
charities, and works because she wants to. She has many qualities
and values that I admire.
   ``Celeste Holm plays my mother, who's been married seven times.
Each of my stepfathers has an expertise that I call on in solving
the cases. Mother's a kind of `Auntie Mame' type. My boss at the
investment firm is Ralph Bellamy.''
   Although she'll come up against the rich, they won't all be
refined. In one show, she deals with a coarse detective played by
Dennis Franz. That particular episode also marks one of the series'
few ventures into humor.
   Most of the stories will show that the rich not only get into
trouble, they also have more money with which to dig themselves in
deeper.
   ``I'm used to doing straight, serious roles,'' said Smith. ``The
role of the intellectual, and having to put across what she's
thinking and doing, is more difficult than an emotional role. It's
a great challenge. The memory work is extensive, having to say all
the legal background.
   ``This is also a long way from `Charlie's Angels.' That was very
tongue-in-cheek. This is much more real.''
   Since ``Charlie's Angels,'' Smith has starred in such movies as
``Escape From Bogen County,'' ``The Users,'' ``Jacqueline Bouvier
Kennedy,'' and most recently, NBC's ``Settle the Score.''
Miniseries include ``Rage of Angels,'' ``George Washington,''
``Rage of Angels II,'' ``Windmills of the Gods'' and ``The Bourne
Identity.''
   ``When I started the series, I thought, `I'm going to be away
from the children,''' she said. ``My kids have been to San
Francisco for some location filming. They've come to the set after
school. It's good for them to see that their mother works.''
   After completing ``The Bourne Identity,'' she took seven months
to devote time to her children, Gaston, 7, and Spencer Margaret,
who'll be 4 in December.
   ``This is a longer commitment than a movie or miniseries,'' she
said. ``I enjoy it. I work 12-hour days, but I'm home in time to
have dinner with the children, read them stories and put them to
bed.''

<HEAD>Earthquake Shakes Government Spending Limit, Too</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first, the instinct was to wave it off, the
way a referee picks up the penalty flag he didn't intend to throw.
   But then Congress decided that the $2.85 billion appropriated
for disaster relief after the California earthquake should, after
all, count against the government's deficit quota, probably
starting next year, not now.
   The government tried to discipline itself with the law that
limits annual deficits, but it also can change laws. That amounts
to optional discipline.
   Rep. Bob Michel, the Republican leader, said the Gramm-Rudman
rules for deficit reduction are a disciplinary tool that shouldn't
be evaded. ``You don't discard it because it is inconvenient,'' he
said. ``It is supposed to be inconvenient.''
   There's a tendency to argue that some appropriations, like this
one, are just too important to be counted against a budget ceiling
that's already been reached and passed, because it makes them
harder to enact.
   And moves that provide budget leeway also serve the Republican
administration, which is determined to keep its barrier high
against new taxes. The White House said none will be necessary to
finance the disaster relief bill, the largest in history. The
second largest also passed this fall, $1.1 billion as a result of
Hurricane Hugo.
   Nobody questioned the decision to provide the money, but there
was ample House debate on how to count it. The Senate, in a vote
that is only advisory, said budget negotiators ought to cut other
programs by $1 billion, the amount of disaster relief money likely
to be spent this year.
   Californians were candid about their determination to get as
much as possible as quickly as possible, before the sense of crisis
eases.
   Later on, ``we'll be just another budgetary problem,'' said Rep.
Vic Fazio, D-Calif. He also said that the emergency appropriation
was little more than a down payment and that added funds probably
will be sought in the spring.
   The double disasters of hurricane and earthquake already are
another budgetary problem. The government is operating under
automatic spending cuts imposed two weeks ago to trim $16.1 billion
from projected spending. That's because Congress has not settled on
a measure to prune the projected deficit to no more than $110
billion for the year that began Oct. 1.
   And that was before the disaster appropriations.
   Hence the search for ways to keep the bill from adding to the
squeeze. As drafted for House action, the disaster appropriation
said the spending it provided would not be charged against the
Gramm-Rudman ceiling.
   That was fine with the White House, more interested in resisting
pressure for new taxes than in the fine print of the budget control
system. According to the administration, the earthquake money won't
affect the current deficit crunch because the deadline for dealing
with it has come and gone, without action.
   That would leave the extra spending to be counted next year
when, according to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
``it's a whole other ballgame.'' It may be a more difficult
ballgame, since the deficit ceiling for that budget year will be
more stringent, only $64 billion unless Congress decides to ease it.
   That's not unlikely.
   ``Just as surely as we erect one barrier, we find a way around
it,'' complained Rep. Sylvio O. Conte, R-Mass., who got the
disaster appropriation amended so that it will have to be counted
against future Gramm-Rudman ceilings.
   He said the idea of pretending the earthquake spending wasn't
being added to the deficit was ``an escape hatch to fantasy land .
.. We spend it _ ha, ha, ha _ but it doesn't count, it's magic,
it's voodoo. And it's bogus.''
   There were counter-arguments that counting the disaster spending
against the limit is going to force cuts in other programs that
already are short of funds. ``Every nickel you are spending will
come out of some other program's hide, education, child care,
nutrition, the homeless, drugs, defense, you name it,'' said Rep.
Bob Traxler, D-Mich.
   Those are indeed difficult choices. The people running
government are supposed to make tough choices.

   The spectacle of Americans held hostage overseas
helped topple one U.S. administration, drove another into the
Iran-Contra scandal and continues to bedevil a U.S. government torn
between a desire to free its captive citizens and reluctance to
negotiate with terrorists. Ten years after Iranian students overran
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the issue is no less painful and the
solutions no more clear.

   For the nation that prides itself as the
mightiest on Earth, hazy television images of Americans held
hostage in the Middle East have become a bitter lesson in the
limits of power.
   Few issues have so frustrated the American public and its
leaders since radical Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran 10 years ago this week _ on Nov. 4, 1979 _ and took 53
Americans hostage.
   President Bush has toned down the rhetoric in an attempt to keep
the public from focusing too closely on an issue that helped topple
Jimmy Carter and led Ronald Reagan into the worst foreign policy
scandal of the 1980s.
   But at the same time, Bush is enlisting third parties in an
effort to deal with Iran and free the eight Americans now held by
Iranian-backed Moslems in Lebanon.
   Carter, hounded by questions about the Tehran hostages and the
United States' inability to free them, withdrew to the White House
Rose Garden to wage much of his 1980 re-election campaign.
   Those hostages eventually were freed after 444 days _ on the day
Reagan was inaugurated, Jan. 20, 1981.
   But nearly six years later, Reagan's presidency was rocked by
the Iran-Contra affair, revelations that his aides had sold weapons
to Iran in hopes of freeing the hostages in Lebanon and diverted
the proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels. The arms deals came when Reagan
was proclaiming publicly that the United States would not negotiate
for the hostages' release.
   Washington has had no diplomatic relations with Iran since the
revolutionary government seized power there in early 1979.
   With little fanfare, however, the United States has been using
intermediaries _ Japan, Pakistan, Algeria and Switzerland, to name
a few _ to send messages to Tehran, says Gary Sick, author of a
book about Carter's hostage crisis and a National Security Council
aide during the Democrat's presidency.
   The thrust of Bush's third-party messages is that the United
States is ready for better ties, but the hostages must be freed
first, analysts say.
   ``Bush is conscious of Iran's power and he's shown an interest
in putting things right,'' says Frederick Axelgard, a senior fellow
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   While Bush has tried to play down the hostage issue publicly, he
was forced to react when a group calling itself the Organization
for the Oppressed on Earth reported on July 31 that it had killed
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   The president cut short a trip to the Midwest and returned to
Washington to condemn the ``brutal and tragic'' events, but he did
nothing to retaliate.
   In Sick's view, Bush simply doesn't have many options.
   ``After the Iran-Contra episode, he can't afford to be tagged
with a trade, a deal. In effect, it has tied his hands,'' he says.
   Publicly, the administration's position on the hostages is the
same as the Reagan administration's was after the Iran-Contra
scandal. Secretary of State James Baker III reiterated that policy
last week.
   ``The Iranian government has known for a long time that we are
quite prepared to have open discussions with representatives of
that government, provided they renounce their pursuit of terrorism
and provided they take actions to seek the release and freedom of
our American hostages,'' he said.
   Iran's president, Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said last week
that he would help free the American hostages if the United States
would release billions of dollars of assets frozen 10 years ago
after the Tehran embassy takeover.
   The United States rejects linking the assets, valued at between
$9 billion and $12 billion, to the hostages.
   U.S. officials say those disputes are, slowly but surely, being
dealt with by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands. As of August, U.S. nationals had been awarded about
$1.2 billion by the tribunal; Iranians had received $118 million,
the State Department said.
   Despite the stalemate, analysts say a number of factors could,
in the long run, help Bush resolve the hostage issue.
   Among them: the death this year of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the hard-line spiritual father of the Iranian revolution, the end
of the Iran-Iraq war and the peace plan between Moslems and
Christians in Lebanon.
   ``If the Lebanese accord works, if Rafsanjani is able to
continue to consolidate his political base, then we are getting to
an atmosphere in which it may be possible for something to take
place,'' says Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Brookings
Institution.
   Kipper says Rafsanjani's need to rebuild his country and obtain
technology and economic assistance could lead him to help secure
the hostages' release.
   In addition, the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war has
reduced the perceived threat in the Persian Gulf and allowed the
United States to cut back its military force there. The Iranians
probably view that as a positive sign, Sick says.
   Maj. Barry Willey of the U.S. Central Command says 10 U.S. ships
remain in the gulf, down from about 17 a year ago.
   Complicating the hostage picture, however, is the relationship
between Iran and the Lebanese kidnappers, thought to be factions of
the Hezbollah umbrella group.
   Axelgard says there are some signs that Iran has distanced
itself from Hezbollah.
   But Shaul Bakhash, a professor at George Mason University,
disputes that view. Recent visits to Iran by Sheik Mohammed
Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Hezbollah, don't suggest a lessening
of contact between the two, he says.

   Melvin Belli, the barrister of disaster,
went into action on lawsuits from the big earthquake almost as soon
as he stopped shaking at Candlestick Park.
   Belli filed $22 million worth of claims Friday against the state
on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of Interstate 880 on Oct.
17 that killed at least 39 people.
   The claims _ $3 million for each of two wrongful deaths and $2
million for each of eight injured survivors _ are the first step in
what Belli's partner, Richard E. Brown, believes will be more than
$200 million in suits by many lawyers in the I-880 tragedy.
   Thousands of San Francisco Bay area residents are busy seeking
profits from the quake.
   Great sums _ perhaps more than the $7 billion or more in damage
estimates _ are shifting from the government, insurers, bank loans
and savings accounts to workers and companies rebuilding the Bay
area.
   A few were accused of profiteering, taking unreasonable gains
from the emergency the night of the quake. Some are after the fast
buck with quake gimmicks and T-shirts.
   One person's bad luck is another's opportunity, but most of
those benefiting from the quake are simply and honestly doing their
jobs.
   Engineers, architects, contractors and masons who will fix
thousands of buildings are making big money as a result of the
quake.
   As for the lawyers, their civil suits would follow 45 days after
the filing of claims if the claims are rejected by the state.
   ``I think we've got a substantial lawsuit because the state
definitely was negligent,'' said Belli, whose firm is talking with
about 30 other survivors and families of people killed in the I-880
collapse.
   ``I think we're going to be able to show that they didn't use
adequate supports,'' he said. ``What's more important, they knew
they were shortcutting and they used the money on something else.''
   Belli, whose uninsured office building has been red-tagged as
unsafe and may need more than $1 million in repairs, plans to move
his staff, books and files on Monday and work on the I-880 case and
others stemming from the quake.
   His office phone was out for three days after the quake, but as
soon as service started up it kept ringing with people wanting to
sue somebody.
   ``At least 50 people have contacted us about lawsuits. We're
also handling for free the problems of people trying to collect
money on loans from the federal government. We're very busy.''
   So are construction crews from Santa Cruz to San Francisco,
preparing to put up new homes once the rubble is cleared.
Lumberyards are already humming.
   Glaziers are clearing away the shards of countless broken
windows and installing new panes. Chimney sweeps are checking out
damage that could cause a fire. Building inspectors are studying
cracks in the walls, roofs, floors and foundations. Plumbers are
repairing broken pipes and toppled water heaters. Helicopters and
ferries are carrying commuters while the Bay Bridge is closed.
   Neighborhood restaurants in San Francisco and others in Marin
County and the East Bay are packing in diners, partly at the
expense of the usual tourist spots along Fisherman's Wharf and the
hard-hit Marina District.
   Disaster recovery services are providing replacement computers
and other office needs. Head-hunters are getting more business from
companies finding it difficult to lure employees to the Bay area
after the quake.
   Reporters, photographers and TV crews are working overtime to
cover it all.
   The quake destroyed so much but was a boon to dozens of
businesses.
   ``It's terrible. No, it's not terrible, it is great,'' said Mina
Taleb-zadeh, controller of West Bay Glass Co. in San Francisco. `So
much broken glass is in the town. The first week we worked day and
night but we've slowed down a little bit because the crew is
tired.''
   West Bay, a small firm with a six-man crew, hired six more
workers last week and replaced about 500 windows, 10 times the
usual number.
   The biggest job, nearly $40,000 in labor for three days of
round-the-clock service, was cleaning glass from about 150 windows
in a seven-story department store. Now, West Bay is hoping to win
the bid to replace those windows.
   Louis Bobrowsky, an engineer and architect who inspects homes
and commercial buildings, said he's been working up to 12 hours a
day.
   ``We would normally get eight to 12 calls a day. Now we're
getting 100. We've been telling the people what to look for and not
charging them for it. If serious cracks or separations come up,
then I go out and see it.''
   Will Prater, a pilot at Astrocopters Ltd. of Oakland, said
business was non-stop in the days after the quake when the company
had its own five choppers and three subleased ones hauling celluar
telephones to Santa Cruz for hours.
   About eight helicopter firms took advantage of the crippled San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and I-880 to sell a fast, expensive
alternative for executives, emergency workers and media personnel.
   Commercial helicopters normally aren't allowed to fly into San
Francisco because of neighborhood complaints about noise. But the
opening of the Port of San Francisco's Piers 30-32 was an emergency
earthquake action.
   The 'copter commute costs $150 to $200 roundtrip. The Bay Bridge
used to cost a dollar.

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Trade Proposal Keeps GATT Pot Simmering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again free-trade advocates are leading
the U.S. assault on hide-bound doctrines, quotas, subsidies and
other protectionist gimmicks that keep the world from a better life
for consumers and fatter profits for farmers.
   That's one view.
   Another is that American farmers and consumers are on a winding
path through dark forests and threatening chasms where wickedness
and mysterious forces lurk, ready to pounce and gobble up the
mighty U.S. food machine.
   Meanwhile, there are all shades of support and criticism about
the government's proposal to revamp global agricultural trade. The
proposal, finely tuned over the last three months, was presented
last week to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
   Since World War II, the 97-nation GATT has been the principal
regulatory body for international trade. The eighth round of
negotiations _ which are held periodically to update the rules _
began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on Sept. 20, 1986, and will
continue through 1990.
   A major U.S. drive in the Uruguay Round was to put agricultural
trade up front during the negotiations. The United States has
called for cutbacks or the elimination of ``trade distorting''
programs and policies.
   One feature of the plan submitted to GATT calls for the
elimination of commodity export subsidies within five years. Some
other programs would be phased out over 10 years, while others
would be retained _ as long as they do not distort world trade.
   The plan is aimed at trade liberalization so that U.S. crops,
meat, poultry and dairy products have the fullest possible access
to foreign markets. Therein, advocates say, lie the future riches
of U.S. agriculture.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., as chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, supports the idea of eliminating export subsidies,
indicating their elimination ``should be the top priority'' of GATT
negotiations.
   But Leahy cautioned that ``a bad GATT deal is worse than no deal
at all. It must be crystal clear _ agriculture cannot be traded off
for gains in intellectual property, trade in services or any other
area of these negotiations.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who was joined by
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last week in announcing the
proposal, said the GATT talks are entering ``the most creative
phase of the Uruguay Round'' of negotiations.
   The agricultural proposal and one on trade and services
submitted to GATT earlier in the week represent ``a microcosm of
our broad goal ... to eliminate the hundreds of ways that
governments distort trade and restrict fair competition,'' Hills
said. ``We seek to achieve this goal through fundamental reform in
the global trading system.''
   What do all these have to do with American farmers?
   Yeutter, a former University of Nebraska economics professor as
well as a farmer, cited one study that indicated the cost of trade
distortions in agriculture alone in developed nations is about $165
billion a year.
   Yeutter said that for every dollar of financial assistance to
farmers in developed countries, about $1.40 is spent by consumers,
taxpayers or a combination of the two.
   ``In other words, there is about a 40 percent slippage, and if
we can, through negotiations, correct that 40 percent slippage
factor, we can theoretically increase farm incomes or comparably
increase benefits to consumers and taxpayers by that amount,'' he
said.
   If it were all passed on to farmers, Yeutter said, ``one should
be able, on paper, at least, to increase farm incomes in the
developed world by as much as 40 percent.''
   By that reckoning, he said, this year's farm income estimated at
$50 billion would go up by an additional $20 billion.
   Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, is
among those who aren't convinced that scrapping subsidies right and
left, opening trade doors and demolishing barriers is a realistic
goal.
   One problem that Swenson and others have with the trade proposal
is that it would seek the 10-year elimination of ``income support
policies linked to production or marketing.'' The proposal would
allow ``income support policies not linked to production or
marketing.''
   According to the proposal, only ``direct income payments to
producers that are not tied to current production, prices, the cost
of production or marketings of agricultural commodities'' would be
permitted after the 10-year phase-out.
   Swenson, in a telephone interview, said his group is adamantly
opposed to the elimination of price support programs that are tied
to production. ``That's our domestic farm program,'' he said.
   But the Farmers Union would go along with the elimination of
direct export subsidies _ including the Export Enhancement Program
used by the United States to meet foreign competition _ if other
countries do the same.
   Yeutter was asked about the opposition of some farm
organizations to the U.S. proposals at GATT and that ``there has
been talk that you are really trying to eliminate the U.S.
agricultural program altogether.''
   ``As I indicated earlier, we are not going to eliminate anything
unless our trading partners are prepared to take comparable
actions,'' he replied. ``That is a matter for the negotiating
table.''
   Yeutter also repeated his assertion that the proposal is in the
best interest of American farmers and ``will clearly and very
substantially increase farm incomes'' in the United States.
   ``If there are some farm organizations that would prefer lower
farm income to higher farm incomes, then they can defend that
position to their membership,'' he said. ``I prefer high farm
incomes to lower incomes, and I will articulate that cause in a
very active way.''

   The Uptown String Quartet (Philips) _ Diane Monroe and Lesa
Terry, violins; Maxine Roach, viola; Eileen M. Folson, Cello.
   
   And now for something completely different ...
   A listener needs a change now and again, and this disc from the
Uptown String Quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears.
   The name gives a clue _ a marriage of the string quartet with
the sounds from far uptown, beyond 110th Street in Manhattan. A big
shot of jazz, a little rag, a little blues, a lot of polish.
   Listen to ``Midnight Child'' and it's evident why the mix is so
convincing. The virtuoso note-bending of the blues and gospel
singers was born for the violin. So, too, were the strutting
rhythms of ``Calvary,'' and doggone if Scott Joplin didn't have
strings in mind when he wrote ``Easy Winners.''
   It helps, too, that the four players are demon fiddlers, whose
various experiences include the Philadelphia Orchestra,
``Dreamgirls,'' the New York Philharmonic, Frank Sinatra, Sammy
Davis Jr., Wynton Marsalis and producer Max Roach's Double Quartet.
   Yes, it may seem a little strange, but this is no Beethoven's
Ninth for massed accordion band kind of stunt. Each of a dozen cuts
is perfectly idiomatic, fresh, piquant, just right.
   The Uptown String Quartet threatens to give crossover recordings
a good name.

   ``Trash'' (Epic) _ Alice Cooper
   
   Don Henley recently complained that pop music has become
moronic, which would mean that Alice Cooper was way ahead of his
time.
   Happily, two decades after the release of his first record,
Cooper still sounds moronic. ``Trash,'' his latest album, is
impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike.
   Don't be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought Cooper
spits out over grinding guitars. These tunes are cartoons _ they
have more in common with Sam Kinnison than Judas Priest.
   No image is too obvious for Cooper, which is half the fun. And
he shows cleverness in other ways. ``I'll drive you like a hammer
on a bed of nails,'' Cooper sings. Then the punch line: ``Ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow.''
   The band is head-banger friendly. Guitarist John McCurry nicely
frames Cooper's frenzy, and guest appearances by Aerosmith and Jon
Bon Jovi add to the fun.
   There are some dead spots, but such hormonal imbalances as ``I'm
Your Gun'' and ``This Maniac's in Love With You'' make ``Trash''
the funniest heavy-metal record since Spinal Tap. Whether Cooper
intended it to be that way is really immaterial.

<HEAD>Childbirth Guide for Fathers, Others Helping With Birth</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you became a father in the last three decades,
odds are you could experience what your father couldn't: being
there.
   If you became a mother, you may have avoided what to many women
of your mother's generation was a humiliating experience.
   Credit your parents and yourselves for the change, says Penny
Simkin, an internationally recognized childbirth educator and
author of a new guide for fathers, medical caregivers and others
who help women give birth.
   Simkin, a physical therapist and a mainstay of the Childbirth
Education Association of Seattle, has written ``The Birth Partner:
Everything You Need to Know to Help a Woman Through Childbirth.''
   Simkin and CEAS' Janet Whalley and Anne Keppler already have won
Seattle a reputation within the natural childbirth movement, and
wrote a widely used text for new parents, ``Pregnancy, Childbirth
and the Newborn,'' published in 1984.
   ``It's one of the most accepted books in the childbirth field,''
said Trudy Keller, president of the International Childbirth
Education Association. The Seattle group is one of the most
influential within ICEA, and Simkin and Keppler especially are
sought to speak on teaching techniques, she said.
   Since the late 1950s, treatment of pregnant women and
fathers-to-be has changed, mostly because parents have demanded it.
Realization that pregnancy and birth ``really are conditions of
health and not illness,'' Simkin said, has ``given consumers more
leeway in what kind of care they can get.''
   It wasn't long ago that giving birth meant being drugged, shaved
and strapped to a table and stirrups while husbands waited in the
hall. It's common for women to resent the humiliation they felt,
even long after their children are grown. ``Wherever I go, a woman
comes up and says, `When you talk about remembering ...' and she
gives me this story about how she was hurt.''
   While medical intervention often is critical, in most normal
births the mother should call the shots, Simkin says, and tells
birth partners: ``Your main role ... is to help her have the kind
of birth she desires.''
   Her book, published by Harvard Common Press, already has been
hailed by experts, including La Leche League International
co-founder Marian Tompson, who said it's ``destined to become the
birth partner's bible.''
   ``I think it's terrific,'' said Sheila Kitzinger, a leader of
the natural childbirth movement and author of ``The Complete Book
of Pregnancy and Childbirth.''
   ``It's very much needed. I think it will be very helpful for a
husband, for anyone, supporting a woman in childbirth,'' Mrs.
Kitzinger said in an telephone interview from her home near Oxford,
England.
   As recently as the 1970s, ``natural childbirth'' meant birth
without pain medication, but still with the mother on her back,
feet in stirrups and usually undergoing an episiotomy, or incision
to widen the vagina, Simkin said.
   Today, three-quarters of all new mothers receive childbirth
education, and women who want to avoid drugs are encouraged to do
whatever helps them relax in labor, be it a warm bath, walking
hospital halls, massage, cold treatments or special breathing
techniques.
   Having the father at her side to encourage, steady and coach is
crucial, Simkin said. ``I would say the father is the sine qua non.
I think the love and the intimate knowledge of the woman can't be
replicated by anyone else.''
   Her book, much of which has appeared as photocopies and handouts
in her classes, offers dozens of suggestions for easing labor, as
well as information on what's going on physically and emotionally
in the mother.
   ``It's a very concise, step-by-step guide,'' Mrs. Kitzinger
said. ``I think it's also got a warmth in it, an understanding of
how the partner may be feeling.''
   CEAS started in the 1950s, and is the third-oldest group
associated with the International Childbirth Education Association.
Simkin, 51, didn't become involved until 1968, when she and her
husband, Peter, a professor of medicine at the University of
Washington, moved to Seattle with their four children. She thought
teaching CEAS classes would be a good part-time job.
   ``I was not sure childbirth education was really helpful _ I had
had four babies without it.'' But at a reunion following her first
class, she was taken by the enthusiastic response from the new
parents. ``I really got hooked.''
   CEAS, which has about 40 instructors, teaches more than 2,500
families a year. Simkin estimates she has taught over 4,500
families in 21 years.
   Though she is allied with CEAS and is one of its teachers,
Simkin has made a business of teaching childbirth instructors and
publishing specialized books and pamphlets for them. Classes cover
anatomy and physiology, but also focus on what parents want from
childbirth, beyond a healthy child. Time is spent on feelings and
practicing breathing, massage and other comfort measures.
   ``So often things we emphasize in childbirth class really
haven't been explored in a relationship,'' Simkin said. ``It's not
sexual, but intimacy. How she likes to be touched, how she likes to
be talked to. A lot find they learn about their partner things
they've never known.''
   The classes also teach how a woman can negotiate with a doctor
or hospital for the birth she wants. While most caregivers now
accept natural childbirth as the norm, and many hospitals give
their own classes, ``I think there are people in this field who
still resent women and partners who want to participate.'' ``I
guess the message I would give to medical caregivers would be:
`This woman will never forget this day in her life and she will
never forget your part in it. And you have a choice in how you will
be remembered.'''

   Deep Thought couldn't topple world chess
champion Garri Kasparov, but computers are gaining, and it soon may
be no contest. The machine will one day beat man at any of his own
games, scientists say.
   ``Computers will eventually be able to outthink us,'' said
Marvin Minsky, an electrical engineering professor at MIT. ``It's
just a matter of evolution. The evolution of computers will be
faster than the evolution of animals.''
   As computers evolve, the differences between electronic and
flesh-and-blood brains will become less distinct, Minsky said.
``Some day we'll have machines that think like humans. People are
humans that think like machines.
   ``The brain is made of hundreds of billions of little cells, and
they're each sort of like little computers and they each do a
little calculation. You could say it's just a big machine.''
   Nonetheless, in a two-game brain vs. byte matchup Oct. 22 at the
New York Academy of Art, Kasparov won both games. Kasparov, who
hasn't lost a tournament since 1981, has an International Chess
Federation rating of 2,775. Deep Thought, which beat a human
grandmaster a year ago and captured the 1989 World Computer Chess
Championship, is given a 2,251. A beginner typically is about 1,200.
   Kasparov said Deep Thought was ``fully aggressive'' but its
``mind was too straight and too primitive.
   ``Chess is much wider than just calculations. It's even wider
than logic. You have to use fantasy, intuition and some kind of
prediction.''
   Deep Thought is actually a computer program developed by
Carnegie Mellon University researchers. Its two high-speed chips
enable it to analyze 720,000 possible board positions per second.
But Feng-Hsiung Hsu, who designed the computer's silicon guts, said
he wouldn't call his creation intelligent.
   ``We produced a machine that behaves like it's intelligent, but
it's not,'' he said. ``It's just mathematical applications. When
humans play chess, they use their intelligence. When machines play
chess, they do calculations.''
   It's just a matter of time before computers wise up and use
reason to analyze options, said Hans Berliner, the brains behind
Hitech, another Carnegie Mellon chess program that ranks second to
Deep Thought in the computer world.
   ``Intelligence is the question of understanding
counter-examples. You have a certain rule that takes you a certain
distance,'' he said. ``The real expert knows when there's
exceptions to those rules. People don't learn this kind of stuff
overnight. We're trying to put this stuff into machines.''
   The secret to making machines reason lies in making machines
that can learn, he said. ``I think we will have programs kind of
like a science fiction thing where you will leave your machine
turned on when you go home at night and in the morning it's learned
something you never even knew existed. I think that kind of thing
will be real by the year 2000.''
   ``A computer like Hitech looks at 30 million positions in the
space of three minutes,'' he said. ``The human being may look at 30
to 50 positions, like one-millionth the number. Computers can now
look way far ahead at things that people never even dreamed of.''
   Because of that, many of the best humans are turning down
invitations to match wits in tournaments against machines like
Hitech and Deep Thought.
   ``I wouldn't stand a chance against either of those machines,''
said Jim Meyer, assistant director of the U.S. Chess Federation.
   Meyers said playing computers isn't much fun.
   ``Chess is a contest of egos,'' he said. ``You don't have an ego
playing against you when you're playing a computer.''
   The technology developed in computer chess systems could be
applied to solving complex problems, like routing electrical
systems, designing computer chips or analyzing the chemical
properties of molecules that contain more than 1,000 atoms,
Berliner said. ``There are things that these machines can do that I
don't think human beings are equipped are to do.
   ``That seems to be the place where there's a lot of opportunity
for the human race to use machines either for good or bad to change
life.''

   When the gringo arrived with his
talk of putting trees and terraces in the fields, an intense debate
began here.
   The peasants were suspicious. Why did he care whether they
planted any trees? Was it so the Americans could come cut them down
when they grew large?
   Some, however, realized something had to be done. There was no
place to go, no more forests to cut and burn and clear for crops.
And every year the rains washed away more of the thin tropical
topsoil.
   ``Some people understood that we ourselves are part of the
problem. Others didn't,'' said Hector Lopez, a farmer. ``They
blamed other things. Some said it was the government; one man told
me the weather was changing because the Americans were going to the
Moon.''
   Lopez, 31, looked down at his two-year-old son.
   ``When I was a kid of 6, 7, 8 years old there were more trees,
more woods, more springs. It's not even 20 years, but it has
changed so much.''
   Eleven percent of Guatemala's forests have disappeared in the
past decade, said Kirsten Johnson, head of a CARE agroforestry
project trying to reverse the trend. It recently won a $2 million
grant from Applied Energy Services, a U.S. company that is building
coal-fired power plants in the United States and is looking for a
way to help offset the pollution the plants would cause.
   Some of Guatemala's forests have fallen victim to logging,
ranching and agribusiness interests, others to pressure of a
growing population, of peasants desperate for a plot of land to
feed their families, Johnson said.
   What is happening in this hamlet of about 300 families reflects
a new approach to the problem. Forests are not being replanted.
There is no place for them now; the people need the land.
   The CARE project began in 1974 and now aims at changing lives,
not landscapes, Johnson said. Massive reforestation projects of the
1970s and early 1980s failed because they didn't take into account
the causes of deforestation. ``People have certain very clear needs
for food, fuel and construction wood. They are not able to meet
those needs.''
   Guatemala has one of the most unequal distributions of land in
the hemisphere. About 4.5 percent of landholders own 70 percent of
the land, and it is the richest. For peasants, ``there's no place
to go except up the hillsides,'' Johnson said.
   Many hillsides, once covered by trees, now are bare, stripped
for firewood and fence posts and to make way for the beans and corn
on which peasants live.
   The area around Guichipilin, 76 miles southeast of Guatemala
City, was deforested by the early 1960s. Some peasants are now
farming hillsides so steep they use ropes to hoist themselves up
and down their plots.
   The program moved into Guachipilin three years ago. Its budget
is $300,000 a year, largely for design, planning and follow-up.
Other support, supplies and Peace Corps volunteers are funded by
the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Guatemalan
government.
   Chris Best, a Peace Corp volunteer who helped bring the program
to Guachipilin, returned recently to say goodbye to his friend
Hector before leaving Guatemala. They laughed about how suspicious
people had been when Chris arrived with his ideas for ``living
fences'' of trees, for mixing crops and trees, for building
terraces.
   ``A lot of people who were ignorant have changed,'' Hector said,
recalling the man who blamed things on sending man to the Moon.
   Best, an ethnobotanist, and Lopez inspected a eucalyptus tree
they planted together, patting the trunk approvingly.
   The changes at Guilchipilin have been modest so far. But the
seeds of both trees _ about 20,000 in Best's second year there _
and ideas were planted. Terraces were built. Village nurseries
started. Techniques were passed on.
   Peasants are learning how to conserve their soil, mix or
alternate traditional crops with trees that produce fruit or
firewood or shade. They are learning to keep what little land they
have productive.
   ``A lot of people have been running off to the Peten. They say
there is land up there'' in the north, Lopez said. ``But I say that
is not the answer. You have to conserve what you have. You have to
think of your children.''

<HEAD>Forestry Experts Say Energy-Saving Benefits Missed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American communities are starving for trees,
according to a new study of streets in 300 U.S. cities and towns.
   Most U.S. cities could accommodate more than twice as many trees
as they have, and are missing out on energy savings, said James
Kielbaso, of Michigan State University, a lead researcher in the
American Forestry Association study. ``If we double the number of
trees in our cities, we would, in effect, triple the environmental
benefits of trees, such as cooling the air, cutting energy costs,
preventing soil erosion and absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the
leading causes of the greenhouse effect,'' Kielbaso said.
   There are an estimated 60 million street trees in the country _
an average of 78 per mile, spaced an average 150 feet apart, he
said. Decreasing the space between trees to 50 feet would allow for
nearly 100 million new street trees.
   The study also found that only half of 1 percent of city budgets
are spent on trees. Most street trees are small _ two-thirds are
under 12 inches in diameter _ and most medium to large trees are in
fair to poor condition.
   ``Research is just now beginning to show the environmental and
economic value of our urban forests,'' said Gary Moll, the AFA's
vice president of urban forestry. ``It is also revealing that our
tree cover is simply too low.''
   The AFA has launched a citizens' tree-planting campaign called
Global ReLeaf, aimed at getting 100 million trees planted in U.S.
communities by 1992, increasing the size of the nation's urban
forests 15 percent to 20 percent.
   ``The urban forest is one of the city's most precious
resources,'' said AFA Executive Vice President R. Neil Sampson, the
creator of Global ReLeaf. ``Yet for every four trees that expire,
only one is being replaced in our larger cities, leaving cities
starving for trees.''

<HEAD>Soviets to Establish Seismic Station in Albuquerque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scientists plan to set up a
station near here and another in Blacksburg, Va., next year to
monitor earthquakes under an agreement that also will lead to U.S.
stations in the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. stations will fill a gap in a network run by the U.S.
Geological Survey's Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory. The
network includes more than 100 stations around the world and is
``like a giant telescope looking inside the Earth,'' said
geophysicist Jon Peterson, the lab's former director.
   Soviet scientists have had access to U.S. seismic information,
but Western scientists have been denied information gathered by the
Soviets. Geologists say the exchange will help them to understand
earthquakes, study the Earth's core and design seismic networks for
monitoring proposed nuclear test bans.
   ``Even if there were no nuclear weapons in the world we would
still like seismic stations in the Soviet Union,'' said Gregory van
der Vink of Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology in
Arlington, Va.
   ``We've always tried to extend the network into China and the
Soviet Union because obviously that's a large land mass,'' Peterson
said. Chinese and U.S. officials began operating a nine-station
system in October 1986.
   The Soviets are eager to improve their ability to predict
earthquakes in the aftermath of last December's quake in Soviet
Armenia that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and killed tens of
thousands of people, he said.
   U.S. stations will be set up in Armenia and Irkutsk; others have
been set up in Moscow, Sverdlovsk, Kislovodsk and Garm.
   The agreement calls for the Soviets to receive data from
stations at Albuquerque, Hawaii, San Diego, St. Louis and Boston,
and to establish their own at Albuquerque and Blacksburg.
   The network of stations gives scientists a better view of the
Earth's interior by combining information from around the world to
draw computerized three-dimensional views, much like a CAT scan
does of the body. The technique, called seismic tomography, has
given geologists glimpses of the irregular shape of the Earth's
iron core. Geologists hope the tomography will reveal why the large
plates that make up the Earth's surface move as they do.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electronic equipment similar to ``laser tag''
games is helping game wardens detect sophisticated lobster poachers.
   The Passive Integrated Tag Gun actually is a pistol-shaped
sensing unit connected to a computer; it sets off an alarm when it
detects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster, said game
warden Mike Castleton.
   When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam,
the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor. The tags,
nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye, give crustaceans
sort of an electronic fingerprint.
   The device has been used to track migrating fish for several
years, but was used to catch a poacher of California spiny lobsters
for the first time in early October off the San Diego coast,
Castleton said.
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the gun will reduce such
illegal catches or just cause poachers to figure out ways to avoid
detection. ``They are forcing us to become more sophisticated,''
Castleton said.
   ``You catch on to all their tricks after a while when you've
seen the same thing a couple of hundred times. People try to hide
lobsters in their clothes, secret compartments in their boats, all
over.''
   Though its now being used only against sport fishermen,
Castleton said he expects the electronic gun eventually to be used
to reduce commercial poaching. Commercial fishermen often complain
that competitors raid their traps.
   More dishonest fishermen than ever seem to be plucking lobsters
and other fish from Southern California waters, he said. Entire
generations of lobsters can be wiped out by just a few aggressive
poachers.
   California spiny lobsters, which thrive off the San Diego coast,
live in crevices and feed at night on fish, algae, eel grass and
invertebrates. Their name is derived from the sharp spines on their
shells. They don't have large pinching claws like their cousins in
the Atlantic Ocean.

   Towering above this industrial enclave
along the Thames River, a 386-foot smokestack rises from the
hulking steel and concrete shell of a coal-burning power plant
under construction.
   The owners, Applied Energy Services of Arlington, Va., and even
environmentalists, say the $275 million plant could set the
standard for the environmentally sound production of electricity in
the future.
   The plant will burn about 2,000 tons of coal a day when it
begins operating in November, relying on a combination of new
technology and new ideas to limit pollution and offset the plant's
contributions to the greenhouse effect.
   The most novel of the ideas is Applied Energy's decision to
spend $2 million to plant 52 million trees in Guatemala in a
reforestation project run by CARE, an international relief and
development organization.
   The trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide _ which scientists
blame as the main culprit in global warming _ to compensate for the
1.4 million tons the plant will generate during its 40 years in
operation, the company says.
   ``AES is setting the pace and helping to determine how their own
industry will be regulated in the future. They've shaped the
debate,'' said Paul Faeth of the World Resources Institute, a
Washington-based environmental research group working with Applied
Energy on the reforestation project.
   Other utilities have expressed interest in similar projects,
Faeth said.
   Daniel Dudeck of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, who
favors requiring new carbon dioxide producers to compensate for
their emissions, said Applied Energy is demonstrating the
feasibilty of such policies.
   Especially important, environmentalists say, is that the company
is proof that private enterprise can take extraordinary steps to
protect the environment and remain economically viable, and even
profitable.
   Applied Energy's stock has climbed from $2 to $135 during its
eight years in operation. The plant here is its fourth. Revenues
during the past year were about $100 million; when this plant and
another under construction are running, the company expects
revenues of about $400 million.
   ``It's their whole corporate ethos. They want to make money in
the best way, environmentally speaking. They want, as much as is
technologically feasible, to build an environmentally benign power
plant,'' Faeth said.
   ``In making electricity, you've got a process that pollutes. Our
objective was to see what we could do to minimize all types of
pollution coming from the plant,'' said Dan Rothaupt, the plant
engineer.
   To keep sulfur dioxide, part of acid rain, out of the emissions,
limestone will be burned with the coal. A reaction between the
calcium carbonate and the sulfur in the coal forms calcium sulfate,
a harmless solid. To accomplish this, the plant uses a new
technology, the circulating fluidized bed boiler.
   The boiler, a steel-encased tower 110 feet high, lets operators
maintain a temperature high enough to maximize the chemical
reaction between the coal and limestone but low enough not to
create many nitrogen oxides, another pollutant.
   The calcium sulfate and ash will be shipped back to West
Virginia's coal fields where it will be used to reclaim land
scarred by strip mining.
   The process will remove 90 percent of the sulfur that goes into
the boiler and produce about half the nitrogen oxides allowed by
federal law. The plant will generate 180 megawatts of electricity
and sell steam to a paper mill.
   ``Profits aren't really the ultimate goal for us. It's being a
good neighbor, being a good citizen,'' said company President
Dennis Bakke, who founded Applied Energy with Roger Sant, now
chairman, his former boss in the Federal Energy Administration's
environmental and conservation efforts.
   ``We try to weigh that responsibility with trying to deliver a
product to our customers which meets their needs.''

   The U.S. economy shrugged off Hurricane Hugo
and the poorest trade performance in six years to grow at a
moderate 2.5 percent annual rate from July through September, the
Commerce Department reported.
   The department said Thursday that the increase in the gross

was accompanied by a slowing of inflation to an annual rate of 2.9
percent, the slowest in three years, as both energy and food costs

<HEAD>Stock Baskets Get Off to Slow Start Amid Criticism of Program Trading</HEAD>

   Stock dealers in New York and Chicago were slow
to warm to the latest innovation in program trading of stocks.
   But officials of the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board
Options Exchange said they were satisfied with the lackluster
first-day trading Thursday of so-called stock baskets, and
predicted the new products would become accepted over time.
   ``We had no real expectations of activity that we were aiming
for,'' said NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin. Her exchange traded
nine of the stock baskets Thursday.
   But critics said they had doubts about whether the baskets would
ever catch on. They cited bad publicity about program trading, a
strategy involving the simultaneous trading of a range of stocks
that has been criticized as worsening stock market volatility.
   ``All of the clients are telling us they don't like program
trading. We don't do it,'' said Brad Weeks, a senior vice president
at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The baskets essentially are portfolios that allow big investors
to buy or sell, in a single transaction, every stock in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. That is aimed at investors who
want to bet on the direction of the overall stock market without
picking individual stocks.
   Investors bet on the overall market now mainly by trading
stock-index futures and options in the Chicago commodities markets.
   At the NYSE, nine baskets were traded Thursday at a price of a
little more than $5 million apiece. The Chicago options exchange
handled 14 trades of a cheaper version at about $1.7 million each.
   Trading began one day after the Securities and Exchange
Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the baskets.
   The NYSE, sensitive to bad publicity about program trading, said
the baskets were introduced in response to a recommendation of the
Brady Commission, which investigated the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   ``It's not something we designed to facilitate program
trading,'' Ms. Gamsin said.
   But one Brady Commission member, Robert Kirby, said he was
unimpressed with the innovation.
   ``The world needs another step toward the commoditization of
common stocks like it needs an addition to the national debt,''
said Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co. in Los Angeles.
   Trading proceeded smoothly albeit slowly at the New York and
Chicago exchanges except for a miware glitch in Nnor softew York,
several market makers and exchange officials said.
   The spread between bid and ask prices _ the difference between
what market makers will pay for a basket and what they will sell it
for _ was narrower than it would be if each of the 500 stocks were
bought separately, making the basket a more efficient way to
participate in the market, according to Matthew Celebuski, vice
president of futures and options strategy at PaineWebber Inc.
   The efficiency of the baskets eventually should attract big
investors such as pension funds and life insurance companies,
Celebuski predicted. NYSE officials agreed.
   ``We would hope that over time the nine baskets would become 20,
30, 50, etc.,'' said Donald Solodar, a senior vice president at the
exchange.
   The four firms making a market in the NYSE's version of the
market basket, which officially is known as the Exchange stock
portfolio, were PaineWebber, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., First Boston
Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
   PaineWebber's Celebuski said he believed basket trading would
slow the form of program trading known as index arbitrage by
keeping stocks and futures closer in line.
   The software glitch at the New York Stock Exchange prevented use
of a mechanism by which investors could sidestep the four
market-making firms and buy or sell a market basket by going
straight to the specialists who make markets in the 500 stocks.

   A beer price war that's heating up across the
nation has turned heads on Wall Street, but the folks who ring up
the six-packs at the cash register aren't impressed.
   ``We've seen and heard these kinds of things over and over,''
said Don Cowan, a spokesman for the Dallas-based Southland Corp.,
which owns 7-Eleven, the nation's largest chain of convenience
stores.
   ``I think this is more like standard operating procedure,''
Cowan said Thursday.
   But the decision by Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the world's
largest brewer, to match price cuts made by competitors in an
effort to shore up some declining markets did attract a great deal
of attention from the financial world.
   ``It's going to be flat-out war,'' said Julie Neimann, a
securities analyst for St. Louis-based Stifel Nicolaus Co.
   ``There has been a beer war in this country for the past 18
months, but we've really tried to stay above the fray. Now, we are
joining the fray,'' said Jerry Ritter, a vice president and chief
financial officer for St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch.
   Talk of a beer price war was news to Miller Brewing Co., the
nation's second-largest brewer.
   ``Our pricing and Anheuser-Busch's have not been significantly
different this year,'' Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for the
Milwaukee-based company, said Thursday.
   The Stroh Brewery Co. ranks third among domestic brewers,
followed by Adolph Coors Co. and the G. Heileman Brewing Co. Last
month, Coors said it signed an agreement in principle to acquire
most of the beer-related assets of Stroh Brewery.
   The new Anheuser-Busch policy is going to mean slightly lower
beer prices for consumers and fiercer competition for the nation's
beermakers, according to market analysts.
   ``The level of discounting in the beer business has been going
up for some time, but now Anheuser-Busch has said it's coming out
with both guns blazing,'' said Ben Steinman, executive editor of
Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication.
   It's too early to tell how much Anheuser-Busch's new policy is
going to push down prices in the premium beer category, but some
analysts estimate consumers will save about a quarter on a six-pack.
   Six-packs of Budweiser, Miller Genuine Draft and Coors generally
cost about $3.50, although all companies offer frequent sales that
drop the price below $3 in many areas of the country.
   Ritter said Anheuser-Busch decided to match price cuts by Miller
and Coors because consumers have been buying Budweiser and
Michelob, the two main Anheuser-Busch brands, at a slower rate in
the past few months.
   ``Sales had been growing between 3 and 4 percent, but now
they've slipped to a little below 3 percent. We decided it was time
to turn up the heat,'' said Ritter.
   Anheuser-Busch, which has been the country's leading brewer for
more than three decades, sells about 42 percent of the beer in the
United States. It hopes to boost that to 50 percent over the next
several years.
   The new pricing strategy is certainly going to accelerate that
growth, at the expense of the nation's other breweries, said Roy
Burry, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   The American beer industry has become much more competitive in
the 1980s because beer sales have been increasing only slightly and
per capita beer consumption has been going down.
   The stepped up competition has led to an increase in the number
of brands being sold by breweries and more promotion, advertising
and price cutting, analysts said.
   While Anheuser-Busch's new policy will be great for consumers,
advertising agencies and convenience stores, analysts say the
aggressive stance is going to hurt the rest of the industry, which
has been struggling.
   ``The big question is what's going to happen to Miller,'' Burry
said.
   Miller has been enjoying one of its best sales years ever. The
company sold more beer in August than it ever sold in any other
month, said Steve Forsyth, a Miller spokesman.

<HEAD>Presidential Airways Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airlines-Outlook, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential Airways Inc., which operates
as a feeder service for United Airlines at its Washington Dulles
International Airport hub, has filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.
   Presidential, which operates as United Express, remained
operating Thursday, company President Harold J. ``Hap'' Pareti said.
   However, flights will be dropped in eight of the 24 cities the
4-year-old carrier served: the West Virginia cities of Elkins,
Morgantown and Clarksburg; Hot Springs, Va., where service would be
suspended normally Tuesday; Columbia, S.C.; Daytona Beach and
Melbourne, Fla.; and Salisbury, Md.
   United Airlines spokeswoman Sara Dornacker in Chicago said
United is ``cooperating fully'' with Presidential and helping it
make alternate travel arrangements for passengers who may be
affected by the service suspensions.
   ``We made these cuts really to maintain the bulk of our revenues
and at the same time to size down the system, so what we're flying
generates the maximum amount of cash at the lowest cost level,''
Pareti said.
   As of today, Presidential expects to operate 64 daily flights,
compared with 75 Wednesday, Pareti said.
   The bankruptcy filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Alexandria, ``gives us the opportunity to continue the
restructuring of our company which began months ago,'' he said.
   Steve Dewey, chairman of the pilots union at Presidential, said
pilots signed a labor contract making wage concessions two weeks
ago.
   ``The company has been very candid with us, and we were aware
that the airline has had financial difficulties,'' he said in a
statement. ``We did our part to help this company. We are very much
disappointed.''
   The move follows Chapter 11 filings by two other airlines this
year: strikebound Eastern Airlines in early March and Braniff Inc.
in late September, its second such filing in seven years.
   According to court documents, Presidential had $30 million in
assets and $76 million in liabilities as of June 30. The largest
creditor, aircraft maker British Aerospace PLC, is owed about $26
million for aircraft, the court papers said.
   Debts during the first two years of operation totaled $70
million, Pareti said.
   ``We're now at a point where we need to pay back these
obligations,'' he said. ``We were not generating enough cash flow
to run the daily operation and pay the past debt.
   Last month, three vice presidents were dismissed and pay cuts
were imposed on 709 workers. The full-time payroll was reduced by
about 90 workers, mainly through attrition, Pareti said.
   Presidential hired an investment banking firm in September to
devise a plan to help the airline restructure its debt and find new
sources of capital.
   Presidential began four years ago as a mid-sized carrier,
switched to a charter service and then to a feeder service for
Continental Airlines, which at the time maintained a hub at Dulles.
However, Houston-based Continental gradually consolidated many of
its flights in Newark, N.J., and closed its Washington hub.
   In January 1988 Presidential became a feeder for United, a move
that has provided some economic security.

<HEAD>Prices Of Imported Goods Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prices Americans paid for imported goods
fell 1.3 percent during the summer, reflecting a stronger dollar
and falling energy costs, the government reported.
   The Labor Department said Thursday the price decline in the
third quarter was identical to a 1.3 percent decline in same period
a year ago. Falling oil costs played the major role in both price
decreases.
   In the latest quarter, energy costs fell by 7.4 percent while
imported food costs were down by 4.7 percent. The price of imported
chemical products fell by 2.2 percent.
   The decline in food costs was the fifth drop in the past six
quarters and marked the biggest decrease in three years. It was led
by a giant 38.6 percent decline in the price of coffee.
   The overall moderation in prices was aided by a stronger dollar,
which lowers the costs Americans must pay for imported products.
   On the export side, the price of American goods sold overseas
dropped by 0.7 percent in the third quarter, the biggest price
decline since a 1.2 percent fall in the third quarter of 1986.
   Labor Department analysts said that most of the decline stemmed
from a 4.2 percent drop in agricultural exports, reflecting lower
grain prices.
   Non-farm products edged down by 0.1 percent, the first decline
in this sector in more than three years.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said that the
drop in non-farm export prices was unusual given the big rise in
the value of the dollar, which makes Americans goods more expensive
on overseas markets.
   He said U.S. manufacturers apparently are shaving profit margins
in an effort to hold onto foreign markets in the face of the rising
dollar.
   ``American companies are attempting to stay competitive in
overseas markets by lowering their break-even points by squeezing
profits and cutting back on costs rather than raising prices,''
Sinai said.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. can
continue to offer special customized long-distance services to
large accounts under its so-called Tariff 12 rates, the Federal
Communications Commission says.
   The commission, in a 4-0 vote Thursday, denied petitions by
Williams Telecommunications Group and the Independent Data
Manufacturers Association for reconsideration of the FCC's April 18
order on Tariff 12.
   That order had allowed AT&amp;T to continue offering Tariff 12 if it
made it available to all similarly situated customers. AT&amp;T made
changes in the offering to comply with the FCC's order, and the
commission's common carrier bureau approved those changes June 30.
   Thursday's action was a final denial of the challenges to Tariff
12, which AT&amp;T first offered to the Defense Department in 1985.
Tariff 12 customers now include General Electric Co., Ford Motor
Co. and Du Pont Co.
   Also on Thursday, the commission, in another 4-0 vote, found
that AT&amp;T's special Tariff 15 rates for the nation's largest hotel
chain, the Holiday Corp., were illegal.
   But the commission said the tariff was unlawful only because
circumstances had changed since AT&amp;T made the offer in 1988.
   AT&amp;T offered the Holiday Rate Plan at discounts of 5 percent to
10 percent off its Pro America II rates and justified the rates as
a competitive response to a discount plan MCI Communications Corp.
wanted Holiday to buy.
   But MCI subsequently said its plan was available to all
customers. The FCC said that eliminated AT&amp;T's claim that it needed
to make a special competitive offering to just one customer in
response to MCI's bid.
   Federal rules require that AT&amp;T must make plans such as Tariffs
12 and 15 generally available to all similarly situated customers.
   The FCC did not rule on whether Tariff 15 was legal at the time
it was filed, which AT&amp;T construed as a victory.
   ``The FCC rejected AT&amp;T's Tariff 15 proposal on a very narrow,
factual ground,'' AT&amp;T said.
   Joe Naccio, AT&amp;T's vice president for business communications
services, told reporters the company had offered Tariff 15 to an
Indiana company, Resort Condominium International, ``and we're
going to honor that.''
   ``We'll file more,'' Naccio added. ``We think the commission
essentially affirmed our right to do that.''
   The commission made its determination even though an industry
newsletter, Communications Daily, reported Thursday that Holiday
Corp. was dropping Tariff 15 in favor of another AT&amp;T offering.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes also said he was ordering the
commission's common carrier bureau to begin an inquiry into whether
or not AT&amp;T should continue to be regulated as a ``dominant
carrier.''
   AT&amp;T contends it no longer is dominant.
   ``We agree emphatically with the FCC that the time is long
overdue to take a look at the fierce competion in the long-distance
business and the rules governing it,'' AT&amp;T said.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
has selected three more contractors for its $30 million program to
develop defense-related high-definition television technology.
   The Pentagon said Thursday the three contracting teams will
develop processor technology for HDTV displays.
   The teams are: David Sarnoff Research Center, Princeton, N.J.,
with Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., and Texas
Instruments Inc. of Dallas; Adams Russell Electronics of Waltham,
Mass., with Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Qualcomm
Inc. of San Diego, Calif.
   Lt. Col. Mark Pullen, the deputy director of DARPA's Information
and Science Technology Office, said the development work would help
with military display systems and promote the development of U.S.
technology in high-definition TV.
   Previously, the Pentagon has selected five contractors to
develop HDTV receivers and displays. Four are working on projection
displays: NewCo Inc. of San Jose, Calif.; Raychem Corp. of Menlo
Park, Calif.; Texas Instruments; and Projectavision Inc. of New
York City.
   The fifth company, Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood, Ohio,
is working on a plasma flat panel display similar to the liquid
crystal displays found on many watches and portable computers.
   Texas Instruments also is working on the plasma display
technology as a subcontractor to Photonics.
   NewCo has told the Pentagon it is working with Spectra Physics

<HEAD>Airline Takeover Frenzy Should Continue Despite Leaner Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though several highly publicized attempts to
take over major airlines failed recently and the industry is facing
leaner times, the wave of airline restructurings should continue,
airline officials and analysts say.
   Many airlines are predicting slimmer profits in coming months as
fuel prices rise and the economy slows. For the weaker players in
the increasingly competitive environment, the outlook is even
dimmer.
   On Thursday, Presidential Airways, a feeder carrier for United
Airlines, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy laws. The move follows Chapter 11 filings by two
other airlines this year: strikebound Eastern Airlines in early
March and Braniff Inc. in late September, its second such filing in
seven years.
   Braniff said Thursday it had hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to advise
it on a possible sale of the beleaguered airline.
   Airline fuel costs are up 20 percent to 25 percent over a year
ago, according to Edward Starkman, an industry analyst at
PaineWebber Inc.
   ``We're looking at a couple of tough quarters to come,'' he
said. ``The numbers have withered and died in the last couple of
weeks.''
   Al Frei, senior vice president of finance at America West
Airlines, says he expects passenger traffic overall to remain flat
or grow only slightly next year.
   ``We're beginning to see a softening,'' said Bruce Nobles,
president of Trump Shuttle, the former Eastern shuttle in the
Northeast that developer Donald Trump acquired this spring for $365
million. ``Business travel is tightening up a little bit. The
airlines tend to lead a recession and follow a recovery.''
   Nevertheless, analyst Starkman and others say, the weakness
won't have a chilling effect on takeover activity in the industry.
In fact, Starkman said, investors who were going after airlines
when their stocks were trading much higher now could ``see some
bargains out there.''
   ``The takeover activity is going to continue even in the face of
an uncertain, at best, stock market,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes
said in an interview.
   Bakes is a former attorney for the Civil Aeronautics Board who
had been influential in drawing up the 1978 law deregulating the
nation's airline industry. As one of the architects of
deregulation, he says he wasn't surprised by the pack of investors
bidding for major airlines _ only by how long it took them to make
their moves.
   The panic selling that rocked the stock market this month was
largely triggered by the breakdown of a $6.75 billion offer for
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. from its pilots and top managers.
And while UAL touched off the slide on Wall Street, its stock price
probably was the biggest casualty of the selloff.
   UAL stock has plummeted by more than 40 percent since Oct. 13,
when the pilot-management bid collapsed due to inadequate
financing. It closed at $170.75 a share Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down sharply from $285.25 on Oct. 12.
   Other airline stocks _ which also had been lifted by the
takeover euphoria _ have followed suit.
   Another splashy airline deal, Trump's $7 billion proposal to buy
AMR Corp., parent of industry leader American Airlines, also was
called off.
   The failures come against a backdrop of growing anxiety in the
Bush administration and Congress over airline takeovers.
   Despite the loss of altitude, airlines remain hot properties
because of their enormous cash flows and asset values. Bakes points
out, for example, that healthy carriers like American and United
own several billions of dollars in equity in new aircraft they have
ordered.
   Some megadeals still seem to be going through _ notably an
investor group's acquisition of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest
Airlines, for $4 billion.
   And despite recent posturing by Bush administration officials
against leveraged buyouts of airlines including foreign carriers,
senior Transportation and Treasury department officials said this
week that proposed legislation to restrict airline takeovers
wouldn't be good for the industry _ or the economy.

<BYLINE>What's In a Name? A Lot, Connecticut Town Says</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BLOOMFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ames Department Stores Inc.
celebrated its acquisition of the Zayre chain by officially
renaming 254 Zayre stores, at least one town found something
sinister about the changeover.
   Bloomfield officials say Ames' decision not to rename the local
Zayre could be interpreted as racist, since Ames officials
acknowledge that the Zayre stores retaining that name are
patronized by ``metropolitan residents'' who might not be as loyal
to an Ames store.
   Officials in Bloomfield, where one-third of the population is
black, interpret that as a slap at minorities, and they aren't
happy about it.
   ``While some might defend the current decision as economic,
others are likely to characterize it more as racism and
stereotyping,'' Mayor David A. Baram said in a letter to Rocky
Hill-based Ames.
   Ribbon-cutting ceremonies were held Thursday to celebrate the
renaming and remodeling of 254 former Zayre stores, but the
Bloomfield store is one of 61 in the country and three in New
England that are rentaining the Zayre name. The other two New
England stores are in the Roxbury and Roslindale sections of
Boston, both of which have large minority populations.
   Executives at Ames, which doubled in size when it bought the
392-store Zayre chain for $778 million a year ago, say market
research indicated Zayre's name recognition was strong and
favorable in the ``metropolitan areas'' where the switch won't be
made, mainly in Chicago, Miami, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.
   Ames' so-called urban-market strategy means that, in addition to
not taking on the Ames name, the 61 stores will carry merchandise
more suited to urban customers _ clothing and accessories, for
instance, as opposed to products like lawn mowers and patio
furniture, said Douglas Ewing, Ames' vice president for investor
relations.
   Bloomfield officials complain that because the town north of
Hartford has a significant black population among its 20,000
residents, Ames officials decided to lump its store there with
inner-city stores serving a lower-income clientel.
   ``Ames has decided to designate the Bloomfield outfit as an
urban outfit and they have made that distinction because they have
suggested their patrons are primarily minorities and lower-income
people who are renters,'' Baram said. ``They picked the wrong
community.''
   The mayor described Bloomfield as ``perhaps the most
successfully integrated community in the state of Connecticut,''
with its population one-third black and one-third Jewish, along
with a smattering of other minorities.
   It is also one of the state's most affluent communities, ranking
in the top 25 percent for per-capita income in Connecticut. Eighty
percent of Bloomfield families own their own single-family homes.
   ``The residents here need and require lawn items, snow-removal
items, things (Ames) claims Zayre doesn't sell because its patrons
are residents who don't engage in mowing their lawns or swimming in
their pools or playing tennis,'' Baram said.
   Ewing said shoppers at Ames and Zayre will find essentially the
same items, although Zayre ``will offer expanded selections of
apparel and accessories and a more limited assortment of the kinds
of merchandise that metropolitan residents don't purchase as much.''
   Ewing said the Bloomfield store was the only one that produced
objections for not taking on the Ames name and merchandise.
   The Ames-Zayre consolidation looks to be a profitable one for
the company, Ewing said. Ames now estimates it will save $40
million by the end of the year because of the Ames-Zayre
consolidation, compared with the $10 million it originally
estimated, he said.

<HEAD>McDonald's Announces Plastics Recycling Program To Counter Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers at McDonald's restaurants in New England
are being asked to separate plastic food containers from waste
paper under a recycling effort that officials hope will spread
across the country.
   McDonald's Corp. is undertaking the program with the National
Polystyrene Recycling Co., a joint venture formed earlier this year
by several leading producers of plastics, including Amoco Chemical
Co., Dow Chemical Co. and ARCO Chemical Co.
   Polystyrene products, which are not biodegradable, have received
criticism around the country, and more than a dozen cities have
enacted bans on the plastic products.
   But officials who spoke at a news conference Thursday at a
downtown McDonald's said garbage problems cannot be solved simply
by switching to more biodegradable materials.
   ``Where we have a shortage of space in landfills, the solution
lies in putting in less,'' said Shelby Yastrow, a McDonald's senior
vice president.
   Ken Harman, acting chairman of the joint venture and director of
styrene products for Dow, said landfills inhibit all products from
biodegrading, so ``to put paper in instead of plastic, you don't
really accomplish anything.''
   The recycling venture has set a goal to recycle 250 million
pounds of polystyrene per year by 1995, an amount equal to 25
percent of the polystyrene produced annually in the United States
for food service and packaging.
   Harman said New England is serving as the launch site for the
program because the joint venture has acquired Plastics Again, a
recycling plant in the town of Leominster.
   ``Here, we're ready,'' he said. ``We have a plant. We have a
capability.''
   The joint venture said it plans to establish four other regional
recycling centers by the end of 1990. These centers are planned for
Chicago, Philadelphia, Southern California and the San Francisco
area.
   Under the program with McDonald's, restaurant customers will be
asked to place their polystyrene foam hamburger containers,
utensils, salad containers and hot drink and sundae cups in special
trash bins marked ``for recyclable plastic only.''
   After the recyclable material is taken to the Leominster plant,
it will be turned into plastic resins, which will be sold to
companies that manufacture plastic products.
   Customers are already being asked to separate their plastic
waste at 100 McDonald's restaurants in New England, Yastrow said,
and about 450 restaurants are expected to be participating by early
next year.
   Based on initial tests, McDonald's expects 70 percent of its
polystyrene waste products will be turned in for recycling, Yastrow
said.
   Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the Environmental
Defense Fund, said he was encouraged by McDonald's efforts.
   ``Providing customers with an ability to recycle in their stores
is an important first step,'' Denison said in an interview from
Washington, D.C.
   But Denison said the program could have limitations.
   ``It only affects customers who eat in,'' he said. ``People who
take materials out of the store would have to be awfully ambitious
to participate in this.''
   McDonald's officials estimate that at restaurants equipped with
drive-in windows, 40 percent to 50 percent of its customers use
that service.
   But Yastrow expressed hope that people who take their food away
from the restaurants will separate their plastic items once they
learn about the effort.
   In fact, officials said educating customers about recycling was
a key part of the program.
   ``We need to have more initiatives like the one we're seeing
today,'' said Paul Keough, acting regional administrator for the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ``I hope that it's wildly
successful and will be copied around the country,''
   Tom Tomaszek, general manager of Plastics Again in Leominster,
noted that next month, the town of Sturbridge is scheduled to start
what is believed to be the first community program for separating
polystyrene products.
   National Polystyrene Recycling officials hope more communities
will initiate such efforts after the other four regional plants are
completed.
   The proposed sites were chosen based on strong support in those
regions for recycling programs, Tomaszek said.

<HEAD>Absolut Vodka Plans Talking Holiday Ad in Selected Issues of Vanity
Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This time, the voice coming from your magazine
will be wishing you good tidings.
   When readers open the four-page Absolut Vodka ad in selected
December copies of Vanity Fair magazine,they'll hear holiday
greetings in English, Italian and Spanish. The voices say,
``Absolut Vodka wishes you Merry Christmas ... Buon Natale ...
Feliz Navidad ... Happy Chanukkah.''
   It will be the second talking magazine ad in as many months when
it comes out in late November.
   Last week, Texas Instruments Inc. ran a talking ad in selected
issues of Business Week magazine extolling the company's
technological capabilities.
   Nonetheless, Carillon Importers Ltd. touts its Absolut ad as the
first of its kind to present a spoken message in support of a
``consumer'' product.
   The ad, with an embedded microchip to do the talking, cost about
$1.2 million to produce and distribute and is being included in
issues going to 200,000 subscribers of the magazine in New York
State and California.
   It is the latest in a series of unusual holiday ads from Absolut
admakers.
   Last year, they developed a magazine ad in which a clear plastic
wrap that contained a liquid and simulated snow was pasted over a
photo of an Absolut bottle. When the page was shaken, the ``snow''
seemed to fall around the bottle, just like in one of those plastic
snow globes tourists often buy.
   An Absolut magazine ad two years ago had a chip that played
Christmas music when the page was opened.
   In its latest ad, an Absolut Vodka bottle is draped in Christmas
ornaments, candles and tinsel on the first page above the words
``Absolut Joy.''
   Across the two-page center spread, bottles are lined up with the
name and description inscribed in Japanese, Russian, English,
Polish, Korean, Portuguese, Ukranian, Chinese and Greek above the
slogan ``To the World.''
   The message ends on the back page, ``(And an Absolut New Year.)''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Pound Stabilizing, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in calm European trading
early today and the pound was stabilizing after its tumble due to
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's resignation.
   Gold prices moved up.
   The sharp drop in the pound, signaling disarray in the British
financial markets after the Cabinet revolt Thursday, helped the
dollar as traders switched funds from the British into the U.S.
currency, dealers said.
   ``It was a signal to favor the dollar over the pound,'' said one
dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   Another trader at a French bank in Frankfurt said the move into
the dollar was a logical first reaction because it is the most
liquid currency where investors seek refuge in times of turmoil.
   ``But I believe the move is more a technical reaction and won't
last,'' he said. ``Next week, we should go weaker again.''
   ``But we have to wait to see whether this was an overreaction
Thursday or means a sustained weakness in the pound,'' he said.
   Traders said the Bank of England may have intervened in the
market to support the pound.
   Another dealer at a West German bank said Lawson's replacement
by John Major won't mean a change in British monetary policy, which
is likely to remain very tight.
   But some traders said the resignation has triggered a deep
crisis for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and will further
undermine the trust of the financial markets in the soundness of
British economic policy. The falling fortunes of Thatcher's
government, coupled with the huge British current account deficits,
could prompt a further decline in the pound's value, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.85 yen to a closing 142.75 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.63 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday's
prices, included; 1.8502 West German marks, up from 1.8390; 1.6203
Swiss francs, up from 1.6085l; 6.2805 French francs, up from
6.2455; 2.0928 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0810; 1,357.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,347.75; and 1.1760 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1750.
   In London, it cost $1.5755 to buy one pound, compared with
$1.6130 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $371 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $369. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $371.55.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.75 compared with $368.25 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.13 to close at a bid $371.87.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.18 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.13.

   The resignation of the British treasury chief sent
the pound plunging and the dollar rising against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply,
dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 142.75 yen, up 0.85 yen from Thursday's
finish and 0.62 yen higher than the New York finish overnight.
After opening at 142.02 yen, it rose to the day's high of 143.15
yen in early afternoon trading.
   Currency dealers said Japanese market players were selling
British pounds and buying dollars, resulting in the dollar's
relative bullishness against other currencies, including the
Japanese yen.
   Masafumi Koyama, a Bank of Tokyo trader, said dollar-yen trading
was light, but the dollar was bought actively against the
widespread selling of the British pound following British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's resignation.
   Lawson, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's treasury chief, and
her personal economic adviser Sir Alan Walters resigned Thursday in
a dramatic government shakeup.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
151.90 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 35,527.29.
   The market's main barometer opened slightly higher, but the
instability in the currency market and a poor showing in Wall
Street gradually pushed the index downward.
   Securities dealers attributed the Nikkei index decline to a
40-point fall in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 major
issues in New York overnight, but they did not say it was caused
directly by the news from London.
   ``The instability in the currency market doesn't seem to bother
stock investors because they are aware that it is only dollar-pound
business,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He added, however, that market players share the view that share
prices have ``reached an excessively high level,'' and that is
causing most shares to ease downward.
   Another dealer at a major Japanese securities firm said
construction shares, which have been the driving force of the
recent rally in the Tokyo market, were mostly bearish because of
the market's general sentiment that construction shares are higher
than their acceptable level.
   Trading of shares in Sansui Electric Co., which announced a
buyout by British Polly Peck International Plc. Friday, was
suspended.

<HEAD>Machinists May Compromise On UAL Ownership Stake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The airplane mechanics who helped scuttle an
employee buyout of UAL Corp. say they are willing to compromise
with United Airlines pilots on an employee ownership stake to
prevent an outside takeover of the company.
   The machinists union favors a restructuring of UAL but ``if we
have to get into some kind of ownership, we want minority ownership
just to keep the raiders out,'' John Peterpaul, vice president of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
said Thursday.
   Separately, the buyout group led by the pilots and UAL
management reiterated its intention to revise its bid for the
airline.
   Also Thursday, UAL reported its third quarter earnings were down
sharply from 1988, partly because of a $58.6 million charge related
to the botched buyout bid and partly because the year-earlier
period included a $393 million gain from the sale of UAL's share of
a computerized reservations system.
   The vehement opposition of the machinists to employee ownership
was seen as a factor in the failure of the $6.75 billion buyout
plan. The $300 a share proposal collapsed two weeks ago when the
buyout group, which also included British Airways PLC, failed to
secure financing.
   United's flight attendants joined forces with the group after
British Airways dropped out last week.
   UAL stock, which had plunged by more than 40 percent since the
plan collapsed, rose $9.75 a share to $170.75 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The price drop since the buyout group's Oct. 13 announcement
that it could not get financing has raised speculation that a
raider might attempt to buy up UAL shares to mount a takeover
attempt.
   Leaders of the Machinists, which represents United's mechanics
and ground-crew workers, met Thursday with financial advisers to
review the situation.
   Peterpaul said before the meeting his union was ready to
consider anything to ``get this company out of play and back into
the real world.''
   ``Ultimately, if we have to get into a posture between us and
the pilots to protect the airline and protect the jobs of
employees, I think ... we can reach a spirit of compromise,''
Peterpaul said in a telephone interview from Washington, where the
meeting was held.
   Frederick Dubinsky, chairman of the United pilots union, has
said the pilots still would like majority ownership by the
airline's employees but would settle for some form of control over
the airline, perhaps through super-majority voting rights.
   Financial advisers to United's pilots and flight attendants met
separately in New York on Thursday ``to fully explore the issues
and options,'' said Kathie Hardin, a spokeswoman for the United
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association in Chicago.
   In a statement issued late Thursday, the pilot-management group
said it was ``reviewing the situation with a view toward revising
its transaction and proceeding with the employee acquisition of UAL
Corp.''
   The statement said the group expected to have a proposal ready
for the UAL board ``in the near term.''
   The flight attendants' union represents about 14,000 United
employees, compared with 7,000 workers represented by the pilots'
union and 25,000 by the Machinists.
   UAL's top management was a 10 percent partner in the failed
buyout bid. But Chairman Stephen Wolf said Monday he was returning
his attention to running the airline, apparently at the urging of
UAL's board of directors.
   The board decided Monday not to sell the company for the time
being, while it explores other ways to increase shareholder value.
   In its earnings report, UAL posted a profit of $110.8 million,
or $5.11 per share, down from $402.4 million, or $18.68, a year
earlier.
   Excluding the $393 million gain from the sale of its interests
in the Covia reservations system, UAL's profit in the year-earlier
period was $179 million, or $8.31 per share.
   Revenue during the quarter rose to $2.6 billion from $2.4
billion in third quarter 1988.
   Earnings also were depressed by a $58.6 million charge for stock
appreciation rights, stemming from the surge in UAL's stock after
billionaire Marvin Davis made a buyout proposal that later was
countered by the pilot-management group's bid.
   Davis later withdrew his offer but said he remained interested
in UAL.
   For the first nine months of the year, UAL posted a profit of
$317.4 million, or $14.66 a share, compared with $1.1 billion, or
$34.35 per share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose to $7.4
billion from $6.75 billion.

<HEAD>Braniff Hires Merrill Lynch to Explore Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc., which is currently undergoing
bankruptcy court reorganization, says it has hired Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. to explore the possible sale of the airline.
   A Merrill Lynch team will work full-time with Braniff to seek
the best possible plan for the airline and its creditors, Mark J.
Schulte, managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said
Thursday.
   In late September, Braniff filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It was the airline's
second such filing in seven years.
   ``We believe that Braniff, its assets and its fine personnel
have an appropriate role to play in today's commercial air
transportation system,'' said William G. McGee, Braniff's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   ``We look to Merrill Lynch to help us appropriately define that
role and explore the best feasible plans to put these assets back
into the competitive environment.''
   Braniff now serves 11 U.S. markets with 46 daily flights.
   Separately Thursday, Presidential Airways, a feeder carrier for
United Airlines, announced that it had filed for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11. In early March, Eastern Airlines filed
under Chapter 11 a few days after it was struck by the unions
representing pilots, Machinists and flight attendants.

   Britain's new treasury secretary is expected to
pursue mostly the same economic policies, but London financial
markets were rocked today by the news of revolt in Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet.
   The new chancellor of the exchequer, John Major, was named to
the post Thursday night after Nigel Lawson abruptly resigned,
saying he couldn't continue to serve as long as Mrs. Thatcher
retained her economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters. Walters resigned
himself several hours later.
   Financial markets were hit hard by the government upheaval. The
pound plummeted late Thursday, sank in early trading today and then
stabilized, while stock prices skidded today before recovering some
of their losses.
   The Bank of England, which normally does not comment on its
activities, appeared to have intervened in the foreign exchange
market today to support the pound, dealers said.
   The markets were concerned about uncertainty and feared that the
government again would push up interest rates, which already stand
at an eight-year high of 15 percent. Even higher interest rates
would worsen fears of a recession in Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters outside her 10 Downing St. office
today that government policies would continue ``precisely as they
were'' despite Lawson's resignation.
   She expressed regret at his departure, citing his ``enormous
achievements,'' but said her new appointees were all experienced.
   The pound traded at $1.5790 in late morning today, compared with
a low of $1.5620 earlier in Asian trading, and $1.6130 in London
before Lawson resigned Thursday.
   On London's stock exchange, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-stock index was down 33.5 points, or 1.6 percent, at 2,095.9 at
midday after having been down nearly 44 points earlier in the
session.
   ``The market was already very uncertain about the economy and
this has just worsened matters,'' said Andrew Smith, a British
equities analyst at Laing and Cruikshank.
   ``Lawson's resignation will be very damaging to the market,''
said Charles Larkum, an analyst at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co. ``The focus will now be on sterling and whether U.K.
base (interest) rates will have to rise.''
   Major on Thursday quickly vowed to continue Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's fight against resurgent inflation with high
interest rates.
   But economists said they doubted Major would see a strong pound
as key in the fight against inflation, as Lawson did.
   The pound's decline reflects the disappearance of the ``Lawson
premium,'' said Nigel Richardson, an economist at the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.
   ``It takes the floor from under sterling,'' said Gavyn Davies,
an economist with Goldman Sachs International in London.
   Major, who was first secretary of the Treasury before being
named foreign secretary in July, said in his statement: ``I
strongly supported the government's economic and monetary policies
when last at the Treasury and I still do.''
   ``Inflation is the most damaging problem we face and its defeat
remains our overriding objective,'' he said.
   ``Monetary policy is tight and is beginning to have its
effect,'' he added. ``I shall keep it tight for as long as
necessary.''
   So far this year, Britain's annual inflation rate has more than
doubled to its current 7.6 percent, and the country's trade deficit
ballooned to the equivalent of $31 billion, from $23 billion at the
same time a year ago.
   The government has increased official interest rates 11 times
since June 1988, bringing them from a decade low of 7.5 percent to
15 percent, their highest level in eight years.
   The latest interest rate increase, on Oct. 5, of a full
percentage point was made in line with a West German interest rate
increase.
   The British move was attacked as excessive by the government's
critics, who warned that it could push Britain into a recession.
   But the government stood by its interest rate increases, which
are designed to curb consumer spending and borrowing.
   Economists said there were likely to be far fewer doubts about
Major's allegiance to Mrs. Thatcher's policies than there were
during Lawson's 6{ years at the Treasury.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been more faithful to free-market principles
in regard to foreign exchange movements than Lawson, who believed
in the benefits of a strong and stable exchange rate.
   Stability could be achieved by tying the pound to the exchange
rate mechanism of European Monetary System, which links eight of
the Common Market's 12 currencies and limits their movements,
Lawson believed.
   But Mrs. Thatcher believes the pound should be linked only after
Britain's inflation comes down to the level of inflation in other
European countries, and capital flows freely in Europe.
   Walters, who had public disagreements with Lawson, has been a
staunch proponent of allowing sterling to float to its natural
level.

   The Federal Communications Commission is
warning ``shock jocks'' that they will be fined if they broadcast
indecent material during daytime hours.
   The commission's mass media bureau Thursday issued $20,000 in
fines against four radio stations and said it was investigating
four others for alleged indecent broadcasts.
   The bureau, under new chief Roy Stewart, also eliminated a
backlog of 87 indecency complaints built up during the last two
years under former FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick.
   Fifty-one cases against 40 stations were dropped because the
purportedly indecent material was broadcast after 8 p.m., and 36
others were dropped because of defective complaints or inadequate
proof of violations, said Bill Johnson, deputy chief of the mass
media bureau.
   Thursday's action was another indication that the commission
under Chairman Alfred Sikes will crack down on indecent programming
between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Since Sikes took over in August, the FCC
has issued warnings to three radio stations and fined another
$2,000.
   Sikes and his three fellow commissioners also voted Thursday to
launch an inquiry into establishing a 24-hour ban on indecent
broadcasting Congress ordered last year.
   A court stayed implementation of the FCC rules in January, and
in September ordered the agency to conduct a study to justify the
ban.
   The commission defines broadcast indecency as language or
material that ``depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   It will take action when there is a ``reasonable risk'' that
children may be in the audience, the FCC said.
   Congress specifically ordered a ban to protect children and in
its announcement Thursday, the commission said it would consider
children to be age 17 and under.
   The stations cited Thursday and their fines were:
   _WIOD, Miami, licensed by Cox Broadcasting, $10,000 for five
alleged instances of indecent programming from Nov. 7 through Dec.
20, 1988.
   _WZTA-FM, Miami, licensed by Guy Gannett Publishing Co., $2,000
for allegedly broadcasting an indecent song Oct. 27, 1987.
   _KLUC-FM, Las Vegas, Nev., licensed by Nationwide Communications
Inc., $2,000 for broadcasting an allegedly indecent song May 16,
1988.
   _KFI-AM, Los Angeles, licensed by KFI Inc., $6,000 for alleged
indecent material on a telephone talk show Nov. 12, 1988.
   The stations were given 30 days to show why they should not pay
the fines, which can be appealed to the full commission.
   Four other stations were given 30 days to respond to complaints
they had broadcast indecent material. They were:
   _WXRK-FM, New York, licensed by Infinity Broadcasting, for a
Christmas party skit aired Dec. 16, 1988. The commission said the
material also may have been broadcast on two other Infinity
stations, WYSP-FM in Philadelphia and WJFK-FM in Manassas, Va.
   _KCCL-AM-FM, Paris, Ark., licensed by Diamond State
Broadcasting, for a broadcast telephone conversation between
station manager Gene Williams and his son.
   _WWWE-AM, Cleveland, licensed to Independent Group Limited
Partnership, for alleged indecent material on several days.
   _KSD-FM, St. Louis, licensed to Pacific and Southern Co., for
allegedly broadcasting excerpts from a Playboy magazine interview
with Jessica Hahn.
   Mike Disney, general manager of WIOD, told the Miami Herald: ``I
liken it to the Starship Enterprise going into a time warp and
suddenly the rules are different. Since Al Sikes has come in (as
FCC chairman) it's been a tremendous shift to the right.''
   Disney said he hasn't decided if WIOD will pay the fine. ``The
fact is that this is, I think, censorship and this would not stand
up against the First Amendment,'' he said.

   When stocks have been under pressure lately, brokers added, they
haven't attracted much support from ``bargain hunting'' investors.
   The market's extreme volatility of late is presumed to have
frightened off a good many participants who might otherwise be
buying stocks at marked-down prices.
   In addition, many Federal Reserve-watchers remain uncertain over
whether and when the Fed might take any further steps to relax its

<HEAD>Japanese Audio Maker Bought by British Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid a wave of buyouts by Japanese companies
overseas, a British company surprised the Japanese public Friday by
announcing plans to take over Sansui Electric Co., a well-known but
financially troubled Japanese audio manufacturer.
   Sansui agreed to a friendly takeover by the British conglomerate
Polly Peck International PLC, Sansui president Ryosuke Ito told a
news conference.
   PPI is to purchase 51 percent of Sansui shares by buying 39
million shares which are to be newly issued in early January, in
addition to 37.6 million shares currently held by other
shareholders, he said.
   The British company will pay some 15.7 billion yen, the
equivalent of $111 million, buying Sansui shares at 400 yen, or
$2.80, per share.
   ``After thorough examination, we have decided the tie-up with
PPI (Polly Peck International) will be the best way to restructure
our company,'' Ito told reporters.
   At the end of October 1989, Sansui had a cumulative debts
amounting to 13.8 billion yen, ``mainly due to our failure in
management to overcome the worsening external environment and tough
competition with other makers,'' he said.
   The deal made front-page news in major Japanese evening
newspapers Friday and prompted lively comment.
   ``Amid a recent wave of mergers and aquisitions of foreign
companies by Japanese firms, this is the first case in which a
major Japanese company is being saved by a foreign company,'' wrote
Yomiuri Shimbun, the nation's largest newspaper.
   With the British company's help, Sansui hopes boost profits by
starting production of VCRs to enter the audio visual equipments
market, while further developing its audio products, Sansui said in
the statement.
   Sansui has been financially in trouble since 1985, largely due
to the dollar's appreciation, and paid no dividends for the fourth
straight year, said Ito.
   Hikaru Matsunaga, minister of Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, told Japan Broadcasting Corp. he thinks the deal is
fine as long as it helps Sansui by solving its financial problems
and favorable management.
   He said the case proved that while Japanese companies are buying
foreign companies overseas, foreign investors are also seeking
opportunities in Japan, which is a good thing, the minister said.
   Asir Nadia, chairman and chief executive of PPI told a press
conference the same day that the tie-up between the two companies
proved that foreign firms are powerful enough to buy Japanese firms.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today she
will not change the economic policies that led to the treasury
chief's resignation and plunged her government into possibly its
worst crisis.
   Britain's financial markets were rocked by news of the revolt
Thursday. The pound plummeted late Thursday, sank further early
today, then stabilized. Stock prices, in their first chance to
react, dove this morning before recovering some of their losses.
   The new chancellor of the exchequer, John Major, was named to
the post Thursday night after Nigel Lawson abruptly resigned,
saying he could not continue to serve as long as Mrs. Thatcher
retained Sir Alan Walters as her economic advisor. Walters resigned
shortly afterward. He did not give a reason.
   Major said Thursday he will continue Mrs. Thatcher's fight
against resurgent inflation with high interest rates, which already
are at an eight-year high of 15 percent.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters outside her office today that
government policies will continue ``precisely as they were''
despite Lawson's resignation.
   She expressed regret at his departure, citing his ``enormous
achievements,'' but said her new appointments were all ``very
experienced ministers.''
   ``We have an excellent new team and it will be business as usual
and we shall go steadily forward,'' she said later at a public
appearance.
   The government says there is no alternative to high interest
rates to fight inflation and maintains the problems of inflation
and record trade deficits are improving.
   Critics say the policies have pushed Britain to the brink of
recession, and many in the public seem to agree.
   The government trails the socialist opposition Labor Party by up
to 10 percentage points in opinion polls. The next general
election, however, is not due until mid-1992.
   Labor party leader Neil Kinnock, in a BBC interview today,
blamed the crisis on ``the utter incompetence of the prime
minister.''
   The Times of London, which normally supports Mrs. Thatcher, said
she faced her biggest crisis since taking power in 1979.
   ``Crisis for Thatcher,'' the conservative Daily Telegraph
reported.
   The Independent reported: ``Government in turmoil ... Nigel
Lawson last night delivered Margaret Thatcher the biggest blow of
her decade in office and shook the Conservative Party to its
roots.''
   It said some members of Parliament have secretly discussed the
possibility of a leadership challenge after the new parliamentary
session opens next month.
   But senior Conservative leaders echoed party Chairman Kenneth
Baker, who dismissed any suggestion that Mrs. Thatcher's position
was at risk.
   ``She has been in many difficulties and come through them
successfully. There is not an economic crisis. The economy of the
country remains very strong,'' Baker said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview.
   Major said after his new appointment that fighting Britain's 7.6
percent annual inflation remained the government's overriding
objective. ``Monetary policy is tight and is beginning to have its
effect. I shall keep it tight for as long as necessary,'' he said.
   Lawson, 57, increased interest rates to 15 pecent in a bid to
choke off cost of living increases and prop up the pound on world
markets.
   He held the job since 1983, engineering tax cuts and an economic
recovery. He and Mrs. Thatcher appeared in close harmony as long as
the boom lasted, but when it began to falter 18 months ago, reports
of discord surfaced.
   The two were said to disagree over the currency, with Lawson
advocating a managed exchange rate and Mrs. Thatcher insisting it
be left to the mercy of market forces.
   Lawson also was thought to favor Britain joining the European
Monetary System, a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates. Mrs.
Thatcher favors joining only after British inflation declines and
capital flows freely in Europe. Walters opposed joining Europe and
criticized Lawson's policies.
   Lawson said in his resignation letter: ``The successful conduct
of economic policy is possible only if there is _ and is seen to be
_ full agreement between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
   ``Recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement
cannot be satisfied so long as Alan Walters remains your personal
economic adviser.'' Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member
responsible for law and order, became foreign secretary. David
Waddington, chief government business manager in Parliament, became
Home Secretary. No replacement was announced for Walters.

<HEAD>LIN Revises Merger Deal with BellSouth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp. said today it has revised
its plans to merge its cellular telephone operations with BellSouth
Corp. in a move evidently designed to thwart a buyout bid by McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc.
   The announcement provides another twist in what has already
proven to be a contorted series of moves begun last June when McCaw
launched an unsolicited takeover bid for LIN, a New York-based
cellular telephone and television company.
   LIN offered no estimate of the value of its revised plan.
   However, under the new proposal, LIN said it intended to give
its shareholders a special cash dividend of $42 per share before
the merger of cellular operations, up from an a $20 per share cash
dividend under an earlier plan.
   LIN said it was able to pay a higher dividend because BellSouth,
the regional telephone company based in Atlanta, agreed to
contribute more assets to the mereger of cellular interests than
originally envisioned.
   LIN also said it intended to exercise its right of first refusal
to buy Metromedia Co.'s 46 percent interest in a cellular franchise
serving New York City for $1.9 billion.
   LIN already owns most of the rest of that franchise, and McCaw
Cellular had recently offered $1.9 billion to buy Metromedia's
interest.
   One element of the original plan that remains unchanged is that
LIN shareholders would still get stock in a new broadcasting
company comprising LIN's television station interests that are to
be spun off. The LIN shareholders would also get stock in the new
cellular company.
   McCaw, the cellular telephone industry leader, has been pursuing
LIN since June and has offered $2.75 billion for 22 million of
LIN's shares in a deal that would give McCaw controlling interest
in LIN.
   Donald A. Pels, president anfd chairman of LIN, said in a
statement the revised agreement with BellSouth ``is clearly
superior to McCaw's coercive two-tiered offer.''

<TEXT>
   Regulators who tried to close Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association say the thrift's millionaire owner fought back
as late as this spring with political influence reaching the
highest levels of government.
   William J. Crawford, commissioner of the California Department
of Savings and Loans, told the House Banking Committee on Thursday
that two attempts were made from Washington on behalf of Phoenix
businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. to approve the sale of Lincoln
to a group of investors.
   Crawford never approved the sale, described as a ``sham'' by
federal regulator William Black.
   Within weeks of the calls, the Irvine, Calif.-based S&amp;L was
taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and is expected
to require a $2 billion bailout, making it the nation's costliest
thrift failure.
   Carolyn Jordan, an aide to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., urged
approval of the sale in March. In April, according to Crawford,
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., called Crawford's boss, Business,
Transportation and Housing Secretary John Geoghegan.
   Crawford said DeConcini called at the instigation of the top
federal thrift regulator, M. Danny Wall.
   In an 8{-hour hearing, Crawford and San Francisco-based
officials of Wall's agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
detailed Keating's three-year effort to deter them from bringing
enforcement action against his institution.
   The effort included what they characterized as secret meetings
in 1987 between Keating and Wall as well as the enlistment of five
senators to plead Lincoln's cause and the hiring of Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, then a private economist, as a
consultant to defend the thrift's financial condition.
   Michael Patriarca, the thrift office's chief supervisory agent
in San Francisco, and Black, counsel in that office, had
recommended in May 1987 that the government seize Lincoln to end
reckless activities and prevent further losses.
   Their recommendation was rejected, and in an unprecedented move
the case was transferred from the San Francisco office to agency
headquarters in Washington. Patriarca and Black said that delayed
action by two years.
   ``If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers ...
would have suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' Black said. ``It
need not have happened and would not have happened if (regulators
in Washington) had showed any backbone.''
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking panel,
said he would ask President Bush to have Wall take administrative
leave during the hearings.
   Gonzalez complained that Wall, by having a thrift office lawyer
meet earlier this month with Patriarca and Black, was attempting to
influence their testimony.
   In other developments:
   _Gonzalez revealed that shortly after the FDIC took over Lincoln
the agency discovered that telephones in an office used by
California state S&amp;L examiners had been rigged so that others in
the institution could eavesdrop on the examiners' confidential
conversations.
   An FDIC memo released by the committee said the matter was
referred to the FBI for criminal investigation.
   Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney representing Keating,
said corporate officials deny authorizing or participating in phone
tampering.
   _Patriarca revealed that in an apparent attempt to influence
him, his wife, Laura Patriarca, then an attorney with the thrift
office, was offered a job with American Continental.
   Testimony by Patriarca and Black illustrates Keating's wide
political reach, which included persuading five senators whose
campaigns he had helped fund to meet with regulators on his behalf
in April 1987.
   The five are Cranston; DeConcini; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Patriarca and Black said the bank board under Wall seemed more
protective of Keating's interests than of its own field staff.
Without informing regulators in San Francisco or asking for their
side of the story, they said Wall and other bank board officials
met dozens of times with Keating.
   In 1984 and 1985, when Keating was fighting a bank board effort
to restrict direct commercial and real estate investments by
thrifts, he enlisted the help of Greenspan, who in a ``very
influential'' letter distributed to members of Congress described
Lincoln as a strong institution, Black said.
   Patriarca, Black and Crawford appeared at the second of four
scheduled hearings on Lincoln. Keating and Wall are scheduled to
appear Nov. 7.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Weaken on Slack Export Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting disappointment in the low level of export sales this
week.
   Although the Agriculture Department announced sales of 100,000
metric tons of corn to South Korea and 25,000 tons of wheat to
Algeria this morning, traders said those transactions were
insignificant compared to the several million tons of U.S. grain
the Soviet Union bought last week.
   Despite the relatively slack demand this week, export sales of
U.S. corn and soybeans are running well ahead of last year and some
experts believe prices are headed higher in the long run.
   ``On any good breaks, buy some for your grandmother,'' advised
John Frazier, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures, which closed at four-week lows
Thursday, were \ cent lower to { cent higher with the contract for
December delivery unchanged at $3.98{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1\ cents lower with December at $2.43{ a bushel; oats were \ cent
to } cent lower with December at $1.45 a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 3{ cents lower with November at $5.64 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent lower with December at
74.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .62 cent lower

<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit declined slightly
to $152.1 billion in fiscal 1989, mostly because the government
spent only half as much as expected on savings and loan bailout in
August and September, it was announced today.
   The budget gap for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 represented a
$3.1 billion improvement over the $155.2 billion in red ink
recorded in 1988.
   The deficit had hit a record $221.1 billion in 1986, before
declining to $149.7 billion in 1987 as the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law pressured the administration and Congress into
holding down spending.
   However, since then progress has stalled and 1989 marks the
third consecutive year of essentially the same budget gap.
   In August, the government projected a $167.2 billion budget
deficit for the fiscal year, but the red ink came in under
projections. The government had planned to spend $18.8 billion on
savings and loan rescues, but spent only $9.1 billion, said a joint
report by the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and
Budget.
   The new agency created Aug. 9 for S&amp;L bailouts, the Resolution
Trust Corp., was unable to complete the sale of five large S&amp;Ls
before Sept. 30. That will shift those expenditures into the
current fiscal year, inflating the 1990 deficit.
   In September, the government spent $105.4 billion and collected
revenue of $99.2 billion, producing a deficit of $6.2 billion. In
September 1988, the government recorded a surplus of $10.2 billion.
   Spending in the 1989 fiscal year totaled $1.14 trillion, while
revenues added up to $990.8 billion.
   According to economists, one factor inflating the 1989 budget
gap was the timing of military pay, farm supports and Social
Security benefits. Those monthly payments normally occur on Oct. 1
_ the first day of the new fiscal year.
   But because that date fell on a Sunday, the checks were issued
the previous Friday, pushing about $10 billion in spending into
fiscal 1989.
   Also noteworthy in fiscal 1989 was the fact that interest on the
$2.8 trillion national debt surpassed Social Security spending for
the first time.
   As usual, the largest spending category was defense, which
totaled $27.8 billion in September and $294.9 billion for the year,
up 4.6 percent from 1988.
   Interest on the national debt was $16.3 billion last month and
$240.9 billion for the year, up 12.5 percent from the previous year.
   Social Security spending totaled $19.2 billion for the month and
$227.5 billion for the year, a 6.2 percent increase.
   Spending in the Department of Health and Human Services for
programs other than Social Security added up to $15.4 billion last
month and $172.3 billion for all of 1989, an 8.4 percent rise from
1988.

<HEAD>Japanese Pilots Union Says New Jet with Two-Man Crew Unsafe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese airline union officials on Friday said the
introduction of a new passenger jet with a crew of two instead of
the conventional three members would lead to a ``great reduction of
safety.''
   Their appeal, made at a news conference in Tokyo, marked the
latest round in a battle between the Flight Crew Unions Federation
of Japan and Japan's three major airlines over purchases of the new
plane.
   Japan Air Lines has announced it will buy 20 of the new Boeing
747-400s, widely thought to be the next-generation jet plane, and
All Nippon Airways is planning to purchase another 24.
   The main advantage of the 747-400 is its fuel-saving features,
which allow the plane to fly 930 miles farther than conventional
747s.
   But the new plane also features an advanced computer system,
which, Boeing Co. says, makes it possible to fly the 747-400 with
only two pilots and no flight engineer. The pilots union says the
omission of the third person is dangerous.
   ``The two-man cockpit design has extensively reduced information
for ackowledging the condition of the systems and airframe of the
aircraft. Also greatly reduced are the tools ... necessary for
coping with a malfunction,'' said Tetsuo Kimura, a flight engineer
for Japan Air Lines.
   But Geoffrey Tudor, director of JAL's public relations, said the
airline had done everything possible to ensure the plane's safety.
   ``We've asked Boeing for certain guarantees that their work is
going to be ... performing to the best possible standards of safety
as requested by the pilots,'' Tudor said.
   He denied that Japan Air Lines' purchase of the new planes was
part of a plan to cut its workforce, said to be one of the highest
paid in the world for an airline. Former flight engineers who lose
their jobs will be sent to a training school to become pilots,
Tudor said.
   ``No one's going to be laid off. That's not the management's
intention at all,'' he said.
   Tetsuya Muranaka, general secretary of the Flight Crew Unions
Federation, denied that union opposition to the new aircraft was
connected to the potential unemployment of union members.
   It ``is not related to the livelihood of the pilots; it is a
matter of our lives and the lives of the passengers,'' he said.
   Muranaka said the unions' goal was not to prevent the airlines
from purchasing the new planes, but to force them to make the
planes safer. He added that the unions might resort to strikes if
necessary.
   After Japan Air Lines released a video last year advertising the
new plane, the Flight Crew Unions Federation spent 3 million
Japanese yen, or around $21,000, to put together its own hour-long
response.
   The federation has since filmed another, shorter video aimed at
a general audience. A Japanese press report said Japan Air Lines
was considering filming another video to respond to those made by
the federation.

   Boeing Co. announced plans Friday for a
reorganization of military and space exploration work to cut losses
on defense projects and reduce overhead costs on government work
generally.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the organizational changes
were largely a matter of redrawing flow charts and executive
assignments without any change in job assignments or employment
level at any plant.
   Many details, however, have been left to be determined by a
transition team, and there is no target level for savings, Binder
said.
   He added that a production-halting strike that began Oct. 4 by
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
was not a factor in the reorganization.
   Last year Boeing reported $125 million in profits on missiles
and space systems, chiefly the Aerospace and Electronics division,
and losses of $95 million on military transportation products and
related systems, covering most of the other affected divisions.
   Effective Jan. 2, a Defense and Space Group will cover Boeing
Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan.; Boeing Aerospace and
Electronics and Boeing Advanced Systems, both in Seattle; Boeing
Helicopters near Philadelphia, and ARGOSystems of Sunnyvale,
Calif., near San Francisco.
   All of Boeing's commercial airplanes are assembled in Seattle
and the surrounding communities.
   Boeing work in Wichita is being reorganized under a Wichita
Branch covering military work and a Wichita Division of Boeing
Commercial Airplanes.
   Work done in Wichita, now performed under the heading of Boeing
Military Airplanes, is actually 53 percent devoted to production of
components for the 737, 747, 757 and 767 commercial plane airframes.
   Boeing Advanced Systems will be renamed Boeing Military
Airplanes, with jurisdiction over the Wichita Branch.
   ``This unified organization structure will increase the
management focus and facilitate performance improvements in certain
overhead elements of our current defense and space activities,''
Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz said in a prepared statement.
   With the moves, Binder said Boeing would be in a better position
to land what is expected to be a dwindling number of military and
space exploration contracts.
   He denied the changes involved any switch in emphasis between
Boeing's commercial side, which has recorded record sales and
profits in recent years, and the less successful military side.
   ``We are trying to make ourselves more competitive in the market
_ both markets,'' he said.
   Boeing senior vice president B. Dan Pinick, who serves as
president of Aerospace and Electronics, was named president of the
group by Shrontz.
   John Dempster, chief design engineer for Boeing Military
Airplanes, was named vice president of that division and general
manager of the new Wichita Branch.
   C.G. King, currently president of Boeing Advanced Systems,
becomes president of Boeing Military Airplanes.
   Robert Dryden, now president of Boeing Military Airplanes, was
named head of the Wichita Division and executive vice president of
Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

   Mobil Corp. said Friday that a previously
announced reorganization of its U.S. operations would involve the
reduction of approximately 400 employees nationwide.
   The country's second largest oil company behind Exxon Corp. said
the biggest reduction would come from slashing the staff in its
Denver office from 430 people to 105.
   Charles E. Spruell, president of Mobil's exploration and
production unit, said the changes would be concentrated in
operations responsible for drilling wells and pumping crude and
natural gas.
   The cutbacks are scheduled to begin ``in a few weeks'' and will
continue over several months, Mobil said.
   Mobil disclosed the reorganization Tuesday, calling it part of
an effort to cut costs and improve profits in the United States,
where depressed oil prices have made exploration and drilling much
less profitable.
   Offices in Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Midland, Texas,
also will lose workers, said Mobil spokesman John Lord, while
offices in Bakersfield, Calif., Liberal, Kan., and Oklahoma City
will gain some.
   Mobil has 69,500 employees worldwide, including 5,000 in its
U.S. exploration and production units.
   In its third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, Mobil said it
had taken a $40 million provision for the restructuring costs.
   Mobil reported a 4 percent decline in net income compared with
the 1988 third period _ $532 million, or $1.30 a share, vs. $557
million, or $1.36 a share. Revenue totaled $13.6 billion, up 4
percent from $13.1 billion a year earlier.
   Analysts said Mobil's restructuring reflects an industrywide
reshuffling of assets because of declining U.S. output. Domestic
production fell by more than 500,000 barrels a day during the first
nine months of this year.

   Scandinavian Airlines System, Swissair
and Finnair announced Friday they had reached a far-reaching
cooperation agreement to strengthen their positions in the 1990s
and open the way for increased travel to Eastern Europe.
   SAS, jointly owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the Swiss
carrier Swissair and Finland's Finnair, said in a joint statement
their aim was to create a competitive service system.
   They said they expected flights between the Nordic capitals to
increase by around 30 percent and give passengers direct access to
Finnair's daily flights to Moscow and Leningrad in the Soviet Union.
   Under the agreement, which will take effect next March, SAS and
Finnair will buy shares in each other but continue to operate as
separate companies. Finnair also will buy a part of hotel chain
International Continental Hotels, which is owned 40 percent by SAS
Intercontinental Hotels.
   Last month, SAS and Swissair announced an agreement aimed at
establishing a combined route system by next summer.
   SAS, based in Stockholm, has actively been seeking links with
other airlines. Managing Director Jan Carlzon has predicted that no
more than five major European carriers will remain by the mid-1990s.
   In the past year, SAS has bought 10 percent of Texas Air Corp.
as a way to link up with Continental Airlines, a Texas Air
subsidiary. It also has purchased 25 percent of Airlines of Britain
Holdings PLC, owner of four British carriers, and formed a joint
venture with All Nippon Airways of Japan.
   In addition, SAS has a longstanding cooperation pact with Thai
Airways International. Last month SAS announced a cooperative deal
with the Chilean domestic carrier LanChile.

   Share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active

resignation and a rapid selloff on Wall Street.
   London shares were driven lower initially by Thursday losses in
New York and by the drop in the British pound after Lawson's

central bank intervention supported the pound, but were overcome by
Wall Street's decline late in London trading and signs of further
weakness in sterling.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index shed 47.3
points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 2,082.1. That was down 4.5

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said today it will
borrow $17 billion on an emergency basis early next week so it can
pay Social Security benefits to 38.9 million retirees and avert an
unprecedented government default.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Thursday the emergency
borrowing will enable monthly Social Security checks to go out on
schedule Nov. 3 regardless of whether Congress breaks a deadlock
and passes an increase in the national debt limit.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, today
denounced the emergency auction as ``obviously a transparent
political move to enhance the effort to get a capital-gains tax
cut. There apparently is no limit to what they'll do'' to reach
that goal.
   Republicans will attempt to attach the capital-gains reduction
to a bill extending the debt limit. Because of stiff opposition of
Democratic leaders, that effort is likely to result in a filibuster
that would delay a vote on the debt bill.
   Announcing the details of the debt auction today, the Treasury
Department said it will speed up the issuance of $15.6 billion in
three-month and six-month bills. They will be auctioned on Monday
as scheduled, but issued on Tuesday rather than Thursday. Also on
Monday, the Treasury will auction $2 billion in 51-day cash
management bills, to be issued the next day.
   Treasury officials went forward with the borrowing after
congressional leaders were not forthcoming with assurances that
Congress would be able to pass an extension of the debt legislation
before the midnight Tuesday deadline, when the current $2.87
trillion debt ceiling drops to $2.8 trillion.
   Brady's announcement came in a letter to House Republican Leader
Robert Michel.
   Brady said in his letter that the government will have $17
billion in borrowing authority left on Monday, which he will use to
raise cash in the financial markets before the Tuesday deadline.
   A Treasury official, briefing reporters on condition that his
name not be used, called the emergency borrowing unprecedented and
said it will cost the government money through higher interest
rates that will have to be paid on the debt due to the hurry-up
nature of the borrowing announcement.
   The official said, however, that Brady decided to go forward
with the borrowing because he did not feel he had any choice. The
alternative, the official said, would have been an unprecedented
default by the government on its obligations.
   The emergency borrowing will only enable the government to
scrape by until Nov. 7, when it will again run out of money.
   At times of other debates over extension of the debt ceiling,
the government has been able to function for several days after
hitting the borrowing limit essentially on a cash basis where it
meets its routine obligations out of tax revenues it receives on a
daily basis.
   The House last spring passed an increase in the debt ceiling to
$3.1 trillion. However, the measure has yet to clear the Senate,
where it has been bogged down in debate over a host of unrelated
matters, such as the proposed cut in the capital gains tax.

approval to buy up to 15 percent of Jaguar. The two automakers are
in the midst of negotiating an operating agreement that may involve
General Motors taking a minority stake in Jaguar.
   Jaguar Chairman John Egan has said he hopes to announce a deal
with GM by mid-November.
   Ford announced last month that it planned to acquire 15 percent
of Jaguar's stock and received regulatory approval for the
purchase. In a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Ford said it was prepared to bid for all outstanding
Jaguar stock when takeover restrictions are lifted at the end of
1990.
   Jaguar bylaws prevent any outside individual or company
acquiring more than 15 percent of its stock before Dec. 31, 1990.
   Jaguar has spurned Ford's overtures, saying it favors a
cooperative agreement with General Motors that would allow it to
maintain its independence.
   A GM spokesman said the company received early clearance for its
stock purchase from the Federal Trade Commission, which must
approve major share acquisitions under the Scott-Rodino act.
   GM said it had no further comment on its plans.

   Wall Street was stunned. Bond brokers froze.
Doomsayers talked of financial disaster.
   That was the scene a year ago, as the biggest takeover battle of
all time consumed RJR Nabisco Inc. When it was over, the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. had defeated the food and
tobacco giant's top management, paid a record $24.53 billion in
borrowed money and put the company heavily into debt.
   Critics of the 1980s takeover era said RJR Nabisco would be
crushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banks
that financed the deal. The bond market, already reeling from a
rash of high-priced takeovers, was traumatized because investors
thought the buyout binge had gone too far.
   What a difference a year makes.
   Despite a debt of $23 billion, RJR Nabisco now is seen as a
relative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffeted
with uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers.
   ``I think the company is doing tremendously well,'' said Kurt
Feuerman, a securities analayst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Jack Maxwell of Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va., said,
``It's a good company and they've got a good team.''
   Investors also praise the new RJR Nabisco. Confidence in the
company was evident in the recent performance of the company's
high-yield ``junk bonds'' that were used to finance the takeover.
Prices skidded on the high-yield market after other big buyouts ran
into trouble recently. RJR Nabisco's didn't.
   There are two reasons why.
   Because of the nature of RJR Nabisco's business, the company is
considered inherently more stable than other companies. Investors
also have confidence in its management.
   The biggest worry for highly leveraged companies like RJR
Nabisco is cash flow _ without a strong, steady influx of money,
they can't pay their interest bills.
   Several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow hasn't matched
projections. The most notorious case has been Campeau Corp.'s $6.6
billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc., a wobbly
transaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks ago
because Campeau couldn't pay its interest.
   Kohlberg Kravis, the acknowledged leader of debt-financed
takeovers, played no role in the Campeau-Federated problem, but
some of its financial deals have faced difficulty. For example, its
$360 million buyout of Seaman Furniture Co., had to be refinanced.
   No one expects that to happen at RJR Nabisco, because the
company's products are considered ``recession proof'' _ even in
hard times, people would still eat Oreos and smoke Camels.
   ``They have a predictable cash flow generating capability which
exceeds interest expense and capital expense,'' said Michael
Dahood, a bond market analyst. ``The stability of the enterprise is
not threatened by debt expense.''
   The company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. _ along with other
tobacco firms _ has lost market share to industry leader Philip
Morris Cos. Inc. in recent years, but the analysts see little cause
for concern.
   ``Tobacco profits should grow 15 percent his year and another 20
percent next year,'' said Drexel's Feuerman, noting that profit
growth from overseas sales is also in the range of 20 percent.
   Analysts and investors say they're satisfied with the way RJR
Nabisco Chairman Louis Gerstner has handled the company since he
arrived there from American Express Co. eight months ago.
   They particularly like the prices he's gotten for assets RJR
Nabisco has sold to help repay its debt load.
   The company has sold five European food businesses for $2.5
billion; its Chun King division for $52 million; its Associated
Biscuits International Ltd. for $44 million; Del Monte fresh fruit
operations for $875 million; Del Monte's canned food business for
$1.48 billion; and most recently, its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and
Pearson candy businesses for $370 million.
   The sold divisions won't cost RJR Nabisco that much business and
``what they have left is very strongly positioned,'' Feuerman said.
   RJR Nabisco must still dispose of some $230 million in assets to
reach its goal of $5.5 billion in divestitures. ``There are some
smaller parts of the company that we're exploring at this point,''
but the company does not plan to shed any major divisions, Gerstner
said in an interview.
   Individual product lines are the most likely to go.
   Maxwell, the Wheat First analyst, said he was pleased by cost
and inventory reductions and by the company's plans for boosting
tobacco sales. In recent years, R.J. Reynolds has turned around its
once-lagging Camel brand, and is focusing on revitalizing Winston
and Salem sales, Maxwell said.
   The battle for RJR Nabisco marked a quantum leap in the scope of
the takeover trend reshaping American business. For the first time,
it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could be
acquired with borrowed money.
   The company announced on Oct. 20 that its chief executive, F.
Ross Johnson, was considering a bid of about $17 billion.
   That kind of money was beyond comprehension on Wall Street. But
four days later, Kohlberg Kravis announced a $20.25 billion offer,
signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included the
investment firm First Boston Corp.
   The RJR Nabisco fight not only dwarfed all records for
takeovers, it came against a background of brawls for two other big
food companies.
   Just days before, Philip Morris had launched an $11 billion
offer for Kraft Inc. and Pillsbury Co. had rejected a $5.23 billion
bid from the British firm Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   In both cases the suitors won. And late in the evening of Nov.
29, RJR Nabisco announced that Kohlberg Kravis had emerged the
winner.
   Johnson was vanquished but still rich from a severance package
and the sale of his own RJR Nabisco stock when he resigned in early
February. He took several top RJR Nabisco managers with him, but
analysts said they were satisfied with Gerstner's replacements.
   Kohlberg Kravis is also said to be happy with RJR Nabisco's
performance. The investment firm is smarting from Seaman's problems
and reports that it has been disappointed by other investments, and
its reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover.
   For Gerstner, the outside world's obsession with the size of the
takeover is irrelevant. It's running the business that's most
important.
   ``You've got to separate that financial transaction from the
great marketing strength and production strength of this company,''
he said.

<HEAD>Britain's Markets Are Buffeted by Political Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's financial markets were buffeted Friday
by the political storm over the abrupt resignation of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's treasury secretary.
   The markets were jolted by uncertainty over the government's
exchange-rate policy and were highly nervous that a resulting steep
decline in the British pound would prompt the government to push up
interest rates above their 8-year high of 15 percent.
   The pound ended at $1.5750 in London Friday, up from a low of
$1.5620 earlier in Asian trading, but down from $1.6130 in London
Thursday before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned.
   On the London Stock Exchange, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-stock index fell 47.3 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at
2,082.1, near its session low.
   Higher interest rates would increase the growing chances of a
recession in Britain, already suffering from the highest interest
rates and inflation among the major industrialized countries.
   ``That's obviously the big fear at the moment,'' said Anthony
Thomas, an economist with the London investment firm Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities.
   Said Keith Skeoch, economist at James Capel and Co.: ``That's
going to be touch or go whether we go to 16 percent.''
   He added: ``We're pretty close to a recession here at the moment
anyway.''
   Mrs. Thatcher declared Friday that it was ``business as usual,''
and that she would continue her economic policies.
   A new chancellor of the exchequer, John Major, was named to the
post Thursday night after Lawson abruptly resigned after six and a
half years in the position.
   Belatedly on Friday evening, the Treasury issued the text of a
speech Major was to make later, saying, ``I favor a firm exchange
rate.'' But most of the day's trading had wound down by then.
   Lawson, an elected member of Parliament, said he couldn't
continue to serve as chancellor as long as Mrs. Thatcher retained
her economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters. Walters also resigned
Thursday, several hours later.
   Lawson's departure, forcing a Cabinet shuffle in the face of a
deteriorating economy, is Mrs. Thatcher's biggest crisis since
coming to power in 1979, the British press and her critics say.
   Some of London's investment firms stayed open all night Thursday
to trade the pound and shares because the news of Lawson's
resignation came after the stock market closed.
   The Bank of England intervened in the foreign-exchange market
Friday to support the pound, dealers said. The British central bank
normally does not comment on its market activities. The U.S.
Federal Reserve was reported intervening late in the London day to
help support the pound.
   But the Bank of England refrained from pushing up interest
rates, for the time being, by leaving its money-market rates
unchanged.
   Analysts said the government was in a difficult position. An
interest-rate increase could signal _ and cause _ panic. But
standing pat could encourage the pound to slide further, and that
might fuel inflation _ just what Mrs. Thatcher wants to avoid.
   ``The government is falling over itself to emphasize this is not
a crisis,'' Thomas said. ``If they put up interest rates, it's
tantamount to admitting it is a crisis.''
   Analysts complained that they weren't sure of what Major's
currency policy was. Lawson believed a strong pound was key to
fighting inflation, and supported managing exchange rates. Walters
believes in free-floating rates.
   Britain's annual inflation rate has more than doubled to its
current 7.6 percent. The country's trade deficit ballooned to the
equivalent of $31 billion so far this year, from $23 billion at the
same time a year ago.
   The government has pushed up interest rates 11 times since June
1988, bringing them from a decade low of 7.5 percent to 15 percent,
their highest level in eight years.
   ``Clearly, the next week or 10 days is going to be a very
uncertain period until that confidence is established in the
market,'' Thomas said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations for an
active harvesting weekend in the Southeast and the Mississippi
Delta region.
   Corn futures also fell while wheat futures finished mixed.
   With most of the Midwestern corn and soybean crops now in, the
harvest is moving south. Dry weather is expected in southern
soybean areas this weekend, which should allow the fieldwork to
move along rapidly.
   A lack of significant export business limited buying interest in
the grain markets, analysts said.
   Although the Agriculture Department announced overnight sales of
100,000 metric tons of corn to South Korea and 25,000 tons of wheat
to Algeria, traders said those transactions were insignificant
compared with the several million tons of U.S. grain the Soviet
Union bought last week.
   Nevertheless, export sales of U.S. corn and soybeans are running
well ahead of last year and some experts believe prices are headed
higher in the long run.
   ``On any good breaks, buy some for your grandmother,'' advised
John Frazier, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to 2\
cents higher with the contract for December delivery at $3.98{ a
bushel; corn was 2} cents lower to \ cent higher with December at
$2.42 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with December

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced Friday it is selling
its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle
Foods Corp. for $370 million.
   The sale leaves RJR Nabisco about $230 million from its goal of
$5.5 billion in asset sales for raising cash to reduce the
company's debt load following its $24.53 billion leveraged buyout
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   The deal with Nestle, a division of Switzerland's giant Nestle
SA, includes a manufacturing plant in Franklin Park, Ill.
   The company began its asset sales program earlier this year
after Kohlberg Kravis completed its acquisition of the food and
tobacco giant. Kohlberg Kravis agreed to sell $5.5 billion in
assets in return for financing the deal, the most expensive
corporate takeover ever.
   RJR Nabisco earlier sold five European food businesses for $2.5
billion; its Chun King division for $52 million; its Associated
Biscuits International Ltd. for $44 million; Del Monte fresh fruit
operations for $875 million; and Del Monte's canned food business
for $1.48 billion.
   RJR Nabisco Chairman Louis Gerstner has said the company would
not sell any more major divisions to reach its goal. Individual
product lines are considered the most likely sale candidates.
   Analysts say RJR Nabisco has negotiated good prices for the
divisions, and will not lose much in operating income because of
the divestitures.
   Nestle produces such well known goods as Nestle chocolate bars
and Raisinets candy, Nescafe coffee and Nestle Quik chocolate drink
mixes.

<HEAD>Sagging Real Estate Market Drags Down Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sagging real estate market in New England is
causing trouble for the region's banks, which competed to lend
money during a building boom earlier this decade but now have seen
many loans go bust.
   ``Everyone was caught up in the euphoria of the market and they
didn't remember that what goes up will also come down,'' said Leo
Spang, senior vice president in the real estate division at Shawmut
Bank in Boston.
   The result of the downturn will be lower stock prices and
earnings for shareholders, and more reluctance by banks to finance
real estate projects, experts say. Also, analysts predict that some
small financial institutions could be forced to shut down.
   ``This real estate correction is going to take a pound of flesh
from most banks and thrifts,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking
analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. in Portland, Maine.
   In recent weeks, the region's largest banks have been wounded
because of shaky real estate loans.
   Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings for both Bank of
Boston and Bank of New England, in both cases citing the weakened
real estate market.
   For example, Bank of Boston reported that in New England, it has
around $400 million in non-performing commercial real estate loans,
meaning developers are having trouble making payments.
   To cover the bad loans, Bank of Boston shifted money into its
reserves and reported a $125 million loss in its last quarter.
   ``It's clearly a problem,'' company spokesman Wayne Taylor said,
``otherwise the bank would not have reported its biggest loss in
history.''
   Similar news came this week from smaller banking companies.
Heritage Bancorp of Holyoke, Mass., and One Bancorp of Portland,
Maine, both reported that their non-performing assets had grown
sharply, and as a result they took losses for the quarter.
   ``The banks that were really players are all experiencing
difficulty,'' said Vincent Furey Jr., president and chief executive
officer of One Bancorp.
   Analysts say these losses can be blamed on natural cycles in the
real estate market, but also on a failure by many banks to see that
the cycle would change.
   ``Things were straight up,'' Cassidy said. ``Everyone was having
a great old time.''
   The real estate fortunes mirrored growth in the region's
economy, which boomed in the mid-1980s. But problems began when the
economy started to weaken, because many commercial developments
were already in the works but still needed tenants.
   ``It's not the boom times,'' said Michael Manzo, president of
the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. ``The demand for office space
is off. Job formation, job growth is not what it was.''
   With office buildings and condominiums having a hard time
finding tenants, many developers have had trouble paying off their
loans. The result is that banks are now struggling with some loans
that they should not have approved, analysts say.
   ``A lot of banks were competing (for developments) and some of
them got into poor lending practices,'' said James Moynihan, senior
vice president of Advest Inc. in Boston.
   Banking officials defend their past lending practices, but they
also say they have tightened the current availability of loans.
   ``The fact is there are not many new deals out there,'' said
Spang, at Shawmut Bank. ``Developers are not moving forward on
speculative products, and banks wouldn't approve them anyway.''
   Analysts say banks could feel bad effects from the real estate
market for another couple of years, until the excess commercial
space is absorbed.
   But that does not mean new construction is dead. Developers can
still get financing for projects that have minimal risks, said
Wayne Clough, vice president of Boston Financial Group.
   ``The old days of speculative building are gone,'' he said.
``But there's still a good appetite for well-sponsored deals.''

   The dollar weakened substantially against all
major currencies except the British pound Friday, undermined by
another poor session in the U.S. stock market and expectations of
lower interest rates.
   Sterling stayed stuck in the slump it lapsed into when the
British government's top finance official abruptly quit on Thursday.
   Gold prices gained sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $378.30 a troy
ounce, up $5.80 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New
York quoted an ounce of gold at $377.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $6.15
higher than Thursday's late bid.
   The dollar ended near its lowest levels of the day. Currency
dealers said selling motivated by internal market factors
accentuated the weakness.
   But much of the impetus to unload dollars came from the stock
market where the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss
for the week of 92.42 points, at 2,596.72.
   Rumors circulating in the bond market that a major Japanese
investor was dumping long-term U.S. Treasury bonds also depressed
the dollar. If U.S. stocks and bonds fall out of favor, there would
be less demand for dollars.
   News that the U.S. budget deficit totaled $152.1 billion in
fiscal 1989, which ended Sept. 30, highlighted another weak spot in
the U.S. economy. The deficit has shown little improvement for
three straight years.
   ``The market's perception of a fragile stock market, a possibly
faltering economy and announcement of the size of the budget
deficit'' pushed the dollar down,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior
trader at the Bank of Boston in New York.
   A bearish attitude toward the dollar has been reinforced lately
by numerous economic numbers showing sluggish growth. There is
speculation that the Federal Reserve Board soon will decide to
stimulate growth by nudging interest rates lower. Declining U.S.
rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments,
tending to curb dollar demand.
   The British pound, jarred by the resignation of Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson on Thursday, finished the London trading
day at $1.5750, substantially lower than $1.6130 the day before.
   But sterling managed to rebound slightly from its worst levels
with a little help from the Bank of England and the Fed. Both
central banks reportedly bought pounds and sold dollars to stall
the pound's slide. The London closing price was up from a session
low of $1.5620.
   The pound also dropped to 2.8820 Deutsche marks, compared with
2.9650 marks late Thursday.
   Later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.5795, up slightly from
$1.5780 on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.85 yen to a closing 142.75 yen. But
in London, it fell back to a late rate of 141.90 yen. The dollar
ended New York trading at 141.75 yen, down from 142.125 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
quotes, included: 1.8295 West German marks, down from 1.8410;
1.6005 Swiss francs, down from 1.6115; 6.2150 French francs, down
from 6.2545; 1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17545; and
1,348.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in London compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.8300 West German marks, down from 1.8390;
1.6005 Swiss francs, down from 1.6085; 6.2190 French francs, down
from 6.2455; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0810; 1,342.00
Italian lire, down from 1,347.75; and 1.1746 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1750.
   Precious metals gained around the world.
   Gold traded in London at a bid price of $374.25 a troy ounce,
the highest since July 26, compared with late Thursday's $369.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.00 compared with $368.25 late
Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $3.13 to close at a bid $371.87.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.19 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.13. On New York's Comex silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.279, up from Thursday's settlement
of $5.194.

   Gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in 3{ months
Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange as investors unnerved by
the stock market's gyrations opted for the perceived safety of
precious metals.
   ``The market is getting back into the viewpoint that gold is a
store of value, that it retains purchasing power,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Silver and platinum futures also rose sharply.
   On other futures markets Friday, copper advanced, oil prices
rose, livestock and meat were mostly lower, and grains and soybeans
were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.80 to $7 higher with the contract for
spot delivery at $378.30 a troy ounce, the highest spot price on
the Commodity Exchange since July 12. The most active gold
contract, for December delivery, settled at $381.20 an ounce,
braking the $380 barrier for the first time since Aug. 3.
   Silver finished 8.3 cents to 9.2 cents higher with December at
$5.32 an ounce; platinum futures climbed $9.30 to $9.70 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, where the January contract settled at
$499.30 a troy ounce.
   The precious metals markets have been in a slump for most of
this year. Gold has not approached $400 since late January.
   But the stock market's recent volatility _ beginning with a
190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 _
has stoked recession fears in investors whose appetite for gold had
already been whetted by the weakening dollar.
   ``The gold market is no longer solely dependent on dollar
movement,'' said William O'Neil, research director with Elders
Futures Inc. ``The key fundamental behind this rally is the general
uncertainty surrounding equities.''
   The Dow average fell a total of 92.42 points this week,
including a 17-point drop on Friday that analysts attributed to
concern about lower corporate earnings.
   Stock-index futures also lost ground Friday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of
stocks represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 2.35
points to 337.20. The contract is worth $500 a point.
   Ms. Raptopoulos said a sharp drop in the London stock market
triggered by the resignation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson added to the economic worries.
   Copper futures posted moderate gains on the Comex, erasing
Thursday's losses in a technically inspired rebound after falling
sharply for two weeks.
   Copper settled .25 cent to 1.7 points higher with December at
$1.158 a pound.
   Most oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
traders evened up their positions after a week of losses.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 39
cents higher with December at $19.77 a barrel; heating oil was .40
cent to .59 cent higher with November at 57.68 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to 1.07 cent higher with November at
54.62 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid expectations for weaker spot markets, especially for
hogs, next week.
   Cattle futures settled .45 cent to .68 cent lower with December
at 74.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .50 cent
lower with November at 82.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .80 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with December at 46.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to .60 cent lower with February
at 51.85 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures ended moderately lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid expectations for an active harvesting weekend in the
Southeast and the Mississippi Delta region. Corn futures also fell
while wheat futures finished mixed.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 2\ cents higher with December at
$3.98{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents lower to \ cent higher with
December at $2.41} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower

<HEAD>Bond Prices Slump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices sagged Friday under the weight of a
heavy supply of recently auctioned issues and a falling dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 19-32 point, or $5.94
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
climbed to 7.93 percent from 7.88 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices slumped early in the session as the dollar fell in
foreign-exchange trading. The decline deepened in the afternoon,
attributed by analysts to recent borrowing by the Treasury and the
agency set up to help salvage insolvent thrifts.
   David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, said securities dealers who bought the $4.5 billion in
30-year bonds auctioned this week by the thrift bailout agency
Resolution Funding Corp. have been unable to find retail buyers for
the securities.
   ``A lot of that Resolution finance paper is still on dealer's
desks,'' he said.
   Hale said the bond market is also disappointed that the Federal
Reserve has not yet given signs that it is ready to begin to relax
credit conditions.
   ``The market wants a clearer vision of the economy and where the
Fed is going and neither are probably forthcoming in the near
term,'' he said.
   Analysts said a government report showing weak gains in consumer
spending and personal income was in line with expectations and had
little effect on the market.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues dropped 3-16 point, intermediate
maturities were down by between 7-32 point and ] point and
long-term issues fell as much as | point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.56 to 1,189.73.
   In corporate trading, industrials fell. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, lost
1.18 to 341.62.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds dropped 19-32 point to 91 27-32. The average
yield to maturity climbed to 7.40 percent from 7.34 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.03 percent as the
discount shot up 18 basis points to 7.78 percent. Yields on
six-month bills jumped to 8.03 percent as the discount rose 15
basis points to 7.63 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.87
percent with the discount up 8 basis points to 7.34 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 11-16 percent, down from }
percent late Thursday.

   Oil futures prices finished higher in moderate
trading Friday, buoyed by strength in the gasoline market.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery finished 0.99
cent higher at 54.62 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, while December gained 1.07 cents to close at 53.92 cents.
   The market got a lift early in the day from reports that a
Chevron Corp. refinery in El Segundo, Calif., had shut down a
catalytic cracking unit for repairs. The unit makes about 60,000
barrels a day of gasoline.
   The unit is expected to be closed for about three weeks, said
Chevron spokesman Jeff Krag.
   Crude oil prices, meanwhile, recovered from four straight days
of losses, mainly on technical factors. The December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,
advanced 39 cents to close at $19.77 a barrel. January crude rose
29 cents to $19.57.
   Domestic heating oil also reversed course from recent days to
finish on the plus side. No. 2 heating oil for November rose 0.44
cent to 57.68 cents a gallon, December increased 0.40 cent to 57.96
cents and other contracts registered slightly bigger gains.
   ``The biggest news was the Chevron refinery,'' said Brian
Tagler, energy broker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``There was
concern that it might disrupt the gasoline supply.''
   Analysts said crude prices continued to pull the market up even
after the Chevron news was absorbed. Traders said a technical rally
was expected after the market's recent weakness.

   LIN Broadcasting Corp. and BellSouth Corp. said
Friday they had agreed on a revised plan to merge their cellular
telephone interests in a deal that would create the nation's
largest cellular operation.
   The deal, which will be presented to LIN shareholders for a vote
in December or January, could prompt revision of a pending buyout
bid for LIN from McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the current
leader in the cellular field.
   A key element of the revised plan is a boost in the special cash
dividend LIN plans to pay its shareholders before the merger, to
$42 per share, or $2.26 billion, from a $20 per share under the
initial merger plan.
   LIN also said it had exercised its right of first refusal to buy
Metromedia Co.'s 46 percent interest in a cellular franchise
serving New York City for $1.9 billion. McCaw had bid for that
interest, but LIN as the holder of most of the rest of the
franchise had the right to match McCaw's offer.
   McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., is bidding for a controlling
interest in LIN and said it was extending its offer until midnight
Nov. 17. The offer had been set to expire at midnight Friday.
   ``We believe the revised BellSouth offer still raises more
questions than it answers,'' McCaw said in a statement. It urged
LIN's directors to conduct ``a fair auction on a level playing
field.''
   Analysts said they doubted the latest LIN-BellSouth plan was the
last word in what has become an increasingly complicated battle for
LIN.
   It is difficult to compare the value of the competing plans.
   Patrick Jurczak, telecommunications analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said he valued the LIN-BellSouth deal at $118 a share to $120
a share for LIN stockholders, compared with $113 a share under the
latest McCaw bid.
   Joel Gross, telecommunications analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin
Jenrette Securities Corp., valued the BellSouth offer at $117 to
$124 a share, compared with $110 to $112 a share under the McCaw
offer.
   ``It puts the ball back in McCaw's court,'' Gross said. ``We had
always said this would be a multi-part game.''
   In national over-the-counter trading, LIN rose $4.62{ a share to
$112.62{ while McCaw fell $2.50 a share to $37.75. BellSouth fell
87{ cents a share to $52.12{ in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The battle for LIN, a New York-based cellular concern which also
has seven television stations and a specialty publishing operation,
began in June when McCaw launched an unsolicited takeover bid.
   LIN rejected the offer but later agreed to merge its cellular
operations with those of BellSouth, the regional telephone company
from Atlanta that wants to extend its reach in the cellular
business.
   McCaw then revised its buyout bid, and offered $125 a share for
22 million of LIN's shares. Combined with the 5.1 million shares
McCaw already owns, the stake would give McCaw 50.3 percent of
LIN's 54 million shares.
   Both the McCaw and the BellSouth deals contain provisions under
which those companies could acquire the remainder of the stock in
the cellular company several years down the road.
   LIN chairman and president, Donald A. Pels, said Friday the
revised LIN-BellSouth proposal ``is clearly superior to McCaw's
coercive two-tiered offer.''
   The plan calls for LIN and Bell to merge their cellular
operations in a new company in which LIN shareholders and BellSouth
each would have a 50 percent stake. Executives said the deal could
be completed in the first quarter of 1990 after securing regulatory
approval.
   BellSouth made payment of the higher special cash dividend to
LIN shareholders possible by agreeing to contribute about $800
million less debt to the new cellular company than originally
envisioned.
   The LIN shareholders will also get stock in a new company that
is being created by the spinoff of LIN's seven television stations.
LIN officials valued that broadcasting company at between $12 and
$15 a share.
   Counting the additional interest in the New York cellular
franchise, the combination of LIN and BellSouth cellular operations
would have a potential audience of 54.9 million. That would
displace McCaw as the cellular leader; it has interests in cellular
companies with a potential audience of 50 million.
   BellSouth said it would pay up to $10 a share in five years to
LIN shareholders who continue to hold stock in the cellular company
if certain appraisals indicate they could done better under the
McCaw proposal.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Friday it had extended
until Nov. 6 its $576 million offer for the 33 percent stake in the
electronic financial information company Telerate Inc. that it does
not already own.
   Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and provides
an array of electronic business services of its own, had previously
said its $18-a-share offer for the Telerate stock would expire at
midnight Friday, Nov. 3.
   But Dow Jones said it was extending the offer until 5 p.m.
Eastern time Monday, Nov. 6, because it is mailing a supplement to
its offer to Telerate shareholders and wants to give them ``ample
time'' to review it.
   The statement said the supplement ``does not otherwise amend the
terms and conditions of the offer.''
   A committee of independent directors of Telerate rejected the
offer as inadequate earlier this month, and urged Dow Jones to meet
with them to achieve ``a mutually agreed upon transaction that
would be fair to all Telerate shareholders.''
   Dow Jones said its representatives met with members of the
special committee of Telerate on Thursday to discuss the offer, but
said those discussions did not result in any changes to the terms
of the offer.
   A Dow Jones spokesman declined to say how many shares had been
tendered so far under the $18-a-share offer.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Telerate fell
50 cents a share to $20.

   Insured property damage from the Oct. 17 San
Francisco Bay Area earthquake has been estimated at $960 million, a
New York-based insurance concern said Friday.
   The preliminary estimate by American Insurance Services Group
Inc. includes damage to homes and businesses covered by earthquake
insurance.
   It also includes damage for automobiles covered under
comprehensive policies, losses for business interruption and damage
from fire.
   The estimate does not include claims under workers'
compensation, life, health disability and liability insurance or
damage to bridges and highways, the company said.
   The estimate of total damage stands at $7.1 billion, according
to reports from state, city, county and federal officials. That
would make the Oct. 17 earthquake the most expensive natural
disaster in U.S. history, based on Independent Insurance Agents of
America records.
   American Insurance Services estimates that only about 30 percent
of homes and businesses in the earthquake area had quake coverage.
   AISG, a subsidiary of the American Insurance Association which
has 195 members, includes property and casualty insurance companies.

   Gerber Products Co. recalled 9,800 cases
of its rice cereal on Friday, saying three consumers reported
finding tiny metal pieces in the 8-ounce packages.
   ``While no injuries were reported and the particle sizes do not
constitute a health hazard, we decided a voluntary withdrawal was
in keeping with Gerber high quality standards,'' Ron Lovasz, vice
president of Gerber's quality control division, said in a news
statement.
   The contamination was isolated in a 9,800-case batch produced
Aug. 24 at the company's Fort Smith, Ark., plant, he said. The
affected packages were recommended for use by Aug. 24, 1991, and
marked with codes S1 through S8.
   The Food and Drug Administration was told of the recall, and
product removal from grocery shelves was under way, Lovasz said.
   Consumers who have the packages should return them to the stores
where they were purchased for a full refund, the company said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Finland's
version of the Silicon Valley on Friday and told his hosts he wants
to build similar high-tech research facilities in the Soviet Union.
   ``We have done good work here,'' Gorbachev said before boarding
his plane at the end of a three-day state visit, during which he
announced a plan to decommission four older model submarines of the
Soviet nuclear-armed fleet in the Baltic Sea.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed the gesture as
insignificant.
   Speaking in Bonn, West Germany, Cheney said the Soviet nuclear
capability in the Baltic ``frankly wasn't all that great.'' Experts
have described the four Golf II-class Soviet subs as dated and
virtually useless.
   The proposal also received a lukewarm reaction from neighboring
Sweden, which supports a ban on nuclear weapons in Northern Europe.
   Gorbachev's proposal was interesting but ``should be studied
closely before drawing conclusions,'' said Sten Andersson, foreign
minister of the neutral nation.
   Swedish opposition leader Carl Bildt said the Golf II-class
vessels were ``the oldest, rustiest and most scraggly subs in the
world.''
   Gorbachev departed for home Friday after a four-hour tour of
Oulu, a remote Baltic Sea city of 100,000 people about 400 miles
north of Helsinki.
   Thousands of Finns lined the streets to cheer and applaud the
Soviet president, who visibly reveled in the attention.
   ``What a lot of people!'' Raisa Gorbachev said of the crowd,
which was larger than any that greeted the couple in Helsinki
during the first two days of the visit.
   Gorbachev waved, shook hands with residents and clasped his
hands above his head in victory.
   The Kremlin leader, who has admitted his strategy to restructure
the economy is in trouble, visited a technological village where 80
science-based companies work on the latest advances in computer
hardware, laser equipment and telecommunications.
   Gorbachev viewed an exhibit by about 30 companies, displaying
curiosity and knowledge in the application of some of the wares,
said Pertti Huuskonen, the director of the village.
   Huuskonen described the village to Gorbachev as Finland's
version of Silicon Valley, a center of high-technology activities
in California. He quoted the Soviet leader as saying he wanted the
Finns to help set up similar projects in his country.
   Gorbachev was presented with an electronic pulse monitor used by
athletes and even racehorses that was invented at the technology
village, associated with the 8,500-student Oulu University. ``Many
joggers in Finland don't go out without it,'' Huuskonen said.
   Soviet businessmen operating in Finland have said they have
access to technology that is denied them in the Soviet Union by
Western export limitations.
   In Bonn, Cheney said he supports retention of the limits on
technology transfers because he said the Soviet arms capability
remains a danger to the West.

<HEAD>Turner Broadcasting Completes Refinancing, Expects Loss</HEAD>

   A $1.6 billion refinancing by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. puts the entertainment company in a position to react
quickly to changes in the coming decade, Chairman Ted Turner said
Thursday.
   TBS said Thursday it had completed the refinancing, which
included repayment or redemption of substantially all of its
outstanding long-term debt. The refinancing will result in a
fourth-quarter loss of about $122 million, it said.
   The move ``puts our long-term financing on a much more
reasonable basis than before and provides us the flexibility we
need to deal with the fast-changing television marketplace in the
1990s,'' Turner said.
   The Atlanta-based company said the refinancing was funded by
about $900 million borrowed through a bank credit facility, the
sale of $550 million in debentures due in 2001 and the sale of $200
million in notes due in 2004.
   In addition, the company called for redemption on Dec. 15 of
$200 million in notes due 1994.
   TBS owns TBS SuperStation, Turner Network Television, Cable News
Network, Headline News, the Atlanta Braves and most of the Atlanta
Hawks. TBS also owns a film library that includes MGM's pre-1986
films, Warner Brothers' pre-1950 films and a number of RKO films.

<TEXT>
   Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western Railway Co. announced
Thursday that a New York investment bank has agreed to purchase the
railway's lines from Springfield and East St. Louis, Ill., to
Kansas City, Mo.
   The letter of intent calls for the sale to Wertheim Schroder &amp;
Co. for $24 million cash, Trustee Daniel R. Murray said, calling
the agreement ``an exciting milestone for CMW and its employees.''
   Rio Grande Industries Inc., the parent of the Southern Pacific
Transportation Co., agreed in August to purchase the remaining part
of the 630-mile railroad, from Joliet, Ill. to East St. Louis, for
$22 million.
   Murray said a competing bid from investor Karl Ziebarth would be
made Friday for $26 million, but that he supported the Wertheim bid.
   ``The consummation of these sales will ensure the future
viability of all of CM&amp;W's service for Amtrak, for our shippers as
well as for the citizens of both Illinois and Missouri,'' Murray
said.
   Creditors, primarily Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller
Financial Inc., are owed more than $100 million. They have opposed
any sale of the railroad and have fought in court for its immediate
liquidation.
   The Wertheim bid will be submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court
Chief Judge John D. Schwartz on Tuesday, and the creditors will be
asked then whether they oppose the sale, Murray said.

<HEAD>McDonnell-Douglas Profit Drops 54 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp., the nation's largest
defense contractor, reported Thursday a 54 percent decrease in its
third-quarter profit, reflecting continued problems in both its
commercial and govenment segments.
   The company earned $38 million, or 98 cents a share, compared
with $83 million, or $2.18 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
Revenue was $3.7 billion, up from $3.68 billion in the year-ago
period.
   The current quarter's figures include $6 million, or 14 cents a
share, in earnings from discontinued operations in the information
systems area.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company had a profit
of $159 million, thanks to a $179 million one-time gain as a result
of an accounting change. Without that gain, the company would have
had a $26 million loss for the period.
   Sales for the first nine months totaled $10.32 billion, almost
the same as the figure for last year's first nine months, $10.33
billion.
   The principal factors cited for the lower earnings in the
quarter were a jump in interest expense to $95 million from $57
million a year earlier, an operating loss in the commercial
aircraft segment and decreased earnings from the combat aircraft,
missiles, space and electronic systems segments.
   The commercial aircraft segment lost $3 million on revenues of
$1.3 billion in the quarter, compared with earnings of $15 million
on revenues of $1.3 billion last year.
   The company attributed the loss to parts shortages and problems
arising from the need to assimilate and train a large number of new
workers. A major reorganization was also a factor, McDonnell
Douglas said.
   ``They've gone through a major restructuring in Douglas Aircraft
and they're doing the same now in helicopters,'' said Phil
Friedman, an analyst with Drexal Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said the
third quarter figures troubled him.
   ``They're a lot better than the first two quarters,'' Nisbet
said, ``but still not near the level that one would consider
normal. I suspect that a lot of it is continued problems with
research and development.''
