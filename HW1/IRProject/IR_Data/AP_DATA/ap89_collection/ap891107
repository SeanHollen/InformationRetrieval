<HEAD>Three Salvadoran Leftists Tortured, Slain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tortured, shot bodies of
three members of a leftist party were found Tuesday in western El
Salvador, a party spokesman said. He accused the military and
demanded that those responsible be handed over for prosecution.
   Spokesman Julio Flores of the Social Christian Popular Movement
said that because of recent attacks, ``our leaders have ordered all
party installations closed. ... The authorities are threatening us,
they do not let us operate.''
   Flores told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that
Cecilio Rivera, the movement's coordinator in western Sonsonate
province, was kidnapped on Monday with two other party members.
   He said their bodies, showing signs of torture and
bullet-riddled, were found on the outskirts of Sonsonate city, the
provincial capital 40 miles west of San Salvador, on Tuesday evening.
   Local judicial authorities ordered the three bodies buried as
unidentified cadavers, but party members were able to identify them,
Flores said.
   He said Rivera's age and the names and ages of the other two were
not available immediately.
   ``Our comrades were seized by military officials dressed in
civilian clothes after a meeting at the party hall (in Sonsonate),''
Flores said, adding that they were killed ``in death-squad style''
and a hand-printed sign was found next to the bodies saying they had
``betrayed the fatherland.''
   ``We hold those military officials dressed in civilian clothes
responsible and we ask that the Sonsonate commander turn them over
to judicial authorities,'' Flores said.
   The commander is Col. Juan Armando Rodriguez.
   Juan Jose Martel, a member of the party's national executive,
told reporters: ``We do not have the least doubt the three were
seized by soldiers dressed in civilian clothes.''
   According to human rights organizations, most of the more than
70,000 people killed in a 10-year-old leftist guerrilla war have
been civilians slain by rightist death squads that were especially
active from 1979 to 1984.
   Death-squad activity sharply diminished in mid-1984 with the
election of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist Christian
Democrat. Repression of leftists started again when rightist
President Alfredo Cristiani succeeded Duarte on June 1 for a
five-year term.
   Leftists have often accused Cristiani's Republican Nationalist
Alliance of being linked to the death squads, made up of off-duty
military and security agents.
   A bomb wrecked the headquarters of the Salvadoran National
Workers' Federation on Oct. 31, killing 10 people and wounding 29.
Earlier that day, another bomb injured four people at Comadres, an
organization of relatives of political prisoners and people who have
disappeared in the civil war.
   Two of those injured in the blasts were Americans.
   Leaders of those two leftist groups accused the military of
mounting the bombings in retaliation for an Oct. 30 mortar attack by
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on the Defense
Ministry compound that killed one civilian and wounded 15.
   The Social Christian Popular Movement was created in 1980 by
dissidents who broke away from Duarte's Christian Democratic Party.
The San Salvador home of party leader Ruben Zamora was bombed Oct.
19, but no one was hurt.
   Zamora is a member of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a
political coalition allied to the Farabundo Marti guerrillas. He
long lived in exile but returned to El Salvador two years ago when
the Duarte government promised an end to repression.
   Flores said that now the union halls, offices and other
installations were being closed because the party does not want to
see more members killed.
   To protest the attacks, Farabundo Marti canceled its
participation in a third meeting with Cristiani government
representatives Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela, to negotiate a
cease-fire.
   Earlier meetings in Mexico and San Jose, Costa Rica, ended in
deadlock but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting at 30-day
intervals until they could agree on some kind of a truce.

<HEAD>A Clubhouse Politician Reaches The Heights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Dinkins is no political meteor, streaking
suddenly across the civic firmament to seek office as the first
black mayor of the nation's most populous city.
   He is a deliberate, courtly man who entered politics more than 30
years ago, working his way up the ladder one rung at a time _
clubhouse worker, assemblyman, district leader, city clerk, borough
president.
   When he defeated three-term incumbent Edward I. Koch in
September's Democratic primary, the top of the ladder was within
reach. On Tuesday, he defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani to become
the 106th mayor of New York.
   ``What I do is provide hope,'' Dinkins, 62, said some months ago
_ hope to other blacks who want to climb up the city's power
structure.
   He is a soft-spoken, cordial man whose diction is perfect; a man
who wears well-tailored suits, made in New York's Chinatown; an avid
tennis player who is said to have a very strong forehand.
   Born in Trenton, N.J., the son of a barber, Dinkins earned a
bachelor's degree in math at Howard University after a tour in the
Marines. He went on to Brooklyn Law School, graduating in 1956; he
had already married Joyce Burrows, daughter of a Harlem assemblyman.
   Dinkins joined a law firm, but also joined the Carver Democratic
Club, the Harlem base of powerbroker J. Raymond Jones.
   Jones, who later became Manhattan's Democratic chairman, was
mentor to a generation of black politicians, preaching a moderate
course and encouraging compromise with the white establishment.
   In 1965, Dinkins was elected to the state Assembly. His seat was
eliminated by reapportionment a year later, but in 1967 Dinkins was
elected a district leader from the Carver Club, a job he would
retain for 20 years.
   In 1975, he was appointed city clerk. He ran three times for
Manhattan borough president before winning the office in 1985.
   Though none of these jobs is all-powerful, Dinkins used each post
as a platform to speak out against discrimination and to support
organized labor. He seldom took the spotlight, and he rarely made
enemies.
   His one misstep was soon forgiven, though it came back to haunt
him when he ran for mayor. In 1973, Dinkins was named deputy mayor
for planning, but when a background check disclosed that he had
failed to file income taxes for four years he was forced to give up
the post.
   He paid $15,000 in back taxes and ascribed his actions to
negligence.
   The omission was especially surprising given Dinkins' legendary
cautious nature. Before he announced his candidacy in February _
promising ``a different direction, new ideas and a fresh
perspective'' _ he formed a committee to examine whether he should
run.
   He ran as an unabashed liberal, but his was not a campaign
brimming with position papers and brash promises. Instead, he
focused on the need for reconciliation of the city's diverse
population. He handily defeated Koch in the primary, 51 percent to
42 percent.
   In the general election, Dinkins' taxes were an issue, as were
his transfer of stock in a cable company to his son and his
acceptance of a friend's gift of a free vacation to France.
   So too was his friendship with Jesse Jackson, who is distrusted
by many in the Jewish community. Dinkins would not renounce Jackson,
but said the former presidential candidate was not an advisor; he
reminded Jewish groups that he had condemned the anti-Semitism of
Muslim Minister Louis Farrakhan.
   Dinkins and his wife have lived in the same three-bedroom
apartment in upper Manhattan for 26 years. They have two grown
children and one grandchild.

22 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MAAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young men wrestled a camel to the ground,
slit its throat and butchered it for a banquet thrown by parliament
candidate Suleiman Arar in this desert town where bloody price
riots broke out six months ago.
   Such rituals of rural campaigning in this sleepy town of 25,000
are partly the result of the violence that prompted King Hussein to
call the first nationwide elections in 22 years.
   There were few visible reminders of April's riots, just the
occasional scar on the street where tires were set alight during
unrest that left 10 people dead nationwide.
   The talk in Maan, 120 miles south of Amman, was about
Wednesday's elections and little else as local men met to chat with
their friends in diwans, gatherings often held beneath goat's hair
tents.
   Old men wearing red-and-white headdresses and younger ones in
Western-style suits sat under one tent on a dusty lot beside Arar's
house sipping tea and smoking Arabic water pipes.
   Among them was a local notable, Sheik Turki Sabah Krayshan, who
called the elections for the 80-seat parliament ``a new page in our
history, a new lease of life for our country.''
   He said Arar, a former interior minister who most people in Maan
call Abu Mohammed, ``will listen to the people, and he will present
their requests to the parliament.''
   The new parliament must approve all laws and budgets and it can
even override the king's veto. It can also toss out the royally
appointed Cabinet, a right spirited lawmakers exercised several
times in the past.
   But Hussein remains the center of power, and he has the power to
dissolve parliament and rule without it, as he has done for most of
the past 15 years.
   A young man who helped slice the camel into chunks for the
banquet said ``it's a special treat, and we'll be killing a lot
more camels after Abu Mohammed wins the election.''
   Twenty-eight candidates are competing for five seats in the
sprawling Maan governorate. Another 13 are vying for two rural
seats reserved for southern Bedouin tribes.
   The April violence in Maan was sparked by taxi drivers angry at
a 25 percent increase in gasoline prices. But most of the rioters
were young men frustrated by rising prices and a lack of jobs.
   At one diwan, a young man told a visiting reporter that ``the
government must do something about unemployment and about public
services here, which are not as good as in Amman.''
   But older tribesmen quickly urged him to quiet down.
   Turki denied that there was a gap between older leaders known as
``the sheiks'' and a younger generation of often better-educated
Jordanians trying to break away from tribal influence.
   ``There are differences between the old people and the young,''
he acknowledged. ``But they're very slight. All the youth are with
the sheiks.''
   But columnist Mariam Shahin wrote in the Jordan Times daily that
the influence of the sheiks appears to be eroding in some districts.
   She quoted one younger candidate as saying: ``Tribal leaders
have had their chance. Look where it got them.
   ``Our rural areas have been neglected as far as educational,
economic, social and cultural development projects are concerned.
So why should they be given another chance?''
   In Maan, local journalist Mustafa Khoshman said tribal
allegiances would be more potent in the elections than any
political stands by the candidates.
   The Maan region has the largest area but the smallest population
of Jordan's governorates. Its 150,000 people are overwhelmingly of
Bedouin stock and form the bedrock of Hussein's support.
   The railroad that runs through Maan along the Islamic pilgrimage
route to Mecca was repeatedly attacked by T.E. Lawrence _ Lawrence
of Arabia _ during his campaign against the Turks alongside
Hussein's ancestors during World War I.
   The southern Bedouins of the Howeitat tribe were famous for
their bravery in the battles that helped put Hussein's grandfather,
King Abdullah, on the throne.
   ``His majesty the king is very popular here,'' said Turki, who
said Hussein was welcomed like a hero when he visited Maan after
the riots.
   ``He can come here any time. There will be no problems,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Dominican Republic General Arrested in Bribery Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general from the Dominican Republic was jailed
Monday for allegedly accepting bribes to release a drug plane
impounded in his homeland.
   Gen. Joaquin Pou, 54, who U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said had
identified himself at different times as either an active or
retired general, was ordered held without bond during an appearance
Monday before a U.S. magistrate.
   He was taken into custody when he arrived at a Miami airport,
said Lehtinen.
   ``All I can tell you he was arrested Sunday,'' Lehtinen said.
``He came to Miami in furtherance of the conspiracy.''
   Pou, who had close contacts with other Dominican generals and
aviation officials, allegedly received about $20,000 to release a
confiscated plane, according to federal authorities.
   Also arrested for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
was Jose F. Guasch, 43, a Miami-based aide to the general, who was
granted a $250,000 bond Monday. A third defendant, pilot Robert
Neil Gurin, was expected to turn himself in Tuesday, the U.S.
attorney's office said.
   Lehtinen, saying the investigation was continuing, refused to
reveal many details of the case, but authorities released an
affidavit by U.S. Customs Agent Gary Lang.
   Lang said in the affidavit that in February Customs and the FBI
began investigating ``allegations of the bribery of high-ranking
military officials of the Dominican Republic by Robert Gurin ... to
assure the release of aircraft seized by the Dominican Republic for
narcotics smuggling.''
   Gurin was also involved with officials in Jamaica, Haiti, and
the Bahamas, the affidavit said.
   Informants told Lang that Gurin, who owns AEA Aircraft Recovery,
was aided by Thomas Martin, manager of the international field
office of the Federal Aviation Administration in Miami, the
affidavit said.
   At one point, Martin was taped by agents as saying ``my darkest
dream is being picked up and put in a ... jail right here in
Miami.''
   Martin was not indicted, and FAA spokesman Roger Myers said the
agency had only just learned of the case. Lehtinen would say only
that the investigation was continuing.
   Through informants and taped phone calls, Customs learned that
Gurin was trying to recover a Rockwell Aerocommander 690 B seized
in the Dominican Republic.
   Gurin at one point said he paid $50,000 to get another plane
released in that country.
   On the tapes, Gurin also said a Miami attorney, Alfredo Duran,
was channeling the money to generals in the Dominican military
through an escrow account. Duran has not been charged in the case,
and Lehtinen refused to discuss him further.

   Actor Anthony Quinn withdrew from a
production of ``A Walk in the Woods'' after experiencing chest
pains, organizers said.
   ``It became clear he could not handle the show,'' said
co-producer Barry Weisler. ``He ... won't be permitted to travel
until he is out of pain and the doctor gives his approval.''
   Quinn's withdrawal Saturday forced cancellation of previews
scheduled for Sunday, today and Wednesday at Syracuse Stage.
   Stage officials said Monday the 74-year-old actor was under the
care of his personal physician in New York City. They said there
was no diagnosis.
   Director Arthur Storch said Quinn was in pain early last week.
   ``We were rehearsing the scene in which the Soviet diplomat has
an angina attack and Tony said, `I know what that is. I have it.'
And we talked about it,'' Storch said.
   Quinn was to portray the diplomat in the play, which is about
the friendship struck between Soviet and U.S. arms negotiators.
   Opening night is still set for Friday, but Quinn has been
replaced by Ben Hammer. The show also stars Nicholas Hormann.
   A planned tour may be scuttled, Storch said.

   The Duchess of York ended a five-day visit to
Texas with a visit to an inner-city school, where she took part in
a day filled with anti-drug messages.
   The 30-year-old former Sarah Ferguson also was serenaded by more
than 600 pupils at Blackshear Elementary School.
   The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to
Houston on Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera,
which is saluting 300 years of British opera.
   At the school, she participated in an anti-drug play and handed
over autographed copies of her two children books about a
helicopter named ``Budgie.'' The students gave her a book they had
written and made her feel like royalty with a playground
performance.
   ``Your Royal Highness, the Duchess of York, from the boys and
girls of Blackshear School, may I present to you these flowers and
ask for your permission to sing?'' shouted 8-year-old Jermaine
Thibodeaux, who gave the duchess a bouquet of yellow roses.
   The duchess gave her the go-ahead, and the students sang ``Deep
in the Heart of Texas,'' ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' ``We are the
World,'' and an anti-drug song.
   Later Monday, she left on a flight to New York, where she was to
meet with her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster.

   The University of Alaska Southeast has set
its sights high for a speaker at next spring's commencement: Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``My feeling is there can be no way to find out unless you do
ask,'' said Professor Wallace Olson, who suggested the invitation.
   Chancellor Marshall Lind said Monday he discussed the invitation
with Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States,
during Dubinin's recent Juneau visit.
   Lind said he was told the invitation is being considered in
Moscow.
   A response is not expected until December. The commencement is
scheduled May 4 in Juneau.
   ``We feel that he would be a very appropriate speaker for us in
view of all the things that are taking place between Alaska and the
Soviet Union,'' Lind said.
   Olson said his idea was inspired by Gorbachev's role in
permitting visa-free travel between the Soviet Union and Alaska for
the region's natives.
   If Gorbachev is unable to speak in person, the university is
hoping for the next best thing _ a speech broadcast by satellite or
videotape.

   Engelbert Humperdinck will appeal a judge's
dismissal of his $50 million lawsuit against The National Enquirer
for its report that the mother of the singer's daughter fears he
had the AIDS virus.
   Robert Rotstein, an attorney for the singer, said Monday the
U.S. District Court lawsuit was dismissed last week but Humperdinck
would appeal.
   Humperdinck has tested negative for the virus, Rotstein said.
   The Enquirer stood behind the article, which it said was based
on a court filing and was thereby not libelous.
   ``We feel vindicated by the judge's verdict,'' said Mike Walker,
an editor with the Florida-based tabloid.
   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Court
demanding that Humperdinck, 53, provide for the financial future of
her 12-year-old daughter, ruled by a court to be his daughter.
   Humperdinck's lawsuit said the woman's claims about the
entertainer were false and have been dismissed by the New York
court. Rotstein said the Los Angeles court's decision was based on
an overly broad reading of libel law.

   James Bellows, the former managing editor of
``USA Today on TV,'' has settled his $1.8 million lawsuit against
the company that makes the syndicated series. He called the
agreement ``an amicable settlement.''
   Bellows' attorney, Michael Zweig, and M.S. ``Bud'' Rukeyser, a
spokesman for the producers GTG East, said terms of the settlement
could not be revealed. The company is the New York branch of GTG
Entertainment, which is based in Culver City, Calif., and is a
co-venture of former NBC chairman Grant Tinker and the Gannett Co.
   Bellows filed his lawsuit in U.S. District Court here on Oct. 2.
He was the second of four senior executives that have run GTG's
show since it premiered in September 1988 as ``USA Today: The
Television Show.''
   Bellows was hired under a two-year contract paying him $275,000
a year. He took over the series in October 1988 and left in March
to help develop a new program for GTG. His lawsuit alleged he was
fired without cause or warning.
   Bellows, 66, is a former newspaperman who also has worked at ABC

``Entertainment Tonight'' series. He said in an interview he hasn't
decided what he'll do next.
   However, he said Monday, he plans to move back to Los Angeles

   Former USS Iowa sailor Kendall Truitt will share a
$100,000 insurance claim with the family of a crewmate whom the
Navy concluded probably caused a deadly gun turret explosion, his
attorney said Monday.
   Gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig had named Truitt as beneficiary
for the life insurance policy taken out about a year ago. The
connection initially focused Navy investigators' attention on
Truitt after the April 19 disaster that killed 47 sailors,
including Hartwig.
   Truitt was later cleared, but the Navy insists that Hartwig was
the most likely cause of the explosion, possibly as part of a
suicide.
   Settlement of the insurance policy was initially held up by Amex
Life Assurance Co., of San Rafael, Calif., because of a dispute
between Truitt and Hartwig's family. The money was paid Sept. 13 to
U.S. District Court in Miami after Truitt filed a lawsuit, said
Melinda McMullen, the insurer's spokeswoman.
   The dispute ended with Monday's agreement, releasing the
$100,000, said Truitt's attorney Ellis Rubin. Rubin refused to give
details of the agreement.
   ``Some of the money will be paid to the Hartwig family in
recognition of the loss of their son, and we are allocating an
amount to the building of a memorial or monument to all 47 sailors
who died,'' Rubin said.
   ``It's a very minimal sum, but we are not allowed to disclose
how much,'' said Kathleen Kubicina, Hartwig's sister and
spokeswoman for the family. She said her father was ``really
upset.''
   She said that Truitt had told her parents they would get most of
the money because it was such a large amount, ``but now he seems to
have forgotten'' what he said.
   Hartwig's family and Truitt have challenged the Navy's
conclusions.
   Kubicina said the insurance company ``did an investigation of
their own and came to the conclusion there was no suicide or murder
involved.''
   ``If the insurance company thought he had committed suicide,
they would not pay off the policy,'' said Rubin. ``It's another
indication that the Navy theory of suicide by Hartwig will not hold
water.''
   Truitt, now stationed at Mayport Naval Station near
Jacksonville, is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a
congressional committee investigating the explosion, Rubin said,
and would have no comment before then.
   The insurance policy named Truitt as the beneficiary of
Hartwig's $50,000 life insurance coverage, which had a
double-indemnity clause for accidental death. Truitt filed a
lawsuit Aug. 14 seeking payment from Amex.
   Hartwig died in the explosion, while, Truitt, on a lower floor
of the gun turret, survived unhurt.
   The Navy's official report by Rear Adm. Richard Milligan cleared
Truitt, and cited Hartwig as the most likely person to have caused
the explosion, saying he apparently placed some type of detonator
between powder bags while loading a 16-inch gun.
   Leaks from the Navy investigation suggested that Truitt and
Hartwig had a homosexual relationship that had gone sour. Truitt,
who is married, strongly denied any sexual relationship with
Hartwig, and the Navy concluded there was no evidence Hartwig was a
homosexual.

   A man shot his mother and wife to
death Monday, wounded his sister and a niece, then killed himself,
a state police spokesman said.
   The rampage occurred at the home of Polly Mae Frederick, mother
of Tony Frederick, in the southwest Georgia city, said Georgia
Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead.
   Frederick, 28, of Sumter County and his 20-year-old wife,
Gwendolyn, had gone to the house to do laundry Monday afternoon,
Bankhead said.
   An argument occurred around 1:30 p.m., and Frederick shot the
two women in the head, killing both, the spokesman said.
   Frederick's 33-year-old sister, Jackie, ran outside to lead
their brother, LeRoy, who is blind, to safety. But Frederick
followed them outside and shot his sister in the head.
   LeRoy Frederick ran to Georgia 271, and got the attention of a
truck driver, who called police. Sumter County sheriff's deputies,
the GBI and state police rushed to the scene.
   Police tried to talk Frederick out, but eventually fired a
tear-gas canister into the house. Officers found him dead and a
niece, Tammy Watts, hiding under a bed with a gunshot wound in her
side, Bankhead said.
   Officers found Ms. Watts' two daughters, aged 4 and 2, locked
inside a car parked near the house, where they apparently fled when
the shooting began, the spokesman said.
   Jackie Frederick underwent surgery at Columbus Medical Center,
and was in critical condition Monday night.
   Ms. Watts was in stable condition at Sumter Regional Hospital in
Americus.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Sumter County Sheriff Randy Howard. ``He
wiped his family out. I just don't understand. We may never know
why it happened.''

<TEXT>
   Six Western states and the province of British
Columbia on Monday issued a proclamation urging their federal
governments to take action to reduce drift net fishing in the North
Pacific.
   The proclamation was announced at a news conference preceding
the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission meeting this
week in Seattle.
   The proclamation seeks reductions in Japanese high-seas salmon
fisheries to reduce the impact of squid fleets on salmon, albacore
tuna, seabirds and marine mammals.
   The proclamation also wants Canada, the United States, the
Soviet Union and Japan to establish a new convention in the ocean
region aimed at protecting salmon in international waters.
   It would also form a research organization among the nations.
   The states are Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California and
Hawaii.
   Drift nets are small, monofilament nets that are draggd through
the water and catch everything they come in contact with. About 800
fishing vessels from Japan, Korea and Taiwan use the nets in the
Pacific Ocean. On any given day, the drift net fleet can cover
30,000 miles of ocean.
   The Alaska Department of Fisheries estimates that the annual
damage to fisheries on the high seas by drift net boats at about
$100 million _ including the effects on salmon, albacore tuna and
other Pacific fisheries.
   Also Monday, the United States joined South Pacific nations at
the United Nations in denouncing driftnet fishing as ``potentially
devastating technology'' that massacres marine mammals, sea birds
and unwanted fish.
   A U.S. delegate, Ambassador Jonathan Moore, told the General
Assembly's Second Committee, which deals with the environment and
other social affairs, that the United States is joining the Pacific
and other nations in a resolution banning the huge drift nets.
   Under the General Assembly resolution, drift-net fishing would
be abolished immediately in the South Pacific, and phased out
worldwide by June 30, 1992.
   Moore said the United States had no objection to developing
nations using small drift nets that allow fish multiply and renew
the stocks, but was opposed to the vast ``pelagic'' driftnets.
   The resolution is cosponsored by New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
Fiji, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu,
Zaire, Colombia and Sweden.
   It does not single out any nation for criticism, but expresses
concern of the indiscriminate nature of driftnet fishing and sets
out proposals for international management and the eventual ban of
driftnet use.

   Braniff Inc. announced Monday it was
ceasing all passenger service immediately because a severe cash
shortage doomed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   William G. McGee, the company's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the action was taken to preserve assets
while Braniff continues to develop alternatives, which might
include selling the airline.
   ``We didn't come up with any other alternative financing and
options like that. There just wasn't any more cash,'' said Sandy
Smith, a Braniff spokeswoman in Orlando, where the board of
directors met Monday.
   Braniff halted all passenger service at midnight Monday, but
will continue and expand its charter airline service while Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets explores strategic alternatives, McGee said
in a short statement released just before midnight.
   The last flights were arriving around midnight, and the planes
would remain at their destinations indefinitely, Smith said.
   McGee said employees at the Orlando-based Braniff will be
notified individually about their status.
   Persons holding Braniff tickets should check with other
airlines, which may honor Braniff tickets in some cases, the
statement said.
   People holding tickets bought with a credit card were told to
consult with the card company, and those who purchased tickets with
cash or a check after Sept. 28 were advised to call a toll-free
number for a refund.
   Braniff, which operated 46 of its 256 pre-bankruptcy flights
Friday, was the first major carrier to file for bankruptcy
following airline deregulation in the early 1980s.
   It emerged as a smaller carrier in 1984, but claimed weekly
losses of about $1.5 million before filing for Chapter 11
bankruptcy again on Sept. 28. It lost $31.8 million on revenue of
$293 million in the first six months of the year.
   On Friday, Braniff laid off about 100 mostly administrative
employees. It was scheduled to submit salary plans for its top
executives in bankruptcy court Nov. 17.
   Last week, Scott Hamilton, editor of the Dallas-based Commercial
Aviation Report, said Braniff needed $50 million to $100 million to
operate on a long-term basis and could run out of cash sometime
this month.
   ``I think executive salaries will all be a moot point very
shortly,'' he said. ``Frankly, I'm surprised Braniff is still
flying.''

   A costly Customs Service radar plane
envisioned as a key weapon in the war against drugs is plagued by
electronics problems and can't reliably guide interceptors to
drug-smuggling aircraft, agency documents say.
   ``Next month marks one year that we have been flying'' the first
P-3 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft, a Customs memo said on
May 4, adding computer errors ``still make air intercept control a
difficult task.''
   In September, the plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co., said it would commit additional resources to
``upgrade'' the plane's computerized tracker. The equipment
automatically plots the course and speed of other planes, and its
inaccurate readings have been largely responsible for difficulties
in intercepting planes suspected of smuggling drugs, according to
the documents.
   ``You can't use the system for interception, and that's what all
this magic is about,'' said a Customs source, adding that the P-3's
computerized altitude, course and speed readings are so inaccurate
that radar specialists worry they could direct their interceptors
into a collision with a drug plane. The source spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   John McGinnis, director of Lockheed's airborne early warning
program, said in an interview the firm is making improvements in
the tracker because of ``anomalous behavior that we could not
prevent. The plane is functioning but there are problems with it
and we are correcting it.
   ``The airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their
job,'' he said, adding the firm hopes to have the difficulties
fixed by ``the first of the year.''
   Other difficulties mentioned in the documents relate to the
computer system that locates targets, faulty on-board
communications for the crew, and problems with a spinning metal
radar dome atop the plane.
   Difficulties aside, sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said reports critical of the plane's performance were ordered
rewritten by an agency supervisor after one early test.
   The P-3 AEW's are designed to play a major role in drug
interdiction from their Customs Service base in Corpus Christi,
Texas. The government's multi-agency El Paso Intelligence Center
reports 51 percent of the 112,000 kilograms of cocaine seized
during 1988 arrived by air _ 45 percent in private planes.
   Despite the shortcomings detailed in the documents, Peter
Kendig, acting director of Customs' Corpus Christi surveillance
center, called the aircraft ``a cost-effective piece of equipment,
giving taxpayers one of best bangs for the buck in government
today. It works and it works great.''
   He said the system for tracking smugglers has a ``few glitches''
that can be solved.
   The first P-3 AEW aircraft has experienced both electronic and
mechanical difficulties since the $27 million plane arrived at the
Customs Surveillance Support Center in Corpus Christi in June 1988,
according to the documents.
   The documents show some of the problems afflicted a second P-3
that arrived in April at a cost of $30.6 million. Congress already
has approved $35 million for a third P-3.
   The P-3 Orion has been used for years as a Navy anti-submarine
detection plane, but the Customs Service plane contains specially
designed electronics for the drug war.
   Identification of the authors of most of the documents was
obscured by sources who made the material available to The
Associated Press. The majority of documents were written by P-3
crew members, the AP was told.
   The difficulties diminish one of the most important features of
the four-engine turboprops: the ability to use the multi-colored
computer displays, with their impressive interchangeable graphics,
to direct Customs Service planes intercepting and pursuing the
flying smugglers.
   Kendig said the two P-3 AEW's were mainly responsible for
detections leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10 this year.
Seizures included 37,000 pounds of marijuana, 8,300 pounds of
cocaine, 17 vessels and vehicles and three aircraft, he said.
   John Berezonsky, project manager for the AEW program at
Lockheed, said in an interview the plane's problems ``haven't
prevented the aircraft from doing a hell of a job'' and result from
``trying to put so much information on display to the operator so
quickly. We can track a greater number of targets simultaneously
than anyone operating an AEW aircraft now. That's the key.''
   Yet the documents, and interviews with those knowledgeable with
the program, said the mission has been hampered in a number of ways:
   _Planes that were possibly 300 miles away appeared as nearby
targets. Single targets were displayed as multiple images. Targets
were lost when the P-3's on-board computer system ``crashed.''
Ships appeared at altitudes of 15,000 feet.
   _The spinning radar dome atop the plane, similar to that on an
Air Force AWACS, stopped working when the plane's speed reached 270
knots.
   _Agency officials accepted the first plane without the test
flights designed by experts to create what a memo called ``real
world'' conditions. The test plan, included in the documents, would
have evaluated the radar equipment over every possible terrain,
trying to see how well it detected other Customs aircraft playing
the role of drug-smuggler planes. The evaluation was flown months
after Customs accepted the aircraft.
   _The P-3's experienced numerous communications problems. Radar
specialists in the back of the plane were unable to monitor pilots'
transmissions, a handicap that would _ according to a memo _
``hinder safety of flight, and impede crew coordination.'' A memo
warned of the potential for a ``NORAD (no radio) situation,'' a
total communications failure.
   _Two crewmen at Corpus Christi were ordered to water down their
highly critical reports of the first P-3's performance during a
then-top secret mission in late July-early August 1988 to detect
drug planes leaving Colombia. One of the initial reports of the
plane's first operational test said, ``The (tracking) program is so
inaccurate'' the radar specialists ``had to develop alternate
procedures to detect and track targets.''
   The aircraft tracker problem was an important part of the
evaluation of Operation Barrier, the mission to detect Colombian
drug planes completed in early August 1988. There are at least four
reports: two highly critical, and more favorable versions of the
originals. A Customs Service source speaking on condition of
anonymity said both original versions were ordered rewritten by a
supervisor in Corpus Christi.
   One of the originals, dated Aug. 2, 1988, said the computer
``crashed'' at ``irregular intervals'' and communications
improvements were needed ``so the next three aircraft will not be
`communications cripples.''' It added that ``deficiencies in the
tracking program'' required use of antiquated ``raw radar'' to
``verify the validity'' of the computer displays and to ``provide
accurate intercept data.''
   After the rewrite was ordered, the same author wrote on Aug. 17,
1988, the operation was ``a complete success'' in which ``systems
reliability was superb.'' He concluded, ``the potential of this
asset is unlimited.''

   A federal appeals court has upheld
government rulings that the Sacramento Union acted improperly in
cutting salaries by 15 percent in 1986 and firing four employees
who criticized the newspaper in a letter to advertisers.
   The two 3-0 rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which were made public Monday, were victories for The Newspaper
Guild in disputes stemming from negotiations with the newspaper in
1986.
   An agreement was recently announced to sell the newspaper to a
group headed by Sacramento developers Daniel Benvenuti and David
Kassis.
   Bob Saucerman, one of the four employees fired over the letter,
said he expected the decisions and felt vindicated.
   ``I'm very pleased. I hope the employer would now swiftly
implement the court's order and give everybody their 15 percent,''
said Saucerman, who was a retail advertising salesman.
   But Sacramento Union President Jack Bates said the newspaper
will appeal both rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court. Bates said 170
to 180 employees were affected.
   ``We believe very strongly that we were at impasse'' in contract
negotiations and had the right to implement the pay cut, Bates
said. ``We also believe very strongly that we had the right to fire
those (four) people on the basis of their actions.''
   The Guild, representing editorial, circulation, business,
advertising and maintenance employees, negotiated with the
newspaper in 1986 on a contract to replace the one that was to
expire that May.
   The talks continued beyond May, but in early August 1986 the
newspaper declared an impasse and put its last offer into effect,
including an across-the-board 15 percent pay cut and elimination of
a longstanding provision requiring all employees to join the Guild.
   The union denied that negotiations were at an impasse, as
required for an employer to implement its final contract offer. A
hearing officer ruled in the newspaper's favor but was overruled by
the National Labor Relations Board, whose decision was upheld by
the appeals court.
   The court said there was evidence to support the NLRB's
conclusion that no real bargaining had taken place on the key issue
of union security when the talks were suspended.
   When the security issue was raised, ``the company put the matter
off to a later time and then declared an impasse before any real
discussion took place,'' the court said. It rejected the
newspaper's argument that the Guild had refused to discuss the
issue.
   The court upheld the NLRB's order requiring the newspaper to
reinstate the former contract, which included the higher pay level
and the union membership requirement.
   The unsigned ruling was issued by Judges Otto Skopil, Betty
Fletcher and Ferdinand Fernandez.
   The other ruling involved a letter written by four members of
the Guild's negotiating committee to 50 of the newspaper's
advertisers in October 1987.
   The letter described the employees' efforts to get a contract,
mentioned the pay cut, and declared that the paper was ``speeding
downhill,'' with circulation plummeting and good staffers leaving.
The advertisers were urged to contact executives of the newspaper.
   The court said the four employees _ Bob Saucerman, Ana Sandoval,
Georgia Canfield and Sue Harper _ were fired two weeks later. Bates
accused them of disloyalty and said the letter contained falsehoods
that disrupted the newspaper's relationship with advertisers, the
court said.
   In an opinion by Fletcher, the court upheld the NLRB's decision
that the letter was within the employees' rights of collective
bargaining and was not an improper act of disloyalty.

   Bob Ross and Evelyn Skinner are proving that
love and marriage really do go together like a horse and carriage.
   Ross, 58, who runs a horse-drawn carriage business in the
Waikiki tourist area, knew Ms. Skinner was the woman for him the
moment the 60-year-old Tennessee woman got into his carriage while
vacationing with her father and stepmother recently.
   ``The first thing the driver said to me was, `Would you like to
go for a cruise, go out to dinner or get married?''' Ms. Skinner
recalled. ``Well, it was just foolishness so I said, `I'd rather
get married.'''
   ``The moment I spotted her beautiful brown eyes, I knew that
this is it,'' Ross said. ``I've waited 18 years for a woman like
her. I've prayed to the Lord for it and he finally sent me an
angel.''
   It was a whirlwind romance after that first carriage ride. After
a breakfast date the next day, Ross asked Ms. Skinner's father for
her hand.
   ``My father said: `Well, she's 60 years old, she ought to be
able to make up her own mind,''' said Ms. Skinner, a registered
nurse.
   The date hasn't been set, but the wedding, the second for each,
will be as soon as possible.

   Tired of scrounging under the car
seat for change to drop in the parking meter? This city is
considering introducing the latest in convenience for the motorist
on the go: the personal parking meter.
   If the City Commission goes along with the proposal today,
drivers would be offered pocket computer-sized devices that
automatically keep track of parking time in metered zones. The
``Parkulators'' would sell for $50, and be dumped in the trash when
$50 worth of curb time is used up.
   ``It's your own personal parking meter,'' said Tom McCormick,
city parking manager. ``We get complaints constantly: `If I only
had enough change on me or had some way to prepay the meter, I
wouldn't have gotten this ticket.' Now they won't have that
excuse.''
   Motorists would be responsible for turning the units on and
punching in the maximum time allowed at whatever meter they've
pulled up to. If they don't, or if they fail to come back and punch
in another deposit when the time's up, McCormick said, they'll get
tickets just like an old-fashioned meter scofflaw.

<HEAD>Ex-Con Who Became Prominent Anti-Crime Consultant Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ray Johnson, an ex-convict sterlized by the
state of California as a teen-ager who turned his life around and
became a prominent anti-crime consultant, has died. He was 62.
   Johnson died Sunday night at a San Diego hospital. He had
undergone serveral surgical procedures and was in ill health for
the past year, said a longtime friend, District Attorney's
spokesman Steve Casey.
   Johnson's life was the basis for a television movie.
   In and out of California juvenile institutions from the age of
7, Johnson was sterlized at age 17 under a theory that juvenile
delinquency could be eradicted by ensuring that teen-age offenders
didn't have children.
   The Syracuse, N.Y., native moved to San Diego at age 1. He
served time in juvenile and adult institutions for auto theft,
burglary and escape, but most of his criminal career involved armed
robbery.
   While doing time at Folsom Prison for armed robbery, Johnson and
two other inmates became the first maxiumum-security prisoners to
escape from the Northern California facility in 1958. The three
were recaptured.
   Johnson spent the next four years in solitary confinement.
Casey, a former San Diego newspaper reporter who met Johnson while
covering jails and prisons, said Johnson never liked small places
after that.
   ``He once had an apartment and it drove him nuts,'' Casey
recalled.
   Johnson, who used to claim the late San Diego Mafia chief Tony
Mirable as his godfather, turned his life around after his parole
in 1968.
   He returned to San Diego and worked for the old county
Department of Honor Camps, then as a research associate for Western
Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla.
   Johnson, who lived in Del Mar, also became an internationally
known anti-crime lecturer who spoke frequently to business and
civic groups. Among the law-enforcement organizations he addressed
were the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   In 1978, Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr. granted Johnson a
full pardon.
   Johnson made about three dozen appearances as a guest on ``The
Tonight Show,'' and regarded host Johnny Carson as a good friend
and a major influence, Casey said.
   Johnson was honored by Mayors Pete Wilson and Maureen O'Connor,
who declared days in his honor in 1978 and 1988, respectively.
   When he died, Johnson was working on a robbery- and
violence-prevention program for small businesses and a similar
program to help the elderly.
   ``If we need proof that it's possible for a person to change,
Ray was that proof. I wouldn't have liked the old Ray Johnson,''
said Casey.
   Johnson co-wrote a 1975 autobiography, ``Too Dangerous To Be At
Large,'' which was a reference to one of Superior Court Judge John
Hewicker's comments to Johnson when he was sentenced to prison for
the last time.
   The book was the basis for a television movie, ``Dangerous
Company,'' in which Johnson's role was played by Beau Bridges.
Johnson also had a bit part in the network movie, playing a prison
guard.
   Johnson is survived by his wife, Joanna, and his mother, Doris
Tarry.

   No one really knows what happened to
Richard Sproules. Two weeks ago he was a well-respected police
chief in this tough shoemakers' town that gave the world Rocky
Marciano and championship football teams.
   Then, on Oct. 24, Sproules was arrested for allegedly taking
cocaine from the police department's evidence room to support his
five-year addiction.
   At his arraignment, prosecutors said Sproules confessed he was a
cocaine addict. The 22-year police veteran, who once headed the
department's anti-drug unit, also is being investigated in
connection with hundreds of thousands of dollars missing from
operating funds and money from seized drug deals, court documents
show.
   The news has taken people's breath away.
   Sproules, 45, was a light for this blue-collar city's 93,000
residents some 20 miles south of Boston. With drug-related crime a
daily reality and racial tension a constant presence, they looked
to him often.
   Nan Ellison, the NAACP's local president, met Sproules more than
10 years ago after racial graffiti was scrawled over a neighborhood
church.
   ``He was very sensitive to people's needs _ all kinds of
people's needs,'' she said. ``He made you feel like a friend and
his door was always open.''
   That open door, and the way Sproules refused to concede defeat
without a battle, may have been his undoing, friends and colleagues
said.
   Between heading a 185-member police force, setting up
neighborhood crime watch patrols, acting as a liaison on various
community boards, guiding high school counselors, coaching pre-teen
soccer, his plate was full.
   When he got home to his wife and two kids at night, it was after
hours of doling out advice and hearing people's problems.
   ``He was called upon so much _ maybe it was too much,'' Ellison
said. ``He might have been under stress and we didn't know it. He
never showed it.''
   Everyone agrees, Sproules never let on that anything was
bothering him.
   Since the news broke, officers down at the department have been
dazed. At the bar, people drain beers while discussing Sproules'
alleged secret life and speculating on his fall from grace.
   ``The overriding thing was the intensity of their reaction,''
said Steve Albert, a talk show host at WBET radio, who threw open
his mike the evening the Sproules story broke.
   ``In a lot of cases we were knocking people off their chairs
with this ... it was the last thing anybody expected to hear. They
needed to talk and let off some steam.''
   Perhaps what people find most disconcerting is the fact that
Sproules, an authority figure, could succumb to an everyday human
frailty. ``If it can happen to him it can happen to anyone,''
people said again and again.
   Eugene Franciosi, a junior high school principal, is still
trying to figure out how the police chief, a friend and adviser to
whom many students turned, could have sunk into the very hell he
was trying to eradicate.
   ``It's been like a car accident or some other kind of tragedy,''
he said. ``It's easy to say `That's terrible, but it's not going to
happen to someone we know,' '' he said. ``Now we know that
assumption's just not true.''
   Cocaine, like many drugs, can be extremely addictive and
Sproules' work drew him daily into temptation's way until
eventually co-workers suspected him and an internal investigation
was launched.
   Sproules was suspended with pay and subsequently resigned. He
was freed on his own recognizance after pleading innocent to the
drug charges. He talked only briefly following his arrest.
   ``I was always helping other people,'' he said. ``But I never
found time for myself. Maybe that was my problem.''
   Authorities have convened an investigative grand jury to examine
evidence against Sproules, who last week admitted himself to a
four-week drug rehabilitation program was not available for
comment. His attorney, Bruce Edmands, did not return telephone
messages left at his office.
   If convicted, Sproules could face more than 20 years in prison.
   Edward Stern, a local carpenter and friend who spoke recently
with Sproules, said the chief in some ways has been set free.
   ``The man feels like there's a 3,000-pound weight off his soul _
that finally he doesn't have to lie anymore,'' Stern said.

<HEAD>Congress Gives Agencies `Open Money Sack' to Hire Consultants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is giving federal agencies ``an open
money sack'' to hire private consultants and contractors, and the
Energy Department even lets them perform sensitive work on nuclear
technology, a Senate report says.
   The Department of Energy relies on private consultants ``to
perform virtually all basic governmental functions,'' according to
a report released Monday by Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of a
Senate subcommittee.
   The number of Energy Department employees has declined from
20,000 in 1980 to 16,000, the report said, adding that contractors
have in effect become part of its permanent work force.
   ``It relies on contractors in the preparation of its most
important plans and policies, the development of budgets and budget
documents, and the drafting of reports to Congress and
congressional testimony,'' the report said.
   ``It relies on contractors to monitor arms control negotiations,
help prepare decisions on the export of nuclear technology, and
conduct hearings and initial appeals in challenges to security
clearance disputes,'' it said.
   Pryor said the department was unable to say how many contractors
and consultants it has, or how much it is spending on them. But he
said the department pays more for work by consultants than it would
for the same work by employees.
   ``We spend in the Congress weeks debating whether government
employees should get a 2 percent or a 3.6 percent pay raise, but we
provide literally an open money sack to agencies to hire private
contractors,'' Pryor said.
   Donna R. Fitzpatrick, assistant energy secretary for management
and administration, defended the use of consultants and contractors
as necessary to provide technical expertise that the government
cannot obtain from its own employees.
   She said the department's employees ``are stretched very thin,''
and that government salaries are too low to keep employees who can
be hired at higher salaries by the contractors. But she said the
department uses only its own employees to make policy decisions.
   Fitzpatrick acknowledged the panel's finding that remarks by
Energy Secretary James Watkins to a House panel in April on nuclear
facilities had been written by a private defense contractor, BDM.
But she said that was an ``isolated'' incident.
   The report was written by the staff of Pryor's Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittee on federal services, post office
and civil service, which has been looking into use of consultants
by the Energy Department and other agencies.
   Pryor said many of the consultants and contractors also do
business with private energy companies or foreign governments and
companies.
   ``The potential for a conflict of interest is unchecked,'' he
said.
   David O'Connor, director of procurement and contract management
for the Environmental Protection Agency, defended EPA's use of
outside contractors in testimony before the panel. He said EPA's
budget for contracts tripled during the 1980s.

   ``Look Who's Talking,'' the comedy about love
and diapers, sold more than $11 million in tickets for the fourth
consecutive weekend, becoming only the seventh movie since 1982 to
do so.
   ``The Bear,'' the live-action drama about two bears being
pursued by hunters, jumped to second place with $5.1 million in its
second week of release.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' starring Kirstie Alley, John Travolta
and the voice of Bruce Willis, has now made nearly $60 million,
according to figures released Monday by Entertainment Data Inc. and
Exhibitor Relations Co.
   During the past seven years, the only other movies to surpass
$11 million each weekend for a month were ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``The Return of the Jedi,'' ``Ghostbusters,''
``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and
``Batman,'' according to Entertainment Data.
   In third place in box offices revenues for last weekend was
director Wes Craven's ``Shocker,'' a story about a murderer who
more or less appeals his death sentence. ``Shocker,'' falling 26
percent from the previous weekend, reported a gate of $3.4 million.
   Woody Allen's melancholy comedy ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' sold
$2.7 million worth of tickets during a weekend of limited release
to finish in fourth place and become the director's biggest hit
since 1986's ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
   In fifth was the new comedy ``Second Sight,'' with Bronson
Pinchot and John Larroquette co-starring as psychics, with $2.2
million. In sixth was ``Phantom of the Opera,'' starring Freddy
Krueger veteran Robert Englund, which debuted with $2.1 million.
   The Patrick Swayze adventure film ``Next of Kin'' was seventh,
grossing $2 million.
   ``Sea of Love,'' the romantic thriller pairing Al Pacino and
Ellen Barkin, was eighth with $1.8 million. In ninth was the
medical-school comedy ``Gross Anatomy,'' which collected $1.7
million.
   In 10th with $1.6 million was ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,''
starring Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by
Entertainment Data and Exhibitor Relations.

<HEAD>New Rules Simplify Shopping for a Home Equity Loan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The confusing task of choosing a home equity
loan should be easier starting today under new federal rules
requiring lenders to disclose in advance the interest rate, fees
and other terms they're offering.
   Federal Reserve regulations, voluntary since June 7, became
mandatory today. In addition to advance disclosure, the law curbs
misleading advertising and other abusive practices.
   ``Simple, easily understood and easily comparable information
will be available to consumers to intelligently shop around for a
home equity loan,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., chief sponsor of
the legislation passed late last year that directed the Fed to
write the rules.
   Lenders now must disclose basic cost information when borrowers
make an initial inquiry and again when the loan application is
filed.
   Another provision targets deeply discounted ``teaser'' rates
that offer borrowers a break on their first few payments before the
rates rise sharply. Lenders can still advertise teaser rates, but
they must give equal prominence to the interest rate borrowers will
be paying after the discount expires.
   The rules forbid contract clauses permitting lenders to call in
the loan, accelerate payments or raise the interest rate at whim.
   Adjustable-rate home equity loans now must be based on an index
outside the lender's control, such as the prime rate published in
newspapers, not the lender's own prime rate.
   Consumer advocates were pleased with the law, sponsored in the
Senate by Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., but they complained that the
Federal Reserve regulations do not fully live up to their spirit.
   Consumer's Union, a national organization that publishes
Consumer Reports magazine, filed suit last week in U.S. District
Court in Washington seeking to close what it considers several
loopholes.
   The group opposes a provision in the law that requires lenders
in the first pre-application disclosure to reveal only the index on
which a floating interest rate is based, but not the margin, or
difference between the rate charged and the index.
   ``We think the margin is an integral part of the cost that
consumers need to know. We also think the legislation expressly
requires lenders to disclose the margin,'' said attorney Michelle
Meier of Consumers Union.
   Bankers are generally satisfied with the law, recognizing it was
needed to curb at least isolated abuses. But, according to Diane
Casey, regulatory affairs director of the Independent Bankers
Association of America, the disclosures may swamp borrowers with
too much detail. One provision, for instance, requires the lender
to provide a chart showing how the interest rate and minimum
monthly payment would have varied over the past 15 years.
   ``It gets confusing,'' Casey said. ``People don't care what
happened 15 years ago. They want to know what's happening today and
what their payment is going to be tomorrow.''
   The popularity of home equity loans has surged since the 1986
tax law began phasing out the deductibility of consumer loans. Home
loans, however, are still fully deductible, including home equity
loans in most instances. This year, only 20 percent of non-mortgage
interest is deductible; in 1990 only 10 percent is eligible and
beginning in 1991 none will be.
   The Federal Reserve said outstanding revolving home equity loans
totaled $26.3 billion at mid-October, up from $21 billion a year
earlier and $11.7 billion in June 1987, when the agency first began
keeping track.
   According to a survey of 138 lenders by the Consumer Bankers
Association, the delinquency and foreclosure rates for home equity
loans were lower this year than for regular first mortgages.
   But, consumer advocates have always been leery of home equity
loans and say they haven't been tested during an economic downturn.
Defaults could soar in a recession, they contend.
   The Better Business Bureau says home equity loans should be used
only for major expenditures such as college education, home
improvement or for major medical expenses, not for luxuries such as
sports cars.

<HEAD>Two Committee Chairman Urge Defeat of Cason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of two Senate committees that
oversee natural resources issues are urging their colleagues to
reject James Cason as assistant secretary of agriculture.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who is chairman of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture Committee, are sending a letter
to all senators, saying Cason ``is neither qualified nor suitable''
for the job.
   Cason, 35, has been nominated to head the Agriculture
Department's forest and conservation programs.
   He has drawn fire for his record as a high-ranking official
during the Reagan administration at the Interior Department, where
critics contend he put private development interests ahead of
environmental concerns.
   ``A review of Mr. Cason's education and employment history
indicates that he came to the Department of the Interior with
little, if any, by the way of background or qualifications for the
job,'' said the letter, dated Nov. 3.
   ``Moreover, Mr. Cason's record indicates a reluctance to rely on
the professional expertise available to him at the Department of
the Interior,'' it says.
   Leahy opposed Cason during committee hearings, saying he
repeatedly shrugged aside public interests in decisions on how to
use public lands.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who is widely admired on
Capitol Hill, has sought to assure senators that he sets
environmental policy at the department and Cason would be taking
orders from him.
   But Johnston and Leahy cited testimony critical of Cason from
Max Peterson, who retired recently as chief of the forest service
after 38 years with the agency and currently holds the title chief
emeritus.
   ``In my judgment, he (Cason) clearly is not qualified,'' the
senators quote Peterson as saying.
   ``The opposition to Mr. Cason's nomination is broad and deep,
and ranges across political and ideological viewpoints,'' said
Leahy and Johnston. ``It is opposition based on the recognition
that we need appointees who are dedicated to protecting the public
trust, whatever their party.''
   The nomination was approved by the Agriculture Committee on a
12-7 vote, but full Senate action was been put on hold because of
opposition to the appointment.

   Federal subsidies would be available to cities
that start tree-planting programs if a bill passed by the House
becomes law.
   The legislation, known as the urban and community forestry act,
was approved on voice vote Monday and now goes to the Senate.
   It directs the Agriculture Department to start a matching grants
program that would provide cash, services or in-kind contributions
for up to 50 percent of the cost of any tree-planting program.
   The legislation addresses ``an important concern in our country
about what can be done to reforest our nation's cities, to cool
down and green up our urban areas,'' said Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind.,
who authored the bill.
   Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., said that for every tree being
planted in cities, four are being lost. He advocated passage of the
bill, saying it would help clean the air and battle against global
warming.
   The measure also:
   _Directs the Agriculture Department to start an educational and
technical assistance program in cooperation with state foresters
and state extension agents.
   _Establishes a 15-member National Urban and Community Forestry
Advisory Council to help develop criteria for the cost share
program and develop a national urban and community forestry plan.

   A House subcommittee this week will begin a
series of four hearings on controversies surrounding the use of
national forests.
   Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., is planning to take testimony
Thursday from administration officials on the status of forest land
and resource management plans.
   ``Our National forests supply a vast array of products and
opportunities, from timber and minerals to recreation for millions
of Americans,'' said Volkmer, chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommittee on forests, family farms and energy.
   ``Conflicts over the use of resources in the national forests
are increasing in frequency and severity, and we need to explore
alternatives for addressing some of these tough issues,'' he said.
   A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 15 on timber harvesting systems;
Nov. 21 on timber sale economics and the timber sale information
reporting system; and Nov. 29 on issues associated with timber
supply and sustained yield.

   It took Martin Miller seven years, but he's
finally convinced the CIA and the State Department to change their
maps of Israel and Jordan to reflect historical fact and U.S.
policy.
   It's a story about a persistent advocate, a cumbersome
bureaucracy and the intractable Israeli-Arab conflict.
   Miller, a retired Treasury Department official, began his
crusade in 1981 when he noticed that a government-published map
book showed the West Bank of the Jordan River as part of Jordan.
   This was despite the fact that the United States and most of the
rest of the world have never recognized Jordan's 1950 annexation of
the 2,200-square-mile territory.
   On the official U.S. maps published by the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Israeli-Jordanian border was drawn along the 1949
armistice line, which defined Israel's physical borders until the
1967 war. The maps did not reflect Israel's capture of the West
Bank in that war and the new cease-fire lines created as a result.
   ``It wasn't right. It just didn't reflect reality,'' said Miller.
   He undertook his campaign in a methodical way, buying a computer
and poring over history books and archive documents, far from the
controversy generated by every wrinkle of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   The first step was a letter to then-Secretary of State Alexander
Haig. The retired general referred Miller's letter to a
little-known State Department entity called the Office of the
Geographer.
   The office maps official U.S. policy on sovereignty issues for
internal State Department publications, and acts as an advisory and
arbitration board for other government agencies that issue maps.
   Miller began corresponding with the geographer, who issued a
directive in 1982 ordering cartographers to stop showing the West
Bank as anyone's territory.
   But still, the public maps were not changed.
   Miller also enlisted his congressman's help, wrote opinion
pieces and editorial letters, but the maps were still wrong.
   Finally, Miller asked to see Haig's successor at the State
Department, George Shultz, whom he had known when Shultz was
Treasury secretary. ``That was very exciting,'' Miller said. He
left Shultz with 92 documents buttressing his argument.
   More conversations with administration officials and letters
followed.
   In 1984, Miller read an opinion piece in The Washington Post by
former deputy CIA chief Robert Gates, who said the agency was
emphasizing accuracy and objectivity in its assessments.
   Miller decided to call Gates, talking his way past skeptical
aides and secretaries until he got through.
   ``I told him his people were not adhering to his standards,''
Miller said. Two days later, on Jan. 2, 1985, he was summoned to a
meeting with two CIA officials.
   They promised the maps would be changed, but a year later
nothing had been done, Miller said.
   Miller called again _ and this time a promise was fulfilled. The
map of Jordan was changed in 1986. It took until January 1989 to
change the Israel map.
   The new maps show the 1967 cease-fire line between Israel and
Jordan, with the West Bank designated as two cultural regions _
Judea and Samaria. The two biblical names are also used by Israeli
nationalists to describe the region.
   Miller's efforts also bore fruit outside government circles when
the Encyclopedia Britannica changed its maps, he said.
   The State Department is reluctant to give all the credit to
Miller for the changes, but concedes his campaign influenced the
decision. ``He was very, very active, and believed in his cause,''
said one official familiar with the case.
   Perhaps the best tribute to Miller's determination was contained
in a letter from Shultz earlier this year, soon after the Israel
maps were changed.
   ``Dear Marty,'' wrote the man who labored in vain for six years
to bring about Israeli-Arab peace talks. ``I'm glad you kept at it
and accomplished something that is of genuine and lasting
significance.''

   Mimicking an overnight decline in New York, share
prices fell on a broad front today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's key
indicator, fell 163.54 points, or 0.46 percent, to close at
35,470.26. It lost 60.86 points Monday.
   The overnight decline in New York, where the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues posted its third-largest
single-day decline this year of 47.34 points, sparked a broad round
of selling, driving the Nikkei down 301.22 points in the first 15
minutes of trading.
   Dealers said investors in both markets were reacting with
disappointment over fading prospects for an interest-rate cut
following Friday's release of U.S. jobless figures, which showed
the U.S. unemployment rate unchanged from a month earlier at 5.3
percent.
   A quarterly auction of U.S. Treasury securities to begin today
in the United States also kept some participants on the sidelines,
they said.
   The Nikkei recovered some of its early losses later in the day
as investors bought popular issues such as petroleum and mining
shares as well as some incentive-backed issues, dealers said.
   A estimated 750 million shares changed hands in moderately
active trading, up from 611 million shares Monday.
   In currency trading, the dollar closed at 143.63 yen, up 0.18
yen from Monday's close of 143.45 yen. It opened at 143.85 yen and
ranged between 143.53-144.04. The dollar closed at 143.88 yen in
New York overnight.
   The dollar surged against the yen in early trading following an
upswing in New York overnight, said a trader with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Many investors bought the dollar in early trading,'' he said,
``but their buying incentive was not strong enough to keep pushing
the dollar beyond the 144-yen line.''
   Demand for the dollar due to today's Treasury auction bolstered
the dollar later in the day as it came under selling pressure from
security houses and life insurance companies, said Kaneo Ogino, a
trader at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.
   ``Rumors of an imminent rate hike by the Bank of Japan are
putting downward pressure on the dollar,'' Ogino said.
   Traders said the dollar-yen rate is unlikely to move much ahead
of the release of the U.S. wholesale price index for October on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Drug Suspect Testifies He Plotted to Kill Pakistan's Zia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man prosecutors say is a major
heroin trafficker testified he paid another accused drug dealer in
a plot to assassinate Pakistan's former leader, who died in a
mysterious plane crash.
   Federal prosecutors allege that Mushtaq Malik, a 41-year-old
Pakistani on trial on charges of conspiracy and importation of
heroin, arranged for Samir N. Houchaimi of Amman, Jordan, to bring
$10 million in heroin to the United States for resale.
   Houchaimi was arrested in Springfield with heroin nearly two
years ago, authorities said.
   Prosecutors say Malik is known as ``The Black Prince,'' and they
allege he is one of the world's biggest heroin traffickers.
   Malik testified Monday in U.S. District Court that he had hired
Houchaimi to kill Pakistani President Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
Malik did not make clear whether the assassination plot he said he
was involved in had anything to do with the crash.
   Malik, a self-described Pakistani prince, said Houchaimi was a
former colonel in the Jordanian army.
   ``I don't know anything about money for heroin in America,''
Malik said.
   Malik was summoned to testify by his attorney Stephen Ferrarone.
   He was scheduled for cross-examination today by Assistant U.S.
Attorney Kevin O'Regan.
   Malik testified he advanced Houchaimi $1 million on behalf of
superiors in the left-leaning Pakistan People's Party _ whose
current leader is Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto _ to secure
personnel and equipment for the assasination.
   The 51-year-old Houchaimi testified last week that he had been
given 2 kilograms of heroin in Nicosia, Cyprus, to sell in the
United States for Malik. Houchaimi was arrested with a nylon
handbag filled with the heroin on Feb. 6, 1988, near a downtown bus
terminal, authorities said.
   Six months later, on Aug. 17, 1988, Zia died in a plane crash
that also killed 29 other people, including U.S. Ambassador Arnold
Raphel.
   After Houchaimi was arrested, he arranged a meeting in Rio de
Janiero, Brazil, between Malik and a ``Mr. Costa,'' the alias for
undercover U.S. drug agent William J. Powers, according to the
Springfield Union-News.
   Malik and the agent met in March 1988, supposedly to fly to
Costa Rica together, but Malik was arrested and returned to the
United States where he has been held in custody, the newspaper
reported.
   Malik said he had lost face among his compatriots because he
recommended a man who failed to carry out his task in the plot.
   ``I don't know anything about money for heroin in America,''
Malik testified. ``I wanted to have that money back for my people
and save my face.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. James Traficant says part of an insurance
investigator's report on ill-fated Pan Am Flight 103 shows the
United States was warned an hour before takeoff about a possible
bomb.
   The plane blew up last December over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground. The
airline has been sued for more than $300 million.
   Traficant, D-Ohio, said he has a report indicating the CIA got a
warning from West German intelligence about a suspicious suitcase
on the plane.
   The CIA termed the report ``nonsense,'' and administration
officials said the United States was not warned about a Flight 103
bomb by any foreign intelligence agency.
   On Monday, Traficant passed out five pages from what he said was
a 27-page report prepared for Pan Am's insurance company.
   The document says a West German agent watching baggage handlers
singled out one suspicious suitcase and reported ``something was
very wrong.''
   West German intelligence passed on the concern to a CIA unit in
Frankfurt, which relayed it to an unidentified ``control,'' says
the excerpt.
   ``Control replied: `Don't worry about it, don't stop it, let it
go,''' the excerpt says.
   A former CIA employee, Victor Marchetti, joined Traficant at the
Capitol Hill news conference to identify himself as the person who
gave the congressman the document. Marchetti said he was not
involved in writing the report but believes ``it is essentially
accurate.''
   ``I know the intelligence officers who prepared this report,''
said Marchetti, who retired from the agency in 1969 and wrote a
book critical of the CIA.
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield, who last week called the report
``nonsense,'' said Monday, ``It's still nonsense.''
   ``My gut instinct is, the CIA is very defensive and that they
know a hell of a lot more than they're telling us,'' said
Traficant. ``I think that there are questions that now have to be
answered.''
   Traficant said the full report shows connections between the
bombing, drug-running and hostage rescue efforts.
   Pan Am already has subpoenaed documents relating to one of the
people mentioned prominently in the report: Monzer Al-Kassar, who
is characterized as having connections with both the terrorist
bombers and the CIA.

   Former Secretary of State George Shultz is
being lampooned by the White House for suggesting that cocaine and
other drugs should be legalized.
   ``Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast too long, hasn't he?''
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. ``The guy
slips into retirement and right away he starts saying things that
are strange.''
   More seriously, Fitzwater said, ``Clearly, we do not believe
drugs should be legalized. President Bush feels very strongly that
that is the wrong direction at the wrong time; that it is not a
moral position for the United States to take; and that it makes no
sense whatsoever.''
   Shultz said legalizing drugs is something that ``everyone is
scared to talk about. No politician wants to say (it) ...''
   His views were published in The Wall Street Journal Oct. 27 in
an adaptation of remarks he made to an alumni gathering at the
Stanford Business School in Palo Alto, Calif., on Oct. 7.
   He said that attacking drugs with a criminal justice approach
``is not likely to work.''
   Shultz said, ``It seems to me we're not really going to get
anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business
and the incentives for criminality out of it.
   ``Frankly,'' he added, ``the only way I can think of to
accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at
some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost.
   ``When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives,
including ... the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around
and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves.
They won't have that incentive because they won't have that market.
   ``... We need at least to consider and examine forms of
controlled legalization of drugs,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz served as secretary of state for President Reagan from
July 1982 until January 1989, when he returned to the faculty at
the Stanford Business School.
   During the Nixon administration, he was budget director and
secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs
Service.

   Action by the Supreme Court clears the way for
the start of payments from a $2.5 billion settlement fund to women
injured by the Dalkon Shield birth control device.
   The device, marketed in the early 1970s, allegedly caused
infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammation and even,
in some cases, death.
   Here, at a glance, are the details:
   _A target date for payments for those with active claims is late
February, but lawyers say the payments may not begin until the
spring.
   _Nearly 100,000 of the more than 300,000 women who filed claims
against A.H. Robins, the Richmond, Va., manufacturer of the device,
still have active claims and stand to share in the settlement.
   _Baltimore lawyer Michael Pretl, however, says thousands of
women with active claims may collect very little because of
problems in their cases. For example, they may have used more than
one brand of intrauterine device.
   _Some 9,000 cases were settled before A.H. Robins declared
bankruptcy and announced a reorganization plan in 1985. Payments
made under those settlements are serving as a model for awards in
this settlement. Pretl predicts that women who suffered serious
injuries may collect between $25,000 and $250,000.
   _A four-member ``trust fund'' committee appointed by U.S.
District Judge Robert Merhige in Richmond will make the awards. The
committee is led by Georgine Vairo of the Fordham University Law
School in New York.
   _Women who win awards most often will have to pay their lawyers
one-third of the amounts.
   _Women already in the case need do nothing right now, but women
who believe they were injured by using a Dalkon Shield are urged to
seek legal help. Those women, if their claims are proved, could
share in a supplemental trust fund established by A.H. Robins'
insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.

<TEXT>
   Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley admits
his dream of a United Nations strike force to combat drug cartel
terrorism lacks necessary political support, but he says he will
keep up his crusade for the idea.
   Manley told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that a
Western hemisphere training center for agents and intelligence
could serve as an alternative _ but only an international strike
force would really do the job.
   ``It isn't a regional problem, it's an international problem,''
Manley said in pitching for an eight-point program aimed at
fighting the narcotics scourge.
   He said the Organization of American States or some other
international group might be interested in sponsoring such a
project.
   Manley was preaching his gospel to a friendly audience.
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., is a leading
congressional supporter of the concept of a multinational force to
combat the drug cartels.
   ``The strike force plan could turn the rhetoric about
apprehending drug kingpins into a reality _ and yet to my amazement
we have not had a firm recommendation by the administration on this
plan,'' Biden said.
   Manley said quite a few governments have been skeptical about
the idea of allowing foreign troops on their soil, even if by
invitation and under U.N. auspices as called for under his plan.
   After the hearing he met for 20 minutes with Vice President Dan
Quayle to discuss the drug problem. Before leaving for that session
he told reporters it would be ``too ambitious'' to expect Bush
administration support for the idea of a multinational force.
   Manley likened the strike force to paramilitary forces
established a decade ago to fight aircraft hijackers and urban
guerrillas in West Germany and Italy. The unit, Manley said, would
be used where drug lords ``create a terror in society and (try to)
break its will to fight them.''
   He said it might be possible to get action soon on the seven
other points in his anti-drug program.
   The package includes a central intelligence-gathering system, a
school for narcotics agents and an international reserve pool of
narcotics agents and intelligence operatives.
   Manley said the seven other pieces of the package were actually
more important if taken in total than the proposed paramilitary
force, although the idea of such an elite unit has drawn most of
the spotlight.

<TEXT>
   A man killed his wife and mother and
wounded two other family members before fatally shooting himself,
but a blind man, a baby and two children escaped the rampage
unharmed, police said.
   Authorities said 28-year-old Tony Frederick started firing a
shotgun at his relatives in his mother's home after an argument.
   ``He wiped his family out. I just don't understand. We may never
know why it happened,'' Sumter County Sheriff Randy Howard said.
   The shootings occurred at the home of Polly Mae Frederick in the
southwest Georgia city.
   Tony Frederick, who lived in Sumter County, and his 20-year-old
wife, Gwendolyn, had gone to his mother's house to do laundry
Monday afternoon, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman
John Bankhead.
   After the argument began, Frederick shot the two women in the
head, killing both, Bankhead said.
   Frederick's 33-year-old sister, Jackie, ran outside to lead
their blind brother, LeRoy, to safety. But the gunman followed and
shot his sister in the head, authorities said.
   In her arms was her unharmed, 4-month-old baby.
   Jackie Frederick underwent surgery Monday night at Columbus
Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition,
according to nursing supervisor June Say.
   After she was shot, LeRoy Frederick ran to a highway, and got
the attention of a truck driver, who called police.
   Police failed to persuade Frederick to come outside, and
eventually fired a tear-gas canister into the house. Officers found
him dead and a niece, Tammy Watts, hiding under a bed with a
gunshot wound in her side, Bankhead said.
   Ms. Watts was in stable condition at Sumter Regional Hospital in
nearby Americus.
   Ms. Watts' children, 4-year-old Deandra Frederick and 2-year-old
Carla Watts, were found huddled in a locked parked car, where they
apparently fled when the shooting began, Bankhead said.

<HEAD>Latin American Incomes Dropped in `Lost Decade'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1980s are a lost decade for Latin America,
with a drop of individual incomes that threatens the establishment
of democracy, according to Brazilian President Joao Baena Soares,
who heads the Organization of American States.
   He also saw damage to the United States and other industrial
countries.
   ``Various sources estimated that the drop in imports by Latin
America cost the United States more than 900,000 jobs between 1980
and 1987, including both the jobs that disappeared and those which
could have been created if Latin America and the Caribbean had not
had to curb their imports,'' he said.
   The organization's general assembly meets in Washington for a
week beginning Monday, with 32 governments represented. Brazil will
have its first popular election for president in 29 years on Nov.
15.
   ``For many groups of people, the reduction of income and the
lack of jobs have been added to previous frustrations, so that
there is a serious lack of basic necessities,'' he told the
executive committee that was preparing the Washington session.
   ``This situation is certainly a threat to the stability of the
democracies that are in the process of consolidating themselves.''
   He said that in 1988, in the worst crisis since the 1930s,
average income was down 1.6 percent _ bringing it to the level of
1978. All except five countries saw incomes decline, and in nine
countries the level was down to that of 20 years before.
   In Venezuela, the average income was calculated at $4,543 last
year, the same as in 1964.
   Soares noted there had been serious disturbances this year
because of the economic situation. He did not name countries but
was clearly referring to last February's riots in Venezuela in
which hundreds of people were killed, and the agitation in
Argentina that brought the resignation of President Raul Alfonsin
before the end of his term.
   The committee calculated the outflow of cash as totalling $204
billion since 1980, peaking at $35 billion in 1985, then declining
for two years but rising again to $31.5 billion in 1988.
   It laid the blame on a marked reduction in the flow of capital
from abroad, the high level of Latin American payments on foreign
debt and the flight of capital from Latin America to ``safe
havens'' abroad.
   It quoted figures to show Argentina, for example, spent 20
percent of its budget on education in 1972 but only 6 percent in
1986. Mexico spent 5.1 percent on health in 1972 and only 1.4
percent in 1986.
   ``The lack of government spending on things like education and
health have disproportionately severe effect on the lowest income
groups in the member states,'' the report said.
   ``The poor do not have the means for private health care and
education when public services are no longer available.''

<HEAD>Facts And Figures On Namibia And Its Pre-Independence Elections</HEAD>
<UNK>With Namibia, Bjt</UNK>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some facts about the elections
being held in Namibia today through Saturday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTING _ Namibia's 701,483 registered voters will choose a
72-member constituent assembly that is to draft a constitution for
the country when it becomes independent from South Africa next
year. Assembly seats will be assigned on a proportional basis,
according to each party's share of the total vote.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ Namibians over 18 were eligible to register if they
or their parents were born in the territory, or if they have lived
in Namibia for four years. More than 40,000 exiles, mostly
supporters of the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),
returned on U.N. flights to participate. About 12,000 white South
Africans are qualified to vote. Sixty percent of Namibians are
illiterate and the ballots show symbols next to the party names.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CANDIDATES _ Ten political parties have submitted candidate
lists, from which the assembly members will be chosen. The top
contenders are SWAPO, which waged a war against South African
occupation from 1966 until April; and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, a multiracial coalition which participated in the
territorial government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KEY ISSUE _ SWAPO is expected to win the most votes, but a key
question is whether it will win the two-thirds majority needed to
write a constitution without consulting other parties.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The 318,252-square-mile territory is mostly desert,
with scattered deposits of valuable minerals. A 1981 census
recorded a population of 1.3 million, but the return of refugees
and the growth rate of 2.7 percent a year makes the figure
outdated. The population is predominantly black, divided among
seven major ethnic divisions, plus Bushmen, mixed-race groups, and
75,000 whites. The territory is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean,
South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Angola.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing the
territory of South-West Africa from Germany in 1915. U.N.
Resolution 435, adopted in 1978, established the process for ``free
and fair elections.'' It was implemented April 1, 1989, after the
United States and Soviet Union brokered an agreement calling for
South African and Cuban troop withdrawals from neighboring Angola,
where SWAPO guerrilla bases were located.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE U.N. ROLE _ Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator
of the territory, is in charge of the elections, while U.N. Special
Representative Martti Ahtisaari has the task of declaring whether
the voting has been free and fair. Territorial police, watched by
1,500 U.N. police monitors, were guarding the polls to prevent
violence. Another 6,150 U.N. soldiers and officials were on hand as
well as 1,000 observers from 25 countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE RESULTS _ The ballots are to be counted at regional centers
and results are expected on or after Nov. 15. U.N. Resolution 435
does not specify a procedure for formation of an independent
government once the constitution is written.

<HEAD>Agreement to Increase US-Japan Air Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred more weekly passenger flights to
Japan are expected under a new agreement officials say will only
begin to meet the huge demand in the nation's most lucrative
aviation market.
   A one-third increase in flights both ways and a similar boost in
cargo service between the two countries will begin after most of
the agreement takes effect next October, Transportation Department
officials said Monday.
   The department will decide which airlines and cities are to get
the increased flights.
   The formal pact, being completed this week after an ``agreement
in principle'' was signed in Tokyo Sunday, will open the way for
other airlines to apply for flights to Japan and for up to six
additional U.S. cities to be served by flights to Tokyo and other
Japanese cities.
   It also encourages more flights to land in Alaska and adds new
flights between Japan and Guam and Saipan.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said it was the most
significant aviation agreement between the two countries in 37
years. He said it would boost travel, trade and tourism across the
Pacific Ocean.
   Agreement came after four years of talks and six days of intense
negotiations involving U.S. State, Commerce, Interior and
Transportation department officials.
   Neither side got as many flights as it wanted, said Jeffrey N.
Shane, transportation assistant secretary for policy and
international affairs.
   ``That's good because it means both sides remain hungry,'' Shane
said, adding this would increasing chances that even more flights
can be added in the future.
   Shane said the Japan-U.S. route generates about $6 billion in
revenue for U.S. carriers, with the number of passengers increased
20 percent a year and cargo 30 percent a year over the past two
years.
   He said passenger flights between Japan and the United States
are usually full.
   ``We have a desperate need for more capacity,'' Shane said.
``This allows us to respond far more effectively to the immediate
demands for service in this market.''
   Six U.S. and three Japanese airlines currently fly between Japan
and Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle,
Minneapolis, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago, New York or Washington, D.C.
   Shane declined to say what U.S. cities might be added or what
airlines might apply for the new routes, but said competition would
be keen. He said the department's policy is to increase airline
competition, and this could be a factor in deciding which carriers
will be approved.
   The pact gives U.S. airlines three new passenger and cargo
routes to Tokyo, three to other Japanese cities and an additional
all-cargo service. Both Federal Express and Northwest now fly cargo
planes to and from Japan.
   Reciprocal routes would be awarded to Japanese airlines,
allowing some routes to extend beyond one U.S. city. The agreement
still will not allow Japanese airlines to carry passengers from one
U.S. city to another.
   Charter cargo and passengers flights by U.S. carriers will be
increased from 300 to 450 a year, and Japanese shippers will also
be able to increase flights beginning Jan. 1.
   U.S. airlines have more U.S.-Japan flights than Japanese
airlines, and the balance will remain in favor of the United
States, Shane said.
   The agreement would increase weekly U.S. flights carrying both
passengers and cargo from 151 to 200, Japanese flights from 95 to
146. Cargo flights would increase from 39 a week for U.S. carriers
to 53 and from 27 for Japanese cargo haulers to 37. The figures
include only westbound flights, with nearly all flying the other
way, as well.
   Alaska will be added as a possible stop for all U.S. and
Japanese airlines flying between the two countries. The state's
economy has suffered from a decrease in air service as more flights
bypass it in order to preserve other landing rights.

   TV viewers can find women panting over
``hunks'' or pairing up with unlikely male love interests but they
won't find any strong female role models among 26 new network shows
this year, a women's group says.
   Nor will they find any breakthroughs in portraying minorities or
find more women behind the cameras, the National Commission on
Working Women of Wider Opportunities for Women said Monday.
   Unlike years past, ``No strong female leads emerge. No workplace
dramas or comedies either break new ground or provide compelling
role models,'' the group said after surveying the 26 new 1989
primetime TV shows. ``At best, the status quo prevailed; at worst,
backward steps were taken.''
   Male-female relationships on CBS' ``Major Dad'' and ABC's
``Chicken Soup'' are ``straining viewer credibility,'' the group
said.
   ``Major Dad'' involves a crusty Marine and his forgiving young
wife, while ``Chicken Soup'' stars comic Jackie Mason in a
Catholic-Jewish matchup that ``resorts to flat stereotypes and
unbelievable characters,'' the group said.
   NBC's ``Baywatch'' shows scantily clad female lifeguards or
women sunning in bikinis or ``scampering on the beach,'' the group
said.
   One episode of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' an ABC show about a
16-year-old doctor, has a ``brilliant (female) radiologist'' asking
Doogie to father her child.
   On Fox Broadcasting's ``Open House,'' a ``professional and
competent'' female doctor, while conducting physicals for employees
of a real estate firm, spots an old flame among the employees and
``begins to swoon and speaks to him in a seductive voice.''
   The group said the shows are ``filled with stereotypes, double
entendres and outdated characters.''
   As for minorities, ``As in the past, most minority characters on
new shows are black, and most of them appear in all, or mostly,
black shows.''
   Behind the scenes, 27 of the 145 producers on the 26 shows are
women. Ten of the shows have no females behind the cameras, the
group said.
   ``At best, the new season has given us the status quo. At worst,
television has taken a step backward from the progress it made last
year,'' actress Linda Lavin said in remarks prepared for delivery
Wednesday at the group's 11th annual Women at Work Broadcast Awards
program.
   The only new shows that got good marks were ``Life Goes On'' and
``Alien Nation.''
   ABC's ``Life Goes On,'' starring Christopher Burke as a
teen-ager with Down's syndrome, was cited for its ``credible
exploration of family issues.''
   ``Alien Nation,'' a Fox Broadcasting Co. show about aliens
living on Earth, was praised for being ``in many ways an allegory
about racism.''
   The group bestowed its 1989 Commissioners Award on actress Dana
Delany for her portrayal of an Army nurse on ABC's Vietnam War
drama, ``China Beach.''
   Other winning programs were:
   _``Horizons: the 9 to 5 Danger Zone _ Occupational Hazards'';
``Vocational Training Programs for Women in Prison''; and
``Repetitive Motion Syndrome _ Two Case Studies,'' from National
Public Radio.
   _``Vets'' episode of ``China Beach,'' ABC.
   _``Displaced Homemakers'' segment on ``ABC World News Tonight,''
ABC.
   _``Winning Women,'' WXIA-TV, Atlanta.
   _``Women Under Fire,'' Oregon Public Radio.
   _``Nurses: Crisis in Care,'' KTVU, Oakland, Calif.
   _``KOMO Editorial: Women's Pay,'' KOMO-TV, Seattle.
   Wider Opportunities for Women, a national employment
organization, merged in 1987 with the National Commission on
Working Women, an advocacy group for non-professionals.

   Two Washington-area real estate agents face
charges of fraudulently obtaining $1.2 million in Department of
Housing and Urban Development loans and conspiring to sell more
than $1 million in drugs to their real estate customers.
   Max Chaikin, 52, and Marvin D. Gitelson, 54, of Potomac, Md.,
face a total of 190 years imprisonment and over $400,000 in fines
for numerous charges including racketeering, wire fraud and
obstruction of justice, said a statement by U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens.
   FBI agents arrested the men at their homes early Monday. The
two, still dressed in their early morning jogging clothes, pleaded
innocent before U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, officials said.
   The judge released Chaikin and Gitelson on personal
recognizance, despite a request from Assistant U.S. Attorney
William S. Block for a $250,000 bond on each.
   The indictments are part of an investigation of fraud in the
sale of rental properties involving HUD-insured mortgages in the
Washington area that has seen 36 convictions so far.
   As described by an unidentified source ``close to the case''
quoted in today's editions of The Washington Post, Gitelson would
locate a property to purchase and Chaikin would find a straw buyer,
or someone only pretending to be the buyer and getting a fee for
the role.
   The two would bribe a government appraiser to assign a value to
the property more than it was worth, and the straw buyer would
apply for a loan, insured by a HUD agency, using the inflated
appraisal.
   Gitelson then paid the straw buyer a fee, the source told the
newspaper. Chaikin would then pay the seller the actual market
value, using the loan funds to do so and pocketing the leftover
loan funds.
   The property was then resold at the inflated value and those
profits were also pocketed, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Displaying their best diplomatic manners, the
United States and Japan are urging each other to make far-reaching
changes in how they operate their economies.
   The United States, on the receiving end Monday of a long list of
Japanese complaints, was taking the offensive today, the windup of
a two-day round of new talks on lifestyle and other non-trade
problems linked to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   U.S. officials planned to urge the Japanese to take such steps
as consuming more, building more sewers, ports and
``super-express'' highways, and making it easier to convert
farmland into housing projects.
   This was in addition to better-known U.S. complaints about
antiquated distribution, noncompetitive pricing and corporate
collusion that the United States contends discriminates against
imports and penalizes Japanese consumers. The American side was
also stressing that it wants to keep the U.S. investment market
open to all countries but obstacles to investing in Japan make this
increasingly difficult to defend.
   The Japanese led off with their grievances Monday because they
accorded that courtesy to the Americans when the talks started two
months ago in Tokyo, and now they were the guests, said senior U.S.
officials who briefed reporters Monday on condition of anonymity.
   Despite strong complaints and obvious disagreement, Monday's
talk at the State Department was ``constructive and open,'' one of
the U.S. sources said.
   The new talks were announced by President Bush last May as an
effort to pinpoint non-trade causes contributing to the annual $50
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. The two countries have
agreed to meet every two months, with a final report in mid-1990.
   A U.S. official said Monday the ideal outcome would be emergence
of ``some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that
... the U.S. is much more competitive and so that on the Japanese
side their economy is much more open.''
   The Japanese charged Monday that U.S. corporate behavior
weakened the U.S. economy and its competitiveness, both sides said.
Japan pointed to Wall Street's leveraged buyouts as an example of
short-term business strategy hurting U.S. interests.
   Japanese officials also criticized low U.S. savings rates, low
investment in production facilities, research and development,
slowness to convert to metric measure and underemphasis on export
promotion and education and training of workers, the Japanese
source said.
   Japan also accused the United States of wasteful use of energy
and over-regulation by government in such areas as antitrust
practices, the ban against selling Alaskan oil to Japan, and
required use of American-owned shipping, the source added.
   The U.S. delegation was led by Richard McCormack, undersecretary
of state for economic affairs, Deputy Trade Representative Lynn
Williams, Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara and Commerce
Undersecretary Michael Farren.
   Heading the Japanese delegation of more than 50 officials were
Deputy Foreign Minister Koji Watanabe, Deputy Finance Minister
Makoto Utsumi and Naomichi Suzuki, vice minister of international
trade and industry.

<HEAD>Chinese Told To Make Sacrifices As Leaders Meet On Austerity Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders met secretly today to endorse a
three-year austerity plan and the Chinese people were told to brace
for several years of ``hard living'' as the country grapples with
economic difficulties.
   A commentary in the official Beijing Daily said ``only through a
few years of hard work, belt-tightening, and unity can we go past
this stage and continue the construction of our socialist
modernization.''
   The Communist Party's governing Central Committee was expected
tp prescribe tighter government controls over the economy and fewer
market-oriented reforms. That could mean the revival of the primacy
of central planning, restoration of the leadership of party members
in factories and a limit in the growth of collective and private
enterprise.
   The Beijing Daily commentary said people should realize that
problems that have built up in past years ``cannot possibly be
resolved at once.''
   It said the serious shortage of funds and raw materials
afflicting the economy result in part from the recent ``turmoil and
counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' officialspeak for the crushed
pro-democracy movement.
   The commentary complained that many local officials only pay lip
service to the nation's austerity drive and ``at the decisive
moment ... think of themselves and forget the interest of the
country.''
   It noted that China's impoverished multitudes live in a backward
economy afflicted with a shortage of resources. In the early 1990s,
China will also enter a peak repayment period for its more than $40
billion in foreign debt.
   China inaugurated its austerity program a year ago, severely
restricting credit, canceling building projects and cutting
government spending to slow excessive economic growth and reduce an
inflation rate of more than 30 percent.
   The program has succeeded in cooling down the economy and
inflation, but it has also caused nationwide hardships for
enterprises lacking funds.
   It has also effectively stopped the price reforms and other
structural changes Western economists say are crucial to China's
economic development.
   Last year, about one-third of China's urban residents said their
living standards had declined because of rising prices. Large parts
of the countryside are still without electricity and millions are
too poor to send their hildren to school, or see no economic
incentives in doing so.
   In Hong Kong, the U.S. ambassador to China today expressed
optimism about long-term prospects for the Chinese economy but
noted that development efforts could easily derail.
   Ambassador James Lilley also said the harsh political rhetoric
from Beijing since the crackdown on the spring pro-democracy
movement has been ``a marked step backward'' for efforts to reform
the economy.
   In June, China's leaders sent troops to clear Beijing of
pro-democracy protesters and soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians.

   Former President Nixon is urging the United
States to restore its relations with China, despite Beijing's
military crackdown on pro-democracy forces, but the White House
says it isn't ready to make dramatic changes.
   ``The issue that would change our position are changes and
actions in China,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Monday after announcing that President Bush had met with Nixon
for two hours Sunday. Nixon recently returned from China.
   The administration's approach to China includes suspension of
all high-level official contacts.
   Asked if Bush and Nixon disagreed over strategy toward China,
Fitzwater said, ``I wouldn't want to suggest agreement or
disagreement or suggest anything of the kind. Simply, we just
aren't willing to describe the former president's remarks.''
   Fitzwater also revealed that Bush had summoned officials from
the CIA, State Department and National Security Council to CaMP
David on Saturday for the first in a series of meetings for his
summit in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Fraud Reports Prompt Cut-Off of Route Used By Thousands of Soviet
Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, citing reports of
fraudulent Soviet exit permits, has restricted access to a European
route used by tens of thousands of Soviet Jews to come to the
United States.
   A pattern of fraud emerged last month, apparently involving some
individuals in the Soviet agency that issues the permits, officials
said Monday.
   Permits had to be dated before Oct. 1 for Soviet Jews to obtain
U.S. visas in Rome or Vienna, and the applicants had to also have
Israeli visas. Otherwise, prospective emigrants are processed
through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   The new restriction required emigrants to obtain their Israeli
visas by Monday. As a result, Soviet Jews may remain at home rather
than waiting in Rome or Vienna until their entry to the United
States is approved.
   Jews who leave the Soviet Union after Monday on Israeli visas
will be presumed to have chosen to emigrate to Israel, U.S.
officials said.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Repeal Part of Immigration Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is being urged to repeal part of the
1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that a report says causes
widespread discrimination against Hispanics.
   A report issued Monday, the third anniversary of the law, said
the section of the law providing for fines against employers causes
discrimination.
   The law granted legal immigration to workers who had been in the
United States since 1982. It also set out guidelines for hiring and
provided sanctions for employers who failed to verify that all
newly employed workers had proper documentation.
   The report was issued by the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The report said 16 percent of the 3.3 million American employers
aware of the law increased or began discriminatory policies by
asking only ``foreign-looking'' or ``foreign-sounding'' job
applicants to present work authorization documents.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 10 people in the southern
province of Guizhou and accused them of trying to overthrow the
Communist Party, an official newspaper said today.
   The Legal Daily said the 10 were members of ``an organized,
planned and programmed counterrevolutionary group'' called ``The
China Three People's Principles Liberation Party.
   The three principles of nationalism, democracy and the people's
livelihood were put forward by Sun Yatsen, who is viewed as the
father of modern China. They are still espoused by the rival
Nationalist government on Taiwan.
   The short report did not provide details of how the group
allegedly planned to overthrow the party or when the arrests were
made.
   It also did not say if the arrests had any connection with the
pro-democracy demonstrations of last spring, which the government
has branded as a counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   It said the leader of the 10, Li Xingfu, was an ex-criminal but
gave no details.
   Last week, the semi-official China News Service reported that
police in the Sichuan city of Chongqing broke up a
``counterrevolutionary clique'' called the ``Chongqing Patriotic
and Democratic Alliance'' and arrested four members.
   That report said the Chongqing group participated in the spring
demonstrations. It said that after the June 4 military crackdown in
Beijing, the group held secret meetings, planned the organization
of underground armed forces, and tried to steal guns.

<HEAD>Bette Davis' Cut Daughters Out of Will</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `Hyman wrote ...' to CHANGE to `her' three husbands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actress Bette Davis left most of her nearly $1
million estate to her son and a close friend but nothing to her
daughters _ one of whom wrote about being raised by a ``hateful
mother.''
   Also left out of the will were Davis' two grandsons.
   The 10-page will was filed Monday for probate in Manhattan.
   ``I declare that I have intentionally and with full knowledge
omitted to provide herein for my daughter, Margot, and my daughter,
Barbara, and-or my grandsons, Ashley Hyman and Justin Hyman,''
Davis said in the will dated Sept. 2, 1987.
   Davis, who died of cancer at age 81 on Oct. 6, had been
estranged from her daughter, Barbara Davis Hyman of
Charlottesville, Va., since Hyman's 1985 book, ``My Mother's
Keeper.''
   Hyman wrote that Davis had been ``an abusive, domineering and
hateful mother,'' and ``a grotesque alcoholic'' largely responsible
for her own mistreatment by some of her three husbands.
   Davis replied in a 1987 book, ``This 'n' That,'' that she had
been victimized by a ``lying and ungrateful child.'' She also
admitted she was ``pained'' by the estrangement.
   Hyman's two sons, Ashley and Justin, also received no bequest.
The actress' lawyer, Harold Schiff, explained: ``Unfortunately,
their mother chose to have them follow her rather than their
hearts.''
   ``Down the road they'll be sorry,'' Schiff said. ``Twenty years
from now they'll say, `That was our grandmother; why didn't we know
her.'''
   Manhattan Surrogate Court Judge Renee Roth directed Hyman to
notify the court by Dec. 5 if she plans to contest the will.
   Davis' adopted daughter, Margot Mosher Merrill of Geneva, N.Y.,
was diagnosed as mentally retarded at age 3 and has been in special
schools and institutions since.
   The will did not specify how Margot Merrill would be provided
for, or how she has been supported in the past.
   Davis' adopted son, Michael Woodman Merrill of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., receives about half the $600,000 to $1 million estate. His
wife, Shu Shu, was left clothing.
   Michael and Margot Merrill were adopted when Davis was married
to actor Gary Merrill.
   Kathryn Sermack, a friend and secretary who lived with Davis in
her Los Angeles-area apartment, also gets about half the estate.
Sermack also was left cookbooks and recipes, a gold charm bracelet,
other jewelry, a desk, furiture and silverware with the initials
``BD.''
   Robin Brown of Westport, Conn., described by Schiff as ``an old,
old, old, friend'' of Davis' from their childhood in Massachusetts,
was bequeathed a painting entitled, ``A Red Barn,'' a photo
portrait of Davis, and a pearl and sapphire watch.
   Faye Forbes of Peoria, Ariz., daughter of Davis' sister, Barbara
Davis Berry, was left six silver condiment holders.
   Davis died of cancer at Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, where she was
being treated for cancer. Schiff said she had undergone a
mastectomy in 1983 and had a stroke a few years later.
   Davis was buried at her family's plot at Forest Lawn in
Glendale, Calif.
   Schiff asked in an affidavit that the court accept the will for
probate here because he was her lawyer, business manager and friend
for 27 years and his offices are here. He noted, too, that all of
her tax returns and those of her production company were prepared
by accountants here. He said the only asset in California is a
condominium apartment.

   A wall mural of the late guitarist Jimi
Hendrix at a high school won't be whitewashed despite a petition by
some students who object to the rock star's drug lifestyle.
   ``I hesitate to accept that Jimi Hendrix's life and work can or
should be condensed into, `He is a symbol of drug abuse,'''
Ridgefield High School Principal Elaine Bessette said Monday.
   Jonathan Fulkerson, the student who started the petition drive,
said he was disappointed with the decision but added that more
students wanted the mural than didn't. He had said it was
hypocritical to display a symbol of the drug culture in school, and
collected nearly 100 signatures.
   The rock guitarist died in 1970 at the age of 27, when he
reportedly suffocated after swallowing a large quantity of
barbiturates. The petition drive prompted the estate of Jimi
Hendrix to issue an open letter defending the rock star as an
artist.

   Omi has been a trainer for 21 months, the official said.

<TEXT>
   A year after his failed presidential bid, Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis said the legacy of his campaign may have been to
teach a potent lesson to fellow Democrats: attack.
   ``You had better be ready to attack,'' Dukakis said. ``You may
not like it, and the public may not like it, but the alternative is
to watch yourself be trashed and be defeated.''
   Where Democrats face tough election battles, particularly in
today's New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial and New York City's
mayoral contests, the governor said those candidates have been
aware of the danger in ignoring attacks.
   ``If there's one contribution I've made to the three races, it's
at least to give the three Democrats a sense of what not to do,
what the danger is,'' Dukakis said Monday. ``And I think the three
of them were very much aware of that from the beginning, having
been forewarned by what happened in the presidential race.''
   Rep. James J. Florio, a Democrat, is running against Republican
Rep. Jim Courter in New Jersey, and Democratic Lt. Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder opposes Marshall Coleman, a Republican, in Virginia. In New
York, David N. Dinkins, a Democrat, is running against Rudolph W.
Guiliani. Polls show all three Democrats lead their opponents.
   Dukakis said he could redo his presidential campaign, he would
have struck hard at George Bush.
   But, Dukakis said, he held back because he had won the
Democratic nomination without resorting to such tactics.
   ``I felt, however mistakenly, that that was really something the
people wanted, that they had had enough negativism for eight years,
enough polarization,'' he said.

   A needle exchange program intended to
protect drug addicts from AIDS _ once planned as the first in the
nation _ has begun after nearly 1{ years of delays caused by
problems getting insurance.
   Outside-In, a nonprofit agency, started giving addicts clean
hypodermic needles in exchange for their dirty ones Nov. 1, said
Kathy Oliver, the agency's administrator.
   The 400 addicts expected to use the service also will be offered
bleach to sterilize their own needles, drug-purifying cookers and
condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, Ms. Oliver said. The virus
is transmitted through blood and semen.
   The program was to begin in June 1988 but was delayed until the
agency found liability insurance it could afford, Ms. Oliver said.
Since then, other cities have started needle exchanges.
   The agency delayed announcement of the program's start to shield
addicts from the news media, she said.

   Friends and family of the late Diana Vreeland,
Vogue editor and curator of the Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, shared memories of her wit and
originality.
   Photographers' strobes illuminated former first lady Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, actress Lauren Bacall, and fashion designers Mary
McFadden, Issey Miyake and Diane von Furstenberg, among others, on
their way in to Monday's memorial service at the museum.
   Photographer Richard Avedon said he remembered how at age 22 he
was intimidated by Vreeland, who for 25 years was fashion editor of
Harper's Bazaar before becoming editor in chief of Vogue.
   She ``accidentally'' stuck a model with a pin, and called Avedon
``Aberdeen,'' the photographer said. When the photo session was
done, Avedon said ```I can't work with that woman.'
   ``But we worked together for another 40 years,'' he said.
   Another eulogist, George Plimpton, who helped Vreeland write her
memoirs, ``D.V.,'' said, ``She liked that title. That's how the
popes sign their papal bulls: deus vobiscum.''
   Vreeland herself once said, ``I know what they'll be wearing
before they wear it. I know what they'll be eating before they eat
it. And I know where they're going before it's there.''
   Predictably, prominent colors on the backs of the fashionable
attenders at the service were the always-correct black and
Vreeland's favorite, red.
   Vreeland died in August in her late 80s.

   About 200 supporters of Ferdinand
Marcos spit on an American flag today and burned it in front of the
U.S. Embassy to demand that their late leader's body be returned
from Hawaii.
   Marcos backers also held Roman Catholic Masses marking the 40th
day since the former president died. Filipino Catholics
traditionally hold memorial services 40 days after someone's death.
   Marcos died Sept. 28 at age 27 in Hawaii, where he lived in
exile since he was ousted in a popular uprising three years ago.
   His successor, Corazon Aquino, refused to allow his body to be
buried in the Philippines, saying its return could lead to violence.
   During today's noisy demonstration, protesters carried placards
claiming the Americans ``kidnapped'' Marcos in 1986 and demanding
that his body be returned ``or else all Filipinos will curse the
Americans forever.''
   Other banners denounced Mrs. Aquino as a ``puppet of U.S.
imperialists.''
   Protesters then stomped and spit on a U.S. flag, burned it with
cigarette butts and set it afire while chanting ``Marcos once
more!''
   Several police officers stood by but did not interfere.
   On Friday, about 25,000 Marcos loyalists marched in Manila to
demand that Mrs. Aquino lift the ban on returning the former
president's body and to denounce her government.
   Police later used water cannons and clubs to disperse a few
thousand of the Marcos loyalists after an all-night vigil in front
of the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary.

   A judge sentenced a woman who
fatally shot her lesbian lover to the minimum prison term, saying
he sympathized with her claim she acted in self-defense after years
of beatings.
   Annette Green _ whose defense centered on the unusual use of the
``battered wife'' syndrome in a relationship between two women _
was sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison for second-degree murder.
   ``Your background has been unusual,'' Circuit Judge Tom Waddell
said before imposing the minimum sentence allowed. ``I want you to
understand that I'm not angry with you.''
   The 30-year-old defendant and others at the trial testified she
suffered frequent severe beatings at the hands of Ivonne Julio, her
lover and roommate for 11 years. She shot Ms. Julio, 32, in the
face during an argument after a Halloween party in 1988.
   Assistant State Attorney Bob Johnson, who recommended a sentence
of 22 years, found the punishment inadequate, saying with parole
Ms. Green would ``probably get out in three'' years.
   ``I don't think that's appropriate for someone who killed
somebody,'' Johnson said.

<HEAD>Politburo Retires Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15-member Politburo retired
Prime Minister Fikre Selassie Wogderess today, saying he was ill
and no longer could carry out his responsibilities, state radio
reported.
   Fikre Selassie, about 48, was the second ranking Politburo
member and the second most powerful person in the Marxist
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government.
   The broadcast said Fikre Selassie, a former air force officer,
had been undergoing medical treatment for some time for an
undisclosed illness and was retired after no improvement in his
condition was noted.
   State radio did not name Fikre Selassie's successor, but
informed sources said Hailu Yimenu, a Politburo member and a deputy
prime minister, had been appointed acting prime minister.
   The prime minister's office oversees the nation's administrative
machinery.
   Fikre Selassi was one of a clique of officers who staged the
1974 coup that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and led to
Mengistu's assumption of power.
   He had served as prime minister since the formation of
Ethiopia's Parliament, the Shengo, in 1987, and before that was one
of three senior ministers in Mengistu's government.
   Observers said he and Mengistu differed over economic policy
with Fikre Selassie reportedly supporting greater liberalization of
the private sector.
   Hailu, his possible successor, is about 50 years old and has
served as a deputy prime minister since 1987. He also has run
several ministries including industry and mines and energy.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Inspections of Some Newer 737s, Older 747s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
inspections of newer Boeing 737s for possible missing bolts in a
doorframe and of older 747s for possible cracks.
   The FAA said both problems could lead to rapid decompression of
the planes.
   The FAA ordered the inspections in separate directives issued
late last week. In the case of the 737s, it ordered operators to
fly the planes at lower than normal altitudes and lower cabin
pressurizations until they could be inspected.
   The FAA said some bolts may be missing from the forward
passenger doorstop in model 300 and model 400 737s.
   The 737 directive, issued Friday, affects 18 of the last 20
737-300s and -400s built, said Boeing Commercial Airplanes
spokesman Jack Gamble. So far, Gamble said, no planes have been
found to have missing bolts.
   The inspections must be performed within 20 flights of receipt
of the directive and the problem fixed as soon as detected.
   Boeing 737s are twin-engine jetliners, with the model 300
carrying 141 passengers and the model 400 156 passengers.
   Gamble said officials at Boeing's Wichita, Kan., plant, which
assembles fuselage sections of 737s, discovered when looking at
paperwork for the planes that it was possible one of the two bolts
could have been omitted. He said Boeing notified the FAA of that
possibility on Thursday.
   ``It's one of those precautionary things you want to do,'' he
said.
   Six of the planes were delivered to U.S. carriers and no bolts
were missing on those planes, Gamble said. Twelve went to either
foreign airlines or leasing companies, and not all have reported in.
   The Machinists union is on strike against Boeing at Wichita and
other plants, but Gamble said all the construction work on the
affected airplanes had been completed before the strike began Oct.
4. ``There's no reason to believe the strike had anything to do
with it,'' he said.
   The 747 order was prompted by an operator finding small skin
cracks in the general area ahead and above the forward passenger
door on a plane with 18,455 landings, said Boeing spokeswoan Liz
Reese.
   The FAA has ordered visual and electronic inspections for the
cracks on all 747s with 15,500 landings or more that have not had
special modifications. The FAA making the inspections mandatory
Thursday.
   Reese said the order affects as many as 92 older 747s. She said
cracks have been found in some of those jets, but she did not have
any numbers Monday night.

<HEAD>Dissident Lieutenant Forms Union For Police and Prison Officers</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SAHM VENTER</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police lieutenant who
publicly accused riot squad members of brutality has expanded his
crusade against the security establishment by forming a union for
police and prison guards.
   Although Lt. Gregory Rockman's superiors have ordered him not to
speak to the press, Rockman invited journalists to a meeting Monday
night at which the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union was
launched. Government regulations prohibit security force members
from belonging to unions.
   Police officials have confirmed that Rockman is the subject of a
departmental inquiry and could face disciplinary action for
violating orders.
   In addition to making unauthorized public statements, he has
acknowledged refusing to accept an order to report for border duty,
far from his home town of Mitchell's Plain, near Cape Town.
   ``I will be very prominent for the next 10 years,'' Rockman said
Monday night. ``If they want me out of the police department, they
should kick me out.''
   Rockman said seven policemen and 21 prison employees already had
joined the new union, formed after he was approached by disgruntled
guards. Like Rockman, the other members are mixed-race, although he
said the union was open to whites and blacks.
   He said the members had previously raised complaints about
working conditions through normal channels and were dissatisfied
with the response.
   Rockman came to prominence in September when he accused members
of an all-white police riot squad of behaving like ``wild dogs''
when they dispersed and beat protesters and bystanders in
Mitchell's Plain during a demonstration against the exclusion of
blacks from national elections.
   Two white officers were charged with assault in connection with
the incident. They were acquitted last month, but the judge
criticized the behavior of some of the officers in the riot squad.
   Rockman said the new union would seek to ensure that security
officers were not exposed to racial discrimination and were able to
speak freely. Some prison gaurds had complained that they were
housed in unused cells, he said.
   Rockman also said the union would campaign against maltreatment
of prisoners. He said some children as young as 10 sometimes are
kept in prison for months while awaiting trial for crimes such as
housebreaking.
   Since entering the media spotlight, Rockman has written a book,
``Rockman: One Man's Crusade Against Apartheid Police,'' which is
to be published at the end of the month.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower in Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with delayed gold fixing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar eased in early European trading today
on a lack of financial news, reported intervention by the Bank of
Japan and Monday's drop on Wall Street, currency dealers said.
   Gold prices rose in Zurich.
   Dealers said there continues to be little market-affecting news,
other than Monday's 47.34-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   ``The market is essentially stable,'' said one trader in Rome.
   ``There are no signs of a resumption of any movement'' in the
main currencies, he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.18 yen to a closing 143.63 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.45 yen.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold dollars for yen during the
East Asian day when the dollar approached the psychologically
important 144.00-yen barrier. Traders said the move limited the
dollar's upward potential, but did not raise fears of another round
of concerted central bank intervention.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.8460 West German marks, down from 1.8517
   _1.6205 Swiss francs, down from 1.6240
   _6.2610 French francs, down from 6.2805
   _2.0837 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910
   _1,350.40 Italian lire, down from 1,357.25
   _1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5813 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5795 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $381.10 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $380.25. At late morning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.20, up from $380.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid $381.57.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.28 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $5.25.

<HEAD>Witnesses: Confusion over Navigation, Lights Led to Grounding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Confusion over navigation equipment and warning
lights led to the grounding of a Yugoslavian freighter on a fragile
coral reef, witnesses told a Coast Guard inquiry.
   Also Monday, the federal government filed a civil lawsuit
seeking $9 million in damages for destruction of the 500-foot swath
of reef in the Dry Tortugas, about 65 miles west of Key West.
   The suit blames the grounding on the ship's ``unseaworthiness
and the negligence of those in charge.'' The damage amount
represents the value of the seized ship and cargo, as well as the
reef damage, the U.S. attorney's office said.
   The ship's captain testified at the opening of the hearing
Monday that his second officer, who was in charge at the time of
the grounding Oct. 30, became confused while making a minor course
change.
   The move sent the phosphate hauler west into a charted shoal
instead of east into Rebecca Channel between the Dry Tortugas and
Key West, ship's captain Zdravko Beran testified. A depth finder on
board was turned off at the time.
   ``I think that he was confused. I think that he must go port,
and he went starboard,'' the captain, a merchant seaman for 30
years, said in broken English. ``He told me that he did wrong _ big
error.''
   The freighter, carrying 14,300 tons of phosphate and 143,000
gallons of fuel, was refloated without damage Thursday and
impounded by the government.
   Marine Patrol officer Gorden Sharp testified that Second Officer
Zvonko Baric told him he had mistaken a warning light for a channel
light and had hit the reef at 12 knots without slowing down.
   Beran also said he was using one large chart covering an area
from the Mississippi River to the Florida Keys because a strike had
held up delivery of more detailed charts.

<HEAD>Abuse Charges Dropped Against Mother of Cocaine-Addicted Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child-abuse charges against the
mother of a baby born addicted to cocaine have been dismissed by a
judge who ruled the fetus is not a child.
   The judge threw out the charges Monday against 23-year-old
Cassandra Gethers, who was arrested in February after she and her
daughter were found to be addicted.
   She had given birth to a cocaine-addicted son a year before her
daughter was born and received counseling at the time on the
dangers of using the drug while pregnant.
   In dismissing the charges, Circuit Judge Robert B. Carney cited
an appeals court ruling in the case of a man who was charged with
battery against an infant after he shot a woman in the abdomen and
she gave birth to a wounded baby.
   The court ruled the fetus was not a person.
   ``That issue has been decided,'' Carney said.
   Dennis Bailey, an assistant state attorney, said he will appeal.
   Ms. Gethers remains in jail, serving an 18-month sentence for
violating probation on a conviction for possession of cocaine.
   Carney's ruling means the state cannot ``legislate morality
prior to birth,'' said Ms. Gethers' attorney, Russell Adler.

<HEAD>New Approaches Needed to Calm Fears Over Japanese Investment, Expert
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors should adopt new, cooperative
alliances with U.S. firms to ease fears they are ``buying up
America'' and help revitalize the U.S. manufacturing sector, a U.S.
businessman said today.
   Peter G. Peterson, former U.S. secretary of commerce and the
chairman of The Blackstone Group of New York, called on Japanese
investors to participate in a ``global, private-sector Marshall
Plan'' to help the U.S. manufacturing sector.
   The Marshall Plan was the financial aid program drafted in 1947
by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall to help rebuild
war-ravaged Western Europe.
   ``The United States desperately needs investment and Japan has
immense capital. The question is, how can it be done so that it's
both economically and politically productive?'' Peterson told
reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
   He defended Japanese direct investments in the United States,
such as Mitsubishi Estate's recent purchase of a stake in
Rockefeller Center and Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion buyout of Columbia
Pictures, which The Blackstone Group helped put together.
   Given huge U.S. trade and federal deficits and the need to
service the almost $1 trillion U.S. foreign debt, ``we need a
voracious amount of foreign financing,'' Peterson said, arguing
against curbs on further investments.
   Peterson said Japan should do more to ease American fears about
the so-called ``buying up of America'' by going all out to open its
own markets to foreign investment and trade and by avoiding
excessive concentration of acquisitions in such areas as Hawaii.
   ``The fears of Americans are real,'' he said.
   ``In every Japanese acquisition of a New York skyscraper or a
Waikiki hotel, some see an inevitable pattern of Japanese
ascendancy and American decline,'' he said.
   Japanese and U.S. firms should form joint ventures and minority
investment arrangements that enable both sides to exchange
technology, market access and distribution facilities, while
avoiding the political problems and managerial pitfalls of
speculative acquisitions, he said.
   Japanese companies and the government could do more to help ease
trade frictions, he said.
   ``If the Japanese companies are not more creative and flexible
in permitting foreign companies to participate directly in this
market, ... I think it will have a serious backlash effect,''
Peterson said.

<TEXT>
   Amanda Blake, saloonkeeper Miss Kitty
on television's ``Gunsmoke,'' died of AIDS-related complications,
not cancer as a hospital and friends had reported, her doctor says.
   Dr. Lou Nishimura, a Sacramento internist, said Monday that Miss
Blake, who died at age 60 on Aug. 16, had throat cancer. But he
added, ``That wasn't the reason that she died.''
   Miss Blake, a longtime resident of the Sacramento area, had AIDS
symptoms for about a year, Nishimura said.
   He said he didn't know how she contracted the disease.
   Miss Blake's fifth husband, Mark Spaeth, a developer and city
councilman in Austin, Texas, died of pneumonia in 1985 at age 45.
They married in April 1984, and divorced a short time later.
   Nishimura was interviewed following a report on Sacramento TV
station KRBK that quoted friends of Miss Blake as saying her death
was AIDS-related.
   After Miss Blake died at Mercy General Hospital, a statement by
the hospital and her friends reported the cause of death as cancer.
   Miss Blake's death certificate, however, listed the immediate
cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest due to liver failure and
CMV hepatitis. CMV, or cytomegalo virus, hepatitis is AIDS-related,
said Nishimura, who treated Miss Blake in her last year and signed
her death certificate.
   Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer were listed on the
certificate as contributing causes of death.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system.
It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   Once a two-pack-a-day smoker, Miss Blake underwent surgery for
oral cancer in 1977 and afterward made appearances on behalf of the
American Cancer Society.
   Jerri Ewen, a Mercy General spokeswoman, said she previously
reported cancer as the cause of death at the request of Miss
Blake's close friends. ``When somebody dies, you go by what the
wishes of the family are. In this case, the friends were the
family,'' Ewen said.
   ``They have the right to say whatever they want to say.''
   Ewen said she never saw the death certificate.
   She said the hospital reported the death to the federal Centers
for Disease Control, which monitors AIDS and other contagious
diseases.
   Miss Blake reigned as Miss Kitty, queen of Dodge City's Long
Branch Saloon, for 19 years in ``Gunsmoke.'' Set in the lawless
cattle town of Dodge City, Kan., in the late 1800s, ``Gunsmoke''
was one of television's original ``adult westerns'' in the
mid-1950s.
   Miss Blake left ``Gunsmoke'' in 1974. CBS canceled the show one
season later.
   After ``Gunsmoke,'' Miss Blake worked only sporadically, usually
in guest appearances for TV game shows, movies of the week and such
series as ``Edge of Night,'' ``Hart to Hart,'' and ``Love Boat.''
   She also was a longtime activist for animal protection.

<TEXT>
   Thai fishermen have rescued three
dozen people caught in a typhoon that ravaged the Gulf of Thailand
and the mainland four days ago and have discovered more bodies, the
navy said today.
   It was unclear whether any of the dead or rescued were from a
U.S.-owned drilling ship that capsized Saturday with 97 crewmen
aboard after being caught in the typhoon. Six crewmen have been
rescued and seven bodies found.
   According to press reports, some 400 Thai fishermen were
missing. The navy report said at least 63 fishing boats sank in the
storm and another nine were missing. The government death toll on
land was 31, but one local official put the number at more than 70.
   A navy ship found 17 bodies in the sea since beginning a search
in the gulf east of Songkhla late Monday, navy spokesman Capt.
Suravut Maharom said. Another 30 were found on an island in
Chumphon province.
   In addition, fisherman rescued 35 more people caught in Typhoon
Gay, the navy said. It did not give details.
   The search for 84 crewmen missing from the 5,373-ton Seacrest
continued today.
   The Seacrest capsized Saturday in the gulf during the worst
storm to hit Thailand in three decades.
   ``All I remember is the sound of swirling wind. The darkness,
the rain, the waves. And every now and then, the screams for
help,'' Chalit Duangpakdee, a Seacrest survivor, said in an
interview published by the English-language Bangkok Post today.
   The Thai kitchen worker said the ship was buffeted by huge waves
and an alarm went off to abandon ship. He grabbed a life jacket,
jumped into the sea with many other crew members and managed to
secure himself with rope inside a life raft.
   A foreign crew member who also climbed into the lifeboat but had
not tied himself down was swept away.
   After several hours, Chalit was picked up by a Thai fishing
boat, he told the newspaper.
   The ship's owner, Unocal, today identified two more of the dead:
Ed Seliger, the ship's West German captain, and Delvin Irby, an
American tool pusher from Mississippi.
   Eyewitnesses reportedly told Unocal that nearly all crew had
abandoned the ship after the alarm and signal to do so had been
given. But the captain and three others remained in the ship's
wheelhouse, Unocal said in a press release.
   A team of investigators from Los Angeles-based Unocal is
investigating why the ship failed to withstand the high winds and
seas and whether it was given adequate warning of the typhoon's
approach.
   The search for survivors was being carried out by the company
and the Thai navy, which has used divers to check the submerged
vessel.
   The crew was mostly Thai, but seven were Americans. None of the
known survivors are American.
   The Seacrest capsized in the gulf's Platong field, one of
several being exploited for natural gas by Unocal. It is 270 miles
south of Bangkok.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has cleared the way for logging
next year in some of the Northwest's oldest forests _ prime nesting
spots for the rare spotted owl.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer on Monday ruled that an
agreement reached by Congress that allows cutting of some of the
giant trees is constitutional, according to Vic Sher, lawyer for
the Sierra Club Legal Defense Club.
   The order turned back a challenge by environmentalists and
vacated an injunction against timber cutting on federal land in
Washington and Oregon and a Nov. 13 trial of the environmentalists'
lawsuit.
   ``I would hope we could start fairly quickly'' to auction timber
in 13 national forests affected by the lawsuit, said John
Butruille, the Northwest's regional forester for the U.S. Forest
Service.
   Congress' compromise also requires the Forest Service and Bureau
of Land Management to start protecting old growth trees, which are
at least 200 years old.
   Dwyer gave no explanation in his ruling, which upheld a section
of an appropriations bill passed by Congress and signed by
President Bush last month. The judge said an opinion will follow,
according to Sher.
   ``What took him so long?'' said Dennis Daughtery, president of
the Contract Loggers Association.
   The disputed trees ``probably should have been hewed down over
100 years ago ... they're just taking up good growing room in the
forests,'' Daughtery said.
   ``Obviously, we're really pleased,'' said Forest Service Chief
F. Dale Robertson. ``We're glad to see the court say we can
continue.''
   Plainiffs contended Congress acted unconstitutionally in
creating the one-year compromise crafted to satisfy the timber
industry and the advocates for the owl, which nests primarily in
the old growth forests of the Northwest.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering whether to
list the owl on the endangered species list.
   ``It's a disappointing ruling for us,'' Sher said. ``But our
quarrel is not with Judge Dwyer or the federal court, it's with
Congress which has put federal agencies above the law and stripped
the courts of their ability to enforce the law.''
   The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, representing The Audubon
Society, the Oregon Natural Resources Council and other
environmental groups, had asked Dwyer to proceed with a trial. The
lawsuit contended that logging on federal land in the Northwest in
spotted owl habitat would violate federal environmental laws.
   In March, Dwyer blocked timber sales in Washington and Oregon in
owl-sensitive areas. The blocked sales total more than 1 billion
board feet.
   Last May, Dwyer signed an order putting the lawsuit on hold.
Congress then stepped in.
   Sher said the plaintiffs haven't decided whether to appeal
Monday's decision.
   ``It's hard to say what the next step will be until we see the
judge's reasoning, and we see how the Forest Service proceeds with
implementing the new legislation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Convicted Drug Dealer Says He Gave DC Mayor Crack Cocaine</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 11th graf, Lewis' statement, to CORRECT charges to two
counts of conspiracy, rather than two counts of possession and distribution.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted drug dealer's sworn testimony that
he gave crack cocaine to Mayor Marion Barry several times is
reviving questions about whether the mayor uses drugs.
   Charles Lewis, 49, testified under oath in U.S. District Court
on Monday that he gave Barry cocaine at least three times while
Barry visited Lewis' room at a downtown Washington hotel late last
year.
   Despite many press accounts of investigations against the mayor,
Lewis' statement was the first on-the-record, under-oath accusation
that Barry, the city's mayor since 1979, had been given drugs.
   ``I'm not worried at all about this,'' Barry, who has repeatedly
denied ever using drugs, told reporters Monday. He described Lewis
as a ``convicted felon'' and added, ``He'll say anything in court
... trying to save his own hide.''
   The federal investigation began in December when city police
called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis on
discovering that the mayor was in Lewis' hotel room.
   Barry, who has described Lewis as an old friend, acknowledged
making at least six visits to Lewis' hotel during that period. But
the mayor has steadfastly denied using, seeing or purchasing drugs
during those trips.
   The mayor's attorney, Kenneth Mundy, scoffed at the defendant's
comments.
   ``We question the credibility of the source,'' Mundy said.
``Charles Lewis is a besieged and beleaguered man who knows that
his only salvation comes by not giving truthful statements about
the mayor.''
   Rumors about Barry's alleged use of drugs have persisted for
years. In 1984, Karen Johnson, a convicted drug dealer, went to
prison on contempt of court charges after refusing to tell federal
prosecutors whether she used cocaine with Barry or sold drugs to
him and other top city officials.
   Barry, who is married, admitted to having had an unspecified
``personal relationship'' with Johnson, but denied ever using drugs
with her.
   Lewis' statement came as Judge Stanley Sporkin was reviewing a
plea bargain calling for Lewis to plead guilty to two counts of
conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.
   The second count centered on Lewis' activities at the hotel last
December, and made reference to Lewis distributing cocaine to one
individual on at least three separate occasions.
   ``Because I don't want to look like a fool, was one of the
individuals you gave cocaine to the mayor of this city?'' Sporkin
asked Lewis.
   As the defendant was preparing to answer, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Judith Retchin asked to discuss the matter privately with
the judge.
   During the bench conference, Sporkin was overheard to say, ``I
don't think it fair that we read all this in the newspaper,''
apparently in reference to press leaks about the case. ``He's under
oath and should answer.''
   Sporkin then overruled the prosecutor's objections to the
question and ordered Lewis to answer.
   After hearing the query repeated by the court stenographer,
Lewis replied, ``Yes, your honor, crack cocaine.''
   When Sporkin reminded Lewis that he was under oath and asked him
whether he was telling the truth, Lewis replied, ``No question
about it, sir.''
   Sporkin then accepted the plea agreement and the two guilty
pleas under it. Sentencing was set for Jan. 8.
   Lewis faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1
million fine for each count. Lewis had originally faced a 14-count
indictment that included perjury charges and additional counts of
cocaine distribution and possession, but prosecutors dropped 12 of
those counts.
   Lewis was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in the
Virgin Islands earlier this year. His sentencing in that case was
postponed indefinitely Monday as part of the plea bargain.
   After the court proceeding, Lewis' attorney Alan B. Soschin
predicted that Lewis will serve between 10 and 12 months in jail,
the minimum called for under the rules governing the plea bargain.
   As part of the agreement, Lewis is bound to cooperate with
prosecutors in the District of Columbia drug investigation.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens refused to comment on the case, or
whether Barry is now a target of the investigation. Barry has
testified twice before the grand jury hearing evidence on the Lewis
case.
   Lewis, a former District of Columbia government official, had
been a consultant to the Virgin Islands government. He said he was
staying in the Washington hotel while looking for work.

<HEAD>Government Postpones $40 Billion in Debt Auctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department announced today it has
postponed $40 billion in borrowing auctions this week because of
congressional failure to raise the debt limit.
   ``The postponement of these auctions is necessary because
Congress has not completed action on legislation to increase the
statutory debt limit ...,'' the Treasury said.
   The department lost its borrowing authority Oct. 31 when the
debt limit fell from $2.87 trillion to $2.8 trillion, a level the
Treasury already has reached.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said after closed-door
meetings on Monday that leaders are hoping to pass a new debt
ceiling in time for President Bush to sign it on Wednesday.
   The Treasury had planned to auction $10 billion in three-year
notes today, $10 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10
billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. In addition it planned to
sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Police today arrested about 20 Tibetan
women who demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy to demand
independence for their homeland from Chinese rule.
   Officers outside the embassy struggled briefly with the women as
they tried to get into the building. ``We want independence!'' the
protesters shouted.
   The demonstrators, many of them weeping, were lifted by police
and carried to a waiting van. They were freed a short while later,
police said.
   Tibetan refugees in India regularly hold rallies outside the
Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and present memorandums demanding
freedom for their homeland.
   The rally today was the first by a Tibetan group in New Delhi
since Tibetans' spiritual and political leader, the Dalai Lama, won
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize on Oct. 5.
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the 1951 Chinese annexation.
   Most Tibetan refugees who have regularly streamed into India
since then live in the northern town of Dharmsala in the Himalayan
foothills and in New Delhi. The Dalai Lama has set up a
government-in-exile in Dharmsala, 250 miles north of New Delhi.
   China says it has ruled Tibet for more than seven centuries, but
many Tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that
time and ruled by a Buddhist theocracy.

<TEXT>
   Maude Plymale Barber went to her grave
not knowing that one son was dead and the other in jail, charged
with killing his brother in a fight over how the cancer-stricken
woman should spend her final days.
   ``I don't know of anyone being cruel enough to tell her,'' her
brother, J. Fred Plymale, said after Monday's funeral.
   Mrs. Barber was buried Monday, the day her son Larry appeared at
a bail hearing in the Oct. 25 shotgun slaying. Charles Barber, 51,
was slain in an argument with his brother in the laundry room over
the care of their 86-year-old mother, who died Friday and had
lapsed in and out of consciousness for days, police said.
   Larry Barber, 53, did not attend the funeral but was allowed a
few moments alone with her body before he was taken in shackles to
a courtroom, where he told Judge Alfred Ferguson he helped make his
mother's last days comfortable.
   ``Mother paid all the bills and I took care of the house,'' he
said.
   Plymale told a reporter that Larry Barber, who lived with his
mother, was insensitive to her and the family.
   ``He was a liar ... and a smoker and a drunkard,'' Plymale said.
``He used to brag that he'd sit on the back porch and shoot
squirrels and eat them.''
   Charles Barber was shot as he prepared to pack his bags to
return home to Las Vegas. He had come to Huntington in early
October to help his mother but decided to leave after two weeks of
arguing with his brother, authorities said.
   Ferguson said he will decide by Wednesday whether to allow bail
for Larry Barber, who told the judge he had a drinking problem he
tried to control but often ``sat and nipped'' in front of the
television.
   Larry Barber also said he had been arrested several times for
public intoxication and once spent a night in jail for hitting a
police officer.
   ``And of course my ex-wife was always sending me to jail,'' he
told the judge.

<TEXT>
   At least 5,000 people today spurned official Red
Square ceremonies to commemorate the Bolshevik Revolution and
marched through Moscow to protest food shortages, pollution,
Communist rule and the secret police.
   In Moldavia, activists said police beat protesters who forced
cancellation of the military part of the republic's parade.
Striking miners in the Soviet Arctic joined a celebration with
slogans urging the government to allow greater independence and
improve living and working conditions.
   The unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital as
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership stood atop
the Lenin Mausoleum and reviewed the traditional display of
military hardware.
   The official tolerance of a counter-demonstration on the
hallowed national holiday showed how far the Soviet Union has come
from the authoritarian rule of Gorbachev's predecessors.
   So did the toned-down nature of the Red Square celebrations
marking the 72nd anniversary of the revolution that brought the
Communists to power in Russia. Not as much emphasis was placed on
military might as in previous years.
   ``We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing having
changed for the better, and this is our protest,'' said marcher
Taisya Shlyonova, a pensioner. The demonstrators represented a
broad spectrum of unofficial groups.
   ``We don't want the people to be sheep that can be led as they
have been led for 72 years,'' popular prosecutor Telman Gdlyan
said. ``Power must be taken away from the apparatus and given to
the people.''
   Leaders of the independent event steered their marchers away
from Red Square and a possible confrontation with authorities or
with the thousands of marchers at the official ceremonies.
   Responding to posters plastered around the city on the eve of
Revolution Day, activists assembled near the Dynamo Metro station
two hours before the start of official ceremonies.
   Their route took them to a fork with one street leading toward
Red Square, and some demonstrators initially headed that way.
However, leaders made appeals from a sound truck and steered them
instead to a route sanctioned by city officials.
   Organizers said they had been told by authorities they would not
be permitted to march through the square because they could not
guarantee the march would remain orderly.
   The marchers, many walking arm in arm, chanted slogans in
support of maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin and other reformist
members of the Congress of People's Deputies and shouted ``Down
with the KGB'' secret police.
   Some brandished posters scorning the 1917 Communist revolution
glorified at the official ceremonies.
   ``Seventy-two years on the road to nowhere,'' said one poster.
Others proclaimed, ``Down With Ligachev,'' a reference to Yegor
Ligachev, the hard-line Communist on the ruling Politburo who has
come to symbolize resistance to economic and social reform.
   The marchers represented a wide spectrum of interests, from
environmental groups protesting construction of a nuclear power
station to church groups demanding freedom of worship in the
officially atheist Communist state.
   Last year, such unofficial groups marched in some Soviet cities
on Revolution Day, but this was the first time they took to the
streets of Moscow on the holiday.
   In the southern republic of Moldavia, police beat people in a
crowd of thousands that gathered near a monument to national hero
King Stephen the Great, Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman for the Moldavian
People's Front organization said in a telephone call from Kishinev,
the republic's capital.
   More were beaten when police dispersed a crowd of a couple
hundred People's Front supporters on Lenin Prospekt a couple of
hours later, he said.
   Officials canceled the military part of the parade. Thousands of
People's Front supporters marched the parade route with slogans
condemning the police and the republic's leadership, Rozhgo said.
   In Red Square, the traditional parade of tanks, troops, and
banner-waving marchers selected by their workplaces passed through
on schedule.
   It was broadcast on state-run television, which made no
reference to the unofficial march.
   Gorbachev, acknowledging the country's troubles in an informal
television interview during the ceremonies, said abandonment of the
old system of central control without installing a new system has
resulted in ``a loss or weakening of control.''
   But to go back would be ``the greatest mistake,'' he said,
calling instead for faster movement toward a new economic order. He
gave few details, but progressives have recently criticized the
regime for half-measures that they say only make matters worse.
   Longtime observers said the official ceremonies this year were
considerably toned down from previous years, when the Kremlin
leadership used the parade to show off the Soviets' military might.
   Few missiles were in evidence today. Anti-tank guided missile
systems and surface-to-air missile resupply vehicles were dropped
this year, diplomats said. They had said they expected just one new
weapon, an updated version of the T-72 tank, to join the parade.
   In addition, party slogans were far less militant than just a
few years ago.
   In another expression of discontent, a local chapter of the
nationalist People's Front movement in Riga, capital of the Baltic
republic of Latvia, declared the Bolsheviks' seizure of power was
not a revolution but ``a government coup.''
   The group said the takeover ``cut short the process of
democratization that started after the February 1917 revolution
(that overthrew the czar).''
   Czar Nicholas II abdicated to a provisional government that was
overthrown eight months later by the Bolsheviks.

   An explosion during an artillery test killed
two Israeli soldiers and injured two others at the Yuma Army
Proving Ground, authorities said.
   An Israeli team was conducting firing tests of an
Israeli-modified M-109 howitzer at the desert facility when the
accident occurred, Army Capt. Stephen McGeorge said late Monday.
   ``The actual projectile or bomb did not explode,'' he said. ``It
was the propelling charge that went off. We don't know why it did.''
   The injured were taken to Yuma Regional Medical Center, but
hospital officials would not release any information. The Israeli
Army said in a statement issued in Jerusalem that the two soldiers
were not seriously hurt.
   No Americans were involved in Monday afternoon's explosion, a
Pentagon official said.
   It is not uncommon for countries buying equipment from U.S.
contractors to first test artillery at U.S. facilities, the
official said.
   The Israeli Army said the accident involved an artillery piece
being jointly produced by the United States and Israel.
   The four soldiers' identities were not released.
   The proving ground is in Arizona's southwestern corner, near the
California line.

   A bomb planted by the Irish
Republican Army exploded today outside the home of a senior police
official, but the man and his family narrowly escaped injury.
   David Mellor, assistant chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
had returned from his mother's funeral in England hours before the
bomb blew up below the living room window of his home in Drumbo,
outside Belfast, officials said.
   Mellor had just left the living room when the blast ripped
through the bulletproof window behind an armchair where he had been
reading. His wife was in another room.
   Mellor's 7-month-old daughter Rebecca was asleep in a cot in the
living room and was showered with debris, a police spokesman said.
His 18-month-old daughter Rachel was asleep in an adjoining bedroom.
   ``Both infants were only six to eight feet from the bomb when it
went off,'' the spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom. ``They had a miraculous escape.''
   He said the bomb caused extensive damage.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility and, in a
statement to Belfast news media, said it had been watching Mellor's
movements for some time.
   The IRA said the bomb contained three pounds of explosives.
   ``We deliberately placed a small charge only, because we were
aware of the young children in the house,'' it said. ``Otherwise we
could undoubtedly have guaranteed Mellor's death with a larger
charge.''
   The English-born Mellor, 49, is in charge of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary's complaints and discipline branch. He is scheduled to
take over as deputy chief constable of South Wales later this month.
   Eight Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, including one chief
superintendent and two superintendents, have been murdered by the
IRA this year.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Kitty Dukakis underwent tests today at a hospital,
where she was taken by ambulance after complaining of sluggishness,
a spokeswoman said.
   The wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis had suffered from the flu
for three or four days before she was taken Monday night to Brigham
and Women's Hospital, said the spokeswoman, Mindy Lubber.
   Mrs. Dukakis' hospitalization came almost exactly a year after
her husband's White House defeat.
   ``I don't know if it's flu-related. I know she was feeling
groggy,'' Ms. Lubber said. ``She's been feeling tired. Last night
she was feeling particularly lethargic.''
   Mrs. Dukakis underwent four weeks of treatment for alcoholism at
a clinic after her husband's unsuccessful campaign. She revealed
previously she was addicted to diet pills for years. She underwent
neck surgery last year.
   Ms. Lubber said initial examinations did not indicate her
illness was drug- or alcohol-related. Ms. Lubber would not say what
the tests were or whether Mrs. Dukakis had been given a CAT scan as
WNEV-TV reported today.
   Hospital officials refused to provide any information on Mrs.
Dukakis, who will be 53 on Wednesday.
   Dukakis was with her when she arrived at the hospital, stayed a
few hours Monday night and returned this morning. He did not
immediately talk to reporters.

   A check of old case files led straight to a
bathtub in Chicago, where authorities arrested a man in the slaying
of a woman 29 years ago.
   ``You don't clear one this old too often,'' said Dallas County
sheriff's investigator Tom Reilly, who helped break the case.
   Reilly and investigator Gary Lachman last week came across a
murder warrant for Robert Lee Mitchell in the shooting of his
former girlfriend, Billie Marie Redmon Phillips, in Dallas in 1960.
   As the detectives do routinely, they asked for an information
sheet on Mitchell from the FBI, which categorizes every person
arrested by fingerprints and not by name. When the detectives
received the file on Mitchell, it included a 1985 arrest of a man
named Billy Jackson on an assault charge in Chicago.
   Chicago police furnished a phone number for the man.
   ``We called and said we were doing a survey,'' Reilly said. ``I
talked to his wife. She gave me his name. She confirmed they lived
at the same address. She even confirmed that he was in the other
room reading the paper.''
   FBI agents arrested Jackson, formerly Mitchell, in his bathtub
on Friday, Lachman said.
   ``He was surprised he was arrested,'' Reilly said. ``He didn't
deny he was the same person.''
   Mitchell had fled after the slaying. Relatives later said he had
died, and the FBI closed the case in 1980, sheriff's detectives
said.
   But the detectives knew Mitchell was still alive because his
Social Security number was still active and no one had claimed
death benefits on it.

   Christian teen-agers today beat up
vendors who ignored a strike that was called to show solidarity
with the army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, in his opposition to the
new president, witnesses said.
   Rene Mouawad, who was elected president Sunday, consulted with
politicians in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon in an effort to form
a government.
   Aoun, who headed a Christian Cabinet for 14 months prior to
Mouawad's election, remained in the shell-ravaged presidential
palace in suburban Baabda, refusing to relinquish it to Mouawad.
   He termed the presidential election ``unconstitutional.''
   About 500 youths chanting ``Aoun is the legitimate leader!''
gathered outside the French Embassy in Hazmieh, just south of
Baabda. They waved portraits of Aoun, Lebanese flags and slogans
calling on French President Francois Mitterrand to ``protect
Lebanon.''
   France has been the Christians' main protector here. It ruled
Lebanon until independence in 1943.
   About 40 of the demonstrators began a sit-in outside the
compound. They raised a banner that said: ``Mitterand has
disappointed us.''
   Paris, Washington and other major Arab and international
governments have backed Mouawad, a Maronite Catholic and a 32-year
veteran of Lebanese politics.
   He was voted into office by Lebanese legislators who also
approved a peace accord giving the Moslem majority more power in
decision making. Aoun opposed the accord because it did not set a
deadline for withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   His main problem with Mouawad is the president's close links
with Syria. Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun wants them out because they are
the Moslems' main supporters.
   A committee of Christian youths who support Aoun called a
general strike for a fourth day in east Beirut and the Christian
heartland to the north, which is controlled by Aoun's 20,000 troops.
   Only bakeries were allowed to open, and thousands of people
lined up outside.
   Some vendors in the east Beirut neighborhood of Ashrafiyeh
defied the strike call and opened their stands. Young demonstrators
attacked them with sticks, witnesses reported.
   ``We want peace. We want to work to make money. We live
hand-to-mouth,'' a vendor shouted as teen-agers beat him up, one
witness reported.
   He said some demonstrators were ``kids around the age of 12.''
The others were slightly older.
   ``The vegetable vendors and the kids fought with fists and
sticks. Policemen at a nearby police station did not interfere. In
fact, they didn't dare interfere because they know the
demonstrators are backed by the army,'' another witness said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said hundreds of demonstrators drove by in cars decorated
with Aoun's pictures and Lebanese flags ``shouting orders to abide
by the strike.''
   A car mechanic said: ``We want an end to war. We've had enough.
   ``What more does the general want? does he want to get the
Maronites (Catholics) slaughtered?'' he said. He identified himself
only as Fares, and added: ``You publish my name and the general's
intelligence men will pick me up in 10 minutes.''
   ``They didn't spare the patriarch,'' he said, referring to the
attack early Monday on Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the
highest Christian religious authority in Lebanon.
   Pro-Aoun demonstrators ransacked his compound in Bkirki, north
of Beirut, shouted insults at the patriarch and forced him to kneel
on the floor and kiss a poster of Aoun.
   Sfeir supported Mouawad.
   Mouawad has been at his home in the mountain resort of Zghorta,
in north Lebanon, where dozens of parliamentrians, former prime
ministers and senior politicians visited him for consultations.
   In west Beirut, an old stone villa was being prepared for
Mouawad.
   The Baabda palace is a wreck. It was destroyed in six months of
ferocious fighting between Aoun and Syrian troops. The fighting was
halted by a cesae-fire in September.

   Israeli aircraft rocketed bases of the
Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah in southeastern Lebanon
this morning. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   Reporters in Nabatiyeh said at least two helicopter gunships
were involved in the attack. Smoke billowed from the stricken
targets as ground defenders fired at the Israeli aircraft with
anti-aircraft guns. No hits were observed.
   An Israeli army communique said Hezbollah targets were struck in
Mazraat Ayn Busiwar, 14 miles north of the Israeli border. ``All
targets were hit and our planes returned safely to base,'' the
communique said.
   It did say what type aircraft were involved in the raid and did
not mention casualties or damage.
   A police spokesman in Lebanon said Hezbollah fighters would not
allow police into the area and that it was not known if anyone was
killed or injured.
   ``We'll only know if they evacuate any wounded to hospitals in
Sidon,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   An Israeli army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said several targets were struck. He refused to elaborate.
   No reason for the raid was given, but military officials have
several times accused guerrillas of Hezbollah of taking part in
attacks in the security zone or of attempting to infiltrate Israel
through the border strip.
   Israel established the 6- to 10-mile-wide zone after pulling the
bulk of its troops out of Lebanon in 1985, following a three-year
occupation of the south. The area is intended to prevent
cross-border raids on Israel.
   It was Israel's 13th bombing raid in Lebanon this year and the
first since September 20 when planes struck a Palestinian base at
Naameh, just south of the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
   By police count, 17 people have been killed and 103 wounded in
the previous strikes.

<HEAD>Kissinger Arrives in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
arrived in Beijing today for a private visit expected to include
meetings with China's top leaders.
   Kissinger, making what is believed to be his 15th visit since
his historic secret trip of 1971, arrived by private plane from
Hong Kong and was whisked to the secluded Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse in western Beijing.
   The Foreign Ministry, his host, has told the foreign press it
will have no access to Kissinger and has refused to divulge his
schedule. Kissinger aides also refused to discuss the visit.
   Foreign sources said he is expected to meet top officials,
including senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Kissinger is the third prominent American to visit China in a
private capacity since Washington suspended high-level official
contacts with China. That was in response to the June military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Alexander Haig, an aide during Richard Nixon's administration
and secretary of state under Ronald Reagan, attended a business
symposium at the beginning of October. Nixon was in Beijing last
week for extensive talks with Chinese leaders.
   Like Haig and Nixon, Kissinger is expected to stress that China
and the United States should strive to overcome their current
differences in the interest of restoring normal relations.
   Kissinger, in a speech in Hong Kong on Monday, urged the United
States not to cut itself off from China, despite its condemnation
of the military crackdown in June that left hundreds of people dead.
   ``It is not in the interest of China to isolate itself, and it
is not the interest of outside countries to isolate China,'' he
said. ``We have to deal with the future, and the future requires a
resumption of dialogue based on mutual respect.''
   During Nixon's visit, the two sides agreed on the importance of
improving relations, although the Chinese repeated their claims
that the United States was interfering in its internal affairs.
   Nixon briefed President Bush on his visit at a White House
dinner on Sunday. After the dinner, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush found the former president's views
``interesting and productive, but our general policy has not
changed.''
   Kissinger's secret visit to Beijing in 1971 for talks with the
late Premier Chou En-lai set the stage for Nixon's February 1972
trip, which reopened relations between the United States and
Communist China after 23 years of animosity.

   More than 60 nations today urged
the world to stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases
blamed for the ``greenhouse effect,'' over opposition from the
United States, the Soviet Union and Japan.
   Most of the participants at the 68-nation conference on global
warming adopted a declaration saying that carbon dioxide emissions
should be stabilized within 10 years as a first step toward
fighting the pollution problem.
   Environmentalists were bitter about the refusal of the United
States, Soviet Union and Japan to sign the declaration.
   ``The conference is a total failure, and the United States and
Japan have sabotaged it,'' said Daniel Becker, an official of the
Sierra Club, a Washington-based environmentalist group.
   The Dutch, hosts of the two-day ministerial meeting, had hoped
to align all the participating nations unanimously behind a
commitment to stabilize emissions by the end of the century and to
begin reducing them in 2005.
   William K. Reilly, chief administrator of the U.S. Environmental
protection agency, said the ``distinction was between those
countries that want to commit themselves to stabilization by the
year 2000 and those, including the United States, who are not
prepared to say so at this time.''
   On Monday, Reilly said, ``We believe in a reduction of carbon
dioxide. But we're not prepared to say by what time and by what
level.''
   Reilly said the countries should wait for completion of studies
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a forum trying to
find ways of reducing global warming.
   The level at which the emissions were to be stabilized will be
set next year by the U.N.-sponsored climate change panel, which is
planning a meeting in Washington in February, and the World Climate
Conference scheduled for late 1990, according to the nations'
declaration.
   Earlier, Japanese delegates said they were awaiting more
scientific data on climate change and on the economic effects of
drastic measures to curb the greenhouse effect, which is believed
by some scientists to be the cause of a slight warming of the
earth's atmosphere.
   Some scientists fear the phenomenon could eventually lead to the
flooding of coastal areas and expansion of deserts.
   Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.
In 1988, the United States accounted for nearly 24 percent of total
world emissions of the gas, according to the Dutch Environment
Ministry. Much carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fuels
such as coal and gasoline.
   The final declaration also called for ways to provide money to
Third World nations to help them cope with the consequences of
climatic change.
   Participating nations also said that by the end of the century,
an annual 30-million acre reforestation program should be under way
in the tropics. The destruction of rain forest is believed to
contribute to the greenhouse effect.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Ease Technical Requirements on Environmental Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to ease the
technical requirements facing people who sue to protect the
environment.
   The justices ruled 7-2 against an Oregon farming couple, saying
the victory it took Olaf and Mary Hallstrom three years and $95,000
to win against their county never should have been ruled on by a
federal court.
   But the Hallstroms are free to start all over again, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
   The Hallstroms' trial victory was overturned by a federal
appeals court because their lawyer had failed to notify federal and
state environmental officials, as required by the law they sued
under, before filing the 1982 suit.
   The suit contended that a Tillamook County, Ore., landfill
adjacent to what is left of the Hallstroms' 200-acre dairy farm
caused or contributed to the pollution of their water supply.
   Despite the failure to notify government officials 60 days
before the suit was filed, a federal judge allowed the suit to
proceed _ and in 1985 ordered the county to remedy violations of
federal environmental law within two years.
   The judge turned down the Hallstroms' request for $95,000 in
lawyer fees, and the couple appealed.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 ruled that the
Hallstroms' suit should have been dismissed before any trial
because of the failure to notify.
   That ruling was upheld today.
   ``Where a party suing under the citizen suit provisions of the
(Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976) fails to meet the
notice and 60-day delay requirement, the district court must
dismiss the action as barred by the terms of the statute,''
O'Connor wrote.
   She added that the Hallstroms are not being deprived ``of their
right to a day in court'' because they ``remain free to give notice
and file their suit in compliance with the statute to enforce
pertinent environmental standards.''
   O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented,
stating in an opinion by Marshall that the decision ``ill serves
both judicial economy and Congress' purposes'' in passing the
environmental protection law.
   The Hallstroms' lawyer, Kim Buckley of Portland, informed the
county of their intention to sue well before the 60-day period
required by the federal law. But Buckley did not give the same
required notification to the federal Environmental Protection
Agency or the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.
   In arguments before the justices last month, Buckley urged the
court to ``look at the spirit'' of the law, contending that ``it's
just not fair'' to make the Hallstroms ``jump through a judicial
hoop that has no purpose.''
   But in her opinion today, O'Connor said the notification
requirement was intended by Congress to give agencies ``a 60-day
nonadversarial period to achieve compliance'' with the
environmental law.
   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.

<HEAD>Army Surgeons Training at Ghetto Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is training young surgeons to handle
war carnage by sending them to the emergency room at a ghetto
hospital inundated with victims of gang violence.
   Two Army residents recently completed two months' training at
Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center in the city's Watts
section. County supervisors were to vote today on allowing four
more surgeons to train there next year.
   ``At King, we see the kind of penetrating trauma that we just
don't see at other hospitals,'' said Dr. John McPhail, chief of
surgery at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas.
``It's a place where the residents will have to treat a large
volume of high-velocity wounds, the kind we would see in war.''
   Army doctors used to receive their trauma surgery training at
public hospitals near their home bases. But the young surgeons
rarely see the kinds of gaping, multiple wounds caused by automatic
and semiautomatic gunfire common to gang violence here, where more
than 353 gang-related slayings were reported last year.
   Dr. John Holcomb, a fourth-year resident at the Army hospital in
El Paso, completed his two-month stint in trauma surgery at
King-Drew last week. The hospital is at the Army's Fort Bliss.
   ``It makes sense that since we're military surgeons, we'll treat
the kinds of wounds that we would see in combat,'' he said. ``And
that's definitely what I saw there.''
   The 430-bed, county-run teaching hospital treated almost 3,500
trauma victims in 1988, or nearly 40 percent of the county's trauma
patients. Health officials estimate that doctors there treat more
than 100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month.
   Dr. Arthur Fleming, chief of trauma and surgery at King-Drew,
proposed the facility as an Army training site to boost manpower at
the overburdened trauma unit.
   Army officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of
their surgical training.

   President Bush said today he hoped the U.S.
decision to return $567 million in frozen assets to Iran will help
get ``underbrush cleaned out'' and lead to the eventual release of
hostages.
   ``I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,''
Bush told a news conference at the White House a day before the
first anniversary of his election. He said he knew of no reason to
be encouraged at this time, however.
   Bush convened reporters on the anniversary of his election
victory and he used an introductory statement to sum up with
satisfaction his first 10 months in office.
   ``I enjoy it; I like the challenge,'' he said.
   One of the first questions was based on statements by former
President Carter who said Bush had reacted to cautiously to changes
in the Communist world. His questioner pointed out that Bush had
said he would go to next month's meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev
with no initiatives to offer.
   ``I'd like to hear some specific suggestions,'' Bush said,
``besides triple the spending.'' He said he has no perception that
European allies are unhappy with the pace of his U.S.-Soviet
policies.

   The American Civil Liberties Union has
gone to court to get Camp Hill prison officials to remove the
shackles and handcuffs used to bind some 1,000 inmates in pairs
since a riot last month.
   U.S. District Judge Sylvia Rambo set a hearing for today in a
suit filed by the Pennsylvania branch of the ACLU on behalf of four
inmates.
   The suit also claims inmates have not had adequate clothing,
heat, plumbing, food or medical treatment since the uprising was
put down Oct. 27. The rioting left 123 people injured and half the
prison in flames.
   The continued restraint of the inmates is ``designed solely to
inflict cruel and unusual punishment,'' said the suit, filed Monday.
   ``I think it's torture. We do not treat animals this way,'' said
ACLU legal director Stefan Presser.
   A Corrections Department spokeswoman said about 1,200 inmates
remain restrained and in locked cells.
   Another spokesman, Kenneth Robinson, said the staff is trying to
identify inmates who were not directly involved in the rioting.
Those inmates will be moved to other blocks where prisoners are not
shackled, he said.
   ``The purpose of the handcuffs is for security,'' he said. ``We
are concerned about the safety of both staff and inmates.''
   Robinson would not comment on the specifics of the ACLU suit.
   Four guards and two inmates hurt in the rioting remain
hospitalized.

   Bush said leaders in western Europe ``don't seem to agree with
some of the poltical criticism I get from Capitol Hill'' on dealing
with the nations that have been in the Soviet sphere since World
War II.
   Bush said that despite the impact of his veto of appropriations
bills, including abortion funding, he is not going to budge on the
issue. He said abortion is not the most important issue on his
agenda, but that he will not approve measures that compel the use
of tax dollars for abortion.
   ``It supports compulsory abortion,'' he said. ``I am not going
to do that.''
   In his opening statement, Bush, elected last Nov. 8, looked back
at his term so far and cited both foreign-policy and domestic
initiatives.
   He said he was pleased he had kept his pledge not to raise taxes
and said neither he nor Congress ``must flinch from our obligation
to keep this nation's deficit from moving down.''
   Bush was asked whether the U.S. action, freeing money that had
had held in a fund to back up claims by American banks against
Iran, could help lead to release of the hostages _ even though the
administration claims the issues are separate.
   ``I don't know the answer to that ... I'd like to get this
underbrush cleaned out now,'' Bush said.
   He said he hoped the current government of Iran ``will do what
they can to influence those who hold those hostages.'' Meanwhile,
Bush said, ``We're continuing behind the scenes to follow rabbit
trails.''

   President Bush offered his thanks today, on
the first anniversary of his election, to the American people for
choosing him and said he would move to ``shed light in the dark
corners of American life.''
   The president called an Election day news conference to mark the
occasion.
   ``I'm very pleased that our administration has come together
rapidly with good people and with good ideas and a quiet sense of
purpose,'' he said in an opening statement.
   Bush expressed satisfaction with his record in international and
national affairs, saying he had seen the greatest surge toward
democracy around the world in at least 40 years.
   And, he said, he had responded to those challenges. Critics have
called him overly cautious in reacting to changes sweeping the
Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   He cited his forthcoming meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev; plans for a formal summit after that; his proposal
for aid to Poland and his support for international efforts to
bolster the movement throughout Eastern Europe toward free market
economies and democratic forms of government.
   Throughout that area, Bush said, ``important decisions have been
made for freedom and we've supported those movements.''
   At home, the president said, he is ``more convinced today than
ever that we can shed light in the dark corners of America'' and
offer hope to the needy.
   He promised to continue a bipartisan approach toward Congress,
said more had to be done to combat the federal deficit, repeated
his pledge to oppose any new federal taxes and basked in ``the
underlying strength of the American economy.''
   Bush cited ``the longest expansion in history,'' and low rates
of unemployment and inflation.
   ``I want to thank the American people on this Election Day for
giving me this opportunity to serve,'' he said. ``I enjoy it.''

   Voters stood in lines more than a mile
long today as balloting began in an election that is to lead to
independence for Africa's last colony.
   Authorities reported violations of election rules and at least
one attempt to distribute bogus pamphlets but said there had been
no major disturbances.
   ``The behavior of the voting public has been an example to the
rest of the world,'' said Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South
African-installed territorial government.
   The U.N.-monitored elections are for a 72-member assembly that
is to write a constitution. Namibia, ruled by South Africa for 74
years, is expected to become independent early next year.
   ``After all the years of waiting, the people of Namibia
themselves, and no one else, will have their say in free and fair
elections,'' the U.N. special representative, Martti Ahtisaari,
said in a radio broadcast as five days of voting began in the
southern African territory.
   There are 701,488 registered voters in Namibia, about 60 percent
of them illiterate. The population was 1.3 million in 1981, when
the last census was taken, but is believed to be far higher now.
   The key issue in the elections was whether the South-West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO), favored to win the most votes, would
capture the two-thirds majority needed to write a constitution
without consulting any of the other nine parties.
   ``Today we are finally burying apartheid colonialism,'' SWAPO
leader Sam Nujoma told reporters at a polling station in Katutura,
the main black neighborhood on the edge of Windhoek.
   ``There is a beautiful lady expecting a baby,'' Nujoma told a
cheering, singing crowd at a rally Monday night. ``That lady is
mother Namibia, and that baby is the freedom and independence of
this land.''
   The queue of voters stretched for about 1.2 miles when the polls
opened in Katutura. Long lines also were reported elsewhere.
   Namibians may vote daily through Saturday and Chief Electoral
Officer Abraham Visser said he was confident results would be
available Nov. 15.
   More than 7,000 U.N. military and civilian representatives _ one
for every 1,000 voters _ are in predominantly black Namibia and
have supervised a massive campaign to promote voting and prevent
fraud.
   Posters and television advertisements financed by U.N. and
territorial officials have stressed that ballots will be secret and
urged voters to ``vote without fear.''
   All voters are required to dip their fingers in invisible ink
after they cast their ballot. The ink is indelible for five days.
When voters enter the booths at the polling stations they must put
their fingers under an ultra-violet light, which will reveal the
ink if they already have voted.
   Officials said most of this sparsely populated desert territory
now is tranquil. But the four-month election campaign was marked by
sporadic violence and intimidation, including the Sept. 12
assassination of the only ranking white in SWAPO, Anton Lubowski.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard cautioned that ``the peace is a very
fragile peace.''
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
noted Monday in a final pre-election report that almost one in 10
Namibians had a gun permit and an unknown number were armed
illegally.
   ``While at this time there have been marked improvements in the
security situation on the eve of the election, I remain vigilant to
the possibility of a deterioration in the field of law and order,''
Perez de Cuellar said.
   In neighboring South Africa, President F.W. de Klerk urged
Namibians to ``cast your vote in the interest of peace and
prosperity.''
   ``The strife and bitterness, the mistrust and misunderstandings
of the past must be put behind us,'' he said.
   South Africa seized mineral-rich Namibia from its German
colonizers in 1915. The League of Nations, forerunner of the United
Nations, provided South Africa with a mandate to administer the
territory.
   The U.N. revoked the mandate in 1966 and SWAPO launched a
guerrilla war later that year after South Africa refused to grant
independence.
   More than 20,000 people, mostly SWAPO guerrillas, died in the
bush war that finally ended in April.
   Nujoma said his left-leaning organization would accept any
election result certified by the United Nations.
   The organization once espoused a Marxist-Leninist one-party
state, but Nujoma last month promised that SWAPO ``has no intention
of imposing a one-party political system on the Namibian people
against their will.''
   Its chief rival is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
moderate, multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy
and was part of a South African-installed transitional government.

   The chairman of the Italian state-owned airline was
killed when his car collided with a city bus, authorities said.
   The accident happened Monday night while Alitalia Chairman Carlo
Verri was telephoning his wife while sitting in the back seat of
the car, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   Verri's car ran a red light at high speed, crashed into an
oncoming bus and was thrown against a soft drink stand on the
corner of the intersection, according to initial police reports.
   Verri's driver, Enrico Grappelli, 25, also was killed. No one on
the bus was hurt.
   Verri, 50, was appointed chairman of Alitalia in 1988.
Previously, he had served as director-general of the Swedish
company Riv-Skf, director of Italian Zanussi Elettrodomestici and
director and member of the executive committee of the Swedish
Electrolux Component Group.
   He is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEAD>Text of President Bush's News Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday.
   President Bush: Well, good morning. And I _ I'm back again _
(laughter) and I just heard you, Brit _ I've got to be careful on
these dates. (Laughter). Today is November 7th, and I was elected
on November 8th, but it was the second Tuesday. And so I want to
take this election day, the anniversary of my own election, to
briefly reflect on the last 10 months.
   I believe that we've had, so far, a successful first year in
office. And although we haven't reached the actual anniversary
mark, January 20th, it's a good chance to take stock of the
situation, particularly as Congress is winding down. There is
legislation yet to be passed, and certainly opportunities to be
developed. But I'm very pleased that our administration has come
together rapidly with good people, with good ideas, and with a
quiet sense of purpose that promises great progress in the years
ahead.
   And around the world we've seen the most dramatic moves toward
democracy in at least 40 years, as people of one country after
another have expressed their yearning for freedom. And in Eastern
Europe, and in Central America, and in the Soviet Union important
decisions have been made for freedom or reforms. And we've
supported those efforts with a substantial aid package to Poland,
trade benefits for Hungary, a bipartisan agreement Congress on
Central America, coordinated international support for Eastern
Europe reforms, special arms control initiatives on chemical
weapons and conventional forces in Europe, and then in progress in
START talks.
   In addition, we've set the timeframe for a summit with the
Soviets, and we're on the verge of an informal meeting with
President Gorbachev.
   One area that has not changed is the underlying strength of the
American economy. We have the longest peacetime economic expansion
in history, 119 million Americans at work, the creation of over 20
million new jobs since 1982. The unemployment rate is only 5.3
percent, a rate that we've not achieved for a full year since 1970.
Inflation remains moderate. I'm not happy with it, but it's
moderate and appears to be under control.
   Though the economy is sound, we must make real progress on
deficit reduction. Sequestration is a drastic action, but neither
the administration nor the Congress must flinch from our obligation
to keep this nation's deficit moving down and ultimately reduce the
debt. And I am pleased that I have kept my pledge on taxes. Our
savings and loan system has been redesigned, the Congress accepted
my proposals giving our workers a higher minimum wage, and
establishing a training wage for the first time.
   The Brady plan for dealing with the Third World debt has been
successfully demonstrated in Mexico and Costa Rica. Many nations'
problems remain unsolved, but the Brady plan is widely accepted.
It's in the setting of internal strength that we are poised to deal
effectively with external change, and to provide new directions for
our society.
   At the education summit and in legislative initiatives on clean
air, ethics, educational excellence, violent crime, child care, and
our national drug strategy, we offer new approaches for improving
the quality of our lives. And so I urge the Congress to move
quickly to enact these proposals. My approach to Congress has been
based on a bipartisan effort. I think everybody here knows that. It
started off with an effort to work with the leadership in a
bipartisan manner, and so we could reach agreement on major issues.
In the course of our debates, there have sometimes been pointed and
somewhat sharp attacks, but I am going to continue to extend my
hand to Congress in seeking solutions to the challenges that we
face.

<HEAD>Bush Threatens To Veto Eastern European Aid Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs new to UPDATE with Bush veto threat; Picks up 4th
graf pvs, The House conferees.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

   President Bush said today he will veto a $14.4
billion foreign aid bill if Congress insists on including a
provision authorizing a U.S. contribution to a United Nations'
family planning agency.
   ``They are asking me to accept things I cannot accept,'' Bush
said in response to a question at a White House news conference.
   He said he could not approve the use of U.S. tax dollars for
programs that require abortions in such overpopulated countries as
China.
   House and Senate negotiators, continuing work on a foreign aid
bill, agreed Monday on the provision involving family planning
efforts through the auspices of the U.N.
   As they worked through a long list of disagreements, conferees
for the two sides agreed to accept Senate language that would
reverse a five-year policy and send $15 million to the U.N.
Population Fund in fiscal 1990.
   Bush, under pressure from anti-abortion groups, had said earlier
that he would veto the bill if it included money for the Population
Fund. The agency carries on programs in China, where its opponents
say severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced
abortions and sterilizations.
   The House conferees voted 8-3 to accept the Senate-passed
provision, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., that also
stipulated none of the money could go directly into programs in
China.
   Administration officials said late Monday they believed the
provision giving money to the U.N. agency still could be overturned
when a compromise bill goes back to the House floor for final
approval.
   The negotiators hoped to complete work on the measure on
Wednesday and send it back to both chambers for approval.
   The aid for Eastern Europe included $200 million towards a $1
billion international fund to stabilize Poland's economy, and money
to set up private sector development programs of $45 million in
Poland and $5 million in Hungary.
   A series of smaller initiatives would promote environmental
cleanups in both countries, educational and cultural exchanges,
Peace Corps activities and the efforts of union and other groups to
promote democratic change.
   In addition, the bill would make available $200 million to
guarantee payment for U.S. exports to Poland and $40 million in
risk insurance for U.S. commercial ventures through the Overseas
Private Investment Corp. Because of questions about Poland's credit
worthiness, it is unclear whether those funds will be tapped.
   Both countries have been on the forefront of changes sweeping
Eastern Europe, the result of failing economies under communism and
of Moscow's looser grip. Poland this year elected its first
non-communist government in four decades and Hungary has torn down
border fences that form its part of the Iron Curtain.
   The conference committee also agreed to put $125 million into
new military, intelligence and law enforcement efforts in the war
on drugs in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   Another issue that had been the basis for a veto threat appeared
to be evaporating, said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., because the
administration had decided against a fight. That was a provision,
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, that would bar the use of
foreign aid money to carry out any policy contrary to U.S. law.
   Other major differences remained, however. One was an accounting
gimmick used in the Senate bill to meet its 1990 budget target,
which would force some $500 million in spending into the following
fiscal year. The House was strenuously opposed to that maneuver.

   WASHN: we face.
   I spoke ten months ago of a kinder and gentler America, and I'm
more convinced today than ever that we can shed light in the dark
corners of our nation and give hope to the homeless and help to the
needy, inspiration to millions of Americans who want to reach out
and help their neighbors. And I am pleased at the progress on this
so-called ``points of light'' initiative.
   These challenges, coupled with our successes to date, have made
these first ten months especially gratifying to me, and give me
great hope for the future. So I, on this occasion of the election _
anniversary of the election _ I want to thank the American people
on this election day for giving me this opportunity to serve. I'm
enjoying it. I like the challenge. And I'll be glad to take
questions.
   Terry?
   Q: Mr. President, the United States is returning $567 million in
frozen assets to Iran, but says the action is not related to the
plight of the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
Nevertheless, in line with your comment that goodwill brings
goodwill, do you hope that this will encourage Iran to help win the
hostages' release?
   A: Well, as I say, I carry the fate of the hostages with me
every single day. So of course I hope that Iran will use what
influence it has to get these hostages released.
   Q: Well, do you think that this could be a catalyst Mr.
Rafsanjani. ...
   A: I don't know, Terry. It's a very good question, and I don't
know the answer to that. They owe money _ you know, they _ we have
accounts that _ where they owe American interests money, and vice
versa. And I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out now. I think
they have made some positive statements. But I don't whether it
will work that way, or not. I hope _ I hope that they will do what
they can to influence those who hold these hostages. We're
continuing behind the scenes to try _ go follow certain ``rabbit
trails'' there. And so far, they have ended up at dead ends.
   Q Mr. President?
   A: Yes, Helen?
   Q: Despite your aid packages to Hungary and Poland and so forth,
President Carter says you've really been slow on the uptake on one
of the most transforming politicals events of our time. You have
failed to show the leadership, you've failed to put the U.S. ahead
of the curve on these things that are happening. And you are going
to the summit without any initiatives at all, and you _ I mean, at
least you've boasted about it. Why don't you have some new ideas of
what to talk about?
   A: Now, Helen, that is not a ``kinder and gentler'' way to
phrase your question. We have done plenty. And the fact that some
critics are out there equating progress with spending more money
doesn't bother me in the least. Look at the dynamic changes that
are taking place around the world.
   Q (inaudible)
   A: Well, I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than
``triple the spending'' on every initiative. We are working closely
with our allies. We are trying to facilitate the change. I don't
hear complaints coming out of our allies or, indeed, out of Hungary
or Poland or Eastern Europe. We've got a seasoned team that is
evaluating the change. I will have a wonderful opportunity to
discuss the change with Mr. Gorbachev. But I can't be all concerned
when people jump up and say the answer is to spend more money!
   Q: No, that isn't it.
   A: Well, what is their answer?
   Q: The perception is that European leaders are leading the way
and are telling you what is really happening, and we have been
sitting back and letting it all happen without doing anything.
   A: Well, that's the perception of some that aren't quite as
familiar with the problem as I am, and it is not the perception of
the

   An Air Force Academy cheerleader
was kicked off the squad for swinging a chicken by its head during
halftime at a football game against Army, officials said.
   The cadet, who wasn't identified, also was ordered by the school
to perform 100 hours of public service at the Humane Society, said
academy spokesman Col. Mike Wallace on Monday.
   Officials at the academy and the humane society said Monday they
received several calls from spectators, faculty members and cadets
about mistreatment of the birds.
   People complained that a cheerleader had swung a chicken by its
head and that a second chicken was tossed into the crowd, which
batted it around before releasing it, said Larry Leonard, shelter
manager at the humane society.
   ``What started off as a very typical service academy prank got
out of hand,'' Wallace said. ``It was a very unfortunate incident
committed by a cheerleader who was caught up in the emotion of what
has become a very fierce inter-service rivalry.''
   The chickens were released on the field by West Point cadets
during halftime events before 52,000 spectators. Both are ``alive
and scratching around the back yard'' of the academy's game warden
until a home can be found for them, Wallace said.
   Academy officials would not release the cadet's name because the
incident did not result in criminal charges.

<HEAD>EDS: New thruout to update with Palestinian killed. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army has captured a ring of Moslem
fundamentalists in the occupied Gaza Strip who are believed to have
kidnapped and killed two Israeli soldiers, the military announced
today.
   The body of one victim was never found, but an army statement
said interrogation of the suspects yielded the first concrete
evidence that the soldier, reported missing in May, was slain after
being abducted.
   The trooper, 18-year-old Ilan Saadon, of the Mediterranean
coastal town of Ashkelon, would be the 41st Israeli slain in the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip
and West Bank. At least 612 Arabs have been killed by Israelis
during the 22-month revolt.
   The latest death occurred today, when riot police shot and
killed a Palestinian teen-ager in the West Bank town of Qalqilya.
The army said he was killed during a clash with stone-throwers.
   Arab reports said at least three other teen-agers were wounded
in the same protest.
   Also today, the body of a 28-year-old Palestinian was found in
the West Bank town of Nablus with multiple stab wounds. Arab
reports said he was suspected of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   The victim, Nabil Samhan, was the 142nd Palestinian killed by
fellow Arabs during the uprising.
   The army did not give the number of suspects arrested in the
soldiers' deaths. It said the ring's leader was among those
detained. It added that the three prime suspects have fled the
country.
   The statement said evidence gathered in the case ``has
strengthened the belief that the soldier Ilan Saadon was kidnapped
and killed as well, similarly to Avi Sassportas, and was buried
somewhere in Israeli territory.''
   Saadon was last seen by a fellow soldier entering a white sedan
in southern Israel on May 3.
   The suspects are also believed involved in the Feb. 16
kidnapping and slaying of 21-year-old soldier Avi Sassportas, who
disappeared while hitchhiking home. His body was found May 7 in a
grove near the Gaza Strip.
   A police inquiry published today recommended that six policemen
be fired and put under criminal investigation for the fatal
shooting of an 18-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank town of
Bethlehem on Oct. 26.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the recommendations for firing
and investigating the six officers were given to National Police
Commissioner David Kraus, who was reviewing them.
   Israel radio quoted the findings as saying the policemen are
suspected of causing death, fabricating evidence and giving false
testimony.
   The inquiry was launched after Israeli newspapers quoted Arab
witnesses as saying the 18-year-old Palestinian was shot at
point-blank range, not during a car chase as police reported.

from the road just before rush hour.
   ``We were knee deep in yogurt,'' said Fire Chief Chris Ritchie.

yogurt.
   No serious injuries were reported in the collision.

<HEAD>Conservative Leader Receives Mandate To Try To Form Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis
received a mandate today to try to form a new government. Party
officials said he faces a difficult time.
   Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party won the most parliamentary
seats in Sunday's elections but just missed a majority, got the
exploratory mandate from President Christos Sartzetakis.
   Mitsotakis has until Friday to drum up enough support to
persuade the president to let him go before Parliament with the
proposed government for a vote of confidence.
   ``In three days I will return to the president and inform him of
the results of my efforts,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   New Democracy defeated Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, PASOK, in national elections for the second
time in five months. However, it failed to win the 151 seats
necessary for a parliamentary majority.
   Papandreou, who governed Greece from 1981 to the June elections,
will be given a chance to form a government if Mitsotakis fails.
The former premier has 128 seats in the 300-seat Parliament,
compared to New Democracy's 148.
   The third-largest party, the Communist-led Coalition of the Left
and Progress, has said it will not give the conservatives or the
socialists its 21 seats.
   Three independents were also elected.
   New Democracy officials said they expected Mitsotakis to have a
tough time gathering enough support for a government, especially
since one of the independents was allied with the leftist parties.
   Mitsotakis said he will not enter any alliance that will force
his party to water down its program to revive the economy and seek
closer U.S. ties.
   A continued deadlock among the parties could lead to a third set
of elections this year. The conservatives were not enthusiastic
about the possibility.
   ``I don't see new elections right now, for the simple reason
that no one (of the parties) wants them, nor do the Greek people.
Only in the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,''
said Ioannis Palaiokrassas, a senior New Democracy member.
   If all three main parties fail to form a government the
president will invite them to put together a joint administration.
The leftist Coalition supports a government of all three parties.
   New Democracy and the Coalition formed an alliance after the
inconclusive June poll. That alliance was dedicated solely to
investigating Papandreou and former ministers in his
administration. It resigned in October shortly after the former
premier and five of his ministers were indicted by Parliament.
   Another set of elections would not necessarily produce a strong
government. The proportional electoral system introduced by PASOK
before the June elections makes it very difficult for any party to
win a parliamentary majority.

   Democrat David Dinkins entered the voting booth
today with a big lead in opinion polls but with mayoral rival
Rudolph Giuliani snapping at his heels with allegations of
financial irregularities.
   ``I hope we prevail, of course,'' said Dinkins, who has accused
the Republican of running a negative campaign.
   Giuliani emerged with confidence after casting his ballot.
   Today's election will decide the successor to Democrat Ed Koch,
the outspoken symbol of the city for 12 years. Koch stopped off at
a police precinct before voting to ``say goodbye to the cops.''
   Should Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor, pull off an
upset, he would become the city's first GOP mayor elected since
John Lindsay in 1965. Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president,
would be the city's first black mayor.
   A weekend poll of 3,010 likely voters by WNYW-TV and the Gallup
Organization showed Dinkins leading 56 percent to 42 percent.
   Dinkins' backers planned a massive get-out-the-vote effort,
using 12,000 volunteers. Workers staffing a 600-line phone bank
were encouraging 300,000 supporters to vote and more than 100 sound
trucks were being deployed.
   More than 60 percent of the city's nearly 3.2 million voters
were expected to turn out. Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5-1.
   The candidates spent Monday in familiar poses: Dinkins
surrounded by prominent Democrats like Koch, whom he defeated in
September's primary; Gov. Mario Cuomo and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, speaking of ``unity and tolerance.''
   Giuliani, surrounded by supportive police officers, sharply
questioned Dinkins' financial dealings.
   ``So many serious questions have been raised about my opponent
that this election has become a referendum on integrity,'' Giuliani
said in a speech downtown.
   Giuliani was referring to alleged financial transgressions,
including Dinkins' admitted failure to pay taxes 20 years ago and
the payment of $9,500 to an ex-convict to get out the vote in the
primary. He sold cable-television stock he once valued at $1
million to his son for $58,000.
   ``David Dinkins has a history of getting away with things that
others don't get away with,'' Giuliani said.
   The latest allegation was that Dinkins failed to list on
financial disclosure or tax forms that a friend paid in part for a
trip to France last year.
   Dinkins said it is unclear whether such a gift must be listed on
financial disclosure forms, but added he would amend his statement
anyway ``in order to provide the fullest possible disclosure.''
   He dismissed the accusation as ``desperate'' and called on
supporters to reject ``the scurrilous politics of divide and
conquer.''
   ``We've rejected the negative politics of slam and slander _ and
stayed on the high ground of substantive dialogue and moral
leadership,'' Dinkins told cheering supporters at a rally.
   Giuliani, who has never held elective office, projected himself
as an outsider who can clean up a scandal-scarred municipal
government and portrayed Dinkins as a product of Democratic
``clubhouse politics.''
   ``I enter City Hall with no strings, no deals, no ethical or
legal problems that will envelop my administration,'' Giuliani said.

   Former President Carter says President Bush is
``delaying too long'' in responding to the initiatives of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the rebirth of democracy in
Eastern Europe.
   ``We have got to get our act together,'' Carter said on Monday
in the strongest criticism he has offered to date on Bush's
performance in office.
   Bush today dismissed such criticism, although he made no direct
reference to Carter.
   At a White House news conference, the president challenged
critics to come up with specific ideas ``other than triple the
spending'' on aid to Poland and Hungary.
   Bush said, contrary to the basis of one question, that leaders
in Western Europe ``don't seem to agree'' with some of the poltical
criticism he gets in connection with his dealings with nations that
have been in the Soviet sphere since World War II.
   Carter, in Washington for a reunion with the people who staffed
his campaigns and administration, told an audience there is
``substantial proof'' that at least in some areas Gorbachev is
producing irreversible change in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   The response of the Bush administration ``doesn't match what
Gorbachev is doing,'' Carter said.
   ``I think we are delaying too long in responding effectively to
this change that is occurring,'' Carter said during a seminar
sponsored by the Center for National Policy on the subject of
``waging peace.''
   In the absence of U.S. leadership in Eastern Europe, a policy
vacuum occurs that cannot be filled by the leaders of Britain,
France, West Germany or any other nation, Carter said.
   ``The spokesman for the Western world has got to be the
president of the United States,'' Carter said. ``I think we need to
be able to respond to Gorbachev because he is winning a tremendous
propaganda victory in all of the many countries I have visited.''
   Walter F. Mondale, who served as Carter's vice president and who
himself sought the presidency, echoed Carter's complaints.
   ``I think now is the time to strike,'' Mondale said. ``I think
the circumstances are such that we need a much more rapid U.S.
policy response.''
   ``They speak to us in Eastern Europe of the joy of democracy and
freedom,'' Mondale said. ``We sort of come back in the language of
bookkeepers and bureaucrats.''
   Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political
affairs, another participant in the seminar, said the United States
``does have to encourage and respond vigorously'' to rapidly
evolving events in Eastern Europe, but the administration is
looking for ``elements of irreversibility'' in Gorbachev's policies.
   Carter called Gorbachev's rise to power ``one of the
transforming political developments of our lifetime,'' citing the
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Soviet encouragement of the
Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia, Gorbachev's arms control
initiatives and willingness to permit independent policies in
Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``It's hard to find fault with what he says,'' Carter said of
Gorbachev. ``In some cases there is substantial proof he means what
he says.''
   The former president also challenged Bush to more closely engage
the United States in pursuing peace in the Middle East.
   He said Bush must make it clear he intends to vigorously pursue
a peace agreement with all the means at his disposal and will not
withdraw until it is achieved.
   Using the resources of the Carter Presidential Center in
Atlanta, Carter has monitored the electoral process in Nicaragua.
   He said he wants ``to make it extremely difficult _ impossible _
for either party to withdraw from the election when one side or the
other discovers it is likely to lose.''
   ``Once they get involved in a highly publicized peace effort,
its difficult for them to withdraw,'' Carter said. ``It would be
devastating for them in terms of their public relations.''
   Carter said he believes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
``made a tragic and deplorable mistake'' last week when he
announced cancellation of a cease-fire with the rebels.
   But he said he does not believe Ortega's action ``is going to
interfere with the holding of an election.''
   And Carter said he believes recent attacks by Contra rebels
across the Honduran border into Nicaragua have been aimed at
disrupting the process of registering voters.
   Carter, who was hailed by participants in the reunion for his
accomplishments as a former president in the fields of health,
education, housing, and conflict resolution, used the occasion to
appeal for funds to raise a $50 million endowment to perpetuate the
work of the Carter center.

   Gay rights, a proposed smoking ordinance in the heart of
tobacco-land, and the fate of a championship baseball club are
among key ballot issues voters were deciding today.
   In all, residents of 10 states will consider 56 statewide
issues, 21 in Texas alone. Scores of citywide issues also are being
contested in this off-year election. As has often been the case,
many of the most controversial local contests are in California.
   San Francisco Bay area residents, fresh from a major earthquake,
weighed a proposal to raise more than $100 million for a new
stadium to keep the National League champion San Francisco Giants
from fleeing.
   San Franciscans also were considering a ``domestic partners''
measure entitling unmarried couples employed by that city to the
same funeral and sick-leave benefits as married couples.
   The issue of discrimination against AIDS victims got its
first-ever ballot test in nearby Concord, where voters were
deciding whether to repeal a recent ordinance protecting the rights
of those victims.
   In affluent Irvine, voters were considering deleting a section
of the Los Angeles suburb's human rights ordinance that outlaws
discrimination against homosexuals. Backers of the proposal say the
measure could promote immorality. Opponents including Mayor Larry
Agran called the repeal effort homophobic.
   Los Angeles, Washington, New York and Laguna Beach, Calif., are
among cities with gay rights provisions.
   In Greensboro, N.C., where the tobacco giant Lorillard Inc.
employs 2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered
voters smoke, voters decided whether to ban smoking in elevators
and in certain stores, and require restaurants seating more than 50
people to set aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers.
   Kansas City, Mo.-area voters weighed a sales-tax increase to
raise $14 million to wage a war on rising drug abuse.
   Voters in New York City considered a sweeping charter revision
to bring it into compliance with a U.S. Supreme Court order to make
its legislature more representative.
   In St. Louis, voters considered a 4-cent property tax hike to
subsidize the St. Louis Symphony. Orchestra officials say they
can't raise any more money from the wealthy or ticket buyers.
Critics in the Missouri legislature have called the symphony
elitist.
   Seattle residents considered a measure ending forced school
busing and promoting educational choice.
   Among statewide issues:
   _ Michigan and Washington residents considered hefty sales-tax
increases aimed at raising hundreds of millions of dollars for
education.
   Washington's ``Children's Initiative'' would hike the sales tax
by nearly a penny per dollar to help raise at least $360 million a
year for smaller school classes, early childhood education,
child-abuse and drug education.
   _ Utah residents decideed whether the state should spend $56
million for ski jumps and ice rinks that could bring that state the
1998 Olympic Winter Games.
   _ In Maine, a non-binding referendum asks whether voters want
the Navy to stop testing Tomahawk cruise missiles over their state.
The Navy began testing the missiles over Maine last winter. Voters
decided whether to approve an agreement to dispose of nuclear waste
from Maine at a facility in Beatty, Nev.
   _ In Texas, where the ballot is laden with 21 propositions,
questions include whether to triple the current $7,200 salaries of
state legislatures, whether to authorize a $500 million bond issue
aimed at bringing running water and sewers to disease-ridden border
towns, whether to enshrine a ``victim's bill of rights'' in the
state constitution, and whether to finance a record $400 million
build-up of the state's prison system.
   Texans will decided whether to drop a 113-year-old provision
requiring state office-holders to publicly affirm that they didn't
bribe their way into their positions. Some consider the oath
demeaning, but at least one official who recently took it said he
didn't mind.
   ``I kind of like it,'' said Secretary of State George Bayoud.
``During my swearing in, there were people from around the state
here and they said they liked it.''

<HEAD>Senate Opens Debate On Minimum Wage Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDs: Top 8 grafs new with Dole and Mitchell complaining about stall
tactics, Bush comment on domestic agenda. Editing throughout. ^By JOHN
KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders today urged colleagues to stop
using delaying tactics preventing final passage of a compromise
plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25.
   Both Majority Leader George Mitchell and Republican leader Bob
Dole called on any senators who plan to offer amendments to the
proposal to come forward. A few senators have indicated they might
propose amendments, and debate has been all but stopped because
none has actually done so.
   Dole and Mitchell said they hoped a final vote on the minimum
wage could come today so the Senate could concentrate on
negotiations to raise the government's debt ceiling.
   The possible amendments range from an attempt to revive
President Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut to technical
changes in the minimum-wage bill. Most are considered little more
than attempts to delay final passage of the measure because of
partisan disputes, particularly those over capital gains and
efforts to raise the government's debt limit.
   ``This is, of course, a situation with which we in the Senate
have become all too familiar,'' Mitchell, D-Maine, said of the
delay.
   ``It is important we finish minimum wage, get some agreement to
vote,'' said Dole, R-Kan.
   The minimum-wage bill was among several President Bush mentioned
at a morning news conference at which he said Congress was moving
too slowly on his domestic agenda. ``I urge the Congress to move
quickly on these proposals,'' Bush said.
   Senate debate began Monday and only two senators spoke despite
Mitchell's urging that any senators with amendments step forward.
   During that debate, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., praised
Bush for compromising with Congress on the minimum wage. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, predicted easy passage of the measure but said it
would hurt the economy.
   ``The nine-year stalemate over the minimum wage is finally
broken,'' said Kennedy. ``We certainly welcome that change of
attitude between the Reagan administration and the Bush
administration.''
   The increase would be the first since the federal wage floor hit
$3.35 in 1981.
   Hatch said the increase would not help many working poor but
would cause wage and price inflation.
   ``Every good and material that is sold in America is going to go
up in cost,'' Hatch said. ``I think that means we're going to have
some very difficult economic times in the future. I hope I'm
wrong.''
   Kennedy countered by calling the planned increase ``a very small
adjustment'' that still would leave minimum-wage earners well
behind price inflation since the last increase in 1981.
   ``May we do everything in our power to make sure that the
working poor never have to wait that long again,'' Kennedy said.
   The proposal, which also would create a subminimum for
teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck a week ago between Bush
and congressional Democrats.
   The measure provides two 45-cent increases, one next April 1 and
the other a year later.
   It also allows employers to pay a lower wage to workers age 16
to 19 with less than three months total job experience. The
subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the workers
were in certified training programs. The subminimum would be $3.35
beginning next April 1 and rise to $3.61 on April 1, 1991. The
provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.

<TEXT>
   A fetus carried by an Asian elephant for a
record two years is probably dead, say veterinarians at the San
Diego Wild Animal Park.
   ``The chances are essentially nil that she is carrying a live
fetus, but there's still an outside chance because she is
healthy,'' James Oosterhuis, park director of veterinary services,
said Monday.
   The average gestation period for Asian elephants is 618 to 648
days.
   The pregnancy of 19-year-old Jean reached 725 days Monday,
surpassing that of an Asian elephant that went 720 days before
giving birth at a German zoo.
   Veterinarians attempted an endoscopy on the pachyderm last week,
but the 5-foot instrument for getting a glimpse of the fetus wasn't
long enough. Park staffers located two longer instruments after
more than a dozen phone calls, but the endoscopy isn't needed
immediately because Jean appears healthy.
   Veterinarians had not decided whether to induce labor or allow
nature to take its course. They are concerned the fetus, which
weighs 185 to 200 pounds, could pass an infection to its 2{-ton
mother, Oosterhuis said.
   ``If she were sick and the going got tough, then we would have
to deal with it immediately,'' Oosterhuis said.

   WASHN: reduction. Yes?
   Q: Why did you commit to Dan Quayle so early for '92? You're
thought to be such a cautious, prudent man. Why did you shut off
your options so early?
   A: Because I thought that was the prudent and right thing to do.
   Q: Well, all right. Are you saying that Dan Quayle is your
choice right now, but you. ...
   A: Well, I'm not saying I'm running. ...
   Q: Well. ...
   A: _ right now. So we've got to get back to square one. I mean,
that _ that one. ...
   Q: Are you?
   A: (Laughing) I'm not saying whether I am or not. So we're
getting way out ahead of the _ of the _ where reality is. But I was
asked the question, and I answered it open, straight.
   Q: Are you saying he's your choice right now, but you leave your
options open for. ...
   A: Yeah _ no, I said he's my choice. Period. Yeah _ (name
inaudible) _ and then Frank.
   Q: When Egon Krenz first came to power in East Germany, you said
it was way too early to say whether he represented more of the
same, which seemed to be your sense at the time, or whether he
represented the leading edge of further reform. Seeing the dramatic
events unfold in East Germany, what is your conclusion about Egon
Krenz, his intentions and his direction?
   A: I think it's still too early to sum it up entirely. But, some
of what he has said about political reform is quite encouraging and
really contradicts the very early, I would say, global assessment
of the man. In other words, he _the early predictions were that
he's a hardliner in the mode of Mr. Honecker. And now, some of what
he is saying is quite different from that. And Mrs. Honecker's not
there any more, so you're seeing some changes _ (laughter) _
(laughing) _ you're seeing some changes.
   Q: (inaudible).
   A: Well, she's out as a minister, and another minister, and
you're beginning to see changes that might _ might _ (laughter) _
what are you guys laughing at? _ (laughing) _ a new order. So it's
_ it _ look, we've got to be _ this gets me back almost to Helen's
question. Things are happening very fast. The concerted opinion was
that this was going to be another hardliner in the mode of Mr.
Honecker. Now there's some signs that that's not the case. So we
will watch that very carefully.
   Yeah, Lesley?
   Q: If I may follow up, Mr. President, do you feel that things
have now gone too far in East Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Soviet
Union for the clock to be turned back, for a Tiananmen Square-type
crackdown? And do you feel any need to assist the West Germans in
all of this?
   A: Well, the West Germans have not requested assistance. And I
am in very close touch with the federal chancellor. And I'm most
anxious to talk to him when he returns from his six-day visit to
Poland. I talked to him just very recently, as a matter of fact,
about what we're doing. And that's why I _ I've stated rather
confidently that European leaders don't seem to agree _ when I
answered Helen's question _ with some of the political criticism I
get from Capitol Hill or elsewhere. So, I _ what was the first part?
   Q: Gone too far?
   A: Oh. No, I don't think you can ever say ``gone too far.'' I
mean, who predicted with certainty what would happen in Tiananmen
Square? But, I think it's gone too far to irreversibly _ I mean, to
set back these fledgling _ I d A: No.
   Q: Well, how committed are you? Why are you vetoing all of the
other programs?
   A: Because I can't in good conscience on this one suggest that
taxpayers' money ought to go to programs that compel abortion, and
hat has been the problem with the China program. And therefore, I
can't do that. ...
   Q: (inaudible) ... our money is ...
   A: _ I can't do it, and I'm sorry, but I am not going to change
that policy. I am strongly in favor, and always have been, of
family planning. I've been out front for family planning for a long
time, and as a member of Congress way back there. But, I simply
cannot support _ and I've asked the Congress not to try to make me
change a policy where the AID people will tell you it supports
compulsory abortion. I am not going to do that.
   Q: But, the American money is. ...
   A: And there's other things in that bill that I don't like, too,
Lesley. This _ this leveraging provision _ I mean, should I be told
by the Congress that I can't go and ask other countries to support
Poland? Should I?
   Q: I don't know about the leveraging. ...
   A: Well, I do, and that's one of the things that's wrong with
it. So I am concerned. Now, that's kind of a post-Iran-Contra
thing. They're saying you can't go get money for certain things.
But in Congress intervening in the president's authority like this,
they are asking me to accept things that I am not going to accept.

<HEAD>Bush Says Abortion Not Most Important Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that he doesn't
believe voters cast their ballots on the single issue of abortion,
nor is it the most important issue on his agenda.
   ``I think our party is broad enough to contain differing views
on this and I think the Democratic Party is,'' Bush told a White
House news conference.
   ``I don't believe most voters are single issue voters. There is
no evidence to support that, none at all,'' he said, citing data by
his campaign pollster, Robert Teeter, showing the issue of abortion
ranked between ninth and 14th on the list of what voters consider
most important.
   Bush said he had ``no intention of changing my position'' on
abortion.
   The president opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or endangerment to the mother's life. He opposes federal money to
fund abortions for poor women.
   ``Abortion divides,'' said Bush, acknowledging the volatile
atmosphere on abortion since the Supreme Court gave states
increased power to restrict it this year.
   ``Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not,'' he
said
   Bush recently vetoed a $157.6 billion funding package for the
departments of Education, Labor and Health and Human Services
because of abortion-funding provisions.
   ``It's just so personal,'' he said. ``I just come down more on
the side of life. ... I don't fault people who view this
differently. There's plenty of room for difference.''

<TEXT>
   The red star atop Hungary's neo-gothic
parliament building will be replaced next year by a weather vane,
which adorned the structure before the Communist takeover.
   The government decided this year to remove the red star _ the
symbol of Communist dominance _ from all public buildings as part
of Hungary's democratic reforms.
   The state news agency MTI said Tuesday the parliamentary office
has asked for those interested in the contract to remove the star
to submit bids by Nov. 20.
   The light in the star was extinguished last month and the star
will come down in spring.
   MTI said the removal would cost about $66,000. Officials would
like to reas remove it, MTI
said.
   The spherical weather vane that crowned the building before the
Communist takeover will resume its place atop the building's dome.
   During the 1956 anti-Stalinist revolt in Hungary, the rebels
tried to pull the star down, but MTI noted that ``the stunt, which
would have tested the skills of steeplejacks, failed.''
   Church restorers and roofers were among those who have indicated
interest in bidding for the contract, MTI said.

   Police have detained the editor of
Uganda's only independent English-language daily newspaper because
of an article that calls President Yoweri Museveni a liar, a
journalists' group said Tuesday.
   Samuel Katwere, editor of The Star, has been held without charge
since his arrest Monday, said James Namakajjo, president of the
Uganda Journalists Association.
   Namakajjo said Katwere, who became editor of The Star in
October, was being held because of a Sept. 22 article titled
``Telling Lies.''
   It said the managing director of the government-owned commercial
bank is paid hundreds of thousands of dollars annually as
compensation for his two children killed during Museveni's
five-year bush war that brought him to power, ``while masses who
lost more go without even the basic needs.''
   It also called the president a liar for defending the banker
against allegations he was being paid more than he is worth.
   Allegations were raised in Parliament in September that the
banker earned $331,663 in salary and other, unspecified
renumerations between March 1988 and June 1989.

   A European satellite launched Aug. 8 has recovered
from an early failure of its booster and has been reprogrammed to
provide accurate measurements of 100,000 stars, the European Space
Agency said Tuesday.
   Named Hipparcos after an ancient Greek astronomer, the satellite
failed to reach its planned geostationary orbit and has had to
undergo a complex revision of its mission involving ground stations
in French Guyana, West Germany and Australia.
   The further use of a U.S. ground station is being contemplated,
bringing the satellite's coverage to about 93 percent of the area
originally planned.
   The life of the satellite in its revised orbit is likely to be
limited by the reduction of electricity generated by its solar
cells, the agency said.
   The agency said it would give an evaluation of Hipparcos'
performance next year.

   One thing the people at Elvis Presley's
house never run short of is rumors, so they're putting out the word
early that the digging set to begin Wednesday night at Graceland is
nothing sinister.
   Crews are resealing the basement wall, that's all, said Todd
Morgan, a spokesman for the Presley residence and its souvenir
shopping center.
   The three-story, white-columned home, called Graceland, draws
600,000 tourists a year. Rumors that Presley, who died 12 years
ago, was alive set off a flurry of reported Elvis sightings a year
or so ago.
   Whenever construction projects get under way at Graceland, the
phones start ringing, Morgan said. ``The simplest of household
chores at Graceland become international headlines,'' he said.
   Morgan said work crews resealed the basement's back walls
earlier this year and now need to move around front where they
easily will be seen from Elvis Presley Boulevard as they dig a
trench beside Graceland.

   L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, the grandson of slaves, bid to
become the nation's first elected black governor Tuesday, and
fellow Democrat David Dinkins sought triumph as New York City's
first black mayor in off-year elections enlivened by the
combustible mix of race and abortion.
   Rep. James Florio was the heavy favorite to defeat Rep. James
Courter in the New Jersey governor's race and reclaim the office
for the Democrats after eight years of Republican control.
   In the sole congressional seat on the ballot, 11 candidates vied
to fill out the term of the late Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas,
killed in a plane crash last summer in Ethiopia.
   Wilder, his state's lieutenant governor, battled former attorney
general J. Marshall Coleman in a contest in the old capital of the
Confederacy that focused more on abortion than race.
   Dinkins, the 62-year-old Manhattan borough president, ran as the
man who could bring racial harmony to the Big Apple. Rudolph
Giuliani, 45 and a former U.S. Attorney making his first try for
elective office, hammered away at his rival's transfer of stock to
a son and his failure to file income-tax returns for four years two
decades ago.
   Big-city mayors on the ballot included Coleman Young in Detroit
and Kathy Whitmire in Houston, each seeking their fifth term; Don
Fraser in Minneapolis seeking his fourth and Xavier Suarez in
Miami, going after his third.
   Cleveland picked a new black mayor, choosing between City
Council President George Forbes and state Sen. Michael R. White in
a particularly bitter race. Forbes called his rival a ``slumlord.''
White said his opponent was a ``master of sleaze.''
   Democrat John Daniels was heavily favored to become the first
black mayor in majority-white New Haven, Conn.
   In Seattle, city councilman Norm Rice battled opponent Doug
Jewett in his drive for a similar distinction.
   Ben Nichols, a socialist, was favored to win election as mayor
of Ithaca, N.Y.
   Michigan decided the fate of two competing plans to raise the
state sales tax for education, one calling for a half-penny
increase and the other a two-cent rise.
   The Maine ballot included an advisory measure to ban cruise
missile testing in the state, while San Francisco, in danger of
losing its Giants baseball franchise, decided whether to build a
new $115 million stadium to replace Candlestick Park.
   President Bush campaigned for GOP candidates in Virginia, New
Jersey and New York in an election season that served as prelude to
1990, when 34 Senate seats, 36 governorships and all 435 House
seats will be on the ballot.
   But just as Republicans and Democrats watched the returns for
signs of partisan success, so, too, was the year marked by interest
in abortion and race _ with a heavy dose of negative campaign
commercials thrown in.

   The elections were closely watched for clues to shifting voter
sentiment on abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling
last summer that permits states to restrict the rights of women
seeking to end their pregnancies.
   Bush, in a news conference marking the first anniversary of his
own election, minimized the importance of abortion in this year's
campaign and said people ``are not for the most part single-issue
voters. They care about war and peace, they care about the
environment.''
   Even so, the issue played a role in New Jersey and New York, and
particularly in Virginia, where pro-choice and pro-life groups
bought television commercials to boost Wilder and Coleman,
respectively.
   In all three races, Republican candidates were thrown on the
defensive by their pro-choice opponents.
   Wilder made the issue the cornerstone of his candidacy, running
television commercials in October that accused Coleman of wanting
to ``take away your right to choose and give it to the
politicians,'' even on abortions in cases of incest and rape.
   His campaign challenged a decade of conventional political
wisdom which held that abortion was an issue best ignored by a
pro-choice candidate and best exploited by one with right-to-life
views.
   Courter and Giuliani both softened their original pro-life
positions as the campaigns wore on.
   The issue of race was largely silent in Virginia until the final
days, when Coleman suggested his rival had been the beneficiary of
a ``double standard'' in press coverage. Wilder's rebuttal:
campaigning on Saturday with a woman who said she was originally a
Coleman supporter, but changed her mind after his comments.
   The current governor, Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, is barred by
state law from seeking a second consecutive term.
   The New York race was to succeed three-term Mayor Ed Koch.
Dinkins defeated the outgoing mayor in a primary in which he
depicted himself as the man capable of calming the racial
antagonism that often flares in the city.
   Giuliani, who established a natiional reputation as a prosecutor
of white-collar criminals, said Dinkins needed to be investigated
for his failure to pay income taxes and for allegedly covering up
the details of a stock tranfer to his son.
   ``I don't want someone voting for me because I am white,'' he
said. I don't think that's right. And I think the same thing is
true of my opponent. No one should vote for him because he's
black.''
   Dinkins replied, ``I ask that nobody vote for me because I an
African-American, but I ask as well that nobody vote against me
because I am an African-American.''
   The New Jersey race was between two men who couldn't have been
less alike.
   Florio, the liberal Democrat, lost a gubernatorial primary in
1977 and came within 1,700 votes of winning the governor's job in
1981. The man who beat him, Thomas Kean, is stepping down after two
terms as required by the state Constitution.
   Courter, a conservative Republican was making his first try for
statewide office.
   Their race was nasty for weeks.
   Florio struck with campaign commercials in October that showed
Courter's nose growing longer and longer as a narrator ticked off a
series of alleged lies and misleading statements.
   Courter lashed back with a variation on the same theme: the
faces of the two men side by side, Florio's nose growing longer and
longer and his own shorter and shorter.

   WASHN: to accept.
   Q: May I follow up on the abortion. ...
   A: How many follow-ups do you get? (Laughter.)
   Q: This is my follow-up. In the China family planning program,
the American money would not have anything to do with abortion, and
also in the D.C. bill that you vetoed, the federal money would not
go to abortion. You seem to be saying you want to affect the policy
beyond the federal role.
   A:Well, look, there are many issues, and abortion divides. We
have room in our party for people that feel one way, pro-life or
pro-choice. The Democratic Party is the same way. I think everyone
knows that this is an issue that divides. But you say, is it the
most important issue for me? Absolutely not.
   Yes?
   Q: You're probably ready for this one, but you campaigned as an
environmentalist and said you were a strong environmentalist. Yet
on the issue of global warming, it seems that the U.S. is being
dragged kicking and screaming into trying to address this problem.
How do you respond to that?
   A: I respond to it by saying it's not true.
   Q: Why are you resisting the moves in this international
conference now?
   A: We're just standing off against extremes. We have a unanimous
communique out of that global conference. We have an outstanding
environmentalist in Bill Reilly. We have an outstanding scientist
in Dr. Bromley. They agree that our approach to all of this is
right. And I think we cannot be _ this policy of the environment
cannot be driven by the extremes. But I would like to take your
question to challenge the United States Congress to go forward on
the revisions to the Clean Air Act, on other initiatives that we
have supported, instead of sitting back there and carping about it.
And if they don't like our way, go ahead and try it and then add to
it in later years. But they sit there and argue back and forth with
each other, and nothing happens.
   In this global conference, I can tell you United States' science
is the best in terms of global warming. And we will be in the lead
as we are now with our science on global warming. But you can't
take a policy and drive it to the extreme and say to every country
around the world, ``You aren't going to grow at all.'' We've got to
use our science to help solve this problem.
   Yes, back there _ these two in the middle.
   Q: Mr. President, the gubernatorial campaigns, as you know, in
New Jersey and Virginia were dominated by the abortion issue. Some
pro-choice Republicans are disturbed with your current position.
What advice are you going to give Republicans legislators and
congressional candidates next year when the Democrats start
pounding on them on this issue?
   A: Well, they've already started. Those who favor _ favor the
pro-choice have already started pounding on them, and started
certainly pounding on me. But you see, one, I think our party is
broad enough to contain differing views on this. Secondly _ and I
think the Democratic Party is. You see that. You see that out there
in practice.
   Secondly, I don't believe that most voters are single issue
voters. There is no evidence to support that. None at all. Indeed _
I hate to talk about polls, because I don't believe them when I see
ugly things _ but I can tell you that that issue ranks about 9th to
14th, if you talk to a pollster like Bob Teeter. I can't remember
whether it was 14th or 9th, so I'm giving you a range there. But
people are not, for the most part, single issue voters. They care
about war and peace. They care about the environment. They care
about education. They care about anti-narcotics. They care about
crime in their neighborhoods. So when you see all this attention to
this question, I happen to think it's those that are
editorializing, the columnists, or some in the political arena that
think the voter is a one-issue voter. I don't agree with that, and
I've seen no evidence.
   Q: But if Republicans cling to the hope that you might change
your position, are they wrong that you're going to. ...
   A: I have no intention of changing my position. It's _ it's so
personal. It's so _ um _ I just come down more on the side of life.
I mentioned in my speech last year at the _ a year-plus ago _ of
adoption and what it's meant. And _ but I _ look, I don't fault
people that view this differently. As I say, there's a _ plenty of
room for difference. But it's not one, John, where people are as
single-issue, as you would _ as some would like to believe.
   Yes, Ellen?
   Q: Mr. President, your predecessor, Ronald Reagan, just came
back from a trip to Japan, where he collected $2 million for his
speaking engagements. Eventually, you're going to be an
ex-president. Is that the kind of behavior that you anticipate
yourself endorsing _ (laughter) _ accepting that kind of money?
   A: I will not have anything negative to say about President
Reagan _ if that's an invitation for this _ because I prefer to
emphasize the positive _ positive parts of that trip, talking
openly about the need for freer trade, the affection shown to him
by the Japanese people. It's important symbolism when it comes to
the _ when it comes to this relationship that sometimes has strain.
And what happens in the future? I don't know.
   Yes?
   Q: Excuse me, a follow up, sir?

<HEAD>Church of England Synod Supports Principle of Women Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England's General Synod voted
Tuesday in favor of the principle of women priests, the first step
toward the possible ordination of women by the state church.
   On the first day of a two-day debate, members of the General
Synod passed by a simple majority the first clause of a proposed
amendement to canon law to permit the ordination of women.
   The change was supported by all three branches of the synod, the
church's parliament. The bishops voted 30-17 in favor, the clergy
149-85 in favor and the lay members 144-78 in favor.
   The issue of women's ordination now goes to the 43 dioceses for
discussion by ordinary members of the church. This is expected to
start next year.
   It is unlikely the question of ordaining women will return to
the General Synod for a final vote until 1992, when it will require
a two-thirds majority.
   Some of the loudest applause during debate was given to the
bishop of Durham, the Right Rev. David Jenkins, who said:
``Ordination of women to the priesthood is not the end of the
world. If the Church of England's making a mistake were the end of
the world, the world would have ended long ago.''
   The bishop of Portsmouth, the Right Rev. Timothy Bavin, said he
would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally
passed, despite being a supporter of women priests. He said he did
not want to have to choose between favoring opponents or supporters
among his congregations.
   About 1,200 women have been ordained in Anglican churches,
mainly in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. The ordination
of women has been a major point of contention between Anglicans and
Roman Catholics in their ecumenical encounters.
   The Church of England has been debating the issue for two
decades, and some opponents among the clergy and laity have said
they will break away if women are ordained.
   The clause approved by the synod reads: ``It shall be lawful for
the General Synod to make provision by canon (church law) for
enabling a woman to be ordained to the office of priest if she
otherwise satisfies the requirements of Canon Law as to the persons
who may be ordained as priests.
   ``Nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be
consecrated to the office of bishop.''
   At the start of the debate, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of
women to proceed in the dioceses, despite remaining undecided on
the basic principle of women priests.
   ``I judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring
forward,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he is willing to
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir so long as the two
sides have ``something positive to talk about'' on the U.S. pln for
Mideast talks.
   Bush said he didn't know if or when Shamir intends to visit
Washington, but he is ``certainly willing to consider'' a meeting.
   Israel has given its qualified acceptance of the proposal by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for talks between Israelis
and Palestinians.
   Israel is asking for a half-dozen assurances, including a U.S.
promise to quit the talks if Israel walks out. Bush officials are
now looking for word from Egypt and the Palestine Liberation
Organization on their stands.
   Bush said Shamir is making a ``real effort'' to support the
Baker plan. As for a meeting, he said, ``I'd like to feel that ...
it would be constructive, that we'd have something positive to talk
about.''
   Under the Baker plan, talks between the Israelis and the
Palestinians are supposed to set the stage for an election on the
West Bank and in Gaza. The Palestinians elected in the territories
would negotiate five years of limited self-rule with the Israeli
government.
   ``There is still much to do and many details to be worked out
before it would be possible to put together a pre-election
dialogue,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``For
now, we look forward to receiving an Egyptian response.''
   Egypt's role is to convey the position of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Without PLO acquiescence, Palestinians on
the West Bank and in Gaza are unlikely to participate in Shamir's
election plan.
   Boucher said Israel's acceptance of the U.S. plan was ``a very
positive step ... a clear step forward.''
   But Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir, said after the
Cabinet action that without the assurances ``we will not enter into
these talks.''
   The Israeli demands include exclusion of the PLO and all of its
members from the deliberations.
   Boucher and other U.S. officials did not close the door on the
Israeli demands. Referring to them as ``assumptions,'' he said:
   ``We know that both Israel and Egypt are likely to request
certain clarifications or understandings about the process. We have
made clear to both sides that we're prepared to discuss these
issues.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A: Follow up? I don't know. This line? Do you want to take --
   Q: This is an invitation, sir, to ask your opinion of former
presidents being paid by private industry once they're out of
office.
   A: I have no problem with that, provided it's not overdone.
   Q: I'd like to return to. ...
   A: Everybody's got to make a living. (Laughter.)
   Q: Vice President Quayle for a minute. On Sunday, the Vice
President said that the Soviets retain expansionistic attitudes in
Central America, Afghanistan, and several other parts of the world.
He suggested that Gorbachev was a Stalinist, and also suggested
that the Soviet defense budget is growing while ours is declining.
Do you agree with those three assessments?
   A: That their defense budget is growing, yeah.
   Q: And that Gorbachev. ...
   A: I'd like to see them find a way to reverse that. And out of
the challenge that lies ahead to both Gorbachev and me, perhaps
there will be a way to reverse it. One way to do that, I think, is
through prudent arms control. The best way to do it is to do it
through success in the Conventional Force in Europe talks, the CFE
talks, because that's where _ that's dollar-intensive or
ruble-intensive, if you will.
   Q: The other two points, Mr. President?
   A: What were they?
   Q: That the Soviets are expansionist in Central America,
Afghanistan, Cambodia, and other parts of the world, and this is a
problem in our improving relations with the Soviets.
   A: Well, I've long been concerned _ and as I think I said when I
announced the Gorbachev meeting _ concerned about some of these
regional issues. And I think we'll have a real opportunity to
discuss the Soviet role in, you know, aid for Nicaragua, the one
country _ well, not the one, but one of the few that's swimming
against the democratic tide here. And it does not help US-Soviet
relations to have enormous expenditures supporting a dictatorship,
the Sandinista dictatorship. So, I think there's plenty of room for
discussion there. And I look forward to talking to the Soviet
leader, just as President Reagan did. But now we know it's a little
clearer, the election process coming forward, and I want to see the
election process succeed.
   Q: Well, my question goes. ...
   A: Where are your questions going?
   (Scattered laughter.)
   Q: Is the Soviet Union continuing to be expansionist around the
world?
   A: Well, I've told you, I've got concerns about certain areas,
just as they've raised concerns with us on certain things. Yes, I'm
concerned about continued support of Soviet weapons _ or Soviet
support _ I want to be careful because the question of weapons is
slightly complicated by how they get there and whether they're
coming out of Cuba and have long been in Cuban hands. I mean there
are some problems there. But I think _ look _ to suggest the
contrawise of that and that there are no problems that exist
between us, that everything is hunky-dory, simply is not reality,
and that's one of the reasons I'm looking forward to this visit.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, when you're bobbing around in the
Mediterranean next month, if Gorbachev should ask you to show
forbearance in the event he cracks down domestically or in the
event he feels it necessary to support a crackdown in Eastern
Europe, how will you respond?
   A: I'm not going to buy into that hypothetical question.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you've had a report yesterday on the POW@MIA
issue. I wonder if you can give us some specifics about what
General Vessey is accomplishing over there with regard to remains
coming back and when, how many more, when we'll see them. And also,
is there any information at all about people alive over there?
   A: No information at all about that. A new openness, according
to General Vessey, on the part of the Vietnamese leaders, a new
spirit, a stepped-up spirit of cooperation in terms of accounting
for remains. They're pointing out to him that they are confident
that there are no government holding facilities for remains that
maybe had existed in the past, pointing out to him that some
families, even, might be holding remains, some, you know,
individuals in Vietnam, hoping for some sort of gain if people are
sending _ putting bounty on these things or rewards out there. And
_ but I think the bottom line is he felt a _ he was quite
encouraging about the kind of cooperation he was receiving. He also
relayed to me what I think all of us know, that Vietnam keeps
sending signals that they want improved relations.

   Mayor James D. Griffin, running with the
endorsements of four parties, was a virtual shoo-in for re-election
Tuesday to his fourth, four-year term _ an unprecedented
achievement in New York's second-largest city.
   The only opposition faced by Griffin came from Liberal Party
candidate William Hoyt, a state assmemblyman who remained on the
ballot despite dropping out of the race after losing the Demoractic
nomination, and Wilbur Trammell, a former city court judge on whose
behalf a write-in campaign is being mounted.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Griffin, 60, had the Democratic, Republican, Conservative and
Right-to-Life nominations. Trammelll and Hoyt finished behind
Griffin in September's Democratic Party primary.
   In his campaign, Griffin emphasized major downtown redevelopment
_ including several new office buildings and hotels, waterfront
condominiums and Pilot Field, the city's highly-praised baseball
stadium.
   A former worker in the city's grain elevators, Griffin lost his
first election for city councilman in 1959, but was subsequently
elected to the state Senate.
   An enrolled Democrat, Griffin nonetheless has never been a
favorite of the Erie County Democratic Party. In becoming mayor in
1977, he beat out the party's challenger, Assemblyman Arthur O.
Eve, by running with the Conservative Party endorsement.
   In his last election in 1985, Griffin again beat out the
Democratic Party's challenger, city councilman George Arthur. This
time, he ran with the Republican Party endorsement.

Necessary</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 13 grafs new with arguments; picks up 7th graf pvs, Maurice

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was told today that jailing
a parent for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of a child who
may be abused or even dead is a necessary penalty to enforce
society's duty to protect defenseless children.
   ``Where will we be if the state cannot enforce'' such orders,
asked Assistant Attorney General Ralph S. Tyler of Maryland. ``Will
the most effective remedy (for assuring children's safety) be taken
away?''
   The court, in the case of a Baltimore woman jailed for refusing
to say where her son is, engaged in a spirited one-hour discussion
of the rights of children and constitutional safeguards against
self-incrimination.
   Tyler argued that Jacqueline Bouknight, in jail for more than 18
months for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts, is not being
denied her rights against self-incrimination protected by the Fifth
Amendment.
   Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfare
could hamstring juvenile courts, Tyler said.
   ``She has never claimed she cannot comply with the order, but
that she need not comply,'' Tyler said. ``That is a dangerous
extension of the Fifth Amendment.''
   But Bouknight's lawyer, George E. Burns, said the authorities
have another alternative to jailing the parent indefinitely for
contempt of court.
   She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a
three-year prison term, he said.
   ``It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' Burns said.
``It's not a matter of `we can't do it. We just won't do it'.''
   Child welfare groups and numerous state and local officials
joined in urging the court to uphold Bouknight's indefinite jailing.
   The mother's ``interest in avoiding any possibility of
self-incrimination simply does not outweigh the state's interest
and its obligation to protect'' the child, said a coalition of
groups representing gorvernors, mayors and other officials.
   The groups include the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the
National Governors' Association.
   Social workers last saw Bouknight's son, Maurice, in September
1987 when he was 11 months old. They fear he may be dead.
   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital on Jan. 23, 1987,
when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and
other injuries.
   Suspecting the infant had been abused, social workers put
Maurice in foster care and later obtained a court order giving the
city protective custody of him.
   City officials said Bouknight suffered from emotional problems
and was observed throwing Maurice into his crib during the infant's
hospitalization.
   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987,
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo
training in parenting skills.
   But nine months later, the social workers said Bouknight no
longer was cooperating with them. Moreover, they said Maurice's
father recently had been shot to death and Bouknight was using
drugs.
   The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28,
1988, after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in December that jailing her
for refusing to disclose the information violates her
constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suspended the effect of
that ruling and prevented her from going free while the Supreme
Court reviewed the case.
   Some have compared the Bouknight case to that of Elizabeth
Morgan, who was released from prison on Sept. 25. The Washington,
D.C., doctor was behind bars for more than two years for refusing
to let her daughter visit the girl's father, Morgan's former
husband.
   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, for
court-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her former
husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently has
denied.
   Among other groups supporting the contempt order against
Bouknight are Advocates for Children and Youth, the Juvenile
Protective Association and the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.
   The case is Baltimore Department of Social Services vs.
Bouknight, 88-1182.

   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops today said
no Catholic can responsibly take a pro-choice stand on abortion,
and they urged public officials to fight abortion.
   The resolution was approved overwhelmingly on the second day of
the fall meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The 300 leaders of the nation's 53 million Roman Catholics also
elected Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati as president.
Pilarczyk, like his predecessor, Archbishop John May of St. Louis,
is a social and theological moderate.
   The resolution on abortion said Catholics should give ``urgent
attention and priority'' to the issue in the wake of a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in July giving states more authority to regulate the
procedure.
   An overwhelming number rose from their seats when those in favor
of the resolution were asked to stand. In a break from the usual
practice, however, there was no request for a showing of those
opposed to the resolution.
   ``No Catholic can responsibly take a `pro-choice' stand when the
``choice' involves the taking of innocent human life,'' the
resolution said.
   ``We urge public officials, especially Catholics, to advance
these goals in recognition of their moral responsibility to protect
the weak and defenseless among us.''
   The Supreme Court ruling, in a Missouri case, provoked
pro-choice advocates to intensify ``efforts to defeat politicians
who do not support permissive abortion,'' the bishops' statement
said.
   Pilarczyk, vice president of the conference since 1986, was
elected on the first ballot to succeed Archbishop John May of St.
Louis, also considered a moderate. Archbishop William H. Keeler of
Baltimore was elected vice president.
   The 55-year-old Pilarczyk enjoys support among both the liberal
and conservative camps of the bishops' conference.
   On Monday, the leaders of the church opened their meeting by
plunging into the abortion debate and urging their flock to dig a
little deeper to support church programs.
   May issued a rallying cry against abortion in his opening
address, calling it an issue ``where clear-cut moral principle
stands tall above all else'' and comparing abortion to dropping a
6-month-old child in the Baltimore Harbor.
   The leader of a Catholic abortion rights groups called May's
remarks ``simply cruel and unusual punishment'' to all women who
have abortions, but said she was not surprised by the bishops'
renewed vigor on abortion.
   ``I think this meeting marks their re-emergence as a political
force on this issue,'' said Frances Kissling, president of
Catholics for a Free Choice in Washington.
   The bishops today also were to vote on a proposal to have laymen
lead Sunday services without priests. The measure was prompted by a
severe shortage of clergy.
   In electing Pilarczyk, the conference held to a tradition in
which no vice president who has sought the top spot has been turned
down.
   Pilarczyk said in an interview that the most important social
issues facing the church include the ``life issue'' of abortion and
euthanasia and economic issues such as Third World debt and the
rights of unions.
   The new conference president also said there is room for
flexibility in seeking legislation that does not entirely conform
to church teaching.
   For example, Pilarczyk said if the question was whether he would
support tolerating a law allowing abortion for rape and incest
victims for the greater good of prohibiting other abortions, ``the
answer is probably yes.''
   Pilarczyk was appointed auxiliary bishop of Cincinnati in 1974
and archbishop in 1982 after Cardinal Joseph Bernardin left for the
Archdiocese of Chicago.
   With a study showing Catholics contribute 40 percent less of
their income than members of other churches, the bishops on Monday
also ordered work to begin on a pastoral letter on church giving.

   Republican Sue Myrick, the first woman
mayor of North Carolina's largest city, tried to retain her seat
Tuesday against one Democrat who has never held political office
and another who became the focus of a write-in campaign.
   Craig Madans, 37, became the Democratic nominee last month when
city councilman Al Rousso, the only other candidate, dropped out of
the race. But Rousso resurfaced as a write-in candidate.

<TEXT>
   In 1987, Myrick unseated two-term incumbent Harvey Gantt by a
995-vote margin on a campaign pledge to improve Charlotte's clogged
road system. Last year, she successfully led a campaign for a $100
million highway bond issue.
   Deeply religious, Myrick, 48, has said she makes political
decisions by listening to ``the will of God first, the will of the
people second.''
   Madans, a textile executive who has never held political office,
criticized Myrick's handling of the Hurricane Hugo cleanup and her
``lone wolf'' style on some issues.
   Myrick criticized Madans' admitted use of marijuana and cocaine
during his college days in a campaign that became increasingly
bitter. In the final days of the campaign, she refused to talk to
reporters.

   A man who was a conscientious objector in the
United States during the Vietnam War has gone to jail in Israel
rather than serve his adopted country as a soldier in the occupied
lands.
   Stephen Langfur joined a small but growing number of Israelis
who refuse to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began 23 months ago.
   ``We have been watching the uprising, on television and on the
streets, and he has been upset at what he has seen,'' said his
wife, Noga Treves Langfur. ``When he came to the point where he
couldn't stand seeing the way Palestinians are being mistreated, it
was natural that he didn't want to take part in this.''
   Langfur, 48, was sent to a military prison Nov. 1 to serve 21
days, an army spokesman said. He would not discuss specifics of the
case and refused to permit an interview with Langfur.
   According to the army, 72 men have been jailed for refusing duty
in the West Bank and Gaza. A support group for them, called Yesh
Gvul, puts the total at 91.
   ``We believe it is on the increase,'' said Yesh Gvul director
Peretz Kidron. ``The army is very embarrassed by this, of course,
and seems to be responding with a crackdown.''
   Kidron said Yesh Gvul, Hebrew for ``there is a limit,'' has
found the army giving repeated sentences to men who refuse duty in
the occupied territories. He said one had spent more than 100 days
in jail.
   The army spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said the
number refusing is very small compared with those who willingly
serve in the lands Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war.
   ``There have always been a few who refuse orders, even when
there is no war, and we have a judicial system to deal with them,''
he said.
   Newspapers say many reservists, instead of refusing service in
the West Bank and Gaza, avoid it by making arrangements for other
assignments. The daily Yediot Ahronot said thousands had used that
means.
   Israeli soldiers or settlers have killed at least 612
Palestinians since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and 142 have
been killed by other Palestinians, most of them on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have died.
   The regular army of 130,000 is supplemented by 310,000
reservists, like Langfur, who are called up each year for about 40
days of active duty. In Israel's last war, the invasion and
occupation of Lebanon in 1982-85, about 160 soldiers were jailed
for refusing service in the neighboring country.
   Langfur's decision was ``a natural outgrowth of his moral
beliefs,'' his wife said.
   He was born in Cedarhurst, N.Y., earned a doctorate in
philosophy from Syracuse University and taught at Temple University
in Philadelphia and the University of Houston.
   In the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, he won conscientious
objector status ``on moral grounds,'' Mrs. Langfur said.
   After moving to Israel in 1979, Langfur worked as a tour guide
to support his family, which now includes a daughter, Tali, 11, and
son, Benny, 9.
   ``He studied the history of Israel closely and caught the sense
of the miracle of the creation of the state,'' his wife said. ``He
still has this feeling.''
   Like most immigrants, Langfur completed military training and
has done reserve duty within Israel. He was not called to Lebanon
and when orders came last month for duty in the territories, he
refused.
   ``He feels, and I feel, that there's no way to peace but to come
to some kind of terms with the Palestinians,'' Mrs. Langfur said.
``The way it is now can't go on.''

   Voters were given an unprecedented choice
between two black candidates Tuesday in an election to pick a
successor to popular Mayor George Voinovich.
   The two hopefuls, City Council President George Forbes and his
youthful former aide, state Sen. Michael White, fought a bruising
campaign that was notable as much for its nastiness as its
historical significance.
   Forbes accused White of being a slumlord and of beating two
former wives, while White denounced Forbes as a ``master of
sleaze.''
   The non-partisan race between the two Democrats was made
possible when Voinovich decided to step aside to seek the 1990
Republican nomination for governor.
   Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown were among the other Ohio cities
choosing mayors Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cleveland's first black mayor was Carl Stokes, who won office in
1967. Stokes, who served one term and subsequently became a
municipal judge, briefly considered running for mayor this year.
   He didn't, and Forbes and White finished first and second in an
Oct. 3 primary that included three white candidates. In a city
nearly evenly split between whites and blacks, the two focused much
of their campaigning on the city's predominantly white west side.
   The five-week campaign epitomized Cleveland's bare-knuckle style
of politics. White, 38, who has been married three times, defended
himself against allegations by his first two wives that he beat
them. He also was put on the defensive when 200 city code
violations were found in seven houses he owned.
   Forbes, 59, defended himself against charges of ethical
conflicts involving his City Hall duties and his private law
practice, and brushed aside allegations that police and other city
workers were defying the city charter by becoming personally
involved in the campaign on his behalf.

   Let's see. Here we _ here, here.
   Q: Mr. President, when did your Defense Secretary and CIA
director learn about your upcoming meeting with Mr. Gorbachev?
   A: I don't know exactly when they learned about it.
   Q: Early on? July?
   A: No.
   Q: October?
   A: No. Not in July.
   Q: Why did you keep it from us?
   A: Well, I've already explained why I did it the way I did, and.

   Q: Did you feel they couldn't be trusted. ...
   A: No.

   Yes, Frank?

languishing despite your bipartisan approach, and yet you're going
to pursue them. What are you going to do to pursue them? What are
you going to do differently?
   A: To do what?
   Q: To pursue your initiatives in Congress, your domestic

   A: Try to urge you people to urge them _ join me in urging,
calling out for congressional action _ a plea to move forward with
the Clean Air Act, and the drug program, and the ethics
legislation; editorial pounding to get them to do what they ought
to do _ support the president as he tries to move this country
forward in these areas _ and not let them dominate debate by
blocking everything I try to do. Look, I'm a realist. ...

capital gains again. The votes are there. The majority of the House
passed it. The majority of the Senate wants it. Please, join me in

happen. ... (laughter).
   A: But it can happen! I mean, come on. You'll get on me when I
do stuff wrong. Get on them! Say, ``Why are you holding up the
Clean Air Act?'' ``Why can't you move ethics legislation?'' ``Why
don't you go forward on the drug program, or on the educational
initiative?'' And if they say it's not enough, take a step, get
your foot in the water. Do something! The American people know why
this deficit isn't down. It's not down because they see, four to
one, that the Congress is to blame. Join me in this noble crusade.
   Q: (inaudible) bipartisanship or alone, sir, what are you going
to do differently?
   A: Exhort. What else can I do? Veto and exhort. Send stuff down
I can't accept, it goes back. A president has to show that that's
how he _ that's his responsibility. But he's got to encourage the
American people to get on their _ on their representatives to do

   The United States is returning $567 million in
frozen assets to Iran, a move President Bush said today he hopes
will prompt Tehran to push for freedom for American hostages in
Lebanon.
   But administration officials maintained that the transfer of
money, which has been held for nearly a decade, was unrelated to
the plight of the hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Moslems.
   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by
American banks against Iran. Most of those claims were settled in
the past few weeks.
   As a result, U.S. officials said Monday night, the leftover
assets will be returned to the Bank of Iran. An additional $243
million will be transferred to a special fund to back up other
American claims against the Persian Gulf country.
   Bush, speaking at a morning news conference, said he didn't know
what effect the money transfer would have on officials in Iran.
   But, he added: ``I hope that they will do what they can to
influence those who hold these hostages.'' He said he carries ``the
fate of the hostages with me every single day.''
   Referring to financial claims and counter-claims between the
United States and Iran, the president said: ``I'd like to get this
underbrush cleaned out now.''
   While Iran has made some ``positive statements'' recently, he
said the administration has so far run into ``dead ends'' in
working behind the scenes to free the hostages in Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, former President Jimmy Carter said he also believes
``the time has come for the Iranian assets to be unfrozen.''
   ``I don't think we ought to be fearful,'' Carter told reporters
during a visit to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
at the Capitol.
   ``It might lead ultimately to flexibility on the hostages,''
Carter said.
   On a related issue, Bush condemned supporters of Gen. Michel
Aoun, the Christian general who is opposed to a peace plan for
Lebanon ironed out by Moslems and Christians in the war-torn
country. Aoun's backers harrassed the Catholic patriarch who backed
the plan.
   ``I am deeply offended by the Aoun supporters who tried to
humiliate the patriarch yesterday,'' the president said. `I just
hope that before I leave this job that I can in some way contribute
to the question of peace in Lebanon.''
   The move on the Iranian assets followed talks in The Hague last
week between Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser,
and Iranian officials. A special tribunal set up in the Dutch
capital in 1981 has been considering conflicting claims.
   U.S. officials said the decision to return the assets through
the Bank of Iran was unrelated to the eight Americans being held in
Lebanon by a pro-Iranian faction.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani offered help last month in
getting 18 Western hostages freed if the United States released
billions of dollars in frozen assets or helped settle the cases of
three Iranians captured by Christian Lebanese militiamen in 1982.
   Bush administration officials immediately responded they would
not engage in negotiations over the hostages and called on
humanitarian grounds for the release of all the hostages.
   Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, said Sofaer's
talks with Iranian officials in The Hague last Thursday and Friday
concerned only claims matters. ``We are making no deals with anyone
about the hostages,'' she said.
   About $800 million had been held in a special fund against
claims of American banks. ``Since most of the bank claims were
settled over the last several months, $567 million could be
returned to Iran and the remainder was transferred to a special
security account to back up other claims,'' a U.S. official said.
   That account is maintained at a minimum of $500 million, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of
the arrangement that led to the release of American hostages held
for 444 days in Tehran after seizure of the U.S. Embassy by
militants.
   There are several other claims issues outstanding, including
Iran's demand for compensation for military equipment purchased
before the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered.
   The United States transferred $9.9 billion in frozen assets to
the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks'
settlement, some $3.8 billion had been transferred to Iran.
   The $810 million involved in Monday's action had been reserved
for U.S. bank claims against Iran.

   Kathy Whitmire looked for a record-tying fifth
consecutive two-year term Tuesday as mayor of the nation's
fourth-largest city as she faced former two-term mayor Fred
Hofheinz.
   Mrs. Whitmire and Hofheinz, who held the top city job in the mid
1970s, were the most prominent contenders in the non-partisan
election that included five others on the ballot.
   Also vying for the mayor's seat were Rosie Walker, 48, a
businesswoman; Greg Rosenberg, 23, a machinist running with the
Socialist Party, Ted G. Walker, 54, an attorney; Shelby Oringderff,
71, a retired pastor and teacher; and James Lee Kelley, 33, a real
estate agent.
   Polls taken in the final week before the election showed Mrs.
Whitmire pulling away from Hofheinz and holding a comfortable 59
percent to 15 percent lead with about 20 percent of the voters
undecided.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The election marked the second time Mrs. Whitmire, 43, faced a
former mayor. In 1985, she trounced Louie Welch, whose mayoral
longevity record she is trying to match.
   In her most recent election two years ago, Mrs. Whitmire _ an
accountant by trade and the first woman elected in a citywide race
when she won the controller's job in 1978 _ won her fourth two-year
term against token opposition.
   Hofheinz's father was colorful Harris County Judge Roy Hofheinz,
the prime mover behind building of the Houston Astrodome.
   Mrs. Whitmire and Hofheinz, a 51-year-old lawyer, engaged in
numerous debates throughout the campaign, with Hofheinz charging
that the incumbent had become complacent in office, lost track of
federal money, rewarded supporters with city contracts and lost the
support of the police department.
   Mrs. Whitmire accused her opponent of mudslinging and criticized
his record as mayor.
   Mrs. Whitmire took office at the height of the oil boom, but
then had to deal with declining revenues and a shattered economy
when oil prices collapsed. She touted her handling of city finances
through the tough times and boasted that unemployment, which peaked
at some 13 percent, is now around 5 percent.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights from
President Bush's news conference Tuesday.
   
   YEAR IN REVIEW
   
   On the eve of the first anniversary of his election, Bush said
he was ``pleased that our administration has come together rapidly
with good people and with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose.''
   Internationally, he said that ``important decisions have been
made for freedom and we've supported those movements.''
   Domestically, Bush said he was more convinced than ever ``that
we can ... give hope to the homeless and help to the needy,
inspiration to millions of Americans who want to reach out and help
their neighbors.''
   ``I enjoy it,'' he said of being president.
   
   HOSTAGES
   
   Bush said he hoped the decision to return $567 million in frozen
Iranian assets will get the ``underbrush cleaned out'' and lead
eventually to freedom for Americans held hostage by Iranian-backed
forces in Lebanon.
   He said he hoped Iranian officials ``will do what they can'' to
influence the hostage-holders and said the United States was
``continuing behind the scenes to follow rabbit trails'' in hopes
of winning freedom for the hostages.
   
   ABORTION
   
   Asked about his vetoes of legislation expanding the conditions
under which Medicaid funds can finance abortions, he said, ``I have
no intention of changing my position. It's so personal. I just come
down on the side of life.''
   Asked about the emergence of abortion as a major issue in
Tuesday's gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, Bush
said, ``People are not for the most part single-issue voters.''
   
   NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING
   
   Asked about the role of negative campaign commercials in
Tuesday's elections, Bush said he believes ``the American people
have a way of sorting out what's fair and what's not fair, what's
ugly and what's not ugly.''
   He said he hoped future elections would be ``a little more
positive.''
   
   RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS
   
   Bush said he would ``veto and exhort'' Congress until he gets
action on his legislative programs and, asking, ``What else can I
do?'' blamed Democrat majorities in the House and the Senate for an
impasse on reducing the federal deficit.
   Bush conceded Democrats ``have the votes'' to have forced him to
pull back his plan to reduce capital-gains taxes but pledged,
``I'll be ready come the fall of 1990.''
   
   EASTERN EUROPE
   
   Reacted to a comment Monday from ex-President Carter that he was
slow in his response to Eastern European pro-democracy movements by
challenging critics to produce specific proposals ``other than
triple the spending'' to aid those movements.
   He said he felt that his cautious approach had the support of
allied leaders in Western Europe and that ``I don't think you can
contain now the people's aspirations for freedom by going back to
totalitarianism.''
   
   RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW
   
   Bush said he could not say ``everything is hunky dory'' until he
is convinced the Soviet government has reined in its defense budget
and expansionist desires. Bush said he would raise those issues
when he meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month.
   
   GLOBAL WARMING
   
   The president said the United States was not joining a call by
more than 60 nations for capping carbon monoxide emisisons by the
year 2000 because ``this policy of the environment cannot be driven
by extremes.'' He called on Congress to expedite action on his
proposed rewriting of the Clean Air Act.
   
   LEBANON
   
   Bush said that followers of Lebanese strongman Michel Aoun were
``totally out of order'' in forcing the country's Maronite Catholic
patriarch, Bishop Nasrallah butros Sfeir, to kiss a picture of Aoun
a day after the patriarch endorsed a Moslem-Christian accord
opposed by Aoun.
   
   QUAYLE
   
   Said he would not say if he would seek re-election in 1992 but,
if he does, Quayle was ``my choice'' as his running mate.

   Democrat John Daniels, a five-term state
senator, was heavily favored Tuesday to defeat Republican
Alderwoman Robie Pooley and become the first black mayor of this
overwhelmingly Democratic city.
   Also in the race for mayor was a Green Party candidate, Matthew
Borentein.
   In Hartford, Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry, also a Democrat, was
expected to easily win re-election to her second term. Her
Republican opponent was Rosemary Z. Cardwell.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Daniels, 53, entered the race for mayor a month before the
incumbent, five-term Mayor Biagio DiLieto, announced he would not
seek a sixth term.
   In the primary, he faced a former top city administrator, John
DeStefano, who managed to narrowly win his party's endorsement
despite a lack of political experience.
   A majority owner of a plumbing business and a college football
referee, Daniels ran a campaign of what he called inclusion,
describing himself as the candidate who could best bring the city's
diverse neighborhoods together.
   He raised about $400,000 in contributions, a record for a
mayoral race, loaning his campaign $88,000 of his own money.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 10-to-1 in this city
of 127,000, where blacks make up about 35 percent and Hispanics
about 12 percent of the population.

   WASHN: question? (Laughter).
   Where did someone else go wrong?
   We've been trying to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion. I don't
think _ I don't _ I'm _ look, if I make a big mistake, I'll admit
it. But I don't think so when it comes to the approach to the
budget. We've got some honest differences on some things, and maybe
with George Mitchell, there's an honest difference on capital
gains, for example. But we put that in our budget proposal. It was
in there with a certain revenue figure next to it. I don't think I
``went wrong.'' That's my responsibility.
   Here's what I believe. And I think that there has been a little
bit of a partisan shift that occurred up there. When you hear them
all come out with a rather unflattering word on the same day to
describe my leadership, you begin to wonder _ including the
national chairman of the Democratic Party _ you begin to wonder
what goes awry. But let's leave aside the politics. I'll be ready,
come the fall of 1990, and let's move the legislative process
forward.
   Q: This was supposed to be groundwork for cooperation next
year's budget, which was going to be the real tough one. Have we
lost all hope of that now?
   A: Well, I think a lot on '91 depends on what happens, you know,
in the last few days here; what kinds of decisions are made.
   Q: Staying on the budget for a minute, the Pentagon feels it
can't live with the consequences of a sequester apparently, and
you've issued a statement last week saying that you're prepared to
manage the government under those circumstances. As a person who
campaigned as a candidate who would defend the Pentagon and keep
defenses strong, how do you explain this to the people who
supported you on the basis of. ...
   A: I tell them please get in touch with the Congress and do what
we suggested back there when we had that _ those meetings. Please
help us keep the defenses of this country strong, but if the _ if
that is frustrated by the inability to get an acceptable
reconciliation bill, I have no choice, and I think the Pentagon
leaders understand that.
   We _ Dick Cheney has done a superb job. He has fought with
diminishing resources for a sound Pentagon budget. And it troubles
me to have Congress insensitive, and also to add in _ I mean, it's
tough _ look, I know it's tough to cut systems. But you go to cut
them, and Cheney makes some very tough decisions backed by the
president, and then the Congress trades around and adds them back
in. And so it's a question of, you know, staying with what we find
is the priority for this defense program and trying to stay with
it. But, I've got to live with the system also.
   Q: Mr. President, in the back.
   Q: Are you willing to meet with Prime Minister Shamir when he
comes to Washington?
   A: Uhhh, whether he's coming or not, I'm not sure. Certainly
willing to consider it. And he is giving _ I think there's a real
effort now to work out support for the Baker points _ the Baker
proposals _ and I'd like to feel that a meeting would be held and
that it would be constructive, that we'd have something positive to
talk about.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President _ Mr. President, last week, you said in
response to the Nicaraguan decision to end the cease-fire, that you
would keep your options open. And yet, the best headcounters _ in
fact, most of the worst headcounters on the Hill _ all say you
don't have the option of new military aid to the Contras. So, isn't
that, in effect, a meaningless statement?
   A: Well, I'll tell you _ no, because I think one option now is
to encourage in every way we can these talks that will result in a
cease-fire. I worry about what Ortega has done. The only good thing
about it _ everybody sees that he is _ he is swimming against the
tide, and I think that it's much clearer to some who, in our
hemisphere, who are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.
But, I'm not going to give up on hoping that they can get back to
the status quo ante here.
   Q: But, you don't believe, sir, that you still have the option
of renewing military aid to the Contras, do you?

<HEAD>Banned Films From 1960s to be Shown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All films made in the 1960s and
banned after Soviet tanks crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms in
1968 will be shown in Czechoslovakia, the Communist Party newspaper
said Tuesday.
   Government cultural officials were quick to add, however, that
the decision was not meant to rehabilitate the liberalization
period.
   The decision to ban the films ``was motivated especially by the
needs of (political) consolidation after the years of crisis in
1968-69,'' the party daily Rude Pravo said.
   ``This decision, however, does not mean any kind of reversal in
our distribution policy, reappraisal of historical events or the
films themselves,'' Rude Pravo said.
   During the 196Os, ``the Czech wave'' of young filmmakers
represented by Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel swept Europe, winning
two Oscars for ``Closely Observed Trains'' and ``Shop On Main
Street.''
   After the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968, Forman decided to
live in the United States, where he scored successes with ``One
Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Amadeus.'' Menzel fought a long
battle with authorities at home.
   ``This move is certainly a positive one, albeit a little bit
belated,'' said Jan Foll, a film historian and member of a
commission which managed to lift the ban this summer.
   ``This ... leaves the drawers clean, there are no films banned
anymore,'' said Alois Humplik of the Czechoslovak Film Distributing
Agency.
   To many moviegoers in Czechoslovakia, the 1960s still represent
``the golden era'' of arts and culture. Film production has been
received with much less enthusiasm in the last 20 years.
   Eleven of the old films will be shown in general distribution,
while 13 others will be shown in film clubs throughout the country,
the daily said.
   Among them will be ``The Party And The Guests'' directed by Jan
Nemec and featuring Zdena Salivarova and writer Josef Skvorecky.
   The decision ``will make it possible for a better and more
objective determining of values inside and outside the times, will
strip them of the smell of cheap sensation and myth, while
contributing to an objective view on the rich and complex period of
the sixties in our film,'' said Hviezdoslav Stefan, director of the
Czechoslovak Film Institute.

   City Councilman Norm Rice, seeking to become
Seattle's first black mayor, faced City Attorney Doug Jewett on
Tuesday in an election dominated by an anti-busing school
initiative.
   Jewett helped draft Initiative 34, dubbed ``Save Our Schools''
by supporters, and made it the prime vehicle of his campaign to
become Seattle's first Republican elected mayor in 24 years.
   Also on the ballot in municipal elections around Washington
state were races between Tim Strege and Karen Vialle for mayor of
Tacoma and Sheri Bernard and Rob Higgins for Spokane mayor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Seattle's anti-busing measure went from a commanding lead in
early polls to a 50-50 proposition a week before the election under
a fierce attack from city, state and school officials in this city
of 500,000.
   The initiative asked but did not require the independently
elected and self-budgeting city School Board to halt mandatory
busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $4.3
million to $4.5 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for
``magnet'' programs to attract a racial balance in school
enrollment.
   In the officially nonpartisan contest to succeed Mayor Charles
Royer in Seattle, Rice trumpeted his Democratic party credentials,
including endorsements from Royer, Gov. Booth Gardner, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott and virtually all of the
city's state legislators.
   Jewett, a maverick moderate who briefly supported former Rep.
John Anderson for president in 1980 and once tried to form a third
political party, downplayed his GOP affiliation.
   The two were allies in their first political forays, with Rice
supporting Jewett for election as the city's chief legal officer in
1977 and Jewett supporting Rice for one of the nine City Council
seats the next year.
   Royer, who did not seek re-election to a fourth term, has
accepted a job as director of the Institute of Politics at the John
F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

<TEXT>
   Congressional inaction on a bill raising the
federal debt ceiling threatens the government with default on
Thursday for the first time in its history.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said after closed-door
meetings on Monday that leaders are hoping to pass a new debt
ceiling in time for President Bush to sign it on Wednesday.
   ``We have decided to concentrate on extension of the debt
ceiling while we are looking at other issues,'' Foley said after
leaders tried to break the deadlock that has blocked passage of the
higher debt ceiling and a big deficit-reduction bill.
   At a news conference today, Bush said he is prepared to let
automatic spending cuts triggered Oct. 16 remain in effect unless
Congress approves a deficit-reduction bill to his liking. The
automatic-cuts processs ``is not easy but its real deficit
reduction,'' he said.
   Bush said he would sign an unamended bill that produces deficit
reduction in the $14 billion range, which is considerably more than
Congress and he agreed on last spring. ``If it's all loaded up with
a lot of special projects, I won't sign it,'' he vowed.
   The president said he is not about to give up on his cherished
capital-gains tax cut, which is stalled in the Senate over the
threat of a Democratic filibuster. ``The votes are there. The House
passed it. A majority of the Senate wants it,'' he said.
   One effect of the stalemate over the debt limit came Monday when
the Treasury postponed its weekly bill auction. Then, today, it
announced the postponement of $40 billion in debt auctions this
week.
   ``The postponement of these auctions is necessary because
Congress has not completed action on legislation to increase the
statutory debt limit ... '' the Treasury said.
   The latest postponment involved auctions of $10 billion in
three-year notes today, $10 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday
and $10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. In addition, the
Treasury planned to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management
bills on Thursday.
   The Treasury had planned to offer $16 billion in three- and
six-month bills Monday, but postponed the sale ``because Congress
has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory
debt limit.''
   The Treasury lost further borrowing authority Oct. 31 when the
debt limit reverted from $2.87 trillion to $2.8 trillion. Because
it already has reached the lower limit, the government faces
default on some of its debt as early as Thursday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that if
Congress fails to increase the limit by Tuesday, ``the government
will run out of cash and default on Nov. 9'' when about $13.8
billion in Treasury bills mature.
   ``Each day that Congress fails to act, however, will cause
additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting
in higher interest costs to the taxpayer,'' Brady said in a speech
to Maryland bankers.
   ``To avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default,
immediate congressional action is imperative.''
   Disagreement over several issues are holding up the legislation.
   Foley indicated one major issue to be resolved is whether
legislation repealing or scaling back catastrophic health coverage
for retirees should be attached to the debt-ceiling bill or
considered as part of the deficit-reduction package.
   The House has passed a $3.1 trillion debt ceiling, but action
was stalled in the Senate by Republican demands that it be
accompanied by a capital gains tax cut, a top priority for Bush.
   The White House abandoned that effort last week and Democratic
and GOP Senate leaders were discussing legislation Monday to
increase the limit. However, any bill approved by the Senate likely
would differ from the House version and efforts to reach a
compromise would require more time.
   Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary, told
reporters last week that plans for $40 billion in additional
borrowing this week probably would have to be postponed if Congress
doesn't complete action on a new debt limit by Tuesday.
   These auctions include $10 billion in three-year notes Tuesday,
$10 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year
bonds Thursday. In addition, the Treasury plans to sell $10 billion
in 36-day cash management bills Thursday.
   Lack of congressional action forced the Treasury last Wednesday
to suspend new sales of U.S. savings bonds and of special
securities for state and local governments.

<HEAD>Integrated Curriculum Could Recruit More Teachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Association of American Colleges said
Tuesday that institutions of higher education can help alleviate a
shortage of qualified teachers by more aggressively attracting
undergraduates to the profession.
   ``Few institutions are trying seriously to recruit large numbers
of more able students into teaching or provide them with more
challenging and substantive programs,'' said Joseph Johnston,
association vice president for programs.
   More liberal arts majors could be recruited if colleges and
universities combined undergraduate arts and science programs with
education courses, the association said.
   Education courses also should be added to the general-education
curriculum, which is usually taken in the first two years of
college before the student declares a major, the group said.
   By adding an education course, colleges and universities might
recruit students who have not seriously considered teaching, or who
even have ``some aversion'' to it.
   Integrating non-education courses with education training will
produce ``bright, broadly educated'' graduates with ``command both
of the subjects to be taught and of the ways in which they can be
taught effectively,'' said Johnston.
   The suggestions in the association study, ``Those Who Can:
Undergraduate Programs to Prepare Arts and Sciences Majors for
Teaching,'' differ from two influential 1986 studies by the
Carnegie Corp. of New York's Task Force on Teaching as a Profession
and by the Holmes Group.
   The earlier studies recommended prospective teachers be required
to earn an undergraduate degree in an academic discipline before
undertaking professional training at the graduate level.
   The Department of Education predicts the demand for new public
school teachers will rise from 128,000 in 1988 to 174,000 in 1995.
Only 8.8 percent of the 1988 first-year students plan to pursue
careers in elementary or secondary schools.
   As recently as 1980, 34 percent of new college graduates who
were certified to teach had completed baccalaureate degrees in the
arts and sciences. By 1984, that number had fallen to 19 percent,
the report said.
   Johnston said the association's report, supported by the
Rockefeller Foundation, is the result of a three-year study that
included a national survey of four-year institutions with
teacher-certification programs for arts and sciences majors.

   WASHN: do you?
   A: Uhh, it would be extremely difficult to get the money, if
that's what you're saying, yeah.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, Nancy Reagan says that you went to see her and
said you agreed that Don Regan should leave as chief of staff, but
that when she asked you to go to President Reagan, you said that
was not your role. Number one, is that the way you remember it? And
number two, now that Quayle is vice president, if he thought there
was someone who was not serving you well, do you agree that it's
not his role to come and tell you that?
   A: No, I think it's his role to tell me anything that's on his
mind, which is exactly the relationship I had with President Reagan
and that's the way I worked as vice president.
   Q: Mr. President, could you just answer the. ...
   A: No, I can't help you on that. I don't want to get into that
one _ (laughter). (Laughs) What was the next question, why? Never
mind. (Laughter.)
   Q: Mr. President, given that today is Election Day, I wonder if
you're satisfied with the level of political discourse you see, if
you think that this negativism that's being raised in one campaign
after another is excessive, and if you feel you can do anything
about it yourself, given that your last campaign was quite negative
or critical, if you prefer that word?
   A: I think everybody would prefer the positives. What some
consider negative, others consider factual. So, you always have a
judgmental problem there. But, I'm not sure there is much that a
president can do about it in terms of _ I don't want to inhibit a
candidate from taking his case to the people or her case to the
people in any way he or she sees fit. On the other hand, I think
the American people have a way of sorting out what's fair and
what's not fair, what's ugly and what isn't ugly. And I have great
confidence in that, that they're right this election day a year
ago. I think they sorted through some of these allegations that
this was the ugliest, dirtiest campaign, and I think they voted on
a more positive basis than that.
   Q: Mr. President, how _ coming off of Ken's question, though _
how do you respond to those who suggest that the negative
campaigning that started earlier in this campaign than usual is a
legacy of '88, when it was shown to be successful?
   A: Well, I don't say anything started in 1988 that hadn't been
taking place in '86 or '84 or '82 or '80 or so _ you know _ and if
you look into history, you're going to have certain things that are
considered negative. I don't have to stand here and defend the
campaign of 1988. I'd be perfectly prepared to do it, but I was
elected. I put confidence in the American people, their ability to
sort through what is fair and what is unfair, what is ugly and what
is unugly. And be as positive as possible, but while people were
running around, you know, in campaigns talking about _ talking
about ads this year _ the candidates have been out there taking
their case on various _ various issues out there. So, I _ I think
we're _ I think there's a little bit of a Beltway syndrome here in
terms of this intense focus on negativism. And, yet, if their trend
is that way, maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets a
little more positive.
   Q: How would you do that?
   A: Well, say I think it ought to be a little more positive.
(Laughter). I mean, what else can you do? I'm certainly not going
to legislate it, and certainly not going to try to dictate to a
candidate how he or she, you know, reacts in a certain situation.
But, there will be _ I suppose there'll be a lot of interpretation
on one candidate or another, and we'll all go back to whether there
needs some other way to approach this. But when you get right down
to it, I do not want to see legislation try to get into this
question. It gets into a censorship mode that I just would feel
very uncomfortable with.
   Ann, and then I've got to go.

   President Bush, in an election-anniversary
news conference, claimed a successful start for his presidency on
Tuesday and voiced hope that the return of $567 million in frozen
assets to Iran will eventually help lead to freedom for American
hostages in Lebanon.
   The president said he would ``veto and exhort'' Congress until
he gets action on his legislative programs, exclaiming, ``What else
can I do?'' as he blamed Democrat majorities in both House and
Senate for an impasse on reduing the federal deficit.
   Much of the session revolved around complicated foreign policy
matters as Bush dismissed criticism _ most recently from former
President Carter _ of his policies toward eastern Europe. He said
the administration is dealing properly with the tumultuous changes
there, and that his opponents just want to spend more money on aid.
   Bush returned to the podium after ending the televised news
conference to rebuke militant Christians in Lebanon for grabbing a
Catholic patriarch at his home and manhandling him for endorsing a
compromise political accord.
   He said that behavior was ``totally out of order'' and urged
that all foreign forces be withdrawn from Lebanon and warring
factors be reconciled.
   The president said the release of Iranian funds might get
``underbrush cleaned out.''
   ``I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,''
Bush told reporters. He said he knew of no reason to be encouraged
at this time, however, on an issue that has bedeviled his
predecessors and complicated the first 10 months of his term.
   Bush arrived with a statement marking Wednesday's anniversary of
his election and saying ``we've had so far a successful first year
in office.''
   ``I enjoy it; I like the challenge,'' he said of his 10 months
in office.
   Later, in response to a question about today's off-year
elections, Bush said he hoped future campaigns would be ``a little
more postive.''
   Asked about the emergence of abortion as a critical issue in
gubernatorial elections being held in Virginia and New Jersey, Bush
asserted ``that issue ranks about 9th to 14th.''
   ``People are not for the most part single-issue voters,'' Bush
said of an issue that often seemed to cut against Republicans
during the campaign period. He added, ``I have no intention of
changing my position. It's so personal. I just come down on the
side of life.''
   Bush recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision
expanding the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions
for poor women in cases of rape or incest. ``It supports compulsory
abortion,'' he said. ``I am not going to do that.''
   Currently, such funds can be used only if the mother's life is
in danger.
   Bush rejected criticism that he has failed to exert leadership
in wordwide efforts to combat global warming. He said he was not
prepared to join some 60 nations meeting in The Netherlands on a
resolution to cap carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 saying
such a move is too early and too extreme.

<HEAD>Eds: Polls close at 8 p.m. EST; material below dash will stand.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic Rep. James Florio, who lost the
closest governor's race in New Jersey history eight years ago,
entered Tuesday's election confident he would reverse his fortunes
and beat Republican Rep. James Courter in an unusually nasty
contest.
   Election officials said voter turnout around the state ranged
from moderate to heavy, and was especially strong in Florio's home
district of Camden.
   The race to succeed Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean was Courter's
first and Florio's third. In the final weekend, Florio, an
eight-term congressman, held a 24-point lead in an independent poll
that gave him a better than 2-to-1 advantage among independent
voters.
   As he grew increasingly confident of his lead, Florio devoted
most of his campaign stops to key Assembly districts where close
battles were waged for control of the Legislature's 80-member lower
house, where the Republicans held a 41-39 margin.
   At stake was control of the Legislature which will control
redrawing congressional districts after the 1990 census.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Florio, 52, ran fourth in the 1977 Democratic primary, and lost
the 1981 general election to Kean by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.3
million cast, a margin of less than one-twelfth of 1 percent. Kean
is barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   Political observers said Florio softened a brusque and aloof
personality that hurt him in 1981, and ran a nearly flawless
campaign that kept Courter on the defensive. Courter, 48, appeared
troubled by internal disarray and stumbled on delicate issues, such
as abortion and homosexual rights.
   Abortion entered the campaign after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in July gave states more power to restrict abortions.
   Florio, who once opposed abortion, immediately condemned the
erosion of abortion rights. It took Courter weeks to remold his
long-held anti-abortion stand and assure New Jersey's largely
pro-choice electorate that he would not impose his personal views
on voters.
   Each gubernatorial candidate spent $5 million, the maximum
permitted under the state's public financing law. Most was spent on
television commercials in the costly New York and Philadelphia
markets as the candidates exchanged charges over the environment,
corruption and taxes.
   Florio, and then Courter, accused each other of repeatedly lying
on the campaign trail. Both ran commercials showing their
opponent's nose growing like that of Pinocchio.
   Florio, who wrote the federal Superfund cleanup law, repeatedly
attacked Courter's environmental record in Congress and the
Republican's plan to cut premiums by deregulating the insurance
industry to increase competition.
   Courter called for changes in New Jersey's death penalty law and
promised to fight for tough laws to combat illegal drugs. Florio
said the current capital punishment law was adequate.

   WASHN: to go.
   Q: Mr. President, President Nixon's public comments about his
meetings with Chinese leaders seem to imply that the Chinese
believe that now it's time for the U.S. to act if we want better
relations with the Chinese. Was there anything that the former
president told you in private that encourages you, thinking that
relations with the Chinese will improve? And anything we can do?
   A: The Chinese have a slogan, ``He who ties the knot should
untie it.'' The Chinese still feel that we tied the knot and thus
should untie it. I don't feel that way. President Nixon's visit to
China was very helpful because he was an unofficial visitor; he is
respected in China as a ``lao pengyou,'' old friend; he is the man
who opened a relationship with China when things were
extraordinarily difficult; not just a lack of communication, but go
back to history and take a look at the _ you were in the last
vestiges of the Cultural Revolution where, you know, many, many,
many people, hundreds of thousands reportedly lost their lives. And
so he went there at a difficult time. He saw the fundamental
importance of this relationship, as I do. He could speak quite
frankly to the Chinese leaders, and they, in turn, spoke very
frankly to him. And I think he made the point that we didn't tie
the knot. Now, I think that helps.
   Because of the respect that the leaders in China have for
President Nixon, I think that visit was very constructive. He
carried no messages from me, he was not on a, you know,
semi-official mode or anything _ a mission or anything of that
nature. But I think I have a better feeling of where Chinese
leaders stand at this point because of having been debriefed by
President Nixon. I wish there were some positive steps that I could
suggest to them that they take.
   There are some things, that I will keep private, that I have
quietly recommended. And we'll see where it goes. But this
relationship is important to us. As those of you who know my views
on this question, I have never favored the concept of a ``card'' _
playing a Soviet card, playing a Chinese card. The relationship has
to stand on its merits.
   Having said that, there is enormous geo-political reasons for us
to have relations with the People's Republic of China. And yet,
there is this affr convening those Taif meetings, and for the
legislators _ to the legislators that are _ that attended _ the
courage that they showed in going there. And the quest for freedom
_ I mean, the quest for peace _ in that country was so _ you just
feel it in what those legislators are hoping to accomplish.
   And then along comes these followers that I would term totally
out of order in going in there and trying to humiliate the Maronite
patriarch, and it is just totally counter-productive. And I _ I
hope that we can find a way to build on the new election, build on
_ and Syrian willingness to get out, move those troops out.
Withdraw all foreign forces from Lebanon, and I'm talking about all
foreign forces; reconciliation under President Moawad; and the
reform _ implement the reforms that have been spoken to _ addressed
in Taif _ and therein lies a formulation for peace.
   But you're talking to one who feels the question of Lebanon all
the time. I've been there. I've seen it as a peaceful crossroads in
always troubled corner of the world. And I just hope that before I
leave this job, that I can in some way contribute to the
restoration of peace in the Lebanon.
   Thank you all, very much.

   Space shuttle Discovery will lift
off after dark on a secret Thanksgiving week military mission, the
first of three dazzling nighttime launches scheduled here in four
weeks.
   NASA announced the Nov. 20 Discovery launch date Tuesday after
shuttle managers concluded a two day-review that assessed the
readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the global tracking network
and all other aspects of the mission.
   The space agency said the liftoff would occur during a four-hour
period starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night launch in 32
shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public until
nine minutes before launch to make it harder for Soviet
reconnaissance ships to track the shuttle.
   Martin Marietta also announced Tuesday that it will launch the
first commercial payloads on its huge Titan 3 rocket on the night
of Dec. 8. They will be communications satellites for Japan and
Great Britain.
   NASA earlier announced the scheduled after-dark launch of space
shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18, to deploy a communications satellite
and to track down and return to Earth a science satellite that has
been in orbit more than five years.
   The late Discovery and Titan launches are necessary to place the
satellites in desired orbits. The Columbia liftoff is timed to put
the shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved.
   While Discovery's crew is scheduled to be in space on
Thanksgiving, Columbia's 10-day mission will have its astronauts in
orbit on Christmas.
   The trio of night launches should provide a brilliant fireworks
display for rocket watchers for hundreds of miles around.
   When Atlantis lifted off on the last shuttle night mission in
November, 1985, its 700-tail of fire was clearly visible from Key
West, Fla., to Georgia, and in Fort Myers, 150 miles away on
Florida's southwest coast.
   Discovery's payload on the Nov. 20 flight will be a $300
million, 2{-ton satellite for monitoring Soviet missile tests and
eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications, said
reliable sources who requested anonymity. Another team of Discovery
astronauts launched a similar satellite in 1985.
   The crew for the upcoming mission is: Air Force Col. Frederick
C. Gregory, the commander; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot;
and mission specialists Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

   The East German Cabinet resigned today amid
growing calls within the Communist Party's ranks for reform and a
change in leadership.
   The entire 44-man Cabinet stepped down, spokesman Wolfgang Meyer
said. The government will remain in office until Parliament elects
a new council of ministers. He did not say when that would be.
   The Cabinet, led by Premier Willi Stoph, has little real power
of its own but implements policy of the Communist Party's ruling
Poliburo, which also was under pressure to step down.
   The Politburo met today to discuss ways of stopping the exodus
of East Germans to the West. The governing Central Committee was to
meet Wednesday to consider further changes aimed at stopping the
exodus.
   About 5,000 people marched in East Berlin to protest election
fraud and call for free elections, and leaflets passed out called
for more protests.
   A parliamentary committee rejected a proposed travel law that
would have allowed East Germans to travel in the West for 30 days a
year, saying it did not go far enough.
   The East Berlin newspaper Junge Welt, organ of the country's
Communist Youth organization, said today leaders ``should resign
without any delay'' to make way for a new Politburo and a new
Cabinet that will implement reforms.
   Dresden's Communist Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer also urged the
resignations, as did a member of Leipzig's Communist city
government, Bernhard Knupp, and three small parties that have been
allied with the Communists.
   The Politburo normally has 21 members, but two lost their jobs
Oct. 18 and the new Communist Party leader, Egon Krenz, has said
five others will be replaced this week.
   Communist Party sources said today they expect the reform-minded
Dresden party chief, Hans Modrow, to be elected to the Politburo.
Modrow has been mentioned as a possible new premier, replacing
Stoph.
   Despite Krenz's promises of change, East Germans continued to
pour into West Germany and were arriving today at a rate of about
120 an hour.
   West German federal border police said 28,000 refugees had
arrived by late this morning in the latest surge, which began early
Saturday when East Germany's Communist leaders began allowing free
exit via Czechoslovakia.
   Police spokesman Karl Heinz Horndasch said the East Germans were
being taken to 56 temporary shelters nationwide.
   About 500,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig on Monday night in
what has become a weekly ritual, and more than 200,000 others took
part in street protests in at least six other cities.
   The marchers demanded free elections and the legalization of
opposition groups, challenging the Communist Party's political
monopoly.
   They also ridiculed a draft of the proposed travel law.
   Parliament's constitutional committee today said the law ``does
not meet the expectations of citizens ... and will not achieve the
political credibility of the state,'' the official ADN news agency
said.
   The committee called for another law that, among other things,
would lift the need for exist visas. It also called for an
emergency Parliament session to discuss the tense situation in the
country.
   So far this year, more than 175,000 East Germans _ more than 1
percent of the population of 16.6 million _ have moved to West
Germany by emigrating legally, escaping or failing to return from
approved trips abroad. West Germany gives them automatic
citizenship and help in starting new lives.
   The unexpected decision to let East Germans out through
Czechoslovakia created the first free route to the West since the
Berlin Wall went up in 1961. In Leipzig on Monday, protesters
shouting ``The Wall must go!'' braved driving rain. Banners
demanded ``Free Elections'' and ``Travel Law without Restrictions.''
   Michael Turek, a Lutheran Church pastor in the southern
industrial city of 650,000, said by telephone that about 500,000
people marched. ADN said members of New Forum, the largest
pro-reform group, addressed the crowd.
   A mammoth rally Saturday in East Berlin, where the crowd was
estimated at 1 million, was the largest protest in the country's
40-year history.
   ADN said 70,000 people marched in Dresden on Monday, 60,000 in
Halle, 50,000 in Karl-Marx-Stadt, 25,000 in Schwerin, and several
thousand each in a several other towns.
   In Dresden, the march was authorized by authorities and led by
the reform-minded party chief, Modrow, and Mayor Wolfgang
Berghofer. ADN said it was the first sanctioned demonstration in
the city.

<HEAD>Falwell to Stop Publication of Monthly Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has decided to stop
publication of his monthly Fundamentalist Journal with the December
issue, a spokesman says.
   The magazine, started by Falwell in 1982, ``did not make money
and it's not something that Rev. Falwell was willing to personally
put in the time and energy to make the magazine stand on its own,''
the spokesman, Mark DeMoss, said.
   Circulation, paid and unpaid, was about 70,000, he said. He was
unable to give a percentage of paid subscribers. A year's
subscription, 11 issues, cost $14.95.
   DeMoss said it cost about $750,000 a year to publish the
magazine.
   The magazine staff was told of the decision Monday, DeMoss said.
The five people involved with the magazine probably will be laid
off, he said.
   The Moral Majority, which Falwell founded, stopped publishing
its monthly newsletter when it was disbanded earlier this year.
   Falwell is meeting with other officials this month to discuss
the future direction of the ministry, which has been making
financial cuts this year, despite what officials say are record
revenues approaching $135 million.
   More than 500 jobs have been terminated since January.
   ``He's asked that his staff evaluate everything we're doing to
determine how strategically each operation relates to one of three
areas _ Thomas Road Baptist Church, Old Time Gospel Hour and
Liberty University _ and furthermore, our goal is that everything
we do in these three areas have some impact on world
evangelization,'' DeMoss said.

<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Attention focused on Virginia, New Jersey and New York City
today as voters decided the outcome of campaigns testing attitudes
on race and abortion and trying the public's tolerance for negative
appeals.
   As candidates wound down their campaigns Monday the emphasis was
on voter turnout, with Democrats warning against over-confidence
and Republicans vowing to surprise pollsters who show them trailing.
   Democrats L. Douglas Wilder and David Dinkins were hoping to
break race barriers _ Wilder campaigning in Virginia to become the
first black elected governor of any state and Dinkins bidding to
become New York City's first black mayor.
   In the New Jersey governor's race Democratic Rep. James Florio
looked like a solid bet to defeat Republican Rep. James Courter.
Turnout was described as moderate to heavy, and especially strong
in the Camden area, Florio's home district.
   Dinkins and his Republican opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, voted
early in New York City.
   Despite his lead in pre-election polls, Dinkins declined to
predict victory when he voted on upper Riverside Drive. ``I hope we
prevail, of course,'' said the Democratic candidate. Giuliani said
he was confident.
   Election officials said turnout was heavy in all parts of the
city, predicting that 60 percent to 65 percent of eligible voters
would cast ballots.
   Early reports from Virginia pointed to a heavy turnout. ``We're
on roller skates,'' said Alice Lynch, the voter registrar in
Richmond. ``It seems like a tremendous turnout. I think it's going
to be a record in Richmond anyway.''
   President Bush, asked at a White House news conference about the
potential impact of the abortion issue on today's elections, said:
``People are not for the most part single-issue voters. They care
about war and peace, they care about the environment.''
   Bush dismissed suggestions that the negative tone this year is a
legacy of his 1988 presidential campaign. ``I don't have to stand
here and defend the campaign of 1988,'' he said, adding that ``the
American people have a way of sorting out what's fair and what's
not fair, what's ugly and what isn't ugly.''
   The president said any role he might have in making campaigns
``a little more positive'' would be limited to persuasion. ``You're
certainly not going to legislate it,'' he said.
   Pre-election polls bolstered the Democrats' hopes in Virginia
and New York. Wilder had an edge over Republican J. Marshall
Coleman while a New York poll said Dinkins had a double-digit lead
over Republican Rudolph Giuliani.
   ``Our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way,'' said
Coleman. ``All we have to do is get the vote out.''
   ``Turnout is very important,'' said Wilder. ``Every Democratic
election here has to depend on turnout and hopefully it will be
there.''
   While race wasn't raised directly in either contest, both
Coleman and Giuliani complained of a double standard, implying
their Democratic opponents were being judged leniently because they
are black.
   ``David Dinkins has a history of getting away with things that
others don't get away with,'' Giuliani said Monday as he insisted
the election had become ``a referendum on integrity.''
   Coleman took a similar tack in Virginia last week.
   Voters also were choosing mayors and city council members in
cities large and small, as well as state legislators in Virginia
and New Jersey.
   The candidates included long-term incumbents like Coleman Young
in Detroit and Kathy Whitmire in Houston. Socialist Ben Nichols was
favored to win election as mayor of Ithaca, N.Y., while Norm Rice
in Seattle and John Daniels in New Haven, Conn., were bidding to
become the first black mayors of their cities.
   There were 56 propositions on ballots in 10 states, giving
voters a chance to decide on issues ranging from funding for
education in Michigan, whether to build a new ballpark in San
Francisco, smoking in Greensboro, N.C., and cruise missile testing
in Maine.
   Whichever party claimed the most victories from the sparse
off-year lineup was sure to read the results as a harbinger of
1990, although there was no sign of the emergence of any national
issue other than abortion, a volatile question whose long-term
impact was far from clear.
   President Bush campaigned for Republican candidates for governor
in New Jersey and Virginia and for mayor of New York City. But
pre-election polls gave Democrats hope for a sweep of the three
races and the chance to claim voters were rejecting the Republican
president along with the candidates he tried to help.
   The campaigns were markedly nasty in tone with the candidates
for governor of New Jersey calling each other liars and rivals in
Virginia and New York questioning each other's ethics. There was
slim hope any conceivable results could undermine candidates' faith
in the power of attack commercials.
   While race was the question that focused attention on Virginia
early in the campaign, Wilder upset many expectations when he made
his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign.
   Wilder's stand caught Coleman, an opponent of legal abortions,
by surprise. As the campaign progressed Coleman conceded he was
being hurt by the abortion issup 3,874.

<TEXT>
   The City Council's acting president, once
considered a top mayoral prospect, has been convicted of accepting
nearly $48,000 in kickbacks from two businessmen for help in
getting city contracts.
   Ben Woods, 47, resigned from the council hours before a federal
jury convicted him Monday on 17 of 22 counts, including extortion,
racketeering, conspiracy and tax evasion.
   U.S. District Judge Alan N. Bloch ordered Woods to forfeit
$47,727 _ the amount in kickbacks he was convicted of receiving _
under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act.
   Woods' co-defendant, businessman Michael Hartman, 38, was
convicted of conspiracy, racketeering and filing false corporate
tax returns. Hartman's firm, Ablebuilt Construction Co., was
convicted of racketeering.
   The racketeering and extortion counts alone carry 20 years in
prison each. Woods' sentencing was set for Jan. 17.
   Woods was accused of taking $19,600 from Hartman to help the
contractor get city housing contracts and expedite payments on a
project. Prosecutors also alleged Woods accepted $36,727 from
Joseph Wozniak, a businessman who testified for the government, to
help Wozniak sell concrete sealants to city agencies.
   Woods was elected acting council president in May 1988 when
Sophie Masloff left the post to become mayor upon the death of
Richard Caliguiri.
   In resigning, Woods said the time had come to turn the council
over to ``others whose personal matters do not detract from the
critical issues facing the people of Pittsburgh.''

<TEXT>
   New York Timesman James Reston, sage of
American journalism, says he doesn't join those who wring their
hands and ask where the giants of yesterday are. He was around, he
says, when the giants were Hitler and Stalin. He's had enough of
giants.
   Reston does wonder, as he retires, what happened to the idea
that people in government were supposed to set the standards, not
just shrug off their misdeeds with an ``everbody-does-it.''
   He's not surprised that George Bush is turning out to be a
cautious president.
   ``You get from George about what you see,'' he says. ``I know
that family. I lived up the street from his mother and father for
10 years. George is not the kind of guy to run a revolution, but he
won't do anything stupid.''
   Reston does raise an eyebrow over the president's weekend
declaration that he would run again with Dan Quayle if he decides
himself to seek re-election.
   ``If presidents go on choosing people like Dan Quayle and
telling us they're the best available, you're bound to have
problems,'' Reston says.
   After all, he points out, a country of two or three million
``produced Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Washington and Ben Franklin. I
can't believe we're getting anything like the best people in
government today.''
   Reston retired Friday, on his 80th birthday, half a century
after he joined the Times. He is writing a book of memoirs.
   He's an old sportswriter, and fond of saying so. He started for
the Springfield Daily News, in Ohio, in 1932, for $10 a week and
was a publicity man for Ohio State University in 1933, a traveling
secretary for the Cincinnati Reds in 1934 and an Associated Press
man in, he recalls, a rathole of a bureau in London from 1937 to
1939, when the war was fomenting and the Times hired him away.
   He spent most of the rest of his life observing Washington. For
34 years, what Reston's column said was important to Washington. He
did his own thinking, took the long view, was generally optimistic.
He retired without fanfare, but shared some parting ideas in a
telephone interview.
   He doesn't think America suffers from a shortage of great men.
Rather than a giant, he likes people like Harry Truman: ``They knew
what they didn't know.''
   The presidents ``who have gotten in the most trouble in the last
40 or 50 years are those who thought they could do everything on
their own and thought they didn't need a State Department and could
run it out of the White House,'' Reston says.
   ``Look where the giants got us in the world, Stalin and Hitler.
I think we can do without giants. If we just get a lot of pretty
smart guys around and argue it out we've got a better chance of
coming out all right.''
   He would like to see a return to ``the idea that people in
government are supposed to be the models who set the standards for
personal conduct. That idea has kind of gone by the boards for some
reason or other.'' Now, ``they say, `Well, Everybody does it.'''
   Reston doesn't join Ronald Reagan in wishing the 22nd Amendment
could be erased from the Constitution. In his last year in office,
Reagan often said he thought it was a mistake to limit presidents
to two terms.
   ``I don't like the idea of people being in power too long,''
Reston says. ``They tend to get corrupted or lazy.
   ``Reagan ran downhill at the end of his second term. Even Ike
did.'' And in England, Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher, after 10
years in office, ``is beginning to get a little schoolmistressish.''
   Reston says newspapers are better than ever. Competition from
broadcasting has forced them to do what they should _ ``report the
causes and consequences of things, not just the event itself.''
   He says it is healthy when people don't like newspapers.
   ``We're not cheerleaders,'' he says. ``It's our business to
carry the news, the way the mailman carries the mail.''
   But he salutes the power of television to wring changes.
Newspapers wrote about injustice to the blacks for years, but the
pictures of police turning their dogs on demonstrators made the
difference.
   ``If you had TV coverage, the first and second world wars would
have ended sooner,'' he says.
   Television is what's forcing change in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union. People there see the rest of the world and begin to
think it's crazy that they ``have to line up for 10 hours to get a
turnip.''
   But the revolution is just beginning, he says. It took a century
and a civil war for America to accommodate to its states' rights
problems.
   ``The Soviet Union is now running into states' rights problems.
It's going to take a long to resolve and, if the Russians can do it
without a civil war, they'll be very lucky.''

   Anti-Communist marchers, striking workers and
clashes between police and protesters vied Tuesday with a
scaled-down military parade on Red Square as the Soviet Union
celebrated the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
   Even President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tempered the Revolution Day
festivities by saying the nation's economic problems hang like a
``sword of Damocles over us.''
   A column of about 5,000 marchers paraded peacefully through
Moscow to challenge Communist Party authority, while a few miles
away, Gorbachev and other leaders celebrated the 72nd anniversary
of the revolution reviewing the traditional show of military force.
   Activists in the southwest republic of Moldavia said police
broke up a crowd of thousands of would-be protesters and beat some
of them. The military part of the parade in its capital, Kishinev,
was canceled.
   In the Arctic city of Vorkuta, striking coal miners joined the
official celebration, but carried slogans demanding more
independence and that the government fulfill promises of better
living and working conditions.
   In some trouble spots, such as the Caucasus republics of Armenia
and Georgia, state-run media said traditional parades were
canceled. Boris Sokolov, an activist from the Baltic republic of
Latvia, said a small group of people burned a red Soviet flag in
the center of Riga, the capital.
   Gorbachev, interviewed by Soviet TV atop Lenin's Mausoleum in
Red Square, acknowledged that many Soviets feel threatened by food
shortages and the disorganization of the consumer market.
   ``When all this is hanging like a sword of Damocles over us, it
is very important we do not forget the main thing, that this is the
way we have chosen to follow,'' he said, referring to the Greek
legend in which a sword was strung by a single hair over the head
of Damocles, a royal attendant, to show the precariousness of power.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet leadership has not yet been able to
replace fully the administrative system of the past, and ``thus
there exists a loss, or a weakening of control. Shall we go back?
That would be a mistake, the greatest mistake.''
   The anniversary marks the day in 1917 when the Bolsheviks under
Lenin seized power from a provisional government that had ruled for
about eight months after Czar Nicholas II abdicated.
   Those who marched more than four hours in the unofficial column
made clear they believed the revolution had gotten them little but
food shortages, pollution, and the KGB secret police.
   ``We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing having
changed for the better, and this is our protest,'' said Taisya
Shlyonova, a retiree. One placard characterized communist rule as
``72 years on the road to nowhere.''
   Police supervised their route from northwest Moscow to the
city's Olympic stadium less than two miles from Red Square, where
they held a rally. Organizers had reached an agreement with city
officials not to head for Red Square, and roads to the center were
blocked by double lines of police in case they changed their mind.
   Grassroots groups marched in official parades in several Soviet
cities last year, but this apparently was the first
counterdemonstration of any size permitted on Revolution Day.
   Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman for the Moldavian People's Front
organization, said by telephone from Kishinev, the republic's
capital, that police beat people in a crowd of thousands who
gathered near a monument to national hero King Stephen the Great
near the parade route before dawn.
   He said more were beaten by police who dispersed a crowd of a
couple of about 100 People's Front supporters on Lenin Prospekt.
   Officials canceled the military part of the parade, but a
demonstration of workers went off as scheduled. Following that,
Rozhgo said, thousands of People's Front supporters marched the
parade route with slogans condemning the police and the republic's
leadership.
   He did not know how many people were injured or detained by
police, but said that most of those detained were released within
hours.
   In Vorkuta in the Soviet Arctic, coal miners who have been on
strike for two weeks joined the official celebration, but with
their own banners, said city strike committee spokesman Pavel
Belyaev.
   The slogans called on the government to fulfill the promises it
made in July to end a walkout, criticized bureaucracy, and demanded
more independence.
   Strikers met on the eve of the holiday with Coal Ministry
Mikhail Shchadov, but did not agree to return to work. Belyaev said
only regular maintenance was done at the striking mines Tuesday,
and it was unclear when the strike would end.
   In Latvia, where local People's Front organizations declared the
Bolshevik Revolution was a coup that curtailed the country's
development of democracy, the official Latinform news agency
reported no disturbances. Activists reported Lvov, a hotbed of
Ukrainian activists, was quiet as well.
   The parade on Red Square, held under a leaden sky with
temperatures just above freezing, was more low-key than in previous
years.
   No strategic missiles were in evidence. The military part of the
parade, including more than 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and
paratroopers, a speech by Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, a
rumble of distant cannon fire and a show of military hardware, took
slightly more than 30 minutes.
   The military hardware took only five minutes to rumble through
the medieval square, leaving behind clouds of smoke and the smell
of diesel fuel.
   A 90-minute march of thousands of people carrying officially
approved banners, paper flowers and balloons followed.
   Several slogans demanded an end to extremism in the tense
relations between Soviet ethnic groups. One poster, protesting
increasing prices, showed a vacuum cleaner, labeled ``prices,''
sucking rubles away from a working man.

   Turnout was heavy today as L. Douglas
Wilder's bid to become the nation's first elected black governor
went to the voters after a race in which abortion and negative
campaigning emerged as major issues.
   ``We're on roller skates,'' said Alice Lynch, registrar in
Richmond, describing the activity in her office. ``I think it's
going to be a record in Richmond anyway.''
   Wilder, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, and J.
Marshall Coleman, the Republican candidate, flew across the state
Monday to warn supporters against complacency and too much reliance
on polls showing Wilder ahead.
   ``We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory,'' Coleman told
about two dozen volunteers at Richmond's airport.
   Wilder, pointing to an overcast and drizzling sky at a state
Capitol rally in the afternoon for about 100 supporters, said
everything was sunny. ``It's only in perception,'' he said.
   The weather was cloudy this morning.
   Campaign workers on both sides staffed telephone banks Monday to
call potential supporters and urge them to vote.
   Coleman, a former attorney general, spent the day with Sen. John
W. Warner, R-Va., and was met in Richmond by the Republican
candidate for attorney general, Joseph B. Benedetti. The GOP
nominee for lieutenant governor, Edwina P. ``Eddy'' Dalton, was
campaigning separately.
   Wilder and his running mates, Donald S. Beyer Jr. for lieutenant
governor and Mary Sue Terry seeking re-election as attorney
general, stayed together and were joined by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
and former Gov. Charles S. Robb, now a U.S. senator.
   While race was the question that focused attention on Virginia
early in the campaign, Wilder upset many expectations when he made
his support for abortion rights a central theme of his campaign.
   Wilder's stand caught Coleman, an opponent of abortions, by
surprise. As the campaign progressed Coleman conceded he was being
hurt by the abortion issue.
   The campaign has gotten acrimonious at times.
   The GOP candidate has aired a commercial portraying his
Democratic opponent as insensitive to rape victims, and Wilder has
inveighed against Coleman for invoking the name of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in a televised debate because
he said Coleman urged a veto of a state holiday honoring King.
   In Roanoke on Monday, Wilder said he felt ``exceedingly good''
about the chances for a Democratic sweep of the state's top three
offices.
   But he also played down a Richmond Times-Dispatch poll on Sunday
showing him 9 points ahead of Coleman _ 45 percent to 36 percent _
with 19 percent undecided.
   Coleman said he has the most effective grass-roots organization
in state history and that his workers were out to ``energize the
precinct organization.''
   ``Our tracking shows the undecideds are breaking our way,''
Coleman said. ``All we have to do is get the vote out.''

   Prince Charles and Princess Diana got an
extravagant colonial welcome Tuesday as they began their visit to
this British territory that has been shaken by the approach of
Chinese rule in 1997.
   A 21-gun salute reverberated over Hong Kong's famed harbor as
the couple stepped off their plane to be greeted by Gov. Sir David
Wilson and his wife.
   The welcome came despite a flare-up of anti-British sentiment
this summer, when London made clear it will permit only a fraction
of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people to settle in Britain after the
communist Chinese take over.
   Charles and Diana then boarded the governor's yacht for the
short trip across the harbor for an arrival ceremony that included
brightly colored lasers flashing across the sky, a variety show and
a traditional Chinese fan dance.

   Actor Willem Dafoe says he cannot identify with
the Greek prizefighter he plays in ``Triumph of the Spirit,'' an
Auschwitz survivor who survived the camp by fighting other inmates
to death.
   He told Model Magazine for its December issue that he met Salamo
Arouch, the man the movie is based on, and found him to be
different from the character he played.
   ``The Salamo I know is not the Salamo of our story. To presume
there's any way you can understand what people felt (in Auschwitz)
is a little ludicrous. I just confronted the action in the story,''
he said.
   Dafoe, who played Jesus in ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' and
a righteous FBI agent in ``Mississippi Burning,'' said Arouch cried
when he returned to the camp in which his family died. The movie
was filmed there.
   ``He told me that when he survived the camps he felt like life
was a gift, so I think he's been devoted to the earthly pleasures
ever since. He's a successful businessman, and he's proud of
that,'' Dafoe said.

   Lee Atwater is shedding his chores as
Republican National Committee chairman long enough to play guitar
and sing on a blues album with B.B. King, Isaac Hayes, Billy
Preston and other artists.
   Atwater has slipped into town about four times since September
to work on the album on the Curb Records label, said record
producer Fred Vail.
   ``I'm talking about long days, I'm talking about 10 to 14 hours
in the studio,'' Vail said. The album is expected to be finished by
January.
   Atwater, campaign manager for President Bush in 1988, performed
at the inaugural ball and co-wrote one of the songs on the album
with King.
   ``He knows a great deal about this music and he respects it
totally,'' Vail said. ``He knows infinite details about old music
and old records. When it comes to R&amp;B, Lee is untouchable.''
   Still, Vail said, Atwater might do well to keep his day job.
   ``He's a good player but obviously he's not B.B. King.'' Blues
guitarist King is best known for his hit single ``The Thrill Is
Gone.''

   Struggling to cope with a flood
of people from East Germany and the East bloc, the government
Tuesday approved emergency plans to build 400,000 apartments to
house the refugees.
   The waves of newcomers this year _ nearly 200,000 of them East
Germans making a dramatic exodus to the West _ is starting to
overwhelm West Germany.
   East Germans, ethnic Germans from Poland and the Soviet Union,
and asylum-seekers are rapidly changing the face of the nation.
Those three groups are expected to account for about 700,000
newcomers this year.
   West Germany, with a population of nearly 62 million, has been
an economic success story and has become a magnet for East Germans,
as well as the ethnic Germans across Eastern Europe.
   Although West Germany has welcomed them, there is increasing
uneasiness about the thousands of new citizens.
   ``We have to tell them that West Germany is not a paradise,''
West German trade union federation chief Ernst Breit told a postal
workers' conference on Sunday in Mannheim.
   While Breit was referring to the expectations of the East
Germans, many politicians, business leaders and ordinary West
Germans are beginning to question the country's ability to handle
the strains posed by the newcomers.
   Social services have been strapped and the influx of children
has filled kindergartens to capacity nationwide. Clothing drives
for the new arrivals have become an almost daily occurrence.
   Local governments have been crying out for more federal aid to
bear the load, and unemployment is swelling to nearly 2 million.
   There was a shortage of affordable housing even before East
Germany's Communist authorities found themselves unable to hold
back the flood and East Germans fled by the thousands.
   Tuesday's approval of $4.3 billion to subsidize construction of
the new apartments over a four-year period is nearly twice the
amount planned for low-cost housing just a few months ago. But
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government felt it had to act to ease the
housing crisis.
   As housing shortages persist, social services are overloaded and
unemployment rises, the government is expected to face demands for
action to slow the flow of newcomers.
   West German politicians have shown increasing signs of alarm and
have called on East German authorities to institute reforms to halt
the exodus.
   ``We want them (East Germans) to be able to live in their
traditional home there and to be able to find happiness,'' Kohl
told a Red Cross convention on Saturday.
   Many of the East German refugees are being put up in hotels and
others have been housed in camps or on floating barracks designed
for construction workers.
   East Germans put up in a temporary shelter in a camping area in
Hamburg have already staged a protest, complaining of ``unbearable
conditions'' and saying they can't afford the $43 they have to pay
per month, per person.
   But housing is only one of the problems.
   The federal labor office said Monday the number of unemployed
workers among the East German refugees stood at 61,700 as of last
month, out of the total of 167,200 people who had reached West
Germany by then. The total East German refugee number is expected
to top 200,000 by the end of the year.
   Still, many employers look at the East Germans as a source of
new labor, willing to take jobs that West Germans avoid and perhaps
willing to work for lower wages.
   Ethnic Germans and asylum-seekers already were stretching social
services and local budgets before August, when the East Germans
started flowing into West Germany.
   ``We still expect between 350,000 and 400,000 ethnic Germans
this year,'' said Ina Ruehl, a Red Cross specialist who helps to
integrate the influx of ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union,
Romania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   She said in an interview with The Associated Press the federal
government is spending $1.2 billion this year to teach them German,
while many also receive substantial unemployment benefits. As of
October, there were 115,000 unemployed among the recent arrivals of
ethnic Germans.
   West Germany also has attracted huge numbers of political
asylum-seekers, most of them from Third World countries as well as
Turkey, Poland and Yugoslavia.
   They benefit from Bonn's liberal policies that allow most of the
asylum-seekers stay for years even if their application is rejected.
   On Sunday, Bishop Martin Kruse, the head of the Lutheran Church
in West Germany, appealed for more help for the asylum-seekers who
are allowed to stay even if their request is rejected.
   ``These people often live for years in legal uncertainty and
without any outlook for the future,'' Kruse told a church
convention in Bad Krozingen near Freiburg. Rejection of an asylum
application generally bars the foreigners from working legally in
West Germany.
   On Monday, the federal Interior Ministry announced that 98,700
asylum-seekers had arrived in the first 10 months of the year.

   In an emotionally charged case pitting
protection for children against the rights of parents, the Supreme
Court was urged Tuesday to uphold the indefinite jailing of a
Maryland woman for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts.
   Social workers fear the child may be dead.
   Mitchell Mirviss, a lawyer appointed to represent the missing
child, predicted ``extreme ramifications'' if the mother is allowed
to go free to safeguard her Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Upholding her rights would mean ``an infant who is defenseless
and abused must be abandoned in an unprecedented extension of the
Fifth Amendment,'' he said.
   Assistant Attorney General Ralph S. Tyler of Maryland agreed.
   ``Where will we be if the state cannot enforce'' contempt of
court orders to assure children's safety? he asked. ``Will the most
effective remedy be taken away?''
   Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfare
could hamstring juvenile courts, Tyler said.
   The court engaged in a spirited one-hour discussion in the case
of Jacqueline Bouknight, 23, in a Baltimore jail for more than 18
months for refusing to disclose where her son is.
   Bouknight's lawyer, George E. Burns, said authorities have other
alternatives to jailing the parent indefinitely for contempt of
court.
   She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries a
three-year prison term, he said.
   ``It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' Burns said.
``It's not a matter of `we can't do it. We just won't do it.'''
   Some justices raised the possibility that a ruling in the case,
expected by July, could rest on narrower grounds.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy noted that
since Bouknight was jailed, Maryland has enacted a law that permits
law enforcement officials to grant limited immunity from
prosecution to compel testimony.
   In Bouknight's case, they suggested, the state could require her
to reveal her son's whereabouts in return for assurances that the
disclosure will not be used to convict her of any criminal charges.
   O'Connor described the process as ``a laser-like limited
immunity'' that would permit prosecution of Bouknight without
compromising her protection against self-incrimination.
   Social workers last saw Bouknight's son Maurice in September
1987, when he was 11 months old.
   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital on Jan. 23, 1987,
when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg and
other injuries. For a while, he was held in protective care after
his emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing Maurice into
his crib during the infant's hospitalization.
   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987,
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo
training in parenting skills.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun expressed dismay Tuesday at that
development.
   ``Why do we need hindsight'' to realize the boy was in jeopardy,
he said. ``Wasn't it apparent at the time?''
   Nine months after Maurice was returned to his mother, social
workers said Bouknight no longer was cooperating with them.
Moreover, they said Maurice's father recently had been shot to
death in a drug-related killing and Bouknight was using drugs.
   The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28,
1988, after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in December that jailing her
for refusing to disclose the information violates her
constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
   But she has remained in jail under an order by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist.
   Some have compared the Bouknight case to that of Dr. Elizabeth
Morgan of Washington, D.C., released from prison on Sept. 25 after
more than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter
visit the girl's father, Morgan's former husband.
   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, for
court-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her former
husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently has
denied.
   In a pair of decisions Tuesday, the court:
   _Refused, by a 7-2 vote, to ease the technical requirements
facing people who sue to protect the environment.
   The justices ruled that the victory it took an Oregon farm
couple three years and $95,000 to win against their county for
polluting their water supply had to be thrown out because
government agencies were not notified before the lawsuit was filed.
   _Voted 8-1 to make it easier for insurance companies to sue in
federal court to challenge worker compensation awards. The decision
allows an Illinois insurer to go into federal court to attack a
Texas man's worker compensation benefits.

   Martin Miller's persistence has paid off.
Seven years after the retired Treasury Department official launched
a campaign to change the CIA and State Department maps of Israel
and Jordan, the lines have been redrawn.
   Soon after he retired in 1981, Miller noticed that a
government-published map book showed the West Bank of the Jordan
River as part of Jordan despite the fact that the United States
never recognized Jordan's 1950 annexation of the 2,200-square-mile
territory.
   The redrawn U.S. map shows the West Bank as a cultural region
bearing its original Biblical name of Judea and Samaria, not
attached to either Israel or Jordan.
   For years, the official U.S. maps published by the Central
Intelligence Agency showed the Israeli-Jordanian border drawn along
the 1949 armistice line between the two countries, which defined
Israel's physical borders until the 1967 war.
   Israel captured the West Bank in that war and has occupied the
land since, despite calls from the rest of the world to negotiate a
political settlement for the territory.
   Miller said he pursued his case in a ``factual rather than
ideological'' manner.
   ``If I were trying to peddle my views, I wouldn't have gotten
very far,'' he said.
   His first step was a letter to Alexander Haig, then President
Reagan's secretary of state. Haig referred Miller's letter to the
State Department's Office of the Geographer.
   That office maps official U.S. policy on sovereignty issues for
internal State Department publications and acts as an advisory and
arbitration board for other government agencies issuing maps.
   Miller began corresponding with the geographer, who issued a
1982 directive ordering cartographers to stop showing the West Bank
as anyone's territory.
   Still, most maps went unchanged.
   Miller also wrote his congressman, who unsuccessfully pursued
the case with the State Department.
   George Shultz took over from Haig. Miller, who had dealt with
Shultz when Shultz was treasury secretary, asked for a meeting in
1984.
   Miller made his case meticulously, buying a computer to help
prepare 92 documents for Shultz to buttress his argument.
   The meeting was exciting, he said, but nothing changed.
   Also in 1984, Miller read an article by then-deputy CIA chief
Robert Gates, who said the agency was emphasizing accuracy and
objectivity.
   Miller said he called Gates and ``told him his people were not
adhering to his standards.'' Two days later, on Jan. 2, 1985, he
met with two CIA officials.
   They promised the maps would be changed. But a year later,
nothing had changed, Miller said.
   Only after dealing with the agency's chief cartographer, did his
crusade bear fruit. The map of Jordan was changed in 1986, but it
took until January 1989 to change the Israel map.
   The State Department is reluctant to ascribe all the credit to
Miller, but concedes his campaign influenced the decision.
   ``He was very, very active, and believed in his cause,'' said
one official familiar with the case.
   But Shultz, who knew from bitter experience how hard it was to
bring about any political change in the Middle East, was more
expansive.
   ``I'm glad you kept at it and accomplished something that is of
genuine and lasting significance,'' Shultz said in a letter to
Miller earlier this year.

   Two men and two women briefly disrupted
Supreme Court proceedings Tuesday, as they stood up to denounce a
recent high court ruling limiting abortion rights.
   ``The Supreme Court has declared war on women and I'm here to
declare war on the Supreme Court,'' said one of the woman,
according to spectators in the courtroom.
   ``I had an abortion 20 years ago. ...'' said the other woman
before she was led from the courtroom by court police.
   All four were arrested and charged with disrupting the high
court, an offense that carries a 30-day jail sentence and a $100
fine upon conviction, said court spokeswoman Toni House.
   Arrested were Michael Madewell, 27, of Athens, Ga.; Benjamin
Fraser Troxell, 26, of Cleveland Heights, Ohio; Sandra Lines, 41,
of Jersey City, N.J., and Michelle Pahl, 27, of New York City.
   A group called Refuse &amp; Resist distributed a statement that said
the protest was intended to focus attention on the court as ``an
oppressor of women.''
   ``The oppressors of women will know no peace until the dogs are
called off from attacking women's (abortion) clinics,'' the
statement said.
   The court last July 3 gave states new power to limit abortions,
but stopped short of overturning its 1973 ruling that said women

<HEAD>Iran Applies to Rejoin International Chess Federation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

   Iran has applied to rejoin the
International Chess Federation after an absence of eight years, a
senior chess official said Tuesday.
   ``It's a return to the fold,'' said the federation's president,
Florencio Campomanes of the Philippines.
   He said Iran would be considered a provisional member of the
124-member federation as soon as it pays its back dues.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, the late Iranian leader, banned
chess following the 1979 revolution. Last fall, however, he said
the game was acceptable so long as it did not involve gambling.
   The general secretary of the Iranian Chess Federation, Khosra
Hirandi, told chess officials that women and men would not be
allowed to play one another, according to Boris Kutin of
Yugoslavia, a member of the international federation's 14-man
executive council.
   Campomanes said Iran would compete with the other countries of
the Middle East.
   ``There was a question of whether it was compatible for Iran to
be in that zone, when Iraq was in the same zone, and Mr. Harandi
said there was no problem from that direction,'' he said.
   Campomanes said the last Iranian to compete in a federation
competition was in 1979, although it continued to pay membership
dues until 1982.
   Casto Abundo of the Philippines, the federation's general
secretary, said he did not know how much the Iranian Chess
Federation owed in unpaid dues.

   New Jersey voters chose between
Democrat James Florio and Republican James Courter for governor
today, with Florio heavily favored for the office he nearly won
eight years ago.
   Turnout was reported moderate in some places to heavy in others,
including Florio's district in southern New Jersey.
   ``It's Jim Florio driving it,'' said Pat Marshall, the
Democratic administrator with the Camden County Board of Elections.
``Let's be honest here _ that's the only issue in Camden County.''
   The two candidates ended their campaigns with vote-seeking
dashes despite Florio's wide lead in the polls.
   ``I'm very comfortable that we've been able to get our message
out, and now of course the goal is to get people out to vote,''
Florio said at an election eve rally Monday at a racetrack in
Cherry Hill.
   The rally, which featured fireworks and a 10-piece rock-jazz
band entertaining 4,000 supporters, brought a raucous end to
Florio's bid to win the job he lost narrowly to Gov. Thomas H. Kean
in 1981.
   Courter continued to dismiss the polls that show him trailing by
24 points.
   ``We have a great state and it's important for all of us to go
to the polls on Tuesday,'' Courter told supporters in Lyndhurst.
``Ignore what some of the pundits are saying, ignore what some of
the pollsters are saying, because people are the ones who vote, not
polls.''
   Florio, who has held a consistent lead in the polls, has widened
the gap to 24 points over Courter, according to a poll released
Sunday by Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics and
The Star-Ledger of Newark.
   Florio lost to Kean in 1981 by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.4
million cast, or one-twelfth of 1 percent, the closest margin in
state history.
   Courter's campaign has been mired in internal problems and the
candidate has stumbled on some delicate issues such as abortion and
homosexual rights.
   By contrast, Florio has largely avoided pitfalls and put Courter
on the defensive. A series of nasty television commercials have
marked both campaigns.
   Each candidate ran a commercial in which his opponent's nose
grew a la Pinocchio with every alleged lie or misleading statement
cited in the spot.
   In addition to today's gubernatorial election, also at stake is
the battle for control of the Assembly. Republicans hold a 41-39
edge, and there are hotly contested races in 10 districts.
   The party that wins control of the Legislature also will control
the redrawing of congressional districts after the 1990 census. The
Democrats control the Senate, which does not face election this
year.

<HEAD>Christian General Refuses to Deal with New President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun said Tuesday he rejected
the entire peace plan adopted by Parliament, and the general's
followers roamed Christian areas, beating street vendors who
ignored a strike supporting him.
   The Christian army commander originally accepted political
reforms in the accord worked out at Taif, Saudi Arabia, but
rejected security arrangements that did not include a timetable for
withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
   Aoun calls the Syrians, who are in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, an occupation army.
Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded in a six-month
artillery war between Aoun's men and the Syrians that was suspended
by a truce in September.
   On Tuesday, the general said: ``We reject all of the Taif
accord. Lebanon was killed in Taif and buried in Kleiat, where they
elected a president for a Syrian state in Lebanon.''
   Parliament met at Kleiat in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanon
on Sunday and elected Rene Mouawad, a Maronite Catholic, as
president. It also endorsed political reforms worked out by
legislators at Taif with Arab League mediation, which give Moslems
more power in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil war.
   The legislators moved their Sunday session to northern Lebanon
because Aoun threatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Aoun said: ``A plan has been
prepared, details of which will not be announced now, to defend our
liberated area,'' a reference to the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north and east of Beirut in which 1 million Christians live.
   Aoun has no control in the 70 percent of Lebanon outside the
enclave, and the peace accord presumably will be applied there. He
also has serious opposition from other Christians and it is unclear
how long the government central bank will continue paying his bills.
   ``Mr. Mouawad is not an elected president, he is only a former
legislator; I had dissolved Parliament before his election,'' Aoun
said at his headquarters and residence, a bunker beneath the
shattered presidential place in Baabda, a Christian suburb east of
Beirut.
   He and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss have led competing
Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when the
six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended without Parliament
agreeing on a successor.
   By unwritten covenant, the president has been Christian, the
prime minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite
Moslem since independence from France in 1943.
   Christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled the
government, army and judiciary, but Moslems now make up 55 percent
of the population. Their demand for more power is a main cause of
the civil war, which has taken more than 150,000 lives since 1975.
   Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam of Syria drove to Mouawad's
hometown of Ehden in north Lebanon late Tuesday to see him, and
told reporters:
   ``Syria, which has supported and continues to support Lebanon's
unity, will extend all assistance requested by the government ...
to establish its authority on every inch of Lebanon''
   In a clear reference to Aoun, he said: ``No one, no matter how
far he goes in craziness, can continue because the process of
reconciliation will bypass the deviationists and all those who
sabotaged the unity of the nation and are trying to subvert
reconciliation and reunification.''
   Mouawad, 64, continued consultations with politicians to form a
government of national unity that would try to end the war.
   At the French Embassy in Hazmieh, just south of Baabda, about
500 youths chanted ``Aoun is the legitimate leader!''
   Waving Lebanese flags and placard portraits of Aoun, they
shouted for President Francois Mitterrand of France to ``protect
Lebanon.'' About 40 of them began a sit-in at the main gate.
   The French have been the Christians' main protectors since they
governed the country under a League of Nations mandate. France, the
United States, Arab nations and other governments have declared
support for Mouawad.
   Aoun asked his followers to end the two-day strike, because they
had ``expressed your views honestly.''
   Witnesses in Ashrafiyeh said Aoun supporters with sticks beat
vegetable vendors who ignored the strike.
   One said a vendor shouted while being beaten: ``We want peace!
We want to work to make money! We live from hand-to-mouth!''
   An editor at Voice of Lebanon, the main radio station in
Christian east Beirut, said privately that 100 of the general's
followers tried to storm the station Monday night and read
statements on the air, but Christian militiamen guarding the
building drove them off.

   U.S. Marines and Army soldiers guarding a
military site at Galeta Island near the Panama Canal exchanged
gunfire twice Friday with a small group of unidentified intruders,
the Pentagon reported Tuesday.
   ``There were no known casualties and sweeps conducted in the
area at daybreak revealed no evidence of intruders or hostile
fire,'' Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.
   However, one Army MP was taken to the U.S. Army hospital with
arm, leg and head injuries sustained in a fall into barbed wire.
   The Marines first noticed ``unidentified intruders outside the
gate'' Friday evening at the Galeta site, located at the northern
end of the Panama Canal area and connected to the mainland by a
road, Hoffman said.
   About an hour later, he said, ``a group of Marine Guards and
Army MPs (military police) were fired on by a small group of
intruders. The U.S. Marines and soldiers returned the fire.''
   There was a second exchange somewhat later, Hoffman said.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said the exchange of
gunfire was the first in months.
   After the failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega last month, the top U.S. military commander in the region _
Gen. Maxwell Thurman _ recommended that the rotations of military
personnel be speeded up so that U.S. dependents could be removed
from the area more speedily.
   Hoffman said that no decision had been made on that
recommendation.
   There are about 10,000 U.S. military permanently assigned to
Panama, with slightly more than 2,000 on temporary duty. There also
are about 2,700 U.S. civilian Department of Defense employees, as
well as about 7,700 military dependents and 3,300 civilian DOD
dependents, the Pentagon has said.

   Now that the Supreme Court refuses to help,
Carla Parrillo risks up to a year in jail and a $500 fine if she
lets her boyfriend stay overnight while her children are home.
   But the Johnston, R.I., woman struck a defiant tone, describing
as ``almost a challenge'' the high court's decision Monday not to
review a judge's order restricting her overnight male guests.
   ``I'd love to see what official is going to enforce'' it, she
said.
   Mrs. Parrillo said she is no longer dating the man involved in
the case, but her new boyfriend sometimes sleeps over while the
children are home.
   A judge ordered the visitation limit as an outgrowth of a
child-custody battle between Mrs. Parrillo and her former husband,
and a lawyer representing the woman said the order has a sexist
overtone.
   ``I would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve as
moral guardians of a family where a man is involved,'' said Steven
Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Rhode Island chapter.
   Thomas DeSimone, an attorney for Mrs. Parrillo's former husband,
Justin, said he was not surprised by the court's action because he
did not feel that a federal question was involved.
   And Brown said he believed the high court chose not to take the
case because the justices felt it was ``simply a strange little
case from Rhode Island that didn't deserve the court's attention.''
   The Parrillos were divorced in 1986. Under a joint custody
agreement, their three children live with her and their father has
visitation privileges.
   Mrs. Parrillo, 33, said her ex-husband began to harass her when
he learned she was dating Joseph DiPippo. She asked for a court
order limiting Parrillo's visitation rights, requiring him to see
the children at specific times away from the home.
   Parrillo countered by asking a judge to prevent Mrs. Parrillo
from having overnight male guests.
   Judge William Goldberg, who has since retired, barred Mrs.
Parrillo ``from allowing any unrelated males to stay overnight''
when the children are home. The judge said having such guests is
not ``a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into.''
   The children were 8, 10 and 13 when the judge issued his order
in late 1986.
   The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld Goldberg's order in March,
saying ``We cannot fault (Goldberg's) actions. We see no great
constitutional issue in this controversy.''
   Neither side had sought experts to testify about the
psychological effect of the visits on the children.
   In other matters, the high court:
   _Removed the last legal obstacle to carrying out a $2.5 billion
settlement for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth-control device.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Illinois whether lawsuits
charging employers with violating a key federal anti-bias law must
be filed in federal, not state, courts.
   _Heard arguments in an Oregon case over the asserted right to
use the hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice. A
decision is expected by July.
   _Agreed to decide in a New York case whether a motorist who
pleads guilty to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in a
fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault.

   As New Yorkers today decided whether Rudolph
Giuliani will be their mayor, ABC gave Jackie Mason, the
candidate's one-time honorary campaign chairman, bad news _ it
voted out his series.
   ABC said Mason's ``Chicken Soup,'' a new situation comedy in
which he plays a Jewish ex-salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic,
has been canceled. The eighth and final episode airs tonight.
   Mason quit the Giuliani campaign in September over remarks he
made about the GOP candidate's Democratic rival, David Dinkins, who
is black. Among other things, the rabbi-turned-comedian said Jews
would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.
   Mason apologized for his remarks, which were reported by the
Village Voice, and said he had learned that ``what's funny on stage
can be insensitive when it's said off the stage and in the world of
politics. And for my insensitivity, I apologize.''
   Janice Gretemeyer, an ABC spokeswoman, would not say whether the
cancellation was in any way due to the controversy.
   In a statement, Robert A. Iger, ABC Entertainment president,
called Mason's show ``a well-executed program'' but said it didn't
realize ABC's hopes that it would help maintain the network's
ratings strength on Tuesday, ``our key night.'' ``Chicken Soup''
follows the hit ``Roseanne.''
   ``Clearly, we're disappointed that `Chicken Soup' didn't achieve
that objective,'' he said.
   ``Chicken Soup,'' which co-starred Lynn Redgrave as the object
of Mason's affections, had averaged respectable ratings _ an 18.6
rating and a 29 per cent share of the audience in its Tuesday time
slot _ and occasionally landed in the top 15. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   The show was the third new series dropped so far this season.
NBC has canceled ``Nutt House'' and CBS its ``The People Next
Door.''
   ABC said ``Coach,'' a comedy that premiered last season and
stars Craig T. Nelson as a college football coach, will succeed
``Chicken Soup'' starting Nov. 21.

<HEAD>Journey for Reconciliation With Poland Gets Off on Wrong Foot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a troubled quest for reconciliation
with an erstwhile enemy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland
on Thursday with aid to offer and two diplomatic dustups to
overcome.
   The first visit by a West German chancellor in 12 years is aimed
at normalizing relations with the East European state overrun by
Nazi Germany a half century ago.
   Kohl brings with him more than $1 billion worth of financial aid
and credit guarantees to help Poland through the transition to a
market-oriented economy.
   But the historic visit and prospects for a clean break with past
hostilities have been marred by the hasty resignation of Bonn's
ambassador to Poland and embarrassment over Kohl's failed attempt
to visit the scene of a 1921 battle between Germans and Poles.
   The trip has been beset by volatile negotiations stalled by the
leadership changes in Poland and disputes within the Bonn
government over the nature and pace of assistance West Germany
should offer to promote reform.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had expressed the wish
this year that a high-level West German delegation make the
emotional gesture of attending memorials in Warsaw marking the 50th
anniversary of the start of World War II.
   However, negotiators for the two states were unable to clear
away old political and economic differences until Oct. 3,
preventing an official visit coinciding with the Sept. 1
anniversary.
   Despite that missed opportunity, Kohl's visit remains a symbolic
atonement for the wartime horrors inflicted on Poles by Germans.
   Kohl and other West German officials have spearheaded the drive
for Western aid to reward reform-minded nations like Hungary and
Poland as they move away from planned economies and Stalinist
controls on personal freedom.
   West Germany already is Poland's biggest Western trading partner.
   Bonn announced earlier it would reschedule or forgive $1.3
billion of Warsaw's overdue foreign debt.
   West German banks and government lending institutions hold about
20 percent of Poland's foreign loans, which total $39 billion, or
more than $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.
   Horst Teltschik, Kohl's chief foreign affairs adviser, said
before the trip to Warsaw that West German aid could potentially
exceed the billion-dollar level established in the negotiations he
conducted with Mieczyslaw Pszon of the Polish Foreign Ministry.
   Bonn will guarantee credits for any ``economically reasonable''
joint-venture projects agreed to by West German firms, Teltschik
said.
   He said the test of their economic reason would be whether they
promised to be self-financing within a few years.
   Among the agreements to be signed by Kohl and Polish Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki are credit guarantees for projects to
improve living conditions in the areas of western Poland populated
by ethnic Germans.
   Nearly one third of Poland was once German territory.
   Kohl plans to meet with members of the German minority in
Warsaw, but has scrapped a plan to visit St. Anne's Mountain
because of strong objections by his Polish hosts.
   The mountain, known in German as Annaberg, was the scene of
bloody confrontation between Poles and Germans in 1921. Warsaw
officials reportedly feared that a visit by Kohl could stir
inter-ethnic hostilities in the formerly German region of Upper
Silesia.
   The Annaberg plan was deemed ill-considered and has been
compared with Kohl's controversial 1985 visit with President Ronald
Reagan to an SS gravesite in Bitburg.
   Adding to the pre-departure turmoil was the unceremonious exit
of the West German ambassador to Warsaw.
   Two weeks prior to the Warsaw trip, Franz Joachim Schoeller, 63,
was granted early retirement after claiming the stress of Kohl's
visit and a recent flood of East German refugees through the
embassy had damaged his health.
   West German media have reported ulterior motives for Schoeller's
decision to step down at such a crucial time, contending it was
prompted by internal disputes within the Bonn government or by his
alleged involvement in an arms trading firm.

<HEAD>Defense Attorney Seeks Jurors With Awareness of Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 potential jurors will be
interviewed starting Wednesday about their awareness of drunken
driving as the trial starts for a man accused of killing 27 people
in a fiery bus crash.
   Larry Mahoney is charged with 83 separate crimes, including 27
counts of murder, for his role in the crash of a church bus on
Interstate 71 on the night of May 14, 1988.
   The prosecution charged that Mahoney was drunk behind the wheel
of his pickup truck traveling the wrong way on the highway when it
slammed into a bus from a Radcliff church returning from an outing
at an amusement park.
   Defense attorney William Summers said he knows that most
potential jurors will have heard of the case, which prompted
national debate over the safety of school buses and the dangers of
drunken drivers.
   ``They know it happened,'' Summers said. ``They know it inflamed
passions and prejudice in them. But despite whatever those are,
that they will at least make a sincere promise to go out of their
way to try and be objective.''
   The prospective jurors will be questioned in three large groups
before individual interviews that Judge Charles Satterwhite has
ordered closed to the public.
   Summers said his ideal juror will have some understanding of how
widespread drinking and driving has become. Potential jurors also
will be asked if they have been convicted of drunken driving.
   Mahoney, 36, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence
several years ago in another case. He currently faces a charge of
driving under the influence in the current proceeding, along with
dozens of assault and wanton endangerment charges for the injuries
to the 40 people who escaped death in the crash.
   After the crash, Mahoney spent several weeks in the hospital and
was then examined at the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center.
He was jailed until until October 1988, when his family put
together enough money and property to post his $540,000 bond.
   Mahoney returned to work at M&amp;T Chemicals in Carrollton and
lives with his parents in nearby Worthville. Mahoney neither drives
nor drinks anymore, Summers said.
   Survivors of the crash, most of whom were members of the First
Assembly of God in Radcliff, are expected to testify at the trial.
People who lost family members in the crash are expected to attend
at least parts of the trial, which could last six weeks or more.

   Richard Ramirez, the ``Night Stalker'' who
butchered or raped more than a dozen people in an orgy of violence
that terrorized Southern California in 1985, was sentenced to death
in the gas chamber today.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Michael A. Tynan followed the
recommendation of the jury that convicted the devil-worshiping
29-year-old on Sept. 20.
   In the courtroom before his sentencing, Ramirez, wearing dark
glases, uttered a rambling, nearly inaudible statement that ended
with the words: ``Lucifer dwells within us all.''
   The killer, who entered unlocked houses late at night to attack
people in their beds, was convicted of 13 murders and 30 other
felonies, including rape, burglary and sodomy.
   The jurors, some of whom said the defendant had tried to
intimidate them during the trial by sneering and glaring at them,
recommended Oct. 4 that he be sentenced to death rather than life
in prison.
   A snarling, gravelly-voiced Ramirez had sneered at the
possibility of being sentenced to death. ``Big deal. Death comes
with the territory,'' he told reporters after the jury's
recommendation. ``See you in Disneyland.''
   After his conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered ``devil
sign'' at photographers and muttered, ``Evil.''

   Dozens of elephants have been terrorizing
a village in eastern Zaire, tearing up plantation land during
nightly visits, a news agency reported Tuesday.
   Up to 30 elephants were trampling land in and around the village
of Indinga, about 115 miles west of the Rwanda border town of
Bukavu, the government-controlled news agency said.
   The elephants had not been seen in the area for four years, but
a government crackdown on poachers may have cleared the way for
their return.

   President Bush on Tuesday steered clear of
criticizing his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, for accepting a $2
million trip to Japan saying, ``everybody's got to make a living.''
   He also passed up an opportunity to comment on Nancy Reagan's
controversial book, ``My Turn,'' but indicated his recollection of
his relationship with her husband was not quite the same as what
she wrote.
   Mrs. Reagan wrote that Bush told her during the height of the
Iran-Contra controversy that he thought Chief of Staff Donald Regan
should resign. She said she told him to tell her husband that, and
he said, ``Nancy, that's not my role.''
   Bush was asked if he shared that recollection, and if his own
vice president, Dan Quayle, should act that way.
   ``No, I think it's his role to tell me anything that's on his
mind, which is exactly the relationship I had with President Reagan
and that's the way I worked as vice president,'' Bush replied.
   Asked to comment further on Mrs. Reagan's version, he said,
``No, I can't help you on that. I don't want to get into that
one.'' Then he added, laughing, ``Why? Never mind.''
   Bush was asked whether it was appropriate for Reagan to accept
$2 million from a communications congolmerate for a speaking trip
to Japan last month.
   He said, `` I will not have anything negative to say about
President Reagan if this is an invitation for that, because I'd
prefer to emphasize the positive parts of that trip, talking openly
about the need for freer trade, the affection shown to him by the
Japanse people. It's important symbolism when it comes to this
relationship that sometimes has strain.''
   Pressed on whether former presidents should make money through
private industry, he said, ``I have no problem with that, providing
it's not overdone. Everybody's got to make a living.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is preparing a
confrontation with President Bush on civil rights by proposing an
update of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that the president has called
unnecessary.
   The legislation that the Massachusetts Democrat plans to file
within weeks would overturn several Supreme Court rulings handed
down in June that made it easier to challenge affirmative action
programs and more difficult for workers to sue their employers for
racial bias.
   Bush said then that the impact of the decisions was being
overblown.
   One highly publicized decision upheld the right of several white
firefighters from Birmingham, Ala., to challenge the department's
minority hiring plan.
   Republican conservatives in the Senate say they will fight the
legislation, particularly if the president sticks by his position.
   ``If the president is committed to a veto, we can sustain a
veto,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, adding that civil
rights advocates want to embarass Bush.
   Kennedy said that Bush isn't sure more legislation is needed.
   ``In my view, the need is obvious,'' Kennedy said. `` A new
national civil rights act will send a strong message that Congress
does not intend to abandon our 25-year-long commitment to civil
rights.''
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the
administration is taking a ``wait-and-see'' attitude.
   ``We haven't come out and said absolutely no to the
legislation,'' she said. ``We don't think the legislation is
absolutely necessary at this time, but once it's proposed we will
not sit back.''
   Kennedy and other lawmakers have been working with a broad array
of civil rights advocates, labor unions and women's groups to craft
a bill that can be introduced in virtually identical form in both
the House and Senate, said Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights.

   A block of ``penny black'' postage stamps, issued
in 1840, were sold at auction Tuesday for about $442,680, an
auction house said.
   The 36 stamps, depicting the young Queen Victoria and originally
selling for one pence each, were bought by the Royale Stamp Co. for
a private collector who was not identified.
   When the set last changed hands in 1934, it sold for about
$2,400, said Ray Haffner of the Harmers auction house.
   The stamps were the star exhibit of the Wills Collection,
consisting of 534 lots which together raised nearly $1.5 million.
   The ``penny black'' and the ``two-penny blue'' were the first
British postage stamps.
   The world record for a stamp sold at auction was $972,500 for an
1851 Baden stamp which had a color error. It was sold in Wiesbaden,
West Germany in 1985.

<HEAD>Former Methodist Pastor Recants Confession to Wife's Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOULTRIE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former pastor who recently confessed to
killing his first wife 10 years ago by setting their mobile home on
fire now says the confession was untrue.
   Former United Methodist pastor James Chastain has written
letters recanting the confession that led to his being charged with
murder.
   Colquitt County District Attorney Lamar Cole said confessions
and recantings of confessions are admissible in court, and he noted
that retractions of confessions are fairly common.
   ``It's up to the jury, who they want to believe,'' he said
Tuesday.
   ``I James P. Chastain, deny the written confession that says
that I did in June of 1979 set fire to a trailer in which my first
wife, Theresa Gail Chastain, died. I deny the charges against me in
this matter,'' the former pastor wrote in a letter to the sheriff
and district attorney in Colquitt County, where he is charged with
murder.
   Chastain has been held in the Schley County Detention Center
since his arrest in October in connection with a fire at his
brother-in-law's home. Authorities have said they don't know where
Chastain will be tried first.
   He was arrested after his second wife, the Rev. Luanne Chastain,
found a piece of paper which the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
said contained notes on a plan to kill her.
   Chastain's letter said he ``believed that if I confessed to this
crime as well as others that I would receive the help needed due to
the note that my second wife, the Rev. Luanne Chastain, found.''
   At the time of his arrest, Chastain was circuit pastor of four
small churches in southwest Georgia.

   Eleven people vied Tuesday for the congressional
seat left open by the death of Rep. Mickey Leland, whose plane
crashed during a famine relief trip to Africa in August.
   City Councilman Anthony Hall and state Sen. Craig Washington
emerged as front-runners, followed in pre-election polls by state
Reps. Ron Wilson and Al Edwards. All are Democrats.
   The winner will represent one of Texas' most Democratic and
racially mixed districts until the regular election is held in 1990.
   A candidate needed more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a
runoff, which would be scheduled by the governor.
   Other Democratic candidates included attorney Shirley Fobbs and
businessman Timothy John Hattenbach and Lee Arthur Demas Jr.
   Republicans included attorney Beverly Spenser, businessman Manse
R. Sharpe Jr. and Byron J. Johnson, an education supervisor. Austin
stockbroker Gary Johnson, no relation, was the Libertarian
candidate.

   The leading candidates differed little on the major campaign
issues: fighting drugs, helping constituents rise out of poverty,
and, to varying degrees, supporting the right to abortions.
   They focused instead on their rivals' behavior.
   Hall accused Washington of failing to pay $17,000 in local
taxes. Washington countered that he was delinquent on only about 10
percent of that amount, and would be paying it before he went to
Congress, if elected.
   Hall was accused of a conflict of interest in taking his family
on two trips paid for by the Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. As a
councilman, he had voted in favor of HL&amp;P rate increases.
   The 18th Congressional District, created in 1971, has produced
two of the nation's most prominent black members of Congress:
Leland, known for his leadership on famine issues, and predecessor
Barbara Jordan, one of the country's leading stateswomen.
   The district encompasses downtown Houston and the city's poorest
residents in central and northeast Houston. In 1980, 41 percent of
the residents were black and 31 percent Hispanic.

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Resolution on Israeli Seizures of Palestinian Property</HEAD>

   The United States on Tuesday vetoed a
Security Council resolution that would have demanded that Israel
return property confiscated from Palestinians during a tax protest.
   Britain, France, Canada and the other 11 members of the council
all voted for the resolution, which would also have sent a
fact-finding mission to observe Israel's crackdown on the
Palestinian uprising.
   ``The United States is deeply distressed by the continuing
violence and confrontation in the occupied territories,'' said U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering.
   ``We have repeatedly called on all parties to exercise maximum
restraint to avoid bloodshed and reduce tensions,'' he said.
   Calling the anti-Israeli resolution ``one-sided,'' Pickering
said ``such resolutions and the divisive debate that accompanies
them do not help to alleviate conditions in the areas, not do they
help to create an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of
constructive dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.''
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said afterward the U.S.
veto ``renders hollow its claims of sensitivity and sympathy for
the Palestinian sufferings and its objections to Israel's clear
violations of Palestinian human and civil rights.''
   ``The U.S. veto means that the Palestinians would remain hostage
to Israel's brutal measures without a consequential protection by
the United Nations,'' Maksoud said.
   Israel began tax raids on the predominantly Christian
Palestinian town of Beit Sahour on Sept. 20. Troops confiscated at
least $1.5 million in machinery, cars, household goods and personal
effects to be sold at auction.
   Hanna Al-Atrash, the mayor of Beit Sahour, estimated 90 percent
of the town of 10,000 people boycotted paying taxes to Israel to
protest the military occupation. Beit Sahour is just southeast of
Bethlehem, in the West Bank.
   Stinging under a storm of international criticism, Israel lifted
its roadblocks around the town last week.
   On Monday, Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein shifted the focus of
the debate, describing the ax-murders or stabbings of five
Palestinians in October. The victims were mutilated, some in front
of family members or while praying in a mosque.
   ``Indeed, the rate of PLO attacks against Palestinians increased
sharply following the promulgation of Israel's peace initiative in
April 1989,'' he said, saying seven times as many Palestinians were
being attacked.

<HEAD>Portrait In Statehouse Was Of Wrong Patriot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Statehouse painting of the two Rhode
Islanders who signed the Declaration of Independence is perfect in
every detail _ except one of the faces is of the wrong person.
   An error dating to 1823 caused Pennsylvania statesman John
Dickinson to end up in former Rhode Island Gov. Stephen Hopkins'
spot in the portrait that hangs outside the House speaker's office.
   The mistake was discovered more than a decade ago, but no one
did anything about it until Hopkins' descendents kicked up a fuss.
   It finally will be fixed Wednesday with the unveiling of a new
portrait _ but Rhode Islanders will have to settle for a picture of
Hopkins' son, Rufus.
   ``Amazing,'' said Kathryn O'Hare, spokeswoman for Secretary of
State Kathleen S. Connell, whose office is in charge of Statehouse
tours and guidebooks. ``It's kind of comical, actually.''
   Stephen Hopkins left no portraits behind when he died in 1785,
and when artist John Trumbull sought him out seven years later for
inclusion in his famous painting of the signers of the declaration,
he had to settle for Rufus Hopkins. Townspeople assured Trumbull
that the son closely resembled the father.
   Trumbull finished the painting in 1820, and three years later
prepared a key matching faces to names. But he confused Hopkins,
Dickinson and George Clinton of New York, said Irma B. Jaffe, a
retired Fordham University professor and Trumbull scholar.
   ``There's no way of knowing how it came to be confused,'' Jaffe
said in a telephone interview. ``It was a long time since he had
done the painting and he might have just confused them.''
   Shortly after the Statehouse was built in 1900, officials
decided they needed a portrait of Hopkins and William Ellery, the
two Rhode Islanders who signed the Declaration of Independence, so
they sought out the Trumbull painting and had an artist copy the
patriots' faces. The artist, relying on the key, faithfully painted
Ellery and Dickinson.
   Jaffe said she discovered the errors in 1972 while comparing
Trumbull's original sketches of the signers with the finished work.
   The General Assembly became aware of the error shortly after
Jaffe published her findings, but nothing was done because ``it's a
beautiful picture'' and ``no one knew except scholars and Stephen
Hopkins fans'' that the face was not correct, said state Rep. Ray
Rickman.
   There was another problem: no one knows who is responsible for
the dozens of dusty paintings that line the Statehouse walls.
   The secretary of state's office and the Rhode Island Historic
Preservation Commission each say the other is responsible. The
secretary of state does have some power to decide where the
paintings should be hung, O'Hare said. But her records show the
Hopkins-Ellery portrait is in the governor's office. No one knows
how it ended up outside the speaker's office.
   Last year, Hopkins' heirs finally persuaded the Legislature to
replace the picture. A commission, of which Rickman was a member,
hired Newport artist John P. Hagen for $4,000 to make a new
portrait.
   Hagen said his work is based on the Trumbull sketch of Rufus
Hopkins and an examination of Hopkins' home, which still exists in
Providence.
   Jaffe said there was no way Trumbull's sketch could be wrong.
   ``The eyes are grey, and the hair and so forth,'' Jaffe said.
``It's quite specific.''
   Dickinson, a practicing Quaker, was wearing a hat as his
religion required, in Trumbull's painting, while Hopkins, a lapsed
Quaker, was not, Jaffe said.

<TEXT>
   A drug trafficking trial has taken a
startling turn with the defendant testifying he was trying to track
down a drug dealer he says absconded with $500,000 in a plot to
kill Pakistan's former leader.
   The unusual defense, built around Pakistani President Gen.
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq who died in a mysterious plane crash, isn't
something the defendant's lawyer said he would have chosen to take
into the courtroom.
   ``It's not my idea of the best defense believe me,'' Stephen
Ferrarone, court-appointed attorney for Mushtaq Malik, said
Tuesday. ``I would prefer not to have my guy stand up and say, `I
may have been involved in an assassination.'''
   Prosecutors declined comment as they prepared to begin
cross-examination Wednesday.
   The 41-year-old defendant, who prosecutors say is known as ``The
Black Prince,'' stopped short of saying he was involved in the
plane crash that killed Zia on Aug. 17, 1988. Malik was arrested in
Brazil on the drug charges five months before the crash in which 29
other people died, including U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel.
   Malik is being tried on charges of conspiracy and importation of
heroin. Prosecutors claim Malik arranged for Samir N. Houchaimi of
Amman, Jordan, to bring $10 million in heroin to the United States.
   Houchaimi was arrested at a bus terminal in Springfield in
February 1988. He was carrying a nylon handbag filled with two
kilograms of heroin that he told authorities he had been given in
Cyprus to sell for Malik.
   After his arrest, Houchaimi arranged a meeting in Rio de Janeiro
with Malik and a U.S. drug agent operating under the alias ``Mr.
Costa.'' Transcripts of those calls have been introduced as
evidence.
   Malik and the agent met, ostensibly to make plans to go to Costa
Rica, but instead Malik was arrested and returned to the United
States.
   Malik's defense, according to his testimony Monday, is that he
actually had contracted with Houchaimi to kill Zia. Malik testified
he advanced at least $500,000 to Houchaimi on behalf of superiors
in the Pakistan People's Party, currently led by Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, to hire people and buy equipment for the
assassination.
   Malik said he followed the 51-year-old Houchaimi to the United
States after it became obvious that the plot was stalled. He said
he then played along with drug plans in hopes of retrieving the
money.
   ``I don't know anything about money for heroin in America,'' he
testified Monday.
   ``Malik was basically in a position where he would have been
totally wiped out. He has said that he would either have to come up
with this money or commit suicide,'' Ferrarone said.
   The lawyer said his client doesn't fear retribution for his
testimony of assassination plotting from the current Pakistani
government, which maintains the cause of Zia's death is unknown.
   The Pakistani consulate in Boston did not return a telephone
call to The Associated Press on Tuesday.

key parliamentary committee as too narrow and restrictive. West
German officials say more than 33,000 East Germans arrive since the
route through Czechoslovakia was opened.

   A second computer problem within a week at the
Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center caused some flight
delays Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration reported.
   ``There was never a safety issue,'' said FAA spokeswoman Diane
Spitaliere. ``The worst-case scenario was massive delays, and that
never happened.''
   Officials said a problem with telephone lines caused a computer
at Leesburg, Va., to lose contact with some remote radar
facilities, meaning information about some flights had to be put
into the system manually.
   The problem started in the early morning hours and was corrected
by noon, causing minimal delays in flights, Ms. Spitaliere said.
   She said the FAA was investigating the cause and trying to
determine how it can be prevented from reoccurring.
   Thousands of airline passengers flying into, out of or through
the Washington area encountered long delays Friday when air traffic
controllers at the center lost about half their computer capacity.
   Flights headed for the nation's capital were grounded in various
cities and flights in the air were kept about 25 percent farther
apart, officials said.

<HEAD>Amazon Destruction Declines, Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased government control and
inspection has caused a significant decline in the destruction of
the Amazon rainforest, Brazil's top environmental official said
Tuesday.
   ``We're still waiting for the final numbers, but we estimate the
devastation will be 30 percent less than in 1988. The results are
not optimal, but they are very good,'' said Fernando Cesar
Mesquita, the president of the Brazilian Institute of Environment
and Renewable Natural Resources.
   The destruction could have been curbed even more, Mesquita said,
if the United States, Britain, France, Italy and West Germany had
provided requested aid for ecological protection.
   ``Regrettably, we didn't get any help,'' he said.
   The institute was founded earlier this year amid an
international outcry over the devastation of Brazil's 2
million-square-mile Amazon jungle, the world's largest. Mesquita
said he went to the United States and Europe to seek money for
radar-mapping equipment, patrol helicopters, patrol boats,
four-wheel drive vehicles and telecommunications gear.
   He said he couldn't get the equipment from his own government,
``because Brazil just doesn't have the money.'' However, he said,
Brazilian sources provided five patrol helicopters that were
instrumental in spotting unauthorized tree cutting and burning.
   Last year, illegal land clearing by farmers, ranchers,
prospectors and peasant settlers wrecked some 55,350 square miles
of Brazilian rainforest, according to the government.
   The heaviest rains in more than five years also helped save
Amazonian trees from being burned, Mesquita said.
   The institute, which supervises only 612 forest rangers in a
region about half the size of Europe, summarily removed local
forest officials suspected of corruption and protecting landowners
who were destroying the ecology, Mesquita said. Inspectors
discovered 300,000 acres of illegally cleared jungle land from Aug.
1-Nov. 3 and levied fines of about $16 million.
   ``The situation is very difficult,'' Mesquita said. ``We are up
against powerful interests. They try to buy off forest officials,
and when that doesn't work they threaten to kill them.''
   He said one federal official on an inspection mission was killed
this year, others were shot at or intimidated, and an institute
helicopter was sabotaged.
   Also hindering environmental control are the growing cocaine
trade, landless peasants, rough free-lance gold miners and
``sinister bureaucracy,'' he said.
   Amazon protection will be ``a hot potato'' for Brazil's next
president, Mesquita said. President Jose Sarney, who has announced
wide-ranging pro-ecology measures, leaves office in March. Voters
will choose his successor Nov. 15 in Brazil's first direct
presidential vote since 1960.
   None of the 22 presidential candidates ``has presented really
serious proposals for protecting the environment,'' Mesquita said.
   Brazil's small Green Party does have a presidential contender,
but polls give him almost no chance of winning.
   Mesquita said the institute is trying to get Congress to change
a law that encourages settlement in the Amazon region by giving
land-tax discounts to settlers who absorb the expense of clearing
up to 50 percent of their land.
   ``The idea of that law was to promote development and at the
same time protect at least 50 percent of the rainforest. But what
happens is that someone sells half his land, and the next guy
clears 50 percent of that, and so on, until there's nothing left.''
   With a $110 billion foreign debt, the highest in the developing
world, Brazil is open to foreign proposals for debt-for-ecology
swaps, Mesquita said, but it hasn't received any.

<HEAD>Denver Council Approves Ban on Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Council, despite heated opposition from
several hundred gun owners and their supporters, approved a ban
Tuesday on semiautomatic assault weapons.
   The ordinance passed just after midnight by a vote of 9-4.
   ``It's regrettable that we have to take this action because the
Legislature didn't have the courage to,'' said Councilman Dave
Doering.
   Tom Gleason, a spokesman for Mayor Federico Pena, said the
ordinance will take effect once it is signed by Pena and published,
probably next week.
   The law carries penalites of $500 to $999 in fines and 10 to 120
days in jail.
   Residents who owned assault weapons before adoption of the
ordinance will be able to keep them, but they will be required to
register them within 60 days.
   ``Criminals are going to behave like criminals,'' said
Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, who proposed the ban.
   ``We have, however, made a small step to give police a tool to
confiscate _ what we now publicly consider anti-social weapons,
when they are found in the course of their work, and we have sent a
message that these particular semiautomatic weapons are not welcome
in the city and county of Denver.
   ``I think that's the useful thing to do. It's not going to solve
crime and we never said it would,'' she said.
   More than 700 people packed into Denver's City and County
Building for a public hearing Monday night. A total of 297 people
signed up to speak against the proposal and 30 were in support, but
some did not get the chance to speak because the hearing ended on
schedule at 11 p.m.
   Gun enthusiasts held signs outside the chambers that read ``Ban
liberals, not firearms.''
   At one point during the hearing, council members threatened to
leave after one speaker called Reynolds a ``rapist'' of the
Constitution.
   The council staff turned off the microphone and the man left.
   Police Chief Aristedes Zavaras spoke in favor of the ban.
   Dennis Martin, president of the American Federation of Police
opposed it.
   ``Recent research has opened new evidence that an armed public
has and is a powerful deterrent to crime,'' Martin said.
``Offenders do recognize the gunowner as a potential threat to
their well being.''

<HEAD>Senators Enter Dispute Over University Indian Chief</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Cardinal in last graf is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's two U.S. senators are on opposite
sides of a dispute over whether a university mascot _ a
headdress-bedecked American Indian chief _ should be discarded as
offensive.
   Chief Illiniwek has been a symbol of the University of Illinois
since 1926, prancing at sporting events and emblazoning clothing,
coffee mugs and other paraphernalia.
   Robert Honig, a pre-law student at the school, began a fight
last month to dump the chief, saying it was an insult to American
Indians.
   ``There is no way we would tolerate someone dressed as an
old-time black slave dancing on the field or someone portraying a
Jew,'' said Honig, who is from suburban Skokie.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois agreed, and joined the
effort to find a new mascot. His fellow Democratic senator, Alan
Dixon, is prepared to lead a fight to keep the mascot.
   Because of opposition, the university in Champaign-Urbana has
agreed to have cheerleaders and band members stop wearing
Indian-style face makeup during games, school spokesman Terry
Shepard said Tuesday.
   But he added, ``I think it would take something very cataclysmic
for the chief to be done away with.''
   The chief is named for a confederacy of woodland tribes that
once lived in Illinois and parts of Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri.
   Dixon is an alumnus of the university and said he is filled with
``pride for my school'' every time he sees the chief.
   Simon acknowledged Monday during a Chicago visit that the chief
``is a revered figure'' to University of Illinois fans.
   ``But it remains a sore point for many Native Americans,'' he
said. ``I would favor further discussion that could eventually lead
to a new mascot for the university.''
   Other schools have changed Indian mascots, including Stanford
University, which several years ago changed the name of its sports
teams from the Indians to the Cardinal.

   A 16-year-old Minuteman
3 missile on Tuesday delivered dummy warheads to Pacific Ocean
targets 4,200 miles from its California launch site, the Air Force
said.
   Thirty minutes after the 8:17 a.m. liftoff, the missile's
unarmed re-entry vehicles were tracked to targets in the Kwajalein
Missile Range.
   It was the 141st in a series of operational test launches of the
Minuteman 3 weapon system, an Air Force statement said.
   The missile had been in the Air Force inventory since Nov. 15,
1973.
   The launch was conducted by an airborne missile launch crew from
the 2nd Airborne Command Control Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base,
Neb.
   Airborne launch crews, flying aboard specially modified Boeing
EC-135 jets, are maintained as a backup in case ground crews are
unable to send launch commands to Minuteman missiles.

   The state's second annual alligator
hunt netted nearly 130 more gators than the first season and
officials expect healthy catches for years to come.
   During the month-long hunt in September, 222 licensed hunters
caught 3,117 gators, including a 13-foot-6 monster bagged on the
north side of Lake Okeechobee and a 685-pounder from Lake George
near Ocala.
   The catch represents about 91 percent of the quota and compares
with 2,988 caught in 1988, the first state-sanctioned alligator
hunt in 26 years.
   Part of the reason officials renewed the hunts was the
burgeoning alligator population, believed to exceed 1 million in
Florida.
   ``We're not trying to reduce the alligator population,'' said
Mike Jennings, a wildlife biologist with the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. ``We want to have these hunts years after
year.''
   A study of this year's catch indicated the alligator population
is generally healthy and growing well, said Jennings.

<HEAD>Police Crack Down on Illegal Parking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Paris Periwinkles stuffed butterflies under
windshield wipers with unusual alacrity Tuesday as part of a
crackdown on illegal parking, a major contributor to the city's
nightmarish traffic.
   Periwinkles are what the French fondly call their meter maids
and butterflies are what, far less fondly, they call parking
tickets. Traffic policemen and police auxiliaries are helping with
the blitz of illegal parkers.
   After a brief publicity campaign notifying the public that the
days of lax enforcement were over and the ``anything goes'' style
of French parking had gone, authorities sprang into action Monday
with tickets and tow trucks.
   ``It's really interfering with my work,'' said Rodrigues
Barbosa, a housepainter working in a central Paris apartment. ``I
keep having to climb down from the ladder and stick my head out of
the window every 15 minutes.''
   It was worse for drivers of delivery trucks, who block narrow
streets with impunity and unload their wares with majestic
nonchalance at all hours despite restrictions on delivery times.
   ``You simply cannot work in Paris without breaking the law,''
one said.
   Another complained: ``They're not really attacking the traffic
problem, they're taking it out on drivers. What they need is to
build more parking places in Paris, but that's more complicated.''
   Paris is blessed with wide avenues, but they are knit together
by hundreds of narrow streets that quickly become congested.
   Parisians, desperate for a places to leave their cars, park them
on sidewalks, in crosswalks, at taxi stands. They'll even park
double or triple at intersections.
   No one is being spared in the painful new regime. Police and
Periwinkles, named for their light blue uniforms, have orders to
ticket every violator, accept no excuses, accede to no pleadings.
   Special attention is being paid to those who park
``dangerously,'' as in bus lanes. Tow-away tickets are stuck on
windows, radio calls placed and the vehicles vanish in 15 minutes.
   ``It's quite a shock to go out and see your car gone,'' said a
journalist who parked in a taxi stand when he arrived at work
Monday night.
   Paris police said 457 vehicles were towed away Monday, compared
with about 300 on a usual day. They said 10,117 parking tickets
were issued, 23 percent more than the previous Monday.
   A ticket for parking that disrupts traffic costs 230 francs
($37). Parking in a delivery zone is worth 500 francs ($80) and
retrieving a vehicle from the car pound lightens the wallet by 471
francs ($75). Dangerous parking might cost a driver's license.
   ``Users of Paris streets must appreciate the consequences of the
increase in individualistic parking conduct, which is at the very
least cavalier, if not outright dangerous,'' Police Chief Pierre
Verbrugghe said last month.
   City plans call for eliminating 100,000 parking places in 10
years and creating 300 ``red streets,'' where parking will be
prohibited to facilitate through traffic.
   How long the current heat will last is not clear.
   ``Before, when I was writing a ticket and the owner of the
vehicle arrived, I had a tendency to let it go,'' a Periwinkle
said, ``but now, we are under very strict orders. Nobody escapes.''

   A Pakistani air force plane buzzed
Islamabad on Tuesday and dropped leaflets advertising a private
home furnishing business _ but it was all for charity.
   The U.S.-built C-130 transport made several low passes over
Islamabad as clouds of white paper fell from its open hatch.
   They read: ``Long Live Pakistan ... Come For New and Unmatchable
Variety of Furnishing, Fabric, Carpets.'' They gave the addresses
and phone numbers of Malik Fabrics, Carpets and Furniture in three
Pakistani cities.
   A military spokesman, when informed of the incident, at first
refused to believe it.
   ``That's incredible, absolutely incredible,'' said Col. S.M.A.
Iqbal, deputy chief of military public relations.
   After investigating, he said the aircraft was authorized to drop
leaflets advertising an upcoming charity bazaar to be held by the
Pakistan Air Force Women's Association.
   The leaflets didn't mention the event.
   Employees at the Malik shop in Islamabad denied any knowledge of
the unorthodox advertising.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules that Insurer Owes in Redgrave Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The insurance company for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra will have to pay court costs for the legal battle between
actress Vanessa Redgrave and the symphony, the state Supreme Court
ruled Tuesday.
   Commercial Union Insurance Co. had refused to provide coverage
for the symphony during its seven-year court tangle. But the
state's high court found the company liable, possibly for as much
as $1 million, which is the amount symphony attorneys say was
incurred during the legal dispute.
   By the time the case came to a close this year, Redgrave had
collected $12,000 in damages.
   Redgrave and her company sued the Boston symphony in 1982, after
the symphony canceled a series of performances of Igor Stravinsky's
``Oedipus Rex,'' which Redgrave was to narrate. The series was
called after protests about Redgrave and her pro-Palestinian
politics.
   Prior to filing the lawsuit, Redgrave's attorneys sent a warning
letter to the symphony demanding an apology and asking that the
performances be restored. The letter said the actress had a right
to speak freely, without fear of blacklisting or discrimination and
should not be publicly ridiculed.
   But the engagement was not revived and Redgrave's lawsuit
alleged that the symphony breached its contract with her, causing
her to lose other professional engagements, among other things.
   Commercial Union argued that Redgrave's suit constituted a
generic breach of contract claim. Since its policy with the
symphony called for providing coverage for injuries stemming from
libel, slander or other defamatory material, Commercial Union said
it should not be liable.
   The symphony sued Commercial Union in 1984.
   In its decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that the claim
involved broader issues and that Commercial Union was obliged to
defend the symphony in the matter.
   Though a U.S. District Court jury initially awarded her
$100,000, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton threw out the award.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later restored $12,000 of the
award.
   Redgrave's attorneys petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
the case, but were refused.

<HEAD>Inquiry Finds Laxity at Root of 35 Rail Deaths Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laxity and dangerous standards on British Rail led
to the deaths of 35 people last year in a triple train collision in
London, an official inquiry reported Tuesday.
   Faulty wiring in the signal system was the immediate cause of
the disaster during the morning rush hour Dec. 12, said Sir Anthony
Hidden, the judge who headed the inquiry. The fault caused a signal
to remain green although a train was stopped just beyond it.
   In addition to the dead, more than 100 people were injured when
one commuter train rammed the rear of a stopped commuter train,
outside busy Clapham Junction in south London. The wreckage was
then struck by a freight train.
   Hidden said the signal failure reflected a deterioration of the
``safety culture'' in the state-owned rail system.
   ``The relevant errors include the facts that working practices
were permitted to slip to unacceptable and dangerous standards,''
Hidden's report said.
   ``The quality of supervision was permitted to slip to an
equivalent degree so that those unacceptable and dangerous working
practices were allowed to continue.''
   Among 93 recommendations to improve safety, Hidden called for
priority in installing radios in the cabs of trains and installing
airline-style ``black boxes,'' and more research on improving
rolling stock to protect passengers in the event of an accident.
   Within the signals department, Hidden called for radical
improvement in recruiting and training, and an end to excessive
overtime.
   Technicians testified at a public hearing that they worked long
hours and days off because of a shortage of qualified staff.
   After the report was released, Clifford Hale resigned as quality
manager for the British Railways Board. He was the regional
signaling engineer at the time of the accident.
   Hidden's report said Hale made the ``dangerous assumption'' that
once a problem was identified, it would be fixed. ``The problem
about Mr. Hale's management was that it demonstrated the lack of
communication which pervaded the signals and telecommunications
department,'' the report said.
   ``I accept all the inquiry's recommendations here and now,''
said British Rail's chairman, Sir Robert Reid. ``We have taken
steps to ensure that the circumstances that led to this tragedy can
never be repeated on British Railways.''
   Reid said more than $32 million has been spent solving problems
identified following the Clapham disaster.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying the fate of the
American hostages in Lebanon is with him ``every single day,'' held
out hope Tuesday that the return of frozen Iranian assets might
help prompt Tehran to work for the captives' freedom.
   ``I'd like to get this underbrush cleaned out,'' Bush said in
response to a question about whether the plight of the hostage was
tied to the disposition of Iranian assets seized by the United
States a decade ago.
   Bush's comments at a news conference came a day after U.S.
officials announced Iran would receive $567 million, a portion of
the money frozen by Washington after radical students stormed the
American Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
   Bush said he didn't know if the release of the money would
affect the eight Americans.
   ``I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,''
he said.
   Bush administration officials repeatedly have rejected linking
the hostages' fate to the assets on the grounds the United States
does not negotiate for captives.
   Bush has appealed to pro-Iranian Moslems holding the hostages to
free them on humanitarian grounds.
   But Bush said he hoped actions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal
in The Hague, a body established in 1981 to iron out financial
claims and counter-claims between the two countries, could help the
hostages.
   ``I think they (the Iranians) have made some positive
statements, but I don't know whether it will work that way or not.
I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who hold
these hostages.''
   Nevertheless, Bush said the administration had run into ``dead
ends'' following certain ``rabbit trails'' in behind-the-scenes
efforts to free the hostages.
   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
hostage in Lebanon, called the release of the $567 million ``damned
good news.''
   Anderson, the Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was captured in March 1985.
   ``I would expect the ball is in the court'' of Iranian President
Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mrs. Say said.
   Last month, Rafsanjani offered to help get the Western hostages
freed if the United States released frozen assets or helped settle
the cases of three Iranians captured by Christian Lebanese
militiamen in 1982.
   Shireen Hunter, an expert on Iranian affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a think tank, cautioned
against reading too much into the tribunal actions' in The Hague.
   ``It isn't really a quid pro quo,'' she said of links between
the hostages and the assets. Nevertheless, the tribunal's actions
are another step in ``confidence-building or mistrust-reducing''
between Tehran and Washington, she said.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the $567 million
was the amount transferred to Iran after Iran satisfied debts to
American banks over the last several months. The money came from an
account that contained about $800 million.
   The remainder, about $243 million, was put in a security account
that will be used to pay off others claims to Americans. The
security account must contain a minimum of $500 million at all
times, officials said.
   The agreement was worked out in party by Abraham Sofaer, the
State Department's legal adviser who met with Iranian officials in
The Hague on Nov. 2 and 3, Boucher said.
   The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part of
the arrangement that led to the release of American hostages held
for 444 days in Tehran after seizure of the U.S. Embassy by
militants.
   There are several other claims outstanding, including Iran's
demand for compensation for military equipment purchased before the
1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered.
   The United States transferred $9.9 billion in frozen assets to
the jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks'
settlement this month, some $3.8 billion had been transferred to
Iran.

<TEXT>
   After three terms as mayor and stints as a
congressman, councilman and district leader, Edward I. Koch
couldn't find his name on the ballot Tuesday. He proclaimed himself
``free at last.''
   The lame-duck mayor said he got up at 5:30 a.m., put in an hour
at the gym, went to a police station to ``say goodbye to the cops''
and then cast his ballot for David Dinkins and the rest of the
Democratic ticket.
   ``I feel very sanguine,'' he said outside the Loeb Student
Center at New York University. ``I'm probably the most relaxed guy
in town today.''
   He said he did not mind being out of the political action and
accepted his loss to Dinkins in the Democratic primary in September.
   ``No poignancy. No regrets. No sensitivity,'' he said. ``I have
a sense of `Free at last! Free at last! Great God Almighty! Free at
last!'''
   Koch first ran for office, unsuccessfully, in the Democratic
primary for the state Assembly in 1962. He won a race for
Democratic district leader in Greenwich Village the next year,
ousting Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio.
   ``My critics _ those who have opposed me in election after
election _ thought that somehow or other my life would come to an
end if I were not the mayor,'' Koch said.
   ``And they're dumbfounded. They're confounded, that I am going
on to a new career: from a financial point of view, much more
enriching.''
   Koch, who is paid $130,000-a-year as mayor, has lined up a
fellowship as a lecturer on urban affairs at New York University, a
two-minute commentary on a daily morning radio talk show, a
possible newspaper column, a big-bucks lecture circuit contract and
what he said will probably be a TV show.
   He has also said he would consider ``tasteful'' commercials.
   However, he added, ``Obviously there's no job as good as that of
being mayor. I said that all along.''

<TEXT>
   In the battle between sharks and people, it
turns out that the jaws most to be feared are those of humans.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service announced Tuesday that the
sharks in the North Atlantic may need protection.
   Sharks have been overfished for a decade, resulting in a severe
depletion in the western North Atlantic, the Commerce Department
agency said.
   Once a secondary product caught by fishermen seeking tuna and
swordfish, sharks have become a sought-after seafood on their own,
said Pat Kurkul of the Fisheries Service in Gloucester, Mass.
   Shark meat is becoming common on American stores and shark fins
are increasingly exported, she said.
   Feared for their voraciousness, featured in such films as
``Jaws'', sharks are slow to mature, have a long reproductive cycle
and produce only a few offspring annually, officials said.
   So serious is the concern that the Fisheries Service is taking
the extraordinary step of scheduling a series of hearings over the
next two months to discuss the problem and draft a management plan
for the fish.
   The plan could include setting a commercial quota, requiring
permits for commercial use and establishing recreational bag limits.
   That plan could go to the secretary of commerce by February and
take effect by June, said Ms. Kurkul.
   Mako is the most commonly caught and sold species of shark, but
the management plan would consider some 38 species if they are
found to be in danger, she said.

   President Bush gave himself high grades
Tuesday on the anniversary of his election, vowed to ``veto and
exhort'' until Congress approves his programs and brushed aside
criticism that he has responded too timidly to the awakening of
democracy in Eastern Europe.
   Bush, at a mid-morning news conference, also expressed fresh
hope Iran would help win the release of American hostages in
Lebanon after a U.S. decision to release $567 million in frozen
assets to Tehran.
   ``I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,''
Bush said. He said he hoped the release of the Iranian funds would
get ``underbrush cleared out.''
   Separately, the State Department said that release of the money
was not linked with the hostages.
   Bush opened the Election Day news conference by saying his
administration ``has come together rapidly with good people and
with good ideas and a quiet sense of purpose.''
   After nearly 10 months in office, Bush said, ``I enjoy it. I
like the challenge.''
   Expressing satisfaction with his record in international and
national affairs, Bush said he had seen the greatest surge toward
democracy around the world in at least 40 years.
   Bush brushed aside criticism _ most recently from former
President Jimmy Carter _ that he has responded too cautiously to
changes sweeping the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, East Germany
and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   ``I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than triple
the spending on every initiative,'' Bush said. Besides, he said,
``I don't hear complaints coming out of our allies or, indeed, out
of Hungary or Poland or Eastern Europe.''
   Coincidentally, within an hour of Bush's press conference, the
entire East German cabinet resigned amid demands on the Communist
Party for reform and change in leadership.
   ``Things are happening very fast,'' Bush said. He said the push
toward democracy has ``gone too far to irreversibly ... set back''
the progress. ``I don't think you can contain now the peoples'
aspirations for freedom by going back to totalitarianism.''
   Bush had originally viewed East Germany's new leader, Egon
Krenz, as a hardliner, but said that may have been premature. ``Now
there are some signs that that's not the case,'' he said.
   Looking ahead to his meeting next month with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Bush said that he remained concerned about
the Kremlin's support for the revolutionary government of Nicaragua
and that other superpower differences remain.
   He said that to suggest ``that everything is hunky-dory simply
is not reality, and that's one of the reasons I'm looking forward
to this visit.''
   On the domestic front, Bush accused Congress of delaying action
on his proposals for clean-air legislation, an anti-drug program
and ethics laws. Democrats have tried to go beyond Bush's proposals
in a number of areas, and Republicans have resisted.
   Bush urged the press and public alike to turn up the heat on
Congress, telling lawmakers to ``take a step, get your foot in the
water. Do something.''
   Yet, acknowledging that his options were limited, Bush said his
strategy would be to ``exhort. What else can I do? Veto and
exhort.''
   Bush recently vetoed two spending bills over a provision to
expand the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor
women in cases of rape or incest. Bush said he would not retreat
from his stand.
   ``I can't do it, and I'm sorry. I am not going to change that
policy,'' said Bush, who supports federal funding for abortion only
when the life of the mother is endangered.
   He dismissed the importance of abortion as a critical issue in
gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, saying most
voters are not swayed by a single issue and that abortion ranks
only somewhere between ninth and 14th on the list of issues that
voters consider important.
   On other points, Bush:
   _ Refused to criticize former President Ronald Reagan for
accepting a $2 million fee for a private visit to Japan, saying,
``I will not have anything negative to say about President
Reagan.'' He added, ``Everybody's got to make a living.''
   _ Rejected criticism from environmentalists and some members of
Congress who complain he is stalling efforts to combat global
warming. Environmental policy ``cannot be driven by the extreme,''
Bush said, as more than 60 nations, acting over the opposition of
the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union, urged the world to
stabilize by the year 2000 the emission of gases blamed for the
``greenhouse effect.''
   _ Said it is up to China to take positive steps to restore good
relations with the United States in the aftermath of the bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy forces. ``The Chinese have a slogan: He
who ties the knot should untie it,'' Bush said.
   _ Said he is ``willing to consider'' meeting Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir when he visits the United States later this
month.
   After ending the news conference, Bush returned to the podium to
rebuke militant Christians in Lebanon for seizing a religious
patriarch at his home and abusing him for endorsing a compromise
political accord.
   He said that behavior was ``totally out of order'' and he urged
that all foreign forces be withdrawn from Lebanon.

   The House on Tuesday approved a resolution

   The United States, France and Great Britain, which have long
tested nuclear weapons in the South Pacific, have refused to sign
agreements under the 1986 Treaty of Rarotonga.
   That treaty would restrict development or permanent placing of
nuclear weapons in the region.
   The non-binding resolution, passed by voice vote, says ``United

the Treaty of Rarotonga and its protocols.''
   ``It is therefore the sense of the Congress that the United

from within the Communist Party for a sweeping top-level shakeup. A
parliamentary committee rejected a law promising up to 30 days of
travel to the West and urged a new law allowing unrestricted stays
abroad. Since Saturday, more than 28,000 East Germans have fled to
the West through Czechoslovakia _ arriving in West Germany at the

Mikhail S. Gorbachev tempered the Revolution Day festivities by
saying the nation's economic problems hang like a ``sword of

<HEAD>Duck Stamp Selected; Fame and Fortune for Minnesota Artist?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An acrylic painting by a 25-year-old Minnesota
wildlife artist of two black-bellied whistling ducks was selected
Tuesday to be used for the next Duck Stamp, covering the 1990-91
hunting season.
   The award brings prestige and financial reward to the artist,
Jim Hautman of Plymouth, Minn., who could earn as much as $1
million from commercial printings and other royalties, although the
government pays no money for use of the painting.
   Five judges selected Hautman, who had entered the Duck Stamp
competition four previous times, after they sifted through 603
entries during two days of judging at the Interior Department's
auditorium.
   Well over a million of the stamps with Hautman's design will be
sold for the 1990-91 waterfowl hunting season, bringing $12.50
apiece to the government. Last year the Interior Department
received more than $13 million from the sale of the stamps.
   Although the government sold nearly 1.4 million stamps last
year, the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years.
About 2.4 million stamps were sold yearly in the early 1970s.
   Norma Oprand, chief of the federal Duck Stamp program,
attributes the decline to the reduction of the waterfowl
population. With fewer ducks there are tighter restrictions on
hunting and fewer hunters to buy stamps.
   But the Duck Stamp, created in 1934 and produced every year
since then, is much more than a source of federal revenue for the
artist whose painting adorns the stamp.
   ``For the wildlife artist there's nothing greater than the
Federal Duck Stamp,'' says Neal Anderson, the winner last year, who
was selected in his sixth try with a painting of a pair of lesser
scaup nestled amid a growth of reeds in a pond.
   Barred like every other winner from competing for three years,
Anderson observed this year's competition as the judges reduced the
competitors to 26 entries on the first day and narrowed on a winner
Tuesday.
   Being selected for the Duck Stamp brings a wildlife artist
instant recognition.
   ``You're one of a handful of people that have a piece of U.S.
history,'' said Anderson.
   And then there are the monetary rewards.
   The government does not pay the artist a dime. But in recent
years proceeds from the sale of prints have been lucrative, as have
commissions from commercial use of the winning design on everything
from T-shirts to commemorative plates.
   ``The artist himself should gross around $1 million or a
million-plus,'' says Anderson.
   The award transcends to the artist's other works as well,
Anderson said, noting his other paintings sold more quickly and the
value of his works in galleries rose 20 percent to 30 percent.
   ``You're not a better painter than the day before (you win).
You're just more well-known,'' he said.

   The mother, Shelly Middleton, wasn't injured, but suffered a

   The gunman spoke to the woman before shooting Mandy Middleton,
Lohrey said. But the sheriff declined to reveal what was said.
   Mrs. Middleton and neighbors in the town of 445 people in
northern Oregon provided a description of the gunman's pickup.
   Gregg Goff, 24, of The Dalles, was arrested about two hours later
in Klickitat County, Wash. Lohrey said he was booked on suspicion of
aggravated murder.
   Goff and the child's father, Rob Middleton, worked for Columbia
Aluminum in Goldendale, Wash., and had gone hunting together in the
past, Lohrey said.
   The sheriff said he had no evidence of any disagreements between
them. ``I don't have any motive at all,'' he said.
   Middleton had gone to work and was not home at the time of the
shooting, Lohrey said.

said Tuesday.
   The department's monthly consumer report also showed a decrease
in the number of mishandled baggage complaints against airlines, but
a slight increase in other complaints.
   The data for September showed that the 12 largest carriers

improvement over the 74.6 percent that operated on time in August.
   It was the best record since April's 83.4 percent.
   Mishandled baggage complaints filed against carriers averaged
7.25 reports per 1,000 passengers in September, compared with 8.19
in August, the report said.
   Consumer complaints against all airlines increased from 1,104 in
September to 1,143 in October, the only figures available for last

   President Bush on Tuesday credited the World
Series championship Oakland Athletics for helping earthquake-weary
San Francisco Bay residents recover from ``hard and tragic times.''
   In a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush praised the team as ``champions
on the field and champions off it.''
   In a World Series that will be most remembered for the earthquake
that interrupted it for 11 days, Bush said both the A's and their
rivals, ``those equally magnificent'' San Francisco Giants,
``bounced back, overcoming adversity, uniting a populace. ...''
   The two teams showed ``how true pros perform when the odds are
longest and the evening darkest, and the game is on the line _ the
game of baseball or the larger game of life.''
   The president, a first baseman and captain of his 1948 Yale
baseball team, was presented a baseball jersey with ``Bush'' in
large black letters displayed on its front.
   ``We're looking for a left-hand-hitting first baseman,'' team
manager Tony La Russa told Bush.
   Actually, Bush pitches left-handed but hits right-handed.
   Bush said he only wished La Russa ``could help pilot my budget
through Congress the way he piloted the A's to this World Series
victory.''
   ``Today we're talking baseball. And a team that is clearly and
truly No. 1,'' Bush said, speaking on a raw, overcast day. With the
team's players lined up in business suits behind him, he added:
``big-leaguers, all, each contributing big-time to the cause.''
   ``You helped the Bay Area through some hard and tragic times,''
he said.
   The Athletics beat the Giants in a four-game sweep. But the
series was abruptly interrupted after a quake measuring 7.1 on the
Richter scale struck at the start of game No .3. The quake killed 66
people, left thousands homeless and did billions of dollars worth of
damage.
   Of the Earthquake Series' most valuable player, A's pitcher Dave
Stewart, Bush said: ``I'm just glad I'm not running for office''
against him.
   Addressing the whole team, Bush said: ``To you we all say, well
done.''
   Team owner Walter A. Haas Jr. told Bush, ``baseball is our
national pasttime and you're our most valuable player.''
   Joked Bush: ``I'll bet it's not often that the Oakland A's are
honored by an unofficial scout for the Texas Rangers.'' His oldest
son, George W. Bush, is an owner of the Texas franchise.

   A propelling charge exploded during artillery
testing at the Yuma Proving Ground, killing two Israeli soldiers
inside a tanklike vehicle, U.S. Army officials said Tuesday.
   An Israeli team of four soldiers was test firing the modified
self-propelled M-109 howitzer at the desert base when the accident
occurred Monday afternoon, Army Capt. Stephen McGeorge said.
   The Israeli Defense Force in Jerusalem said the soldiers were
working on a joint project with the U.S. Army.
   Two Israeli soldiers outside the howitzer were injured. They were
in satisfactory condition at Yuma Regional Medical Center, the base
public affairs office said. The identities of the soldiers were
withheld pending notification of relatives.
   McGeorge said the propelling charge apparently exploded; the
projectile and fuse were not explosive.
   ``The fuse and projectile were filled with sand. They were not
explosive. The shell was an iron body filled with sand and the fuse
was inert,'' McGeorge said. He said the shell-fuse combination
weighed about 100 pounds.
   McGeorge said the soldiers had fired about 70 of the 100 rounds
they were scheduled to fire Monday. ``These guys were firing
intermittently over the course of an eight-hour day,'' he said.
   The Israeli army said the accident involved an artillery piece
being jointly produced by the United States and Israel. Countries
buying U.S. equipment sometimes test the equipment at U.S.
facilities, U.S. officials said.
   The proving ground is in Arizona's southwestern corner, near the
California line. The site of the accident was sealed off pending
investigation.
   McGeorge declined to discuss which country was responsible for
maintaining the artillery. ``That will be part of the
investigation,'' he said.
   Because the howitzer was a prototype, investigators will have
``far more detailed'' records on its parts and maintenance, than if
the accident had happened in the field, McGeorge said.
   The howitzer was severly damaged, McGeorge said.
   He didn't know its cost and declined to discuss the specific
modifications.
   The Yuma Daily Sun reported Jan. 3 that Israeli soldiers were
testing an M-109 equipped with computerized fire control and
navigation systems. The systems would allow the self-propelled
howitzer to automatically point its cannon at a target while keeping
constant track of its own location, the Sun said.
   The Sun also reported officials planned to increase the
howitzer's firing speed to three rounds every 15 seconds from four
rounds a minute by installing a new loading device that would insert
the howitzer's 100-pound shell into the breech automatically.
   McGeorge said the howitzer may have been equipped with the
device, called a flick rammer, ``but they were not trying for any
speed records.''

   The Senate Armed Services Committee will begin
hearings next week on the explosion aboard the USS Iowa that claimed
the lives of 47 sailors, the panel's chairman said Tuesday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the panel will hold hearings both on
the April 19 blast and the Navy's investigation of it.
   The Navy concluded that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig ``most
likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   But since the service issued its report on Sept. 7, members of
Congress, Hartwig's family and the sailor's former shipmates have
criticized the Navy's conclusions.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of a House Armed
Services subcommittee that also is reviewing the matter, cited an
FBI report that said its laboratory inquiry was inconclusive.
   Mavroules said the fact that two government departments _ the
Pentagon and the FBI _ failed to reach the same conclusions raises
serious doubts about the Navy's findings.
   However, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the Navy's
technical and criminal study, said in an interview last week that he
stands by his conclusions.
   ``I am not aware of anything that would cause me to change my
report,'' he said.

Tuesday during the Duchess of York's visit to a children's museum.
   Indeed, the former Sarah Ferguson didn't even mention her books
``Budgie the Little Helicopter'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's Point,''
children's tales of a helicopter that has adventures and doesn't
like to bathe.
   When the British duchess known as ``Fergie'' led a group of

   The meeting between the duchess and youngsters at the Children's

   Asked why her books weren't among those being handed out to
children, the duchess just smiled.
   ``It wasn't an event to promote the Budgie books,'' said Ken
Geist of Simon and Schuster.
   To showcase Budgie ``would have been too obvious,'' said Francis
Corniche, a spokesman for the British Embassy.
   The duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew, has said she got

Andrew is a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy.

   One of the changes enacted by Congress in response
to the savings and loan crisis may have the unintended effect of
making new homes more expensive, thrift and housing executives said
Tuesday.
   Officials of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift
industry's largest trade group, have identified the new restriction
on loans to one borrower as a top priority in their campaign to
amend S&amp;L legislation passed in August.
   The new limit is 15 percent of an institution's capital, down
from 100 percent previously, a level that allowed an institution to
fail because of the default of a single borrower.
   The lower limit was intended to break up the relationship between
some builders and a few thrift executives who would fund highly
speculative development projects.
   But, U.S. League President Fred Webber said 15 percent is too
restrictive. Kent W. Colton, executive vice president of the
National Association of Home Builders, said ``war stories'' are
beginning to filter in from builders whose credit lines with S&amp;Ls
have been cut drastically.
   Home builders need large acquisition and development loans to
prepare subdivision plots for sale, he said.
   ``I'm not talking about dollars to finance land speculation. ...
There are people who have sold the lots but can't get the money to
put in infrastructure,'' he told 3,600 delegates to the league's
97th annual convention.
   Colton said a scarcity of development loans could increase the
cost of new homes and said builders and S&amp;L executives should unite
to lobby Congress to ease the restriction.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the home builders, said S&amp;Ls
may eventually learn to cope with the new rule, which has applied to
national banks for years, by combining in groups to make development
loans or by selling shares in the loans to other institutions.
   Meanwhile, House Secretary Jack Kemp drew cheers from the S&amp;L
executives by repeating his call for lower interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve Board has been trying to ease inflation
pressures by slowing the economy with high interest rates, a policy
Kemp called ``a barbaric solution to the inflation equation.''
   Lower interest rates are ``absolutely critical'' for making homes
affordable to Americans, he said. New homes sales in September,
according to the Commerce Department, plunged 14 percent, the
sharpest dive in nearly eight years.
   However, economists appearing at a panel discussion predicted the
Fed would only reluctantly ease interest rates as signs of economic
sluggishness emerged.
   ``The decade is going out with a whimper and you might get some
short-term relief from high interest rates,'' said James Christian,
chief economist of the S&amp;L trade group.
   Christian is predicting that construction of new homes will
remain flat at about 1.4 million units in 1990 and 1991.

   NBC appears to be winning the battle of the
network comedy nights as ABC's Tuesday shows fell in the ratings and
``Chicken Soup'' was canceled.
   ``Chicken Soup,'' starring comedian Jackie Mason, touted as this
season's biggest potential hit, will have its final telecast Tuesday
night.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Cheers''
all nosed out ABC's ``Roseanne'' for first, second and third place
in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended Nov. 5. NBC's other
Thursday night comedy, ``Dear John,'' was sixth.
   ``Roseanne'' fell to fourth place after last week's finish at the
top. Other ABC Tuesday comedies were also down. ``The Wonder Years''
was 17th, ``Who's the Boss?'' tied for 19th and ``Chicken Soup'' was
23rd.
   NBC won big for the week in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey. Its
average was 15.2. ABC was second with 13.7 and CBS third with 11.9.
A rating is the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes tuned
to a show.
   NBC is also ahead for the season-to-date and in the November
sweeps. The ratings for the first seven weeks of the fall season:
NBC 15.0, ABC 13.7, CBS 12.6. For the first four days of the Nielsen
sweeps: NBC 15.0, CBS 12.8, ABC 11.3. The first five days of the
Arbitron sweeps: NBC 14.8, CBS 12.4, ABC 12.3.
   The sweeps are designated times when local stations' ratings are
recorded to establish advertising rates. Networks usually present
their flashiest shows during the monthlong sweeps period.
   Two veteran network stars, Carroll O'Connor and Andy Griffith,
contributed to the fall of ABC's Tuesday comedies. NBC won the night
with ``Matlock,'' ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ``Midnight
Caller'' for the first time this season. ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' starring O'Connor, was 14th, ``Matlock,'' starring
Griffith, was 18th, and ``Midnight Caller,'' starring Gary Cole, was
26th.
   Here are the top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A
Different World,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC's ``Dear John,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and NBC's ``L.A. Law,''
tied.
   This past week was the most normal week of the season so far.
NBC's ``L.A. Law'' was the last regular show to premiere, the World
Series is over and the end of daylight savings time is raising the
eight o'clock ratings to standard time levels.
   ``Chicken Soup'' will be replaced by the return of ``Coach,''
starring Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares.
   The opening chapter of the NBC miniseries ``Cross of Fire'' on
Sunday was 42nd. Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With
Children'' was 51st for the week.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first again in the ratings,
despite the fact that 18 West Coast stations telecast it earlier or
dropped it entirely on Mondays because of ``Monday Night Football.''
ABC has won for the past four weeks and was tied with CBS the week
before that. The ratings: ABC 11.4, CBS 10.7, NBC 10.1.
   The lowest rated network show of the week was CBS's ``Wolf.'' The
five bottom network shows were: ABC's ``Homeroom,'' ABC's ``Living
Dolls,'' CBS' ``A Peaceable Kingdom,'' ABC's ``Mr. Belevedere'' and
CBS' ``Wolf.''

   Winter wheat planted this fall for the 1990
harvest is in ``mostly good to fair'' condition, but more soil
moisture is needed in some areas, the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday.
   ``Planting was 93 percent complete, four points ahead of normal''
as of the Oct. 30-Nov. 5 survey week, the report said. ``Planting
was complete or nearly complete in 13 of the 19 major producing
states.''
   However, winter wheat planting continued to lag behind normal in
Georgia and North Carolina.
   ``Rain was needed in the Great Plains where the crop was mostly
good to fair,'' the report said. ``In Texas, the crop was mostly
fair. Russian wheat aphids were a continuing problem in portions of
the Pacific Northwest.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. Its reports cover weather and crop conditions only and
provides no estimates of yields or total production.
   This year's corn harvest was 88 percent completed by early
November, 10 percentage points ahead of normal, the report said.
Harvest was almost done in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, kansas,
Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas, and advanced sharply in Colorado,
Indiana and Michigan.
   But the report said corn harvesting lagged behind in Ohio and
Pennsylvania, while ``near or ahead of normal'' in the other major
producing states.
   The soybean harvest was reported 87 percent complete, 11
percentage points ahead of normal pace for this time. Farmers had
completed harvesting in Minnesota and South Dakota, and were almost
done in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska.
   Soybean harvesting made rapid progress during the week in the
Delta and eastern Corn Belt, with advances of 20 percentage points
or more in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee.
   The cotton harvest advanced 12 percentage points during the week
of Oct. 30-Nov. 5, including major progress in Arkansas, California
and Mississippi, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis
began efforts to form a new government under a presidential mandate
bestowed on Monday, but faces an uphill battle for success.
   Mitsotakis has three days to organize enough support to persuade
President Christos Sartzetakis he can put together a Cabinet. If he
fails, former Premier Andreas Papandreou will be given the
exploratory mandate.
   Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party came in first in elections last
Sunday, but missed a parliamentary majority. It was the second time
in five months Greeks went to the polls only to get an inconclusive
result.
   A third set of elections this year is likely if no leading party
can fashion a government. The standoff has delayed major decisions
on the ailing economy and foreign policy.
   A conservative-Communist alliance formed after elections in June
was empowered only to investigate allegations of scandals in
Papandreou's former administration.
   ``In three days I will return to the president and inform him of
the results of my efforts,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   He must marshal the support of 151 members of the 300-seat
Parliament to win approval of his government. New Democracy won 148
seats last Sunday, Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement _
known as PASOK _ won 128 and the Communist-led Coalition of the
Left and Progress won 21.
   Mitsotakis faces tough going. PASOK and the Coalition ruled out
teaming with New Democracy and one of the three independents is
allied with the leftists.
   But Mitsotakis said he expected to gain the seat won by an
independent environmentalist, citing a legal ambiguity that may
allow his party to contest the seat in a special electoral court.
   He said he will not enter any alliance that will force his party
to water down its program to revive the economy and seek closer
U.S. ties.
   Papandreou was expected to appeal to the Coalition to join PASOK
in a government.
   If no coalition emerges, the president will offer the major
parties the chance to form a joint administration _ a proposal
supported by the Coalition.
   If that fails, new elections will be called.
   A New Democracy official, Ioannis Palaiokrassas, said the
parties will try to avoid new elections.
   ``I don't see new elections right now, for the simple reason
that no ... (party) wants them, nor do the Greek people. Only in
the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,'' he said.
   New Democracy and the Coalition have said they will not repeat
their summer alliance as their programs are incompatible. Their
government handed over to a caretaker administration in October
after Parliament indicted Papandreou and five of his former
ministers on charges of corruption.
   More elections would not necessarily produce a strong
government. A proportional electoral system introduced by PASOK
earlier this year makes it difficult for any party to win a
parliamentary majority.
   The new Parliament includes some celebrities. Actress and former
Culture Minister Melina Mercouri was re-elected on the PASOK ticket.
   Leftist composer Mikis Theodorakis, who did the soundtrack for
the film ``Zorba the Greek,'' was elected running as a New
Democracy candidate. A former Communist Party deputy, he announced
in October he was cooperating with the conservatives in a crusade
against urban terrorism.
   Mitsotakis' daughter, Dora Bakoyannis, won overwhelmingly in the
mountainous constituency of Evritania. The seat was formerly held
by her husband, New Democracy spokesman Pavlos Bakoyannis, who was
murdered by extreme-left urban guerrillas on Sept. 26.

<HEAD>Five Countries Freeze $60 Million Bank Accounts Of Drug Lord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five foreign countries froze $60 million in
bank accounts owned by a major narcotics trafficker, a senior U.S.
drug enforcement official said Tuesday.
   The official, Terrence M. Burke, acting deputy administrator of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, said efforts are being made to
freeze an additional two or three bank accounts belonging to the
same Columbian drug dealer.
   Burke told reporters the action represents a significant advance
in the war on drugs because it is an example of valuable
cooperation by the government of Colombia and the five other
nations in which the numerous bank accounts were located.
   Burke disclosed the development during testimony before a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearings held to evaluate the Bush
administration's attempt to attack major drug cartels at the source
in Colombia and other Latin American nations.
   Elaborating on his testimony after the hearing, Burke declined
to identify the drug dealer whose accounts were frozen or to name
the countries in which the accounts were located. No American banks
are believed to be involved, Burke said.
   ``Based on information provided by the Colombian government in
the last 10 days, we have been able to identify and freeze bank
accounts in five countries that contain at least $60 million,''
Burke told reporters.
   He said the accounts were not part of a money laundering-system,
``but represent savings accounts of one of the major Colombian
narcotics dealers.''
   ``These are accounts which we believe contain liquid assets of
this particular trafficker,'' Burke said.
   Burke said the drug dealer is being sought by law enforcement
authorities.
   ``I think this development demonstrates international
cooperation,'' Burke said. ``The Colombian authorities developed
this information in real time and gave it to us. And several other
countries cooperated in turn to freeze these funds. I think that's
very significant.''
   ``We are striking at the heart of these trafficking syndicates
by confiscating their money and goods,'' Burke said in his prepared
testimony.
   He noted that earlier this year the DEA and other federal and
foreign law enforcement agencies conducted a joint operation dubbed
``Operation Polar Cap'' which closed down a money-laundering
enterprise that handled some $1.2 billion in illicit drug profits
belonging to Colombia's Medellin cartel.
   ``Operation Polar Cap resulted in the seizure of more than one
ton of cocaine, the confiscation of $92 million in cash, jewelry
and real estate and the indictment of 127 individuals,'' Burke said.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Jamming System `Has Problems'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department acknowledged Tuesday
that a planned $9 billion system for jamming enemy radar ``has
problems,'' and that a major review has been ordered to determine
whether the program will proceed.
   The program came under fire in September when Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark., called it a ``potential waste of billions of dollars'' and
quoted Navy documents that called the system ``marginally
operationally effective.''
   The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer will deceive or jam enemy
radar and will be carried aboard Navy and Air Force fighter planes,
including the F-14, F-18, F-16 and AV-8B.
   The Defense Department planned to produce 2,369 of the jammers
at a total cost of $9.4 billion over the expected 20-year life of
the program. So far, $681 million has been spent.
   Aircraft are to be equipped with electronic warfare systems that
use a radar-warning receiver to alert a pilot when the airplane is
being tracked by enemy radar. It also sends out signals to confuse
enemy missiles or radar, creating false targets or giving opponents
the idea that U.S. planes aren't where they seem to be.
   Many electronic warfare systems are in use and determined to be
satisfactory, but the services are pursuing the new system in the
expectation of growing technological threats.
   ``It has problems,'' Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman told
reporters when he was asked about the system. But he declined to go
into detail, saying only that the system had ``performance,
reliability'' problems.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood and the undersecretary of
defense for acquisition, James Betti, are ``engaged in the
problem,'' Hoffman said.
   ``Where we stand now is that there has been a memorandum that
calls for a review of the program after a one-year period,''
Hoffman said, adding that the Pentagon then will decide whether to
continue the program.
   Meanwhile, he said, a limited production of 100 units has been
ordered.
   ``Work is being done on this, and we hope to get this thing on
track,'' Hoffman said.
   Duane P. Andrews, nominated to be assistant secretary of defense
for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, told the
Senate Armed Services Committee that support for the system remains
strong despite problems.
   ``I'm told it's the most effective system that we currently have
for our deployed forces and the office of the secretary of defense
is standing behind the program,'' Andrews said at his confirmation
hearing Tuesday.
   According to Pentagon sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified, the program is four years behind its original
production start date.
   The source said that the delays were due in some measure to
``updated threat intelligence'' information and a decision to delay
development to upgrade the system.
   The Pentagon inspector general and the General Accounting Office
are reviewing the decision to proceed with the program, the source
said.
   Navy Capt. Matt Small told The Washington Post in an article
published Tuesday that ``we don't do a good job of evaluating
jammer performance,'' and that problems with the program's flawed
test methods and equipment can be overcome.
   The source said a joint Air Force and Navy group has been formed
to improve those testing procedures and that the effort is expected
to be completed by the end of the year.
   In a report released in September, the GAO said the test
equipment used by the Air Force to determine the effectiveness of
the radar-warning receivers and other electronics on tactical
fighters was faulty and unreliable.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the problems
undermined the combat readiness of the aircraft and attributed the
problems to the Air Force's acquisition process, in which it bought
test sets before determining whether they would work properly.

   The Bush administration urged the Supreme
Court on Tuesday to give U.S. law enforcement officials broader
power to conduct searches in foreign countries.
   The justices were told in a case involving a notorious Mexican
drug-smuggling operation that the Constitution gives U.S. agents
more leeway when they investigate away from U.S. soil.
   Justice Department lawyer Lawrence S. Robbins said Fourth
Amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches were not
designed ``to protect rights in every quarter of the globe.''
   He described as ``zaniness'' any constitutional interpretation
that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant from a U.S.
judge before searching a home in another country.
   But Michael Pancer, representing an alleged high-ranking drug
dealer, said the high court should not authorize ``a raiding
party'' on foreign soil.
   ``If a warrant is required, (U.S. agents) must either get one or
they must not search,'' he said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia questioned what judge in the United
States would have authority to issue a warrant to search a foreign
residence. ``Where do you go?'' he asked. ``You call warrant
central?''
   U.S. agents without a warrant in 1988 searched the home of Rene
Verdugo Urquidez in Mexicali, Mexico. Verdugo was convicted in
California last year of taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture
and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique
Camarena and his pilot.
   Verdugo, identified as a top lieutenant to Mexican drug kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero, is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life
and is not eligible for parole for 59 years, when he would be 96.
   But his conviction in the murders is not at issue in the case
argued Tuesday that is expected to yield a high court ruling by
July.
   The issue is whether the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based
in San Francisco properly suppressed evidence the DEA found when it
searched Verdugo's home.
   Verdugo had been arrested two years earlier by Mexican police
and was turned over to U.S. authorities in California.
   The Bush administration said the power of U.S. law enforcement
officials, particularly DEA agents, to help in foreign
investigations is at stake.
   The DEA has offices in 45 nations and last year helped in
investigations that it said led to 1,200 arrests of suspected drug
smugglers in foreign countries.
   The search of Verdugo's home was conducted in conjunction with
Mexican police.
   Robbins argued that even if the Fourth Amendment applies to
foreign searches by U.S. agents, the search of Verdugo's home was
reasonable and did not violate the suspect's rights.
   Pancer said the search was unreasonable. For example, he said,
the U.S. agents were cooperating with a Mexican police officer they
knew had a history of taking bribes and the searchers by mistake
first went to the wrong house.
   Requiring a search warrant is designed to prevent such abuses,
he said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.

   Prosecutors say they will appeal a
judge's decision to drop a child-abuse charge against the mother of
a baby born addicted to cocaine.
   Broward Circuit Judge Robert B. Carney said he based the
dismissal on an earlier case that determined Florida's child-abuse
laws do not apply to a fetus.
   In the earlier case, the 4th District Court of Appeal in West
Palm Beach decided charges of battery against an infant could not be
brought against a man who shot a pregnant woman who delivered a
wounded baby.
   ``The state will certainly seek to appeal,'' said Assistant State
Attorney Dennis Bailey after Carney dismissed charges Monday against
Cassandra Gethers, 23, of Hollywood.
   Ms. Gethers remains in jail, serving an 18-month sentence for
violating probation she received for an earlier conviction for
possession of cocaine. Her attorney, Russell Adler, said she may be
released in one to three months.
   ``She wants to get her baby back, get a job and get counseling,''
he said.
   She was arrested in February and charged with child abuse after
she and her baby daughter were found to be cocaine-dependent.
   No woman has been convicted in the United States of child abuse
as a result of harm she caused her baby by using cocaine during
pregnancy.
   The State Attorney's Office said it prosecuted Ms. Gethers
because she also gave birth in February 1988 to a cocaine-dependent
son and was counseled at that time on the dangers of using cocaine
while pregnant.

   A fungus from Australia is showing up well as a
natural killer of destructive grasshoppers that threaten crops and
rangeland, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Jerry Fowler, director of the department's Grasshopper Integrated
Pest Management Project, said preliminary laboratory experiments
indicated that the fungus _ Entomophaga praxibuli _ can infect and
kill a broad range of the pesky hoppers.
   USDA's Animal and Plant health Inspection Service said that if
the fungus proves out, it could help lessen the need for chemicals
to control the pests. The project plan is to integrate the fungus
with research demonstrations in North Dakota next year.
   ``The fungus only affects grasshoppers,'' the agency said.
``Laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater than any
found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus causes no harm
to other insects and does not affect humans or other mammals.''
   Scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an
outbreak in Australia in 1985.
   ``The dry climatic conditions in the Wanwibinda region of New
South Wales, where this fungus was discovered, are similar to
America's northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infect
millions of acres,'' the agency said.

   Police said a security guard and three other
people were held in custody Tuesday in connection with the theft of
$17 million of art from the home of Pablo Picasso's granddaughter.
   None was charged and investigators released no names. All are
current or former employees of Marina Picasso and worked at her
French Riviera villa, including the guard who was out shopping for
bread Sunday morning at the time of the heist, police said.
   The four were interrogated Monday and will be questioned further
regarding the robbery of 13 works of art worth at least $17 million,
the officers said.
   Investigators identified the works only as seven paintings by
Pablo Picasso, one Brueghel, an Odilon Redon, three lesser-known
19th-century works and a bust by sculptor August Rodin.
   Ms. Picasso was spending the weekend in Megeve when the theft
occurred in the Basse Californie section of Cannes.
   Police said Tuesday they found a hole made in the fence
surrounding the estate, but no other signs of a break-in.
   The burglar alarm did not go off and none of the five guard dogs
interfered, police said. One guard was on vacation and the other had
gone shopping, leaving the house empty.
   Art experts said the items stolen were too well-known to be sold
on the art market by any serious collector or dealer.

   U.S. Army surgeons are learning trauma
treatment skills at a Watts-based hospital that has one of the
busiest emergency rooms in the country tending to the carnage of
gang gunshot victims.
   The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a motion to
expand the presence of military physicians at beleaguered Martin
Luther King-Drew Medical Center into other areas, including
obstetrics and pediatrics.
   The county-run hospital has been under fire and its director was
recently removed following reports that it was understaffed and
underfunded.
   Tuesday's motion by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, whose district
includes the hospital, calls for the Health Services Department to
develop a proposal within two weeks for expanding the military
physician training program.
   Army doctors usually receive their trauma surgery training at
public hospitals near their home bases.
   But military officials say that the young surgeons rarely see
the kinds of gaping, multiple wounds caused by automatic and
semiautomatic gunfire, like those common to gang shootings here,
where more than 353 gang-related slayings were reported last year.
   A pair of U.S. Army resident physicians from Texas recently
completed a two-month training program at King-Drew, where
officials say gang mayhem creates a virtual steady stream of
gunshot victims.
   ``Here, you'll see a case where a .22 (-caliber gun)
accidentally discharged,'' said Dr. John McPhail, chief of surgery
at William Beaumont Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, on Tuesday.
``But at King, the typical shooting was a victim shot multiple
times by someone trying to kill them with larger caliber and more
bullet holes in the patients.''
   The 430-bed hospital treated almost 3,500 trauma victims in 1988
_ nearly 40 percent of the county's trauma patients, hospital
officials said.
   County health officials estimate doctors there treat more than
100 gunshot cases and dozens of stabbings each month.
   McPhail said he got the idea to send military physicians to Los
Angeles last year after Dr. Arthur Fleming, chief of trauma and
surgery at King-Drew, attended a trauma conference at William
Beaumont and gave a talk on the situation at the Los Angeles
hospital.
   ``I said, `This is a place where we should be sending some of
our residents and staff,''' McPhail recalled.
   A telephone call to Fleming's office on Tuesday was not
immediately answered.
   Dr. John Holcomb, a fourth-year resident at Beaumont Medical
Center in Texas, completed his two-month stint in trauma surgery at
King-Drew last week.
   He said Tuesday in a telephone interview that while he did see
several gunshot victims, only a few were suffering from high
velocity weapon wounds of the type inflicted by military-type
weapons.
   ``There were nights that were extremely busy. About two
Saturdays ago, it got really busy. That was the night I got called
in on my time off. There was a guy walking around with a .45,
shooting people,'' Holcomb said.
   County health officials said the pilot program may be expanded
and Army officials said they hope to make it a permanent part of
their surgical training.
   McPhail said Holcomb told him that ``while the experience was
excellent, he also felt he was providing a service as well.''
   In addition to the two doctors from Beaumont, another Army
surgeon from Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colo.,
trained at King-Drew. Two more surgeons from Beaumont and two more
from Fitzsimmons are scheduled to train at the hospital over the
next year.

   The Iran-Contra prosecutor urged the U.S. Court
of Appeals on Tuesday to issue a transcript of a closed hearing in
the case of Joseph Fernandez, the former CIA station chief in Costa
Rica.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh told the Richmond, Va., court
that a censored version of the transcript from the Aug. 23 hearing
should be made public because much of the testimony isn't
potentially damaging to national security.
   Justice Department lawyers prevailed on the court to close a
portion of that hearing dealing with CIA programs in Costa Rica
aimed at protecting the country against a possible invasion by
Nicaragua.
   In a court filing, Walsh said intelligence agencies had
authorized him to disclose that information and that the Justice
Department approved its disclosure at public trial.
   But the department said the information, contained in documents
prepared by the government, still was considered classified for
purposes of oral argument.
   Even federal law protecting classified information ``implies that
the Attorney General may not certify the closure of an entire
hearing where only a `portion' of that hearing risks disclosure of
classified information,'' Walsh said.
   ``Thus, while the Attorney General has authority to close an
argument because of the likelihood that classified information will
be disclosed, the Attorney General has no authority ... to prohibit
access to a redacted, unclassified transcript,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh's court filing was in support of five organizations _ CBS
Inc., The New York Times Co., The Washington Post, the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press _ that have filed a motion for access to a redacted transcript.
   Fernandez is charged with obstructing the Tower Commission and
the CIA inspector general and making false statements in the
Iran-Contra affair. He allegedly assisted White House aide Oliver
North's secret Contra re-supply operation.
   His trial is delayed while the Justice Department decides whether
it wants to appeal a ruling that the attorney general may not
intervene in the Fernandez case with court appeals to protect
classified information.
   The ruling leaves Attorney General Dick Thornburgh with the
option of allowing certain classified information to be divulged at
Fernandez's trial or filing an affidavit barring its disclosure.
Filing an affidavit could scuttle the prosecution.

<HEAD>EPA May Exclude Too Many Waste Sites from Superfund, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT T. GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency may be
improperly excluding up to 2,000 hazardous waste sites from its
Superfund cleanup program and deliberately limiting the number of
cases it will handle, according to testimony Tuesday before a House
subcommittee.
   ``EPA's requirement to meet statutory guidelines and its desire
to reduce its tremendous workload is causing the site reject rate to
steadily increase,'' Joel S. Hirschhorn of the congressional Office
of Technology Assessment told the Government Operations subcommittee
on environment, energy and natural resources.
   Witnesses at the hearing said that EPA's system for identifying
sites that would qualify for Superfund and federal aid for 90
percent of the cleanup cost is inadequate because it relies heavily
on information from state and local governments.
   State governments sometimes are reluctant to report sites for
Superfund cleanup because states must pay 10 percent of the bill,
witnesses said.
   To hold down costs, states have settled with the polluters, often
resulting in a less expensive, less reliable cleanup, according to
testimony. States also have not told EPA about some sites, forgoing
federal funds, because they thought EPA cleanup was too
time-consuming, said GAO official Richard L. Hembra.
   The cost of cleaning up an average Superfund site runs from $21
million to $30 million, the House Appropriations Committee estimated
last year.
   The Superfund has a $10.1 billion authorization for 10 years
beginning in 1986, subject to actual appropriations of funds from
year to year.
   Hirschhorn said that EPA, under pressure because of the high
costs and heavy caseload, is ruling out too many sites too early and
with too little information.
   In a report released last month, the Office of Technology
Assessment calculated that from 246 to 2,000 sites may have been
excluded from Superfund that should have been included. The estimate
was derived from a number of studies and data and did not refer to
specific sites.
   The General Accounting Office estimates that there are from
130,000 to 425,000 potential hazardous waste sites in the country.
There are, however, only 31,000 known or suspected hazardous waste
sites on EPA's list of candidates for Superfund cleanup.
   The agency has 1,219 sites on a priority list for cleanup under
Superfund.
   EPA concedes that it is ruling out more sites for Superfund but
maintains that it is doing a better job on site decisions and is
devoting more staff time to that task.
   ``Yes, we've processed more, but we've made better decisions,''
said Henry Longest, director of EPA's Office of Emergency and
Remedial Response.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. and chairman of the subcommittee,
alleged that EPA was pursuing a policy of deferring enforcement
decisions to the states even though the agency officially had
discarded that approach.
   ``By consciously limiting the number of sites which will be
addressed through the Superfund program, EPA is continually shifting
more and more cleanup responsibilities to other Federal programs
which have fewer financial resources and safeguards, and to states
which are struggling to cope with the problems they already face,''
Synar said.
   Last December, the EPA asked for comment on a proposed policy of
turning over control of Superfund sites to states. The outcry was so
great that EPA disbanded the working group studying the issue.
   EPA's acting assistant administrator for Solid Waste and
Emergency Repsonse, Jonathan Z. Cannon, said the agency was working
within the constraints imposed by budgets and the law, which
requires a certain deference to state agencies.
   ``Our job is to prioritize and to do the best job that we can,''
said Cannon.

   President Bush on Tuesday rejected criticism
from members of Congress and environmentalists who say he's
stalling efforts to combat global warming.
   Environmental policy, Bush said, ``cannot be driven by the
extreme.''
   The president's defense came as three senators chastized his
administration for not endorsing a resolution sought by many
European countries at a global warming conference in the
Netherlands. The resolution calls for specific curbs on
``greenhouse'' gases by the end of the century.
   The White House issued a statement later Tuesday saying that the
United States had agreed on a compromise declaration at the
Netherlands conference that says global warming pollutants should
be stabilized ``as soon as possible.''
   According to administration sources, U.S. negotiators felt they
could accept that wording because it doesn't tie any nation to
specific levels of pollution reduction nor stabilize levels by a
specific year.
   The revised declaration notes only that ``in the view of many
industrialized nations'' _ but not necessarily all nations _ carbon
dioxide emissions should be stabilized by 2000, said one U.S.
official, asking that he not be identified.
   ``We're not willing to agree to a set time. We did not sign on
to anything mentioning the year 2000,'' said deputy presidential
press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Originally, many of the conference participants had sought
commitments to freeze greenhouse gas emissions at present levels by
2000, a position the Bush administration has rejected. That
prompted sharp criticism from some members of Congress and
environmentalists.
   ``President Bush promised to confront the greenhouse effect. Now
what we're seeing is the whitewash effect,'' Sen. Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., said in remarks on the Senate floor.
   Bush also was criticized by Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.
   ``The president of the United States, who wants to be the
environmental president, promised to lead us on this issue (of
global warming),'' Becker said. ``But he's leading us in the wrong
direction _ backward.''
   Bush, asked about the issue at a White House news conference,
defended his strategy of moving slowly in making a commitment to
specific reductions in greenhouse gases.
   The U.S. scientific community, he said, ``is in the lead'' in
focusing on the question of what effect pollutants, primarily from
the burning of fossil fuels, will have on world temperatures over
the next 50 years.
   ``But you can't take a policy and drive it to the extreme and
say to every country around the world (that) you aren't going to
grow (economically) at all,'' the president said.
   The administration has been divided for months on how
aggressively it should pursue specific commitments to getting
worldwide reductions in global warming pollutants, especially
carbon dioxide, of which the United States is the largest source.
   A major concern among some presidential advisers has been over
cost.
   Significant reductions of greenhouse pollutants will require
curbing the use of fossil fuels, meaning more fuel-efficient
automobiles and increased energy conservation, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``We believe in a reduction of carbon dioxide. But we're not
prepared to say by what time and by what level,'' EPA Administrator
William Reilly, head of the U.S. delegation in the Netherlands,
said as the conference opened Monday.
   Reilly has said repeatedly that the United States believes it's
too early to commit to specific curbs of greenhouse gases and that
such matters are best worked out by the International Panel on
Climate Change in a series of meeting beginning in February.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, on Tuesday
compared Bush's attitude toward dealing with global warming with
former President Reagan's eight-year opposition to dealing with
acid rain. Conceding pollution curbs could be costly, Mitchell said
that ``delay has a cost of its own.''
   Gore and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., two of the Senate's
strongest advocates for immediate action to combat global warming,
accused Bush of reneging on a campaign promise to address the issue
promptly.
   Wirth said the administration ``is clearly out of the
mainstream'' on global warming and has has demonstrated at the
Netherlands conference that it's ``not a leader but a delinquent
partner.''
   ``The overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that we are
changing our atmosphere, the world is getting warmer and we ought
to move now,'' Wirth said. ``It is not a question of if the globe
is warming, but how much and how fast.''
   Nicholas Fedoruk, a spokesman for Washington-based Environmental
Action Foundation, said the United States is the largest
contributor to the release of global warming gases ``and should be
leading efforts to solve the problem.''
   ``Instead, this country allied itself with some of the world's
biggest polluters to stymie meaningful action,'' Fedoruk said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush said Tuesday that there's room
in politics for differing viewpoints on abortion and that the issue
is ``absolutely not'' the most important one for him.
   On an election day when the issue of a woman's right to an
abortion figured as a major theme in gubernatorial campaigns in New
Jersey and Virginia, Bush also said he does not believe voters cast
their ballots based on that issue alone.
   ``I don't believe most voters are single-issue voters. There is
no evidence to support that, none at all,'' he said, citing data by
his campaign pollster, Robert Teeter, showing that voters consider
abortion the ninth to 14th most important issue before them.
   ``I think our party is broad enough to contain differing views
on this ... and I think the Democratic Party is,'' Bush told a
White House news conference. ``It's so personal. I just come down
more on the side of life. ... Look, I don't fault people who view
this differently. There's plenty of room for difference.''
   Bush's comments brought quick reaction from a leading pro-choice
advocate on Capitol Hill. Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said it
appeared the president was attempting to moderate his views, and
was ``trying to distance himself from the radical, anti-choice
platform on which he ran.''
   She said also that ``he's got a bit of a mini-revolution going
on'' among pro-choice Republicans in Congress.
   In the meantime, members of Congress and activist groups that
want abortions outlawed have hammered on Bush because they are
suspicious that he is not as strongly committed to their cause as
his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Acknowledging the heated opinions, Bush appeared told reporters,
``Abortion divides.''
   But he also said, ``We have room in our party for people that
feel one way _ pro-life or pro-choice; Democratic Party, the same
way.''
   Nationwide activism by pro-choice supporters has put an
increasingly bright spotlight on the abortion controversy since the
Supreme Court's decision in July giving states increased powers to
legislate on abortion.
   Bush insisted he has ``no intention of changing my position.''
   ``Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not,'' Bush
said.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said Bush was wrong to think abortion was not a top priority among
voters.
   ``He's going to find it out ... in 1990. And, if he stays on a
collision course with the American people, he'll find it out
personally in 1992.''
   Bush recently vetoed the $157.6 billion package for the
departments of Education, Labor and Health and Huan Services
because it included an abortion-financing provision written by
Boxer.
   The provision would have expanded the use of Medicaid funds to
pay for abortions for rape or incest victims, going beyond current
law, which allows Medicaid funds to be spent only in cases where
the mother's life is endangered.
   Bush also has vowed to veto a $14.4 billion foreign aid bill for
fiscal 1990 because it would send $15 million to the U.N.
Population Fund.
   The agency carries on programs in China, where its opponents say
severe official restrictions on family size have led to forced
abortions and sterilizations.
   ``It supports compulsory abortion,'' he said of the U.N.
program. ``I am not going to do that.''
   Bush commented as voters in Virginia and New Jersey went to the
polls to elect governors after campaigns that dwelt heavily on the
candidates' positions on abortion.
   In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Douglas Wilder
attacked Republican Marshall Coleman in a series of TV ads for his
stance against the right to an abortion.
   The abortion controversy continued to erupt nationwide as Bush
made his comments, with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
saying Tuesday in Baltimore that no Catholic can responsibly take a
pro-choice stand on abortion, and they urged public officials to
fight the right to an abortion.

   Barbara Bush said Tuesday she is keeping
silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy
``whichever way I go,'' and detract from her work on illiteracy,
the homeless, hunger and AIDS.
   ``I think that should be left to the people who are courageous
enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do
something about it,'' she told three reporters at a White House
reception for disabled award winners.
   Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections _ notably
the governor's races Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia _ she said
that she is not a ``single-issue'' person and indicated voters
should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter.
   ``I think people ought to be thinking about fiscal
responsibility and past records and ... looking at the man as a
whole or the woman as a whole,'' she said. ``I'm not a single issue
man or woman,'' she said.
   President Bush told a news conference Tuesday that he believes
Americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion. He recently
vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be
spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest.
   Asked why she will not give her own position on abortion, which
has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the
Supreme Court's July decision giving states greater leeway to
restrict it, Mrs. Bush said: ``It does nothing but cause
controversy whichever way I go. I want people to be interested in
my projects,'' such as working for literacy and the homeless.
   Mrs. Bush announced in February that she would not speak out on
controversial policy issues, after she told a reporter that she
favored a ban on semi-automatic weapons, putting her in conflict
with her husband's public position.
   The first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to
teen-age women, and says, ``We need a lot of education, to tell
these girls that there are opportunities out there for them, that
the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies. It's very
old fashioned, I know.''
   After the Supreme Court in July gave states expanded powers to
restrict abortion, Bush lauded the ruling and Mrs. Bush said only,
``I go with my president.''
   Mrs. Bush also said that she would like to go to the
Mediterranean superpower summit next month if Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, also goes.
   She said it had not been decided if she would go, but that ``I'm
one who loves to travel.''
   On another issue, Mrs. Bush said her eyes are still irritated
from the thyroid condition she suffers known as Graves Disease.
   She said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the
ailment, prednisone, has made her gain back some of the weight she
lost earlier in the year.
   ``I'm fighting a small problem, weight,'' she conceded, adding
that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape.
   Then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at
an event designed to honor people who have overcome major
disabilities.
   ``Of all the places in America to complain about taking
prednisone, this is not the party to complain about it,'' she said
as she stood among several wheelchair-bound award recipients.
   The 1989 Victory Awards were bestowed by the National
Rehabilitation Hospital to people who overcame physical obstacles
while making contributions to society.
   Among the award recipients were one chosen by the governor of
each state, and several selected by the National Rehabilitation
Hospital, a private 160-bed institution in Washington.
   This year's recipients included: country singer Barbara
Mandrell, who suffered a near fatal car accident in 1984; Latin
singer Julio Iglesias who recovered from spinal-chord paralysis
after a car accident at age 20; Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who
lost his right arm during World War II; Joni Eareckson Tada, an
internationally recognized artist who is paralyzed from the
shoulders down from a diving accident and draws with a pencil held
in her teeth; Skip Wilkins, a wheelchair-bound athlete who works as
a counselor to troubled teen-agers and and Bill Demby, a disabled
track and field athlete and professional counselor who lost both
legs in the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Force of Inspectors Called Inadequate to Ensure Laws Being Obeyed</HEAD>

   Twenty-eight inspectors check the safety of
shipments of hazardous chemicals that cross the country by rail _
too few to ensure federal safety regulations are being obeyed, the
General Accounting Office told Congress Tuesday.
   ``It's like trying to stop an elephant with a fly swatter,''
Kenneth M. Mead, the GAO's chief transportation expert, told a House
subcommittee. ``You try to stop all these tank cars and there's
another 500,000 cars right behind them.''
   Mead said that there's no way the federal government can afford
to hire enough inspectors to look at all 1.1 million rail carloads
of hazardous chemicals which move each year but that ``a doubling of
this workforce would be reasonable.''
   ``There is simply too much of a workload on these people,'' he
said.
   The GAO, in a report to be issued next week, concluded the
Federal Railroad Administration hasn't done a good job of running
the government's hazardous materials inspection program.
   The agency is authorized to have 34 inspectors, but only 28 of
those positions are filled, and the people filling the slots have an
average age of 50, Mead told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
transportation and hazardous materials. That means ``we're going to
have some attrition soon,'' decreasing the pool of experienced
inspectors, he said.
   In addition, he said inspectors haven't been going after
high-risk shippers and railroads and haven't received adequate
guidance about their procedures because there's been no direction
from the top.
   Gilbert Carmichael, the new head of the railroad administration,
told the panel the GAO accurately described shortcomings and ``we'd
be wise to include'' the recommendations of the GAO's report in
discussions of ways to improve the way the FRA does its job.
   Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., called the
GAO's conclusions ``a truly frightening picture of the dangers to
which our citizenry is exposed on a daily basis.''
   Dingell blamed the problem on ``a long-slumbering bureaucracy
that grew cold and complacent during an eight-year dismantling of
federal safety activities.''
   ``The Reagan administration left its successors an unforgiveable
legacy of mismanagement and inefficiency, and then made sure ther
weren't enough resources to clean up the mess,'' Dingell said.
   The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
called the 4 billion tons a year of harzardous chemicals transported
in the U.S. a ``potential Bhopal on wheels,'' in a reference to the
fatal 1984 release of methylisocyanate that killed 3,403 people in
India.
   Luken has introduced a comprehensive bill dealing with the
movement of hazardous materials and increasing the number of federal
rail inspectors, with their salaries paid through first-ever federal
registration fees.

   The House approved a bill Tuesday that would
expand Everglades National Park in Florida by 110,000 acres to
protect it from encroaching commercial development.
   Established in 1947, the Everglades park preserves the
subtropical region at Florida's southern tip. Certain water quality
and flows must exist to maintain the park's extensive freshwater and
saltwater ecosystems.
   Increasing development in the region has affected the waterways
and hurt plant and animal populations. For example, the number of
wading birds has declined by 93 percent, naturalists say.
   The bill, which was passed on voice vote and sent to the Senate,
would allow the Interior Department to acquire lands and interest in
land through donation, purchase or exchange.
   The state of Florida has said it would donate 35,000 acres. Under
the bill, it must pay 20 percent of the cost of acquiring the
remaining 75,000, with the federal government spending 80 percent.
   The addition would amount to about 7.9 percent of the park's
current area, 1,398,937 acres.
   The measure would prohibit most use of airboats in the park, but
people who were using them on Jan. 1 could contiue to use them under
rules to be adopted by the Interior Department.
   The bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers to modify water
delivery to the park, based on the findings of an experimental
program authorized by Congress in 1984.
   The corps also would construct flood control and drainage works
in areas adversely affected by the modifications. Property owners
would be compensated if their crops or lands were damaged.
   In another provision of the measure, the Interior Department is
to submit to Congress a feasibility study for redesignating the Fort
Jefferson National Monument, in the Dry Tortuga Islands off Key
West, as a national park.
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill
wpould require spending of $79 million over the next five years.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard law professor urged senators Tuesday
to reject the nomination of President Bush's cousin as a federal
appeals judge, saying the appointment would violate the nation's
anti-nepotism law.
   ``He would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the
president's cousin,'' Alan M. Dershowitz told a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing on the nomination of John M. Walker.
   Walker, 48, is a District Court judge in New York.
   The committee is not expected to vote for several weeks on
whether to recommend confirmation by the full Senate to the U.S. 2nd
Circuit Court of Appeals. Such a delay is normal and the nomination
has not drawn opponents other than Dershowitz.
   Walker ``got this appointment because of family connections,''
Dershowitz said, alleging that it ``violates the anti-nepotism
statute both in language and in spirit.''
   The 1967 law bars naming relatives to government jobs. Dershowitz
said he believes it applies to the Walker nomination but told
reporters in a hallway afterward that there was room for
disagreement on that point.
   He said that even if the law does not apply to a judicial
nomination, Bush's nomination of Walker ``violates the spirit of the
law.''
   The elegantly dressed Walker, who bears a remote resemblance to
his cousin, sat a few feet away with an impassive expression most of
the time as Dershowitz described him as an ``average'' judge. Once
he shook his head impatiently during Dershowitz's testimony.
   Dershowitz alleged that Walker once held an improper conversation
with an attorney in a lawsuit stemming from the Claus Von Bulow
society murder trial.
   Walker denied the allegation.

<TEXT>
   A white man who said he shot a black
panhandler out of fear for his life was given a suspended jail
sentence after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor homicide charge.
   Clifford Smith, 40, was also placed on probation for two years in
the 1986 shooting death of Jimmy Jackson, 42. Smith fired when
Jackson approached a pickup driven by Smith at a red light in
Birmingham.
   Smith's 1987 trial ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked
10-2 in favor of convicting him of the same charge he pleaded guilty
to Monday in a plea bargain at Jefferson Couty Circuit Court.
   The sentence drew criticism Tuesday from attorney Henry L.
Penick, who is representing Jackson's brother in a $4 million
wrongful death suit against Smith. The civil lawsuit is pending.
   Penick said he was ``outraged and disturbed'' by what he
considered a ``very light sentence, certainly in comparison to the
nature of the crime.''
   ``It is precisely a Bernhard Goetz case,'' said Penick. ``In
fact, it is more heinous than that case in the sense there was no
allegation that Jimmy Jackson was trying to rob Mr. Smith. He was
merely asking for a quarter.
   Goetz, who shot four young black men on a New York subway in
December 1984, said he feared he was about to be robbed. He was
cleared of attempted murder and assault charges but was sentenced to
one year in jail and fined $500 for illegal gun possession.
   In the Birmingham case, Penick said the prosecution and sentence
would have been harsher if the unarmed victim had been white and the
gunman black.
   ``I know both the judge and the district attorney to be fair
persons, but I do not understand how they came to agree on this
particular sentence,'' he said.
   Bill Neumann, deputy district attorney, denied any racial
motivation behind the plea bargain with Smith. He said the
prosecution had problems finding witnesses, and noted that a 1987
jury deadlocked with 10 wanting to convict Smith of no more than
criminally negligent homicide. The other two jurors favored a more
serious manslaughter conviction.
   ``Based on the evidence we felt we could put on with the
witnesses we had, the age of the case and the jury voting the way
they did before,'' Neumann said, it seemed better to make the offer
to Smith.
   Smith contended he shot Jackson because he feared for his life.
He said Jackson had approached him previously and when Smith refused
to give him money, Jackson tried to take the keys from the ignition
of his vehicle.
   On the day he shot Jackson, Smith said Jackson approached him
yelling, ``I remember you! I remember you!'' Smith said he fired a
warning shot at the ground, then fired again when Jackson kept
advancing.
   Smith has been on non-paid leave from his job as a U.S. Postal
Service mechanic since the shooting. One of his attorneys said he
now will start the process of getting reinstated.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Smith said outside the courtroom.

   An explosion and fire ripped through a recreation
center in the resort town of Margate Tuesday, injuring 25 children
and two firemen.
   Divisional fire officer Kevin Simmonds said firemen were summoned
when a small blaze was discovered in a sauna-bath unit and there was
a blast as firefighters arrived.
   Traffic officer Peter Hall was credited with saving many lives.
   Police said he shepherded the children, aged 11-16, away from the
smoking sauna unit just before the explosion that sent a wall of
fire through the building.
   ``If he had not moved the children away there would almost
certainly have been fatalities,'' a police spokesman said.
   Most of the victims were treated at a hospital for minor burns
and injuries but one boy and a fireman were in serious condition and
were transferred to a burn unit, official said.
   A spokesman for the Thanet District Council in Margate, 70 miles
east of London, said an investigation was under way to determine the
cause of the explosion.

   Fourteen activist AIDS groups on Tuesday urged
an Illinois drug manufacturer to cut the price of a drug used to
prevent a form of pneumonia that is the biggest killer of people
with AIDS.
   The coalition, in a letter to Lyphomed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill.,
said the price of about $100 for a monthly dose of aerosolized
pentamidine is too expensive for many people with AIDS or infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
   The groups said that while recognizing that pricing is based on
more than just the research and development costs of a particular
drug, ``the ultimate price must also be within reason and should not
deny access to thousands.''
   They noted that ``unreasonably high prices borne by the federal
government for these therapies through Medicaid and other federal
programs may spur calls for broader regulation of drug prices.''
   The groups asked for a meeting with Lyphomed officials to discuss
pricing of aerosolized pentamidine, which the company markets as
NebuPent.
   Lyphomed officials were out of the office Tuesday afternoon and
could not be reached for comment.
   The aerosol version of pentamidine was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration in June. Federal health officials recommended
aggressive use of the therapy that protects people infected with
AIDS from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills more than 60
percent of people with AIDS.
   A similar coalition of AIDS activists had earlier pressed for a
price cut by Burroughs Welcome Co., which makes AZT, the only
government-approved drug that attacks the AIDS virus.
   In September, Burroughs Wellcome announced a 20 percent reduction
in the wholesale price of AZT, cutting the cost of an annual course
of treatment from about $8,000 to about $6,500.
   Among the groups signing the letter were AIDS Action Council,
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, American Foundation for AIDS
Research, American Association of Physicians for Human Rights,
People with AIDS Health Group, the Human Rights Campaign Fund and
Gay Men's Health Crisis.
   The letter was also sent to top federal health officials and
members of Congress.

   The United States and Soviet Union will
begin exchanging information about their chemical-weapon arsenals
next month and likely will conduct trial inspections in May, a U.S.
official said Tuesday.
   The exchange of data and inspections are initial steps toward a
treaty to sharply reduce and possibly eliminate the weapons.
   President Bush and Soviet Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze called
for production bans in recent speeches to the U.N. General Assembly.
   The U.S. official, attending an arms control seminar at Wye
Plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, estimated U.S.
stockpiles at about 30,000 tons.
   The official, who spoke to reporters under rules that barred
identifying him, said the Soviet's claim of possessing 50,000 tons
of poison gas was widely understated.
   He said their arsenal could be five or six times as big.
   The superpowers, apparently working without major disagreements,
hope they can reach an accord that will prompt 40 nations meeting in
Geneva to adopt a worldwide ban.
   Another 27 countries are attending the Geneva talks as observers.
Those countries include Iran, Syria, Libya and several others
suspected of having chemical weapons programs.
   The U.S. official estimated 20 to 25 nations have mastered the
technology to produce chemical weapons and that about half actually
possess them.
   Only the United States and the Soviet Union have acknowleged
chemical weapons stockpiles.
   However, U.S. official have said that Iran and Iraq both used
poison gas in their Persian Gulf war. Libya was accused of nearing
production at a plant near Tripoli.
   The U.S. official said the Soviets have proposed exchanging
information Dec. 20 in Washington and Moscow, while the United
States suggested Dec. 14 in Geneva.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, proposed a single inspection in May of
either a production or storage facility. The United States suggested
an inspection of both types of facilities, the U.S. official said.
   The inspections, which the Soviets call ``visitations,'' would be
conducted by monitors from the other country.
   On another point, the Soviets have proposed drawing up a list of
60 countries whose approval of a treaty would trigger the complete
elimination of all U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons, the official
said.
   The United States, seeking a more air-tight arrangement, wants
all countries in Geneva to approve a ban. Until they do, Bush said
in his U.N. speech, the United States would retain 2 percent of its
chemical weapons, all of them the modern binary type still in
production.
   Despite these differences, ``we find the Soviet and U.S.
positions, very close,'' the official said in an optimistic account
of ongoing negotiations in Geneva.

<TEXT>
   Fishermen have rescued 35 survivors of
a typhoon that ravaged the Gulf of Thailand and about 70 bodies have
been recovered, including seven from a capsized U.S.-owned ship,
reports said Tuesday.
   The Thai navy said its ships would take aboard the survivors
found by fishing boats but it did not know if any of the victims
were from the Seacrest oil-drilling ship. The Seacrest, operated by
Unocal of Los Angeles, had 97 crewmen aboard when it capsized
Saturday as Typhoon Gay roared across the gulf.
   Unocal reported that six crewmen were rescued and the bodies of
seven have been recovered from the accident about 270 miles south of
Bangkok.
   Navy and local officials reported 400 Thai fishermen are still
missing along with 84 Seacrest crewmen.
   The navy said the storm sank at least 63 fishing boats.
   Navy spokesman Capt. Suravut Maharom reported warships recovered
17 bodies from the gulf, east of Songkhla, since beginning the
search Monday and 30 bodies were found washed ashore on a Chumphon
province island.
   Carol Scott of Unocal in Bangkok said search teams aboard company
helicopters found 16 bodies and they were recovered by Unocal boats
Tuesday.
   She said she did not know if any of the 16 were from the Seacrest.
   Navy divers on Monday removed a seventh body from the 5,373-ton
oil- and gas-drilling ship, which was upside-down in the water.
   A Unocal news release said, ``We have no plans to give up the
search effort.''
   The Interior Ministry said 31 people on land were killed by the
typhoon but the governor of Chumphon placed the death toll in his
province alone at 71.
   Unocal identified six of the Seacrest crewmen who perished and
whose bodies were recovered as Ed Seliger, the West German captain
of the vessel; Delvin Irby, a drill worker from Mississippi; Kent
Nolen, an assistant driller from the United States; Andrew Charles,
a British field engineer, and Thai crewmen Anan Charoensuksomboon
and Munard Moowangohareen. Hometowns were not given.
   Unocal's local subsidiary said four of the bodies were found in
the ship's wheehouse and the other two in the water.
   Most of the Seacrest's crew crew were Thais but there also were
seven Americans aboard. No American is known to have survived.
   Chalit Duangpakdee, one of the Thai survivors, told the Bangkok
Post, ``All I remember is the sound of swirling wind, the darkness,
the rain, the waves. And every now and then, the screams for help.''
   The kitchen worker said when an alarm sounded to abandon ship he
grabbed a life jacket, jumped into the sea with many other crew
members and managed to secure himself with rope inside a life raft.
   He said after several hours he was picked up by a fishing boat.
   Unocal reported survivors said all of the crew abandoned ship
except the captain and three men who remained in the wheelhouse.
   The Seacrest capsized in the Platong field, one of several being
explored for natural gas by Unocal.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Funds Approved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a $3.4 billion
program for the Coast Guard in fiscal 1990, including provisions
designed to crack down on alcohol abuse among merchant seamen.
   The bill, approved 383-3 and sent to the Senate, contains several
provisions that address the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska last
spring.
   The House was to vote Wednesday on another bill expedited by the
Exxon accident _ oil spill liability.
   The Coast Guard measure would require the agency to review the
criminal records of applicants for new or renewed licenses,
registrations and other needed documents. If there's enough evidence
of alcohol abuse, the agency could withhold papers until the problem
is corrected.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, dumping 11 million gallons
of crude oil into Prince William Sound. Investigators were told that
the tanker captain had been drinking and wasn't on the bridge when
the accident occurred.
   By voice vote, the House added a requirement that the Coast Guard
conduct random drug tests of its employees.
   The bill calls for new research and development of techniques for
cleaning up oil spills. It also authorizes the Coast Guard to spend
$24 million for advanced aircraft radar to detect drug smugglers and
develop new procedures for seizing vessels on which drugs are
detected.
   Much Coast Guard activity involves policing recreational boaters,
but some need more policing than others.
   The bill requires the agency to identify how much it's spending
to provide security for President Bush's fishing and boating
activities at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The oil spill liability coming up Wednesday sets limits on the
amount an oil company or oil carrier would have to pay if a spill
occurs.
   Heated floor debate is expected over an amendment proposed by
Reps. George Miller, D-Calif., and Gerry Studds, D-Mass., that would
allow states to set stricter liability laws than the federal
statute. As written, the bill would require a single law, the
federal one.

<HEAD>Geologist Says National Detection System Would Provide Early Quake
Warning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A national early warning system for
earthquakes could provide emergency planners with crucial extra
seconds in a disaster, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey said Tuesday.
   The federal agency has proposed a national network of 150
interconnected seismometers to detect ground motion and relay
immediate information about earthquakes, including predictions of
when and where the most shaking will occur.
   The network would issue bulletins telling emergency planners how
many seconds they had before shock waves from the quake would reach
them. Those seconds could be enough to turn off power systems, issue
public warnings and make emergency response plans before
communications are cut off, said Thomas Heaton of the geological
survey's office in asadena, Calif.
   The bulletins would help planners know where emergency services
would be needed most and provide an estimate of what kind of damage
the quake would cause.
   The network also would estimate the probability that an
earthquake is a foreshock and would be followed by another, bigger
quake, Heaton said in a briefing for science writers at Cornell
University.
   Heaton said early warning systems are used in Japan to predict
tidal waves after an earthquake and to turn off gas and
transportation systems when a quake occurs. One system shuts down
Japan's high-speed ``bullet train'' to prevent an accident if the
train's tracks were bent in an earthquake.
   Although there are 1,600 seismograph stations in the United
States, they are intended to locate earthquakes _ even very small
ones _ and not to provide information about them. The existing
system records only the up and down motion of the earth, not its
side-to-side shaking, and can measure only a limited range of shock
waves, Heaton said. Major quakes, like last month's California
quake, are off the scale.
   The existing system is also very slow, Heaton said. The
information it provides is typically one or two days behind, and in
a large sequence of shocks that delay could become as long as
several months.
   Heaton said a detection system would not have reduced deaths in
the California earthquake but might have been able to reduce some
injuries by giving people enough warning to get out of the way of
falling objects.
   ``We need to use whatever creative strategies there are to
minimize the risk,'' he said.
   After the California earthquake, three seismometers were
installed to measure aftershocks from the quake. The seismometers
sent about a 20-second warning of aftershocks to emergency workers
who were digging through rubble.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has agreed to fund 60 of the
centers recommended by the geological survey in the eastern and
central part of the United States, at a cost of about $5 million. No
funding has yet been found for the remaining centers, Heaton said.
   ``Many people have the impression that whatever can be done is
being done,'' Heaton said. ``That is far from the true situation.''
   Heaton's talk was part of a four-day briefing at Cornell
University sponsored by the Council for the Advancement of Science
Writing.

   Soldiers killed a 13-year-old Palestinian during
a violent protest in the West Bank on Tuesday, and a police
commander recommended dismissal of six policemen involved in the
fatal shooting of another youth.
   Also Tuesday, the army announced it had broken up a ring of
Moslem fundamentalists believed responsible for the slayings of two
Israeli soldiers.
   A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities
was found stabbed to death in the West Bank city of Nablus. Another
Palestinian died in apparent infighting between militant groups in
the West Bank.
   An army communique meanwhile reported an air raid Tuesday on
targets of the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah in Mazraat
Ayn Busiwar, 14 miles inside Lebanon. ``All targets were hit and our
planes returned safely,'' it said.
   Reporters in Nabatiyeh, Lebanon, said at least two Israeli
helicopter gunships were involved.
   The communique said nothing of casualties or damage. In
southeastern Lebanon, a police spokesman said no casualty count was
available.
   Israel gave no reason for the raid, but military officials have
accused Hezbollah guerrillas of trying to infiltrate Israel and of
taking part in attacks in the border area.
   The 13-year-old boy was killed by a rubber bullet after
paramilitary Border Police fired in Qalqilya to stop rioting, the
army said.
   Residents identified him as Mowaeya Haj Hassan and said at least
three other Palestinians were wounded.
   Witnesses said trouble began when hundreds of Qalqilya residents,
many of them children, tried to march to the home of Hassan's
cousin, who was shot and killed by soldiers a day earlier while
trying to escape to Jordan.
   The army said 10 Qalqilya youths were arrested and that some wore
masks.
   At a nearby army base, an Israeli soldier was fatally wounded
when a fellow trooper's pistol accidentally discharged, an army
spokesman said. He said the accident occurred as soldiers of the
Golani infantry brigade were examining their weapons prior to a
patrol in the West Bank.
   At least 612 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since the
uprising against occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began 23
months ago. In addition, 142 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Palestinians, most for allegedly collaborating with Israeli
authorities. Forty Israelis have died.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the national police
commissioner, David Kraus, was reviewing a recommendation that six
police officers be fired in connection with the death of an
18-year-old Palestinian last month.
   An inquiry was launched after Israeli newspapers quoted Arab
witnesses as saying Karim Daamseh of Bethlehem was fatally shot Oct.
26 and did not die during a car chase, as the police claimed.
   The officers' commander recommended a criminal investigation,
Israel radio reported. It said preliminary findings indicated the
policemen allegedly fabricated evidence and gave false testimony.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army said security forces uncovered a ring
of Moslem extremists connected with the fundamentalist Hamas
organization and arrested several. It said three Hamas members
believed involved in the abduction and slayings of two Israeli
officers were not caught.
   The body of one of the missing soldiers, 18-year-old Ilan Saadon,
was never found, but an army statement said that during
interrogation, the detainees' yielded concrete evidence he was dead.
Saadon was last seen May 3 hitchhiking.
   The suspects are also believed involved in the Feb. 16 kidnapping
and slaying of 21-year-old soldier Avi Sassportas, who disappeared
while hitchhiking home. His body was found May 7 in a grove near the
Gaza Strip.
   In Nablus, the body of 28-year-old Nabil Samhan was discovered.
He had been stabbed, and Arab reporters said he was suspected of
collaborating with Israeli officials.
   A 24-year-old Palestinian identified as Hamed Mahmoud Abdullah
was attacked by masked Arabs in the village of Safa near the West
Bank town of Ramallah.
   The national Itim news agency said the killing appeared to be the
result of a dispute between Palestinian factions.

   An 18-year-old man climbed a transformer
tower and burst into flames, leaving him in critical condition
Tuesday.
   Rob Colyer of Lake Grove suffered burns over 50 percent of his
body, said Pam Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Emanuel Hospital &amp;
Health Center.
   The accident Monday evening briefly knocked out power in the area.
   Colyer was among a group of 15 teen-agers who gathered near the
Portland General Electric Co. transformer station, said Mick Brady,
battalion chief at the Lake Oswego Fire Department.
   Brady said the youth suddenly ran toward the station, scaled the
fence surrounding it and climbed up the 30-foot tower.
   Hilary Demary said she was driving through a nearby intersection
when she heard an explosion and saw sparks at the top of the tower.
   She said the lights went out and she heard another explosion,
followed by a burst of flames, which she realized was a person on
fire.
   The man fell to the ground in flames, Demary said.
   Fire officials said there were no indications of what prompted
Colyer to climb the tower.

<HEAD>UN Sending 625-Member Border Patrol Force to Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday
to deploy a 625-member Central American peacekeeping force, whose
main job will be to keep Contra rebels in Honduras from infiltrating
Nicaragua.
   Another mission for the peacekeepers is to interdict shipments of
Nicaraguan and Cuban weapons the U.S. State Department says are
being made to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Because U.N. peacekeepers are not sent to combat areas, approval
of the border patrol operation is expected to increase pressure on
Nicaragua to restore its cease-fire with the U.S.-backed rebels,
which President Daniel Ortega ended last week.
   The unit will be the first U.N. peacekeeping force deployed in
the Western Hemisphere, although a two-man observer group was
stationed in the Dominican Republic during factional warfare in
1965-66.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said it was ``a complex
and ground-breaking operation, which is being set in motion in a
region characterized in recent years by its volatility.''
   He said he would deploy the peacekeepers cautiously, in stages.
The 15-member council gave the operation a six-month mandate that
can be renewed.
   Before the vote, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the
council: ``My government supports the establishment of an effective
and comprehensive United Nations observer force in Central America.''
   Approval was delayed for several weeks by U.S. reservations.
Pickering said Washington questioned whether the force was large
enough and was concerned about the cost, $41 million for the first
six months.
   Canada, West Germany and Spain will provide most of the soldiers,
pilots, and staff for the operation, to be called U.N. Observer
Group-Central America. Colombia and Venezuela have agreed in
principle to provide troops to a Latin American contingent of the
force.
   On Thursday and Friday, delegations of the Contras and
Nicaragua's Sandinista government are to meet at U.N. headquarters,
with Honduras attending as an observer.
   Nicaragua requested the talks when Ortega called off the
cease-fire after 19 months, accusing the Contras of killing dozens
of Nicaraguans in attacks aimed at undermining national elections
set for Feb. 25. The Contras deny making attacks.
   A senior U.N. official said privately all issues would be on the
table, including the voluntary disbanding of the Contras, security
guarantees for rebels returning home and political reform in
Nicaragua.
   The Central American peacekeeping force will have jeeps,
helicopters and speedboats. Its jobs are to prevent any nation from
attacking a neighbor, verify that no rebel raiders cross borders and
halt any broadcasts by insurgents.
   It will will have 260 military observers, 115 crew members for
helicopters and an airplane, 50 members of a naval unit operating
speedboats and patrol boats, 14 medical personnel, about 104 U.N.
administrators and 82 civilians recruited locally.
   Headquarters will be in Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras. The
force will have liaison offices in the other Central American
capitals and 31 ``verification centers'' manned by mobile observers.

   A guerrilla group said its
members mistakenly killed a self-employed tiler, thinking he was a
member of Northern Ireland's security forces.
   The outlawed Irish People's Liberation Organization issued a
statement after police said the victim, Robert Burns, 49, had no
connection with the army or police.
   Burns was fatally wounded by assailants who fired through the
front door of his house in Derriaghy.
   The Irish People's Liberation Organization is a breakaway group
from the Irish Republican Army, also outlawed in both Britain and
Ireland. Both are fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a British
province where Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics 3-2, with the
predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   In another development, police ordered an urgent review of
security for Northern Ireland's senior police officers after an IRA
bombing Monday of the home of a chief in the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   Assistant Chief Constable David Mellor, 52, had just left the
living room when the bomb exploded under a bullet-proof window
inches behind the armchair where he had been reading. Mellor's wife
and two young daughters were nearby but were not injured.
   The IRA said its guerrillas placed a 3-pound bomb at the window.
   It issued a statement saying, ``We deliberately placed a small
charge only because we were aware of the young children in the
house. Otherwise we could undoubtedly have guaranteed Mellor's death
with a larger charge.''
   Police are concerned that the guerrillas were able to breach
Mellor's security arrangements that included a full alarm system
with special lights.
   Eight Royal Ulster Constabular officers, including a chief
superintendent and two superintendents, have been killed by the IRA
this year.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke said Tuesday there was no
change in the government's policy toward terrorists but stood by his
remarks last week when he said it was ``difficult to envisage'' a
military defeat of the IRA. He had suggested the government might
hold talks with the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, if the
organization ended its terror campaiagn.

   Industrial nations, which produce
two-thirds of the gas emissions associated with global warming, were
still divided at the end of a conference Tuesday on how to reduce
them.
   At the two-day conference of 68 nations on ways to slow or halt
dangerous climatic changes, the United States, Japan and Soviet
Union refused to commit themselves to stabilizing emissions of
carbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000.
   Environmentalists said the reservations to the final declaration
were a setback to efforts against the ``greenhouse effect,'' the
gradual warming of Earth's atmosphere.
   ``Less than six months ago in Paris, President Bush talked of the
urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Now, the White House
has sabotaged the first international effort to make good on the
president's words,'' said Brooks Yeager of the National Audubon
Society, a U.S. environmental group.
   The meeting's final declaration said: ``In the view of many
industrialized nations, such stabilization of carbon dioxide
emissions should be achieved as a first step at the latest by the
year 2000.''
   It said a ``stable development of the world economy'' remained
essential and urged industrial nations to study ``the feasibility of
achieving targets to ... reduce carbon dioxide emission levels by
the year 2005.''
   William K. Reilly, chief administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, told reporters the United States ``is not one of
the countries that has agreed to go so far. ... While stabilization
is necessary, we must closely analyze the means to achieve that.''
   Reilly said the proposed measures could only be implemented at
great cost. It is estimated that hundreds of billions of dollars
would be needed to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and
industrial plants around the world.
   In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying the
United States had agreed to a compromise declaration saying the
pollutants should be stabilized ``as soon as possible.''
   Administration sources said U.S. negotiators felt they could
accept that wording because it did not tie any nation to specific
levels of pollution reduction or require levels to be stabilized by
a specific year.
   One U.S. official, speaking privately, said the revised
declaration noted only that, ``in the view of many industrialized
nations'' but not necessarily all, carbon dioxide emissions should
be stabilized by 2000.
   Stephen Hart, deputy presidential press secretary, said: ``We're
not willing to agree to a set time. We did not sign on to anything
mentioning the year 2000.''
   Several developing nations, including India and China, voiced
reservations at the conference.
   The Netherlands, West Germany and the Scandinavian countries had
teamed with Canada in an unsuccessful effort to get unanimous
approval of such a commitment.
   The Dutch sponsors of the conference and others also pushed to
set a level at which the emissions of ozone-threatening gases would
be frozen by the end of the century.
   Klaus Toepfer, the West German environment minister, took a less
bleak view.
   ``Reilly and the others will take the message home that more is
expected of them,'' Toepfer told reporters. ``That means we'll have
a better starting point for the next conferences.''
   The U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is
to meet in Washington in February and the second World Climate
Conference is to be held in late 1990.
   Reilly said the United States is ``enthusiastically supporting,''
those meetings and did not want to ``excessively influence'' them by
committing itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at
the Noordwijk conference.
   Those emissions, along with those of chlorofluorocarbons, methane
and nitrous oxides, are believed to be the major cause of the rise
in atmospheric temperatures.
   About 65 percent of the emissions originate from industrialized
nations in the northern hemisphere, according to a recent report by
the Worldwatch Institute in Washington.
   The Dutch Environment Ministry said the United States produces
23.7-percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.
   Scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turn
subtropical zones into deserts and coastal nations could face
massive inundations.

<TEXT>
   Women are running for the first time in
parliamentary elections Wednesday, which are the first in 22 years
and will formalize the Arab kingdom's separation from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   The three-week campaign was among the freest in the Arab world,
conducted by nearly 650 candidates embracing Islamic
fundamentalists, tribal sheiks, Communists, businessmen, former
intelligence agents and former political prisoners.
   Only a few rallies were held Tuesday, but thousands of banners
still fluttered and newspapers were crammed with appeals to the
877,000 voters. The daily Al Dustour alone carried 222 political ads
in its 30 pages.
   A Interior Ministry official said Tuesday night that 649
candidates were registered. Jordanian television put the figure at
648.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, whose platform includes a
more Islamic government and destruction of Israel, attracted the
largest crowds to rallies for its 26 Parliament candidates.
   Political analysts said it might win 12 to 20 of the 80 seats,
but predictions were being made in a void because of the long period
without elections, a lack of opinion polls and numerous candidates
in each race.
   Despite martial law and a 33-year-old ban on political parties,
King Hussein's government allowed political groups to run slates
openly for the first time since 1956. They held rallies and debates
that attracted thousands of Jordanians.
   ``I think this is the most important election Jordan has ever
experienced,'' said former Foreign Minister Taher Masri, who
resigned as deputy prime minister to run for Parliament in Amman,
the capital.
   The unusually free election follows two major events: Jordan's
worst economic crisis in decades, which led to riots in April, and
Hussein's rununciation of claims to the West Bank in July 1988 in
favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Jordan is leaving the West Bank out of national elections for the
first time since 1950, and that will help formalize the division.
Israel captured the West Bank in the June war of 1967, two months
after the last election.
   Loss of the territory, which held half the 60 seats in the old
parliament, made national elections impossible. Hussein suspended
the legislature in 1974, then revived it a decade later.
   Because women were given the right to vote only in 1974, this is
the first general election in which they can participate. Twelve are
running for Parliament.
   The last parliament was largely passive in recent years, but
earlier legislatures have been so independent that kings often have
suspended them.
   Parliament must approve all laws, has the power to override a
royal veto and can dismiss cabinets. With no organized governing
party, the government must forge alliances to get its proposals
through.
   ``It will be a more important parliament than before,'' said
Masri, the former foreign minister.
   Kamel Abu Jaber, a political scientist, noted that Jordan had
changed dramatically since the last election. Only one Jordanian in
20 went beyond high school in 1967, but the rate today is greater
than one in three, he said.

<HEAD>Church of England Synod Supports Principle of Women Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England's General Synod voted in
favor of the principle of women priests on Tuesday, the first step
toward possible ordination of women by the state church.
   Members of the General Synod passed by a simple majority the
first clause of a proposed amendment to canon law to permit
ordination of women.
   It reads: ``It shall be lawful for the General Synod to make
provision by canon for enabling a woman to be ordained to the office
of priest if she otherwise satisfies the requirements of Canon Law
as to the persons who may be ordained as priests.
   ``Nothing in this measure shall make it lawful for a woman to be
consecrated to the office of bishop.''
   The change came on the first day of a two-day debate and was
supported by all three branches of the synod, the church's
parliament. The bishops voted 30-17 in favor, the clergy 149-85 in
favor and the lay members 144-78 in favor.
   ``It went better than we thought,'' said Margaret Orr Deas,
executive secretary of the Movement for the Ordination of Women.
``We are very pleased.''
   The issue now goes to the 43 dioceses for discussion by ordinary
members of the church. This is expected to start next year.
   The question will probably not return to the General Synod for a
final vote until 1992, when a two-thirds majority will be required.
   The General Synod threw out two controversial amendments _ one to
create a separate church allowing only male priests; the other to
allow a parish within a diocese that ordained women to transfer to a
diocese which did not.
   About 1,200 women have been ordained in Anglican churches, mainly
in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It has been a major
point of contention between Anglicans and Roman Catholics in their
ecumenical encounters.
   The Church of England has debated the issue for two decades. Some
opponents among the clergy and laity say they will break away if
women are ordained.
   At the start of debate, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie
said he would vote to allow discussions on the ordination of women
to proceed in the dioceses, despite remaining undecided on the basic
principle of women priests.
   ``I judge that the dioceses may surprise us by what they bring
forward,'' he said.
   Explaining his dilemma, Runcie said on one hand he believed
theological arguments could justify ordaining women. On the other,
he said, women priests would have a detrimental effect on church
unity, as both he and Pope John Paul II said during his visit to
Rome in September.
   ``I cannot deny the serious obstacle which this move has created
there,'' he said.
   The bishop of Durham, the Right Rev. David Jenkins, drew loud
applause when he said, ``Ordination of women to the priesthood is
not the end of the world. If the Church of England's making a
mistake were the end of the world, the world would have ended long
ago.''
   The bishop of Portsmouth, the Rt. Rev. Timothy Bavin, said he
would have to consider resigning if the legislation was finally
passed, despite being a supporter of women priests.
   He said he did not want to have to choose between favoring
opponents or supporters among his congregations.
   Canon Frances Briscoe, one of 500 women deacons anxious to become
priests, told the Synod: ``The vast majority are not a regiment of
strident feminists but are dedicated women who quietly and
efficiently get on with the job within the confines of the present
strictures.''

<TEXT>
   A member of the Medellin drug cartel extradited
last month from Colombia was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison
and fined $25,000 for his 5-year-old drug conviction.
   Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, 44, fled to his homeland after his 1983
indictment, forfeiting a $200,000 bond. He was convicted in absentia
in Detroit in 1984 of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 660 pounds of cocaine.
   Defense attorney Richard Lustig said he wasn't surprised Pelaez
received the maximum federal penalty, but contended his client's
rights were ignored.
   ``Pawns like Bernardo are being given to the public because of
the hysteria over drugs,'' Lustig said.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Lustig asked that Pelaez be returned to
Colombia because of improper extradition procedures, and that the
time he has served in prison since his 1983 indictment be credited
to his sentence.
   ``The defense motion for credit for time served is premature,''
U.S. District Judge Ralph M. Freeman said, adding that such a motion
must go to the Justice Department and not to the sentencing court.
   In 1987, the Colombian Supreme Court ruled that Pelaez couldn't
be extradited to the United States because the charges against him
predated an extradition agreement between the two countries. Pelaez
had been incarcerated for 22 months in Colombia pending that ruling.
   But Pelaez was extradited under presidential orders, independent
of Colombian courts, Lustig said.
   President Virgilio Barco revived extraditions to the United
States as part of the emergency measures against drug traffickers
imposed Aug. 18, after the assassination of a presidential candidate
who was an outspoken foe of the drug trade.
   Six people have since been extradited; Pelaez is the only one
tried and convicted, according to the U.S. Justice Department.
   Freeman said he will rule Nov. 22 on the extradition question.
   The government portrayed Pelaez as a major money launderer for
the Medellin cartel, which is believed to supply 80 percent of the
cocaine sold in the United States.
   Testimony in the 1984 trial revealed Pelaez was responsible for
shipments of cocaine valued at $6 million in 1981 and 1982. But
Lustig maintained his client was merely a courier.
   ``He did something wrong and admitted to it,'' Lustig said. ``But
if I might use the term, he was a flunky.''
   Lustig said he will appeal the conviction and Pelaez's
extradition.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday imposed a curfew in
two departments and placed four Lima provinces under
state-of-emergency rule to combat the campaign by leftist guerrillas
to disrupt Sunday's elections.
   The state of emergency decree published Tuesday also extends for
30 days emergency rule in five other provinces in the department of
Lima.
   All 11 provinces in Lima department are now under emergency
decrees, which suspend civil rights and give police powers to the
military to maintain order. Lima and the port of Callao, each a
separate province, were placed under a a 30-day state of emergency
on Oct. 24.
   In Peru, a department is the largest political subdivision _
similar to a state _ and is made up of provinces.
   More than 330 people have been killed in October in attacks
related to efforts by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement
to disrupt the municipal elections. Lima newspapers are calling the
month ``Red October.''
   In Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, Shining Path rebels
entered a radio studio Tuesday and forced an announcer to read a
statement warning people not to vote, police said.
   Night curfews were ordered in Junin and Pasco departments. They
are mining and agricultural regions in the Andes east of Lima.
   Guerrillas exploded bombs early Tuesday at two banks, a mining
company office and a police barracks in La Oroya, 95 miles east of
Lima, officials reported. They said four policemen were wounded in
the attack on the barracks.
   About one-third of Peru and more than half of the nation's 21
million people are now under emergency rule.
   The government has used state of emergency decrees in an effort
to combat terrorism since 1982. Among the provisions of the decrees
are the suspension of habeas corpus and free movement and assembly
rights and guarantees against search and seizure.
   More than 15,000 people have been killed in guerrilla-related
violence since the Shining Path began its terrorist campaign in
1980, according to the government.

   Financially ailing Braniff Inc. dismissed
many of its 1,800 remaining employees and stranded some passengers
Tuesday, after the airline abruptly canceled its last 46 round-trip
flights.
   A severe cash shortage short-circuited the company's
reorganization plan and forced it to halt passenger service as of
midnight Monday, said Chairman William G. McGee after an emergency
meeting of the board of directors.
   Braniff, which sought protection from creditors Sept. 28 while it
developed a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, is looking for a buyer, officials said.
   Many of its remaining employees were being dismissed Tuesday,
said spokeswoman Sandy Smith.
   ``The situation is confusing, to say the least,'' Ms. Smith said.
``Most people, I assume, are losing their jobs right away ... I'm
not getting a lot of information from our executives.''
   McGee said in his announcement that employees would be notified
of their status individually.
   Before its filing, Braniff operated 256 round-trip flights and
had employed as many as 4,800 people.
   Tom Volz, senior vice president of marketing, said discussions
were under way with potential investors.
   The immediate objective is ``to attempt to continue
reorganization under the Chapter 11 code as a viable charter
entity,'' he said. ``There are no plans at this point to give
consideration to liquidation.''
   However, Edward Starkman, an airline analyst with PaineWebber in
New York, said he doubted a buyer would be found for the entire
airline and that Braniff would probably be liquidated.
   ``I don't think you're really buying much if you bought the whole
thing,'' he said. ``Some assets would be of interest.''
   The cancellations surprised and angered pilots and other
employees and left a few customers frustrated in Orlando, Fla.,
Kansas City, Mo., Dallas, Los Angeles and other major airports.
   ``We're all in shock,'' said Jim Hamilton, a Braniff pilot based
in Dallas. ``I didn't expect something like this to happen. We were
hoping that someone would buy Braniff and want to run it, but maybe
there was nothing left to buy.''
   Passengers calling to check about flights were advised to try
other airlines ``who may honor tickets in some cases.'' Braniff
ticketing and check-in counters were unstaffed.
   Passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers.
Eastern Airlines was taking Braniff customers on a standby basis.
United was giving Braniff ticketholders a 50 percent discount on a
full-fare coach ticket.
   There were no long lines of passengers, as there were in
September when Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``I think the word was out and people were booking elsewhere,''
said Dave Napoli, assistant general manager at the Kansas City
airport.
   The carrier had been operating from week to week, relying on
emergency infusions of cash approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Orlando. In its filing, Braniff listed debt of $347 million and
assets of $326 million.
   Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 nearly $1 billion
in debt. It started flying again in 1984 as a low-cost, no-frills
carrier. The company was acquired by BIA Acquisitions, an investor
group formed by PaineWebber Inc., in June 1988, and shifted most of
its flight operations to Kansas City from Dallas.
   It moved its corporate headquarters from Dallas to Orlando early
this year and had ambitious expansion plans, but it kept getting
deeper into debt.

<HEAD>Synagogue Relic Discovered in Restoration Efforts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restoration workers have discovered an important
relic of Berlin's once-magnificent main synagogue, East Germany's
ADN news agency said Tuesday.
   ADN said workers restoring the synagogue in East Berlin uncovered
the house of worship's ``Eternal Lamp,'' or Ner Tamid, as they were
removing a concrete ceiling.
   The synagogue was damaged by fire during the 1938 Nazi Crystal
Night pogrom against the Jews and later suffered heavy damage during
Allied bombing raids.
   Hermann Simon, director of a foundation established to restore
the building, said the lamp was a ``sensational find.''
   ADN said the silver lamp was donated by a Jewish family in 1866
and had likely hanged in a prominent place in the synagogue.
   The synagogue was once one of the largest in Europe. The ruins
have stood unattended since the end of World War II.
   Restoration efforts began in late 1988. When completed, the
building is to become an international center for Jewish culture and
tradition.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Tuesday it won't
show a House subcommittee a legal opinion broadening FBI arrest
powers overseas because Congress is no more entitled to see it than
the public.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the opinion
stating that FBI agents have legal authority to seize fugitives
overseas without permission of a foreign government is considered
private legal advice for the bureau that won't be made public.
   The opinion's author, Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr,
is scheduled to be questioned about it on Wednesday by members of
the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.
   Asked why the opinion, which is not classified, was being
withheld from members of the subcommittee, Runkel replied: ``Why
would we treat the committee any differently than the news media or
the general public?''
   ``Bill Barr will go up and talk about it and answer questions,
but it's in keeping with department policy not to make the opinion
public,'' Runkel said. ``It's our view that it's a confidential
legal opinion.''
   Runkel argued that the Justice Department is not privy to legal
opinions produced for Congress by House and Senate legal counsel.
   The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which Barr
heads, issued the June 21 opinion in response to a request for
advice from the FBI.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, expressed
incredulity over Runkel's statement his panel was not entitled to
see the document.
   ``Maybe that Department of Justice needs more experience, it
needs an education about how the government is supposed to work in a
free society,'' Edwards said. ``And our hearing tomorrow, I hope,
will guide them along that path.''
   Besides approving the Justice Department's budget, Edwards noted
that the Judiciary Committee by law is required to oversee its
operations.
   ``That's what we take the oath of office to do,'' Edwards said.
   Barr was summoned along with Associate Deputy FBI Director Oliver
B. Revell to answer questions about the opinion, which sparked
veiled criticism last month from Secretary of State James Baker III.
   Baker called it ``a very narrow legal opinion based on
consideration only of domestic United States laws.'' The secretary
said ``it did not take into account international law, nor did it
weigh the president's constituitnal responsibliity to carry out the
foreign policy of the United States.''
   The document entitled ``Authority of the FBI to Override
Customary or Other International Law in the Course of
Extraterritorial Law Enforcement Activities'' reverses a 1980 legal
opinion that the FBI could not arrest a fugitive without obtaining a
foreign government's permission.
   The earlier opinion, written in response to a query over whether
the FBI had authority to seize fugitive financier Robert Vesco in
the Bahamas, was eventually published.
   Justice Department officials have stressed that the opinion is
aimed intended to clarify the FBI's legal authority to seize
fugitives from countries that do not cooperate with the United
States or where there is no law and order, such as in Lebanon.

   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder and Republican J.
Marshall Coleman were running even in early returns Tuesday in an
election that could make Wilder the nation's first elected black
governor.
   With 415 of 1,967 precincts counted, or 21 percent, Wilder and
Coleman each had 50 percent of the vote. Coleman had 176,364 votes
to Wilder's 172,894 votes.
   Many of the early returns were from traditionally conservative
Henrico County, a constituency expected to favor Coleman.
   The state's first woman attorney general, Democrat Mary Sue
Terry, won re-election against Republican state Sen. Joseph B.
Benedetti, with early returns giving her more than a 3-2 edge.
   The governor's race pitted two candidates with a history of
overcoming long odds and featured a high-profile debate over access
to abortion, which Wilder supports and Coleman opposes.
   Early turnout was described as heavy in most parts of the state.
``We're on roller skates,'' said Alice Lynch, the registrar in
Richmond, describing the action in her office. ``It seems like a
tremendous turnout.''
   The 58-year-old Wilder, who earned money for college by waiting
on tables at whites-only political dinners in downtown Richmond,
defied the conventional wisdom by winning election as lieutenant
governor in 1985.
   He is hoping to become the nation's first black governor since
Reconstruction, and the first one ever elected by the voters of his
state. The only other black governor, Pinckney B.S. Pinchback, was
appointed acting governor of Louisiana when the incumbent was
impeached in 1870.
   Coleman, a 47-year-old Republican who has battled his own party's
establishment repeatedly during his political career, is attempting
a comeback after losing the 1981 election for governor to Democrat
Charles S. Robb.
   In other races, Democrat Donald S. Beyer Jr. was leading
Republican Edwina P. Dalton, who had been favored to become the
state's first woman lieutenant governor. With 16 percent of the
precincts counted, Beyer had 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent
for Dalton.

   The East German government resigned Tuesday, a
victim of mass emigration and pro-democracy turmoil, and pleas came
from within the ruling Communist Party for changes in its top ranks.
   More than 100,000 people marched for democracy in five East
German cities.
   A Parliament committee rejected a draft law allowing up to 30
days of travel abroad just a day after it was published, and said
unrestricted travel should be permitted.
   The 44-member Cabinet, called the Council of Ministers, resigned
jointly, said government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer. The council, led
by 75-year-old Premier Willi Stoph, implements policy made by the
Communist Party Politburo.
   Stoph and several other ministers are Politburo members.
   ``We appeal to the citizens who intend to leave our republic to
reconsider their step once more,'' the council said in a statement.
``Our socialist fatherland needs everyone.''
   More than 28,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany through
neighboring Czechoslovakia since Saturday _ they arrived Tuesday at
the rate of 120 an hour. About 175,000, more than 1 percent of the
population, have left the country this year by legal or illegal
means.
   The Council of Ministers will remain in office until Parliament
elects a new one, Meyer said, but did not say when that would occur.
The party Central Committee was to meet Wednesday to consider
further changes.
   West German political leaders in Bonn applauded Tuesday's
resignations but said only democratic reforms will quell unrest in
the communist nation.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, said,
``If I am correctly gauging the will of the people, they will not be
content with a few personnel changes, they will continue demanding a
genuinely new political course.''
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
said free elections now must follow.
   ``This move clearly reflects the mounting pressure for real
democracy and freedom,'' Britain's Foreign Office said. ``The
government did not have popular support. They have recognized this
by resigning.''
   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House deputy press secretary, said
in Washington: ``If it leads to a process of reform, it can be a
positive development.''
   Several Communist Party officials and three small parties allied
with the Communists urged the resignation of the Politburo itself,
which met on Tuesday.
   Leaders ``should resign without any delay'' to make way for a new
Politburo and government to carry out reforms, said the newspaper
Junge Welt, organ of the Communist youth organization.
   Egon Krenz, who replaced his mentor Erich Honecker, 77, as party
leader last month, has said five elderly Politburo members closely
associated with Honecker will be replaced by the end of the week.
Two other Politburo members lost their jobs when Krenz took over
Oct. 18.
   The Politburo, which normally has 21 members, also discussed an
``action program'' Krenz has said would contain sweeping political
and economic reforms.
   Guenter Krusche, a senior Lutheran Church leader in East Berlin,
called for immediate ``secret and free elections'' for a new
government.
   About 5,000 people marched in East Berlin on Tuesday to demand
free elections and challenge the Communist monopoly on power. Police
did not interfere with the protesters, who shouted: ``All power to
the people!''
   ADN, the official news agency, said 50,000 people rallied in
Wismar, on the Baltic coast; 35,000-40,000 in Nordhausen, near
Erfurt; and 20,000 in Meiningen.
   Guntram Erdmann of New Forum, the largest opposition group, told
the Wismar crowd his organization seeks ``peaceful transformation to
a democratic state.''
   On Monday, 750,000 demonstrators marched, about 500,000 in
Leipzig alone.
   East German leaders have been promising democratic reforms and
freer travel in hopes of halting unrest, but the draft law appeared
to satisfy no one.
   In rejecting the law in its current form, ADN said, the committee
declared: ``The proposal does not meet the expectations of citizens
... and will not achieve the political credibility of the state.''
   The panel recommended eliminating the need for exit visas,
separating travel regulations from emigration rules, clarifying the
access to foreign currency for trips abroad, reconsidering the
30-day limit and changing grounds on which passports can be refused.
   It also recommended an emergency Parliament session to find ways
of persuading citizens to remain at home. The latest tide of
emigration began early Saturday when departure was permitted through
Czechoslovakia, the only country to which East Germans can travel
freely.
   Opening Czechoslovakia created the first free passage to the West
since the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961. Authorities have
said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect.

<HEAD>Bush Adminstration Urges No Amendments; Final Vote Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration urged Republican
senators Tuesday not to undermine a compromise to increase the
minimum wage by seeking to amend the deal.
   A final vote on the plan was delayed until Wednesday morning by
congressional action to increase the government's debt ceiling.
   Because of the delay, it was unclear whether several GOP senators
said to be mulling amendments would honor the administration's
request, delivered in a letter to the Senate from Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole.
   Mrs. Dole said the administration had supported the compromise
passed by the House last week and ``accordingly I ask for your
support of this same bill now before the Senate with no amendments
attached.''
   It appeared, however, that at least one amendment would be
offered, a proposal by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to exempt small
businesses from the increase in the minimum wage. The amendment, if
offered, was expected to fail.
   Mrs. Dole's letter was addressed to her husband, Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. A copy was given to Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Talks on raising the debt limit dragged on throughout the day,
and Tuesday evening Mitchell announced the minimum-wage vote would
be Wednesday.
   The legislation, as it now stands, would increase the hourly
minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80 next April 1 and to $4.25 a year
later. It also would create a new, subminimum ``training wage'' for
workers 16-19 years old new to the job market. All workers in that
age group could be paid the subminimum for their first three months,
and for another three months if enrolled in approved training
programs.
   The subminimum would be $3.35 when the minimum wage rose to
$3.80. It would rise to $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

   Six wounded guerrillas and 25 of
their relatives occupied a Roman Catholic church Tuesday to demand
they and the others be allowed to leave the country for treatment.
   ``We are going to stay here as long as necessary to be able to
leave,'' said Rosa Elida, a 19-year-old former rebel for the
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front. Suffering from a leg wound, she
said she has been with the guerrilla forces for nine years.
   Ms. Elida said she had received primitive medical attention in a
rebel camp but still has difficulty walking and has not been able to
return to combat.
   The group took over Calvary Chruch in downtown San Salvador to
demand that President Alfredo Cristiani allow 109 of the war
casualties be allowed to go abroad for specialized medical care.
   An injured 18-year-old rebel, who gave his name only as Miguel,
said the occupation is indefinite.
   ``We will not move from here until we obtain evacuation,'' he
said.
   The group's evacuation had been scheduled for last May by the
government of then-President Jose Napoleon Duarte. It was suspended
in the face of strong opposition from the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, of Cristiani, who took office June 1.
   A group of 47 wounded rebels were allowed to leave for Cuba in
September after occupying the Metropolitan Cathedral for 43 days and
then taking refuge in the Mexican Embassy in San Salvador.
   Evacuations of Salvadoran war wounded began in 1984 under the
Duarte administration through negotiated exchanges of army officers
held by the guerrillas for the wounded. In 1987, agreements were
reached on evacuating the wounded without negotiations and exchanges.
   Since 1984, 393 former combatants have been given safe conduct
out of the country to receive medical attention and rehabilitation
in West Germany, Sweden, France and Cuba.

<TEXT>
   ABC decided Tuesday that ``Chicken Soup'' wasn't
good for the network, and canceled the new series. Its star, Jackie
Mason, said he wasn't disappointed and felt ``somewhat relieved'' he
can be himself again.
   Mason said in a statement that there have been many ups and downs
in his life, ``but one thing that I know is that there are at least
20 million gentiles who now know what a real Jew sounds like.''
   Tuesday's show was the series finale. Mason, a
rabbi-turned-comedian whose distinctive, staccato accent is part of
his act, played a Jewish ex-pajama salesman in love with an
Irish-Catholic widow portrayed by Lynn Redgrave.
   Although TV critics gave the series mixed reviews when it
premiered on Sept. 12, many said it couldn't miss because it
followed ABC's hit ``Roseanne'' on Tuesdays. Rival network
executives who disagreed were proved right.
   ``Chicken Soup'' achieved respectable ratings, averaging an 18.6
rating and a 29 per cent share of the audience in its time period,
according to ABC. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   But ABC felt it wasn't holding the audience that had been
watching Roseanne Barr's preceding comedy, said a network executive
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the ratings for the week ending last Sunday, Mason's show was
23rd in prime-time ratings, well below ``Roseanne,'' which was in
fourth place.
   Mason's series was a ``well-executed program'' that nonetheless
didn't achieve ABC's hopes that it would help maintain the network's
ratings strengths on Tuesday, its key night, ABC Entertainment
president Robert A. Iger said in a statement.
   The series had three more finished episodes awaiting broadcast
when it was canceled. No decision has been made yet on what will be
done with them, ABC said.``Chicken Soup'' was the third new series
axed this season. NBC's ``Nutt House'' and CBS' ``The People Next
Door'' were the earlier casualties.
   ``Chicken Soup'' will be suceeded, starting Nov. 21, by
``Coach,'' which premiered last season and stars Craig T. Nelson as
a college football coach. The announced end of ``Chicken Soup'' came
on the same day as the New York mayoral election, in which Democrat
David Dinkins faced GOP candidate Rudolph Giuliani. Mason earlier
touched off a controversy while campaigning for Giuliani.
   Mason quit the Giuliani campaign in September over remarks he
made about Dinkins, who is black. Among other things, Mason said
Jews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.
   The comedian apologized for his remarks, which were reported by
the Village Voice, and said he had learned that ``what's funny on
stage can be insensitive when it's said off the stage and in the
world of politics. And for my insensitivity, I apologize.''
   In his statement Tuesday, Mason praised the staff of ``Chicken
Soup,'' and said he would continue to perform club dates, possibly
put on another one-man show on Broadway and work on other projects.

<HEAD>Security Council Welcomes New Lebanese President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Tuesday night
hailed the election of Lebanon's new president under an Arab League
peace plan, a not-so-thinly veiled rebuke to Gen. Michel Aoun, who
rejects the development.
   Aoun, the Christian army commander, spurned the entire peace plan
adopted by Lebanon's Parliament on the ground it did not include a
timetable for withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian soldiers from Lebanon.
   The Security Council responded by adopting a unanimous statement
urging ``all sectors of the Lebanese people, including the armed
forces, to come to the support of their president.''
   The council members ``welcome the election of the president of
the Lebanese republic and the Taif agreement by the Lebanese
Parliament.'' The legislators adopted the changes at an emergency
meeting held in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   Parliament met at Kleiat in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanon on
Sunday and elected Rene Mouawad, a Maronite Catholic, as president.
It endorsed political changes worked out by legislators at Taif with
Arab League mediation, which give Moslems more power in an effort to
end the 14-year-old civil war.
   The legislators met in northern Lebanon because Aoun threatened
to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.
   The Security Council said they ``pay particular tribute to the
high sense of responsibility and to the courage of the Lebanese
members of Parliament.''
   The Syrians are in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from
the Arab League. Aoun calls it an occupation army. A six-month
artillery war between Aoun's men and the Syrians killed hundreds of
people and wounded thousands before it was suspended by a truce in
September.
   Aoun and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss have led competing
Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when the
six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended without Parliament
agreeing on a successor.
   Lebanon's civil war has killed more than 150,000 people since
1975.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators, acting with
President Bush's assent, agreed Tuesday on a stiffer set of trade
sanctions against China in response to last summer's Tiananmen
Square massacre.
   The sanctions were included in a compromise version of a
two-year, $9.7 billion bill authorizing activities of the State
Department and related federal agencies. The measure now goes back
to the full House and Senate for final approval.
   The measure contained harsh rhetoric condemning the ``unprovoked,
brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the thousands of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing on June 4, noting that at
least 700 people died and another 27 or more were executed afterward.
   The bill also condemned China's efforts to conceal the truth of
what happened, including clandestinely disposing of bodies and
suppressing news reports.
   But its strongest section was a set of trade sanctions, including
suspension of insurance trough the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
for companies doing business in China; suspension of trade
assistance; a freeze on exports of satellites; a halt to sales of
controlled munitions, including helicopters and parts, and crime
control equipment; and an end to sale of certain nuclear material
and components.
   The sanctions go beyond penalties imposed earlier in the year by
Bush and the measure was initially opposed by the White House. But
it was later accepted after Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee, agreed to make it
easier for the president to waive the sanctions.
   In discussions with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,
Solarz said, the measure was altered to allow termination of the
sanctions if the president certifies such action is ``in the
national interest.'' Scowcroft reported that the president would not
veto the measure based on that provision, said Solarz.
   As the conferees worked through a list of disagreements between
the House and Senate bills, they also accepted a section that would
impose criminal penalties on any government official who enlists any
foreign government to carry out policies that are banned by U.S. law.
   The amendment was intended to bar use of U.S. foreign aid as
leverage on recipient countries to support goals that the United
States cannot pursue directly because of legal restrictions. It is
aimed at situations like the use of U.S. military aid for Honduras
to pressure that government to support the Contra rebels fighting
the leftist governnment in neighboring Nicaragua.
   That provision, which stemmed from Congress' discoveries during
the Iran-Contra affair, could still provide a reason for Bush to
veto the bill.
   The overall measure included $4.7 billion for the State
Department and other agencies for the current fiscal year, which
began Oct. 1, and $5 billion for next year.
   It includes major boosts in aid for the United Nations and for
U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   They would be authorized to receive a total of $832 million this
year and $939 million next year, compared with $520 million last
year.
   The National Endowment for Democracy, which promotes democratic
elections abroad, could get up to $25 million in each of the two
years, compared with $15 million last year.

<TEXT>
   Rep. James Florio has served eight terms in
Congress and wrote the nation's Superfund cleanup law. But he has
always made it clear that he would happily trade the nation's
Capitol for New Jersey's Statehouse.
   On his third try Tuesday, he made it. Florio, a 52-year-old
Democrat, was elected governor, easily defeating Republican Rep.
James Courter. The victory came eight years after Florio lost the
closest gubernatorial election in the state's history.
   For Florio, mastering subjects such as the environment and
transportation played well to New Jersey residents, who live in a
pollution-riddled and traffic-clogged state.
   ``I didn't pick these topics because I wanted to be governor,''
Florio said. ``I've been involved in environmental legislation for
20 years. I was a bird-watcher when I was a kid.''
   The son of an Italian immigrant shipyard painter, Florio was born
in Brooklyn and left high school at age 17 to join the Navy. He
earned his high school equivalency diploma, and later degrees from
Trenton State College and Rutgers University Law School.
   After three terms in the state Assembly, he was elected to
Congress in the Democrats' 1974 ``Watergate'' freshman class. His
district takes in Camden, an aging industrial city just across the
Delaware River from Philadelphia.
   Florio gained statewide recognition when he ran fourth in his
party's 1977 gubernatorial primary. He won the Democratic nomination
in 1981, but lost the general election to Republican Thomas H. Kean
by 1,797 votes out of nearly 2.4 million cast. Kean went on to
become one of the most popular modern governors, but was barred by
state law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   In 1981, Florio was criticized as being an icy candidate who
couldn't relate to people. He set out to change that this year, and
jokingly referred to himself as ``warm and wonderful.'' He became
Florio the people-meeter.
   Friends say a big part of the transformation is attributed to a
happier personal life. But others say the ``new Florio'' persona has
been carefully crafted by an experienced campaign staff.
   Florio ran as a loner in 1981 while separated from his first
wife. This time, he campaigned with his new wife, Lucinda, a school
teacher. He drew approving cheers throughout the campaign by
mentioning his two new grandchildren.

<HEAD>President Aquino Defends Her Government's Human Rights Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on
Tuesday defended her government's record on human rights, saying she
was personally committed because she had been a victim of abuses.
   Speaking with reporters following a meeting with Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, she said, ``I would like to tell you that having
been a victim of human rights abuses myself, I am certainly
committed. In fact I have stated throughout my administration that
we will not tolerate any violations of human rights.''
   Her husband, Benigno Aquino, was shot to death in 1983 at the
Manila airport when he returned from self-exile in the United States
to campaign against President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino became president after Marcos was ousted in a
military-civilian uprising in February 1986.
   Several human rights groups claim Mrs. Aquino's government has
failed to control army and paramilitary groups that the groups say
violate rights in the fight against Communist rebels.
   Mrs. Aquino is on a four-day visit to Canada and then will go to
the United States for four days.
   She said she hears few complaints about human rights abuses until
she travels abroad.
   ``We have a very free press in the Philippines and I want to tell
the Canadians that very rarely does this (allegations of rights
violations) appear in our press,'' she said. ``I am really surprised
that it is only in foreign countries that there is so much talk
about alleged human rights abuses.''
   Mulroney, also speaking with reporters after a 90-minute meeting
with Mrs. Aquino in the Parliament building, said he has done much
to improve human rights. He also said she had done a remarkable job
in transforming her country from a dictatorship to a democracy.
   ``We are very interested in helping her along the road to greater
reforms and greater democracy ... as opposed to inhibiting any flow
of aid at all,'' he said.
   Foreign Secretary Joe Clark announced that Canada would provide
$100 million in new aid for the Philippines. He said the money would
be used to purchase commodities and telecommunications equipment,
help fund anti-poverty organizations and support an environmental
management program.
   Mrs. Aquino has said a main goal of her trip is to encourage
foreign investments in the Philippines.

   President Corazon Aquino's daughter
was quoted Tuesday as saying her mother likes to travel abroad to
escape criticism at home.
   Mrs. Aquino is on an eight-day trip to Canada and the United
States and her 18-year-old daughter, Kris Aquino, is traveling with
her.
   The Manila Times quoted Kris Aquino from Toronto as saying, ``I
think it really invigorates my mon after each visit.'' She quoted
her mother as telling her, ``It's good also to hear that `Hey,
you're OK,' because back home all you hear is criticism.''
   Mrs. Aquino has visited 12 countries, Hong Kong and the Vatican
since becoming president in 1986.

   Voters decided New York City's most contentious
mayoral election in more than a decade Tuesday, choosing between a
Democrat who would be the first black to win City Hall and a
Republican running as a reformer.
   Three network-owned television stations projected Democrat David
Dinkins as the winner over Republican nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani.
WABC-TV, WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV called the contest based on surveys of
voters leaving polling places as soon as they closed at 9 p.m.
   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, maintained the
multiracial support that enabled him to defeat three-term incumbent
Mayor Edward I. Koch in the Democratic primary, according to
pre-election polls.
   Giuliani, hamstrung by the vast Democratic majority in New York,
accepted the tiny Liberal Party's nomination in a bid to fashion a
reform-minded ``fusion'' candidacy that crossed party lines.
   In late morning, under a clear sky and bright sunshine, Board of
Elections spokesman Jon Del Giorno said he expected the predicted
turnout of 60 percent to 65 percent to hold up.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Giuliani, 45, a former federal prosecutor making his first run
for elective office, sharply criticized Dinkins throughout the
56-day campaign, calling him a clubhouse politician with
questionable ethical standards.
   Dinkins criticized his opponent's change of views on abortion _
Giuliani first opposed it, then reversed himself _ and his
qualifications for office.
   Dinkins also drew the contest as a battle between Democrats and
the Republican Party, which he blamed for deep federal budget cuts
in urban programs. Many prominent Democrats campaigned and
advertised for him.
   Mainly, though, the 62-year-old Dinkins stressed his theme of
social healing, repeatedly referring to New York's ethnic and racial
groups as ``a gorgeous mosaic'' stitched together by common
interests. Both candidates asked that they be judged on their
abilities, not their race.
   Dinkins was propelled by his solid defeat of Koch, the ebullient
but often-abrasive mayor since 1977. The city's Democratic
organizations and most unions lined up with Dinkins, providing him
endorsements, donations and thousands of volunteers. Koch worked and
advertised for his conqueror.
   The general election was the most hotly contested since Koch beat
Mario Cuomo, running as a Liberal, in 1977.
   Giuliani's most daunting hurdle was the Democrats' monster edge
in voter registration: Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-1
margin in New York, 2.2 million to 450,000. There are an additional
460,000 independents.
   To overcome that disadvantage Giuliani tried to remake the
cross-party ``fusion'' candidacies fashioned by the three
Republicans elected mayor this century _ Seth Low in 1901, Fiorello
H. La Guardia in 1933, 1937 and 1941, and John V. Lindsay in 1965.
   In appealing for Democratic defectors, Giuliani stressed his
record as a corruption-fighting prosecutor and hammered at Dinkins'
sloppy financial record-keeping, including his failure to file
income taxes from 1969-72.
   Dinkins said the tax lapse was an oversight and a thing of the
past. But there were damaging reports of more recent flaws:
conflicting valuations Dinkins assigned to stock that he transferred
to his son in 1986; failure to disclose a friend's partial funding
of a vacation he took to France; two votes by aides, acting in his
place, that contravened an Ethics Board recommendation.
   Dinkins also underwent repeated questioning about his
relationship with Jesse Jackson, whose 1988 presidential campaign he
headed in the state. Jackson is anathema to some Jewish voters
because of his support for Palestinian rights and his 1984 reference
to New York as ``Hymietown.''

   A fire erupted aboard a C-5 cargo plane
Tuesday at Kelly Air Force Base, injuring three people, authorities
said. It was the second aircraft blaze at the base since July.
   One person working on the plane was treated for minor smoke
inhalation and two firefighters were overcome by smoke, base
spokesman Lt. Dave Ebner said. The firefighters were taken to a
hospital, he said.
   The cause of the fire wasn't known. Workers were checking the
operation of control systems when the fire broke out.
   The fire was brought under control in about 25 minutes, Ebner
said.
   The C-5 is the world's largest cargo plane. The Air Logistics
Center at Kelly does maintenance and repairs on the C-5 and B-52
bomber.
   Last July, a B-52 caught fire and exploded at Kelly, killing one
civilian worker and injuring 11 others. Air Force officials blamed
that accident on failure to remove a faulty fuel-tank vent plug
during refueling.

<TEXT>
   The United States expects a broad agreement on
renewing the lease for military bases in the Philippines when
President Corazon Aquino makes her second official visit to this
country this week, a senior administration official said.
   ``This is going to be an important and, we think, a very
successful visit,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The official also told reporters the United States is confident
``that, at the end of the day, there will be an agreement'' on U.S.
use of military bases in the Philippines beyond expiration in 1991
of the current arrangement.
   The issue is expected to come up during Mrs. Aquino's scheduled
meeting with President Bush at the White House Thursday, and the two
countries have agreed to start formal negotiations next month on
extending their bases agreement.
   Mrs. Aquino arrives from New York Wednesday evening on the second
U.S. state visit of her presidency. White House talks and a state
dinner hosted by Bush, meetings with Cabinet secretaries and leaders
of both houses of Congress and visits to the International Monetary
Fund, Arlington National Cemetery and the National Museum of Natural
History are on her two-day schedule in the capital.
   Predicting ``long and very complicated'' negotiations over the
future of Clark Field, Subic Bay naval station and four smaller U.S.
bases, the official said, ``we think there's a logic that both
parties will see ... that these facilities do, in fact, serve the
interests of both countries in very important ways.''
   ``I think that will be the compelling fact that will assert
itself, and I think we will have an agreement. We're going into it
with that frame of mind,'' he said.
   Despite the drop in East-West tension, the bases remain important
to Philippines and regional security and ``are regarded by every
government in East Asia as a stabilizing factor,'' the U.S. official
said.
   ``They are a known quantity and an important representation of
the United States commitment to the security and stability of the
region ... and I think that's a sentiment still widely shared
throughout the region.''
   The main purpose of Mrs. Aquino's visit is to stimulate interest
in trade and investment, along with a continued flow of development
aid, the official noted.
   He said Philippines officials are in the final stages of reaching
agreement with creditors on a buyback of up to $1.4 billion worth of
the country's foreign debt. ``We hope it succeeds. We will help it
succeed if we can,'' he said.

<HEAD>Actor Yusaka Matsuda Dead at 39</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yusaku Matsuda, the award-winning actor who played a
murderer in the current U.S. film ``Black Rain,'' has died of
bladder cancer. He was 39.
   Matsuda died at a Tokyo hospital Monday. He had been hospitalized
since Oct. 7.
   Matsuda won the Japan Academy Award and the Kinema Junpo award
for best actor for his role in the 1983 film satire ``Kazoku Geimu''
(``Family Game''), directed by Yoshimitsu Morita. In the film, which
was a critical hit in the United States as well as Japan, Matsuda
portrays a sadistic private tutor coaching a high school student
through ``examination hell.''
   In his last film, ``Black Rain,'' Matsuda played an ambitious
yakuza gangster who committed a murder in New York. Michael Douglas
played the American detective who brought him back to Japan and
pursued him through the streets of Osaka after he escaped custody.
   Matsuda also co-starred with Olympic gold medalist Florence
Griffith-Joyner in a 140-minute television drama that aired Oct. 7.
In ``Karei-naru Tsuiseki'' (``The Great Pursuit''), Matsuda played a
detective who helps a sports journalist, played by Griffith-Joyner,
in investigating a plane accident in which she lost her adopted
child.
   Matsuda was known for his frequent real-life brawls as well as
his slender build and cool, cynical style. He made his first
appearance on screen in 1973 and appeared in numerous TV and screen
films.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   A wave of mud and rocks cascaded down a
hillside and across the Pacific Coast Highway on Tuesday, sweeping
three cars across the scenic route and closing it for at least 24
hours, authorities said.
   Two people were treated for injuries at a hospital.
   Motorists said they were suddenly cloaked in darkness as a wall
of mud ripped across all four lanes. The renowned highway, marked as
State Route 1, links Los Angeles with Malibu, Oxnard and other
northern coastal communities.
   ``All of a sudden it got dark and my sister said, `My God it's a
landslide,''' said Judy Lester, a passenger. ``We broke through the
dirt, she steered very hard. We went into the side of the hill, did
a 360 (-degree turn) and went in backwards. It just engulfed us.''
   By late Tuesday, much of the debris had been cleared but the
highway remained closed. Fire officials said homes perched on the
hill over the highway, with a panoramic view of the Pacific, were in
no immediate danger from the slide.

   A moderate aftershock from the killer
earthquake three weeks ago rattled the Santa Cruz Mountains and
nearby areas on Tuesday, injuring at least one person but causing no
property damage, officials said.
   A woman fell down at a shopping center and broke an arm, said
police in Los Gatos, which is nearly 45 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   The quake measured 4.3 on the Richter scale, making it the 23rd
aftershock of magnitude 4.0 or higher since the Oct. 17 quake that
caused 66 deaths and an estimated $17 billion in property damage.
   That quake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, was
centered in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The center of Tuesday's
aftershock was 12 miles southwest of San Jose and 17 miles north
Santa Cruz, and was felt as far north as San Francisco.
   ``It was a pretty good shake,'' said Capt. Bob Schuster of the
Los Gatos Police Department.
   ``It was scary,'' said Dinah Phillips, a Santa Cruz County public
information officer.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

   A judge who sat on the bench for 17 years
abused his power to get cut-rate bank loans, demanded bribes from an
attorney and staff and forced court employees to do personal chores,
prosecutors said Tuesday.
   Joseph F. O'Kicki, 59, stands accused of a decade of violations
as judge, including extortion, bribery, open lewdness and coercion.
He has denied the charges. He also faces a second trial on 16 counts
related to more private charges.
   ``We don't mean to say Judge O'Kicki was a corrupt judge in every
case,'' said Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Claus in his opening
statement. But O'Kicki ``definitely abused the very powers, the
privileges and the responsibilities which were conferred upon him by
you.''
   The suspended judge frequently wrote on a yellow legal pad as the
prosecutor described 13 incidents cited in 11 counts of public
corruption. His wife, Sylvia, sat at his side and also took notes.
   O'Kicki's trial has been the talk of this community in the
foothills of the Allegheny Mountains in central Pennsylvania.
   At times, it has verged on soap opera, with allegations that the
judge ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in his
underpants or naked, and that he ordered court workers to chop his
wood and feed his dogs.
   About 20 observers, including reporters, were scattered
throughout the large, ornate courtroom where O'Kicki took his oath
as president judge 1{ years ago.
   Defense attorney James Yelovich later told visiting Judge Richard
Grifo of Northampton County he would wait to present his opening
statement until the prosecution had rested its case.
   During his 45-minute opening argument, Claus told the jury
numerous documents will be presented during the trial to prove
O'Kicki's guilt.
   Claus said O'Kicki used his influence to secure lower interest on
a $10,000 bank loan in 1986. The prosecutor said the judge also had
a staff member pay him $500 in exchange for a better job with the
county and ordered him and another court employee to perform
personal tasks for him on county time.
   Last March, a state grand jury recommended O'Kicki be charged
with 13 years' worth of violations, including extortion, bribery,
lewdness and coercion. He was elected to his first 10-year term as a
judge in 1971 and re-elected in 1981.
   Although the grand jury recommended 76 charges, most of those
were dismissed, withdrawn or combined with other charges.
Twenty-seven remain, 11 of which involve public corruption and 16 of
which involve more private charges.
   The first witness, auto dealer Allen Black, said O'Kicki bought a
Pontiac Sunbird from his family's dealership in 1984. He testified
that on one contract, the judge signed his full name then crossed it
out and instead wrote ``Judge O'Kicki.''
   ``He said `My name is judge,''' Black said.
   An $8,000 loan was financed through Laurel Bank of Ebensburg,
Black said.
   Charles Horne, a vice president of Laurel and former car loan
officer, said he was told O'Kicki was paying $1,298 as a down
payment on the Sunbird. Horne said he didn't know until the trial
that O'Kicki's check totaled only $298.
   Horne said it's difficult to say whether he would have approved
the loan if he had known O'Kicki was putting down only $298 in cash.

   Nearly half the 1,100
federal troops sent to maintain order on St. Croix after Hurricane
Hugo have returned home following a presidential order to withdraw.
   About 250 troops returned home aboard C-141 transport planes
Tuesday. On Sunday, the first 250 were flown back to the States,
said Joint Task Force spokesman Maj. Doug Foster.
   ``We should all be home for Thanksgiving,'' he said.
   The C-141 and C-130 transport planes were constantly flying in
and out of the island to evacuate heavy equipment and vehicles
brought by the soldiers when they arrived on Sept. 21, four days
after Hugo's ravaged the island.
   President Bush ordered the withdrawal last week following a
request by Gov. Alexander Farrelly, who said the troops, most of
them from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Bragg, N.C., were no longer
needed.
   The U.S. troops were sent to curb looting and help local
authorities maintain order. Most stores had already been sacked of
food and other commodities by the time the soldiers arrived.
   ``It's important for the Virgin Islands National Guard and the
police to get back on their own feet now,'' Foster said.
   Farrelly's request for the pullout was criticized by three
business organizations, the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, the Board
of Realtors and a civic group called the United Concerned Citizens
of St. Croix.
   They charged the governor reneged on his promise to keep the
federal troops until all power and telephone services were restored.
   Hugo caused more than $500 million in damage to the U.S. Virgin
Islands, mostly on St. Croix, where most of the 52,000 residents
were left homeless.

<HEAD>Jury Acquits Former `Diff'rent Strokes' Star of Attempted Murder</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Bridges' reaction, jurors
saying they might be able to reach verdict on assault charge with instruction,

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Tuesday acquitted former child
television star Todd Bridges of attempted murder and attempted
voluntary manslaughter charges in the shooting of a man at a
``crack'' house.
   However, the jurors told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Florence-Marie Cooper they were deadlocked on an assault charge, and
resumed deliberations.
   The 24-year-old former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star was accused of
shooting eight bullets into the head of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay, 25,
and slashing his throat during a Feb. 2 scuffle in a Los Angeles
house where crack cocaine was being peddled. Clay survived the
attack.
   Bridges had tearfully told jurors he was a suicidal cocaine
addict at the time. He showed no emotion Tuesday as the verdict was
read.
   In announcing the deadlocke on the assault charge, jurors said it
was possible they could reach a verdict with more instruction from
the judge, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office.
   The judge told them to go back into the jury room and write down
questions they need instruction on so they could continue
deliberating, she said.
   Clay testified that Bridges was ``based out'' from freebasing or
smoking cocaine when the shooting occurred. ``He looked like his
eyes were about to jump out of his head,'' Clay said.
   Clay described himself as a bodyguard for the owner of the house
where Bridges was living. He told of arguments that involved Bridges
purportedly taking weapons from the house and selling them.
   Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran maintained that Bridges shot
Clay in self-defense.
   Bridges testified that Clay borrowed his BMW automobile, and
never returned it. The actor said Clay hit him, pushed him over a
fence and locked him out of the house.
   Bridges, who for eight years played actor Gary Coleman's brother
Willis on the ``Diff'rent Strokes'' series, testified he became
depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was
canceled in 1986.
   That same year he discovered his accountant had embezzled more
than $1 million from his account, Bridges testified.
   ``It came to the point where I became very mentally unstable. ...
The only thing I had left was to kill myself,'' the actor said.
   Bridges said that at the time of the shooting he was consuming 14
grams of cocaine a day.

   Richard Ramirez, the satanic ``Night Stalker''
who butchered or raped more than a dozen people in a spree that
terrorized Southern California in 1985, was sentenced Tuesday to
death in the gas chamber.
   Before he was sentenced, the 29-year-old Texas killer, wearing
dark glasses, uttered a rambling, nearly inaudible statement in
court that ended with the words: ``Lucifer dwells within us all.''
   ``You don't understand me. You are not expected to. You are not
capable of it,'' he said. ``I am beyond your experience. I am beyond
good and evil. Legions of the night, night breed. Repeat not the
errors of `Night Prowler' and show no mercy. I will be avenged.''
   The sentence, pronounced by Superior Court Judge Michael A.
Tynan, carries an automatic appeal.
   The killer, who entered unlocked houses late at night to murder
people in their beds and beat others and demand money, was convicted
Sept. 20 of 13 murders and 30 other felonies, including rape,
burglary and sodomy.
   He often left satanic symbols scrawled at the scenes of his
crimes and in at least one instance, gouged out the eyes of a
victim. During his preliminary hearing, he appeared in court one day
with a pentagram drawn on the palm of his hand and flashed it to
reporters as he said: ``Hail, Satan!''
   The jury recommended Oct. 4 that he be sentenced to death.
Jurors, some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to
intimidate them during the trial by sneering and glaring at them,
returned death penalty recommendations on each of 19 special
circumstance counts.
   ``The jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this
court has ratified that judgment,'' Tynan said.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, who prosecuted
Ramirez, dismissed Ramirez' statement as ``more baloney.''
   ``I certainly wouldn't want anyone to listen to what he has to
say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some
structure in his life,'' Halpin said.
   One of the defense attorneys, Ray Clark, said appeals courts
would face a novel issue in the case, that of determining the impact
on the trial of the slaying of a juror during deliberations. A juror
was shot to death in August by her boyfriend, who later took his own
life.
   A snarling, gravely voiced Ramirez had earlier sneered at the
possibility of being sentenced to death.
   ``Big deal, death comes with the territory,'' he told reporters
after last month's sentencing recommendation. ``See you in
Disneyland.''
   After his September conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered
``devil sign'' at photographers and muttered one word: ``Evil.''

   The Senate and House agreed Tuesday night to
raise the treasury's borrowing authority above $3.1 trillion,
preventing the government from reneging for the first time ever on
its pledge to repay creditors.
   The legislation was approved by voice vote in the Senate and by a
269-99 margin in the House and sent to President Bush. His signature
would prevent the government from running out of cash on Thursday.
   ``Default is unthinkable,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``It
would strike a devastating blow to our country's credit rating.''
   The way for action on the debt-ceiling increase was cleared
earlier in the evening when leaders of the House and Senate worked
out an arrangement that removed from the debt-ceiling debate a fight
over modifying catastrophic health insurance for retirees.
   The agreement was blocked for more than an hour by Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa. He sought to add to the debt-ceiling bill an amendment
that would bar use of the cash-laden Social Security trust fund
income to make the budget deficit look smaller than it is.
   Heinz dropped his objection after Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, assured him that the Social Security amendment
would be given priority consideration next year.
   Under the agreement:
   _The debt-ceiling bill has only one amendment. That would repeal
a 1986 law, bitterly opposed by business, that prohibits
employer-financed health insurance plans from discriminating against
lower-paid workers. House acceptance of that amendment would send
the package to Bush.
   _The House would pass a new bill repealing catastrophic medical
coverage for retirees. That would send the bill to the Senate, which
would be expected to amend it with a plan repealing the unpopular
surtax that finances catastrophic insurance while retaining coverage
for hospital bills. Negotiators from the Senate and House would work
out a compromise somewhere between total repeal and keeping hospital
benefits.
   Without an increased debt ceiling, the Federal Reserve Board
would order banks, starting Thursday, not to honor any checks issued
by the U.S. Treasury. Owners of maturing federal securities would
have to continue holding those bonds, creating a cloud over the
government's credit rating and raising interests rates, economists
say.
   ``It is important to our economy and our country that we not risk
the adverse consequences of default by the government,'' Mitchell
said in pleading with colleagues for a quick settlement of the
problem.
   With no more authority to borrow, the Treasury Department
suspended sales of savings bonds and special state and local
securities and postponed auctions of $40 billion of securities.
   There was only token Senate opposition to approving a
House-passed bill raising the debt limit by $250 billion, since that
would simply give the government authority to borrow to pay for
goods and services it already has bought. But the measure became
entangled with a host of other major issues, blocking quick
resolution of any.
   These included the government's chief deficit-reduction bill of
the year; a bipartisan compromise increasing the mininum wage; the
fate of a year-old law expanding Medicare to protect retirees
against cost of a catastrophic illness; a major child-care
initiative and even a last-gasp effort by Republicans to pass
President Bush's proposed reduction in capital-gains taxes.
   Meanwhile, Bush prodded Congress to pass a deficit-reduction bill
that will pass his muster. Otherwise, he told a news conference, he
is prepared to make permanent the $16 billion in automatic spending
cuts that took effect Oct. 16.
   He said an acceptable bill would have to cut the deficit by about
$14 billion, considerably more than he and Congress agreed on last
spring. Too, he said, ``if it's all loaded up with special projects,
I won't sign it.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters: ``We'll
give him, I think, what we agreed to give him'' in the spring
agreement.

   '
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A bullfighter, a Marxist councilman and
12 other people were killed in four attacks Tuesday across Colombia.
   There were no immediate indications that Colombia's drug cartels
were involved in the killings, the latest to convulse this country
since the government ordered a crackdown on traffickers in
mid-August.
   Authorities said they did not know who carried out an attack in
which six people riding in a truck were killed by gunmen in an
ambush. In a separate incident, a bomb killed six other people,
police said.
   Late Tuesday, Oky Botero, a bullfighter who raised bulls and was
a private pilot, was shot to death in an upper-class Medellin suburb
while driving a Jeep, police said. He was riddled with bullets from
a passing car, the authorities said.
   At about the same time in Santador de Quilichao, a town about 210
miles southwest of Bogota, assailants broke into the house of local
council president Ruben Dario Fernandez and shot him to death. Dario
Fernandez was local head of the Marxist opposition Union Patriotica
Party.
   Officials gave these accounts of the other attacks:
   A group of men attacked a coffee plantation near Quinchia, a town
120 miles north of Bogota, early Tuesday and a bomb was thrown into
the owner's house.
   Quinchia Mayor Saul Botero told the RCN radio network that six
people were killed and five, including ranch owner Antonio Zuluaga,
were wounded. He said Zuluaga's wife, the couple's two daughters,
two nephews and a ranch worker were killed.
   Botero reported Zuluaga said guerrillas of the Popular Liberation
Army had demanded money and when he refused the extortioners
threatened to kill him and his family.
   Police said they have not determined the motive for the ambush on
a rural road near San Luis de Gaceno, a town 90 miles east of
Bogota. They said all six people aboard a truck were killed by men
who stopped the vehicle, opened fire and then escaped.
   It was not known if that attack might be related to a strike by
22,000 banana plantation workers in northern Colombia where both
leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads are active. The
strike spread to 11 other districts Tuesday.
   The strike affecting plantations along Colombia's Caribbean coast
could cause a shortage of bananas in the United States.
   Companies exporting bananas to the United States have said they
were losing $1 million a day because of the strike that began Nov. l.
   The strike originally started to protest the killings last month
of two union leaders. Union members blamed right-wing death squads
for the killings.
   Now the strikers are demanding higher pay, shorters hours and
medical care. The average pay for a plantation worker is the
equivalent of $79 per month for six-day work weeks of 10 hours a day.
   The president of the Association of Banana Companies, Jose Manuel
Arias, claimed the strikes were organized by leftist guerrillas and
were a ``festival of terrorism.''
   He said in an interview published Tuesday by the Bogota daily El
Tiempo that the strikes were organized by the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army, two of
Colombia's six left-wing guerrilla groups.
   The strike is centered in Apartado, a town of 100,000 and the
capital of the region.
   Gen. Jose Hernan Guzman, army commander of the region, told El
Tiempo he feared there would be violence because of the strike.
   He said he had tried to get the companies and workers to reach an
agreement that ``has no winners and no losers.''
   The worst attack in the zone blamed on rightist death squads
occurred about a year ago, on Nov. 11, when men firing from cars
killed 43 people in Segovia, a town 150 miles southeast of Apartado.

   The United States is returning $567 million in
frozen assets to Iran but says the action is unrelated to the
plight of eight Americans who are being held hostage in Lebanon.
   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by
American banks against Iran. Most of those claims were settled in
the past few weeks.
   As a result, U.S. officials said Monday night, the leftover
assets will be returned to the Bank of Iran. Another $243 million
will be transferred to a special fund to back up other American
claims against the Persian Gulf country, U.S. officials said Monday
night.

   Spurning official Red Square ceremonies to
commemorate the Bolshevik Revolution, at least 5,000 people marched
through Moscow today to protest food shortages, pollution,
Communist rule and the secret police.
   The unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital as
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership stood atop
the Lenin Mausoleum and reviewed the traditional display of
military hardware.
   The official tolerance of a competing protest march on a
hallowed national holiday represented how far the Soviet Union has
come from the authoritarian rule of Gorbachev's predecessors. But
so did the toned-down nature of the Red Square celebrations, which
did not put as much emphasis on military might as in previous years.

   The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for
payments to tens of thousands of women injured by the Dalkon
Shield, but one attorney said ``ultimate justice can never be
done'' for victims of the birth control device.
   The high court on Monday rejected a challenge by 650 women to a
$2.5 billion trust for victims of the intrauterine device made by
A.H. Robins Co. The fund was established by Richmond-based Robins,
which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 amid a flood of
claims because of the Dalkon Shield. The ruling means women injured
by the IUD could begin receiving compensation by next spring.
   It also clears the way for the purchase of Robins by American
Home Products Corp., a New York-based food and drug manufacturer
that agreed to buy Robins for $700 million in stock and to finance
the trust. The deal was conditional on approval of the trust, which
was established as part of Robins' bankruptcy reorganization plan.

   Congress is giving federal agencies ``an open
money sack'' to hire private consultants and contractors, and the
Energy Department even lets them perform sensitive work on nuclear
technology, a Senate report says.
   The Department of Energy relies on private consultants ``to
perform virtually all basic governmental functions,'' according to
a report released Monday by Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of a
Senate subcommittee.
   The number of Energy Department employees has declined from
20,000 in 1980 to 16,000, the report said, adding that contractors
have in effect become part of its permanent work force.

   In a darkened government auditorium five
judges are sifting through 603 artists' works to choose the next
official Duck Stamp for hunting licenses. But there's more than
prestige on the line, for the winner also is likely to become a
millionaire.
   The painting for the new stamp will become the 57th Duck Stamp
and bring instant recognition to the winner within the community of
wildlife artists and conservationists _ not to mention substantial
economic reward. Well over a million of the stamps with the
artist's design will be sold for the 1990-91 waterfowl hunting
season to be placed on hunting licenses.
   For the federal government the stamp is a source of revenue for
buying and protecting wetlands. Last year more than $13 million
went to the Interior Department from selling the $10 stamps.

   An AIDS victim was led to take Holy
Communion for the first time in 15 years. A priest was encouraged
to seek reconciliation between his homosexuality and his
Christianity.
   These are examples of the impact of The Oasis, an unusual,
recently opened Episcopal Church ministry to gays, as recounted by
its pastor, the Rev. J. Robert Williams.
   However, opponents say it surrenders to human weaknesses that
are forbidden by the Bible.
   ``The lifestyle is wrong,'' said the Rev. Walter Lewis, interim
vicar at the Church of The Transfiguration in neighboring North
Bergen. ``If you accept the Bible as the standard of faith, it's
clearly wrong.''
   The controversial new center opened in June at All Saints'
Episcopal Church in Hoboken, a city of 40,000 people on the Hudson
River across from New York City.
   Williams, 34, who has a mailing list of more than 200 people
connected with The Oasis, has spent the last few months on the road
spreading his view that Christianity can and should find room for
homosexuals.
   ``If we're made in the image of God, then anything in human
nature has its corollary in God,'' he said
   He said he and other homosexuals possess a special understanding
of spirituality because so many people silently linger ``on the
edge _ between masculinity and femininity, between respectability
and criminality.''
   His travels have led him to offer Communion to an AIDS-afflicted
gay man who had left the Roman Catholic Church 15 years ago. The
man adorned his hospital room with flowers and _ along with his
lover _ dressed in his Sunday best for the occasion, Williams said.
   The ministry's notoriety has reached as far as Colombia, where a
Roman Catholic priest there wrote to Williams seeking guidance on
how to reconcile his devotion to the church with his homosexuality.
   ``He wanted to know how he could fit in within an anti-gay
atmosphere,'' Williams said.
   Williams said he has sought to show the priest and other
homosexuals who have ``been taught they're going to hell'' that
they have something to offer by acknowledging their differences and
returning to religion.
   Williams ``came out of the closet'' at age 23 after a
fundamentalist upbringing in Abilene, Texas. He later lived with
his current lover in a Boston suburb along with his lover's former
wife and two daughters before accepting the post in Hoboken.
   He said he told church officials who read his application that
``You know you're not getting Ozzie and Harriet, but you're not
getting Ozzie and Ozzie either.''
   However, Williams said his openness remains rare among
homosexuals. ``Gay people typically lie _ they make up the name of
a boyfriend or girlfriend. A lifetime of doing that erodes your
self-esteem and takes its psychological toll.''
   One homosexual parishioner, who insisted on anonymity, said he
began attending because he wanted to answer his own spiritual
questions and feel a part of something.
   He said he grew up as a Roman Catholic but could not work with
that church's gay outreach group, Dignity, because of what he felt
was the Catholic Church's anti-gay bias.
   ``I see a very strong purpose to something like the Oasis,'' the
man said. ``Most people feel quite alienated from organized
religion. I've met a lot of nice people. But it hasn't been The
Dating Game experience.''
   Beth Crippen, a 35-year-old heterosexual parishioner from
Hoboken with two children, said she and other parishioners respect
Williams' sexuality as part of who he is.
   ``There are people who I thought might get up and walk and
haven't,'' Ms. Crippen said.
   Ministers within the Newark Diocese, encompassing seven counties
in northern New Jersey, differ over the Oasis.
   ``The call of the church is to be inclusive to all people,''
said the Rev. Pat Close at St. John's Episcopal Church in
Montclair. ``I'm sure if more parish clergy looked at their
congregation, they'd find gay people within their midst.''
   A critic of the new ministry, the Rev. Richard Constantinos of
Christ Episcopal Church in Budd Lake, said the church should help
homosexuals to ``become well'' instead of encouraging their
lifestyles.
   The ministry doesn't seem to be developing spin-offs. The Rev.
Elmer Sullivan, a spokesman for the adjacent New Jersey diocese
based in Trenton, said none of its parishes plan to offer gay
ministries.
   Rev. Frederick Boswell, a minister for St. James Episcopal
Church in Montclair and a backer of the Oasis, said he hopes the
ministry outgrows its need.
   ``I would hope that the Oasis would go out of business,''
Boswell said. ``I'd hope one day there'd be no need for special
ministries. This is just a stepping stone.''

<HEAD>Louisiana Governor Alters Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen months after Gov. Buddy Roemer
went to war against populist tradition, he claims several
victories, owns up to a major defeat and admits he needs to do a
better job dealing with legislators.
   But Roemer, a self-styled reformer who unseated three-term Gov.
Edwin Edwards in 1987, said he won't back off from a pledge against
``good-old boy'' dealings. ``I don't want anybody to be
disappointed in the fact that Buddy has gotten a little older and
hopefully a little wiser.
   ``I can be legitimately criticized for many things ... but I
don't think you can say after a year and a half that this is a
political office.''
   Roemer's drive to enact an ambitious agenda have been met
recently with anger from legislators. His style _ part bulldog and
part evangelical minister _ worked against him during debates over
the state's tax system and a divisive budget-balancing fight this
year, some lawmakers said.
   ``He has had the attitude that it's his way or no way,'' said
Rep. John Alario, who was ousted as House speaker last year at
Roemer's insistence. ``He should know better. He came up as a
legislator through Congress and he knows that's not the way it
works. For some reason, he let it go to his head and ran all over
everyone and that's not a way a democracy should work,''
   When Roemer took office in March 1988, Louisiana faced an
accumulated deficit of $900 million and ranked near the top of the
unemployment list and at the bottom of most education categories.
He convinced the Legislature to give him temporary fiscal authority
unlike any since Huey Long, who ruled with fiat and a rubber-stamp
Legislature in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
   In the first few months of Roemer's term, an education reform
bill gave teachers pay raises, the state's long-term debt was
bonded out and the giant agency handling public welfare programs
was split in half and reorganized.
   An office of inspector general, headed by a former newspaper
investigative newspaper reporter, was activated to root out
corruption and mismanagement.
   The governor also pledged to bring in new business to end
Louisiana's dependence on the volatile petroleum industry, and to
clean up the environment _ goals often seen as conflicting. The
Department of Environmental Quality was beefed up and the
Legislature this year passed a tough clean air act.
   All the way, Roemer fought with the ``evil part of our past.''
   ``I am a politician. I like politics. I don't consider it a
pejorative word. But in Louisiana it had become that over time.
Excuses not to move, factions. It has not been surpising to me, but
depressing, to spend so much time on political warfare.''
   The governor wound up on the losing side when he tried to change
Louisiana's populist tax system, which leaned heavily on business
and has often been described as ``don't tax you, don't tax me, tax
the guy behind the tree.''
   One attempt to shift the load to individuals through income tax
failed in the Legislature in October 1988; a second passed in March
only to be rejected by voters in April. The fallout was an
acrimonious fight with the Legislature over the current state
budget, a revolt led by his Senate floor leader that forced
acceptance of a sales tax to balance spending, and speculation
Roemer already had moved into the ranks of the lame ducks.
   ``Even the political enemies of that wanted it to pass. I'll say
it for the public record. They wanted it to pass because they knew
it was the answer.''
   The governor believes he has recovered from the downturn in
popularity as gauged by post-session media polls, but doesn't know
yet whether he will seek a second term. Edwards already has said
he's thinking about another bid and other candidates from 1987 are
believed to be looking at the 1991 race.
   ``I need to do a lot of things,'' Roemer said. ``Fundamental
changes are so important for this state to survive that if I feel a
year, a year and a half from now that to finish the job, I've got
to stay, then I'm going to ask the voters to keep me. But I never
want to make that desire to be paramount in my mind and in the
actions that take place here.''
   Voters on Oct. 17 approved a major part of the tax package, a
$1.4 billion highway improvement program funded by a 4-cent
increase in gasoline taxes, but Roemer said it's too early to
decide on a third attempt at fiscal revision.
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander ``called me and told me
that it took the second year of his second term to get it done,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, Roemer said, he will concentrate on selling Louisiana
to new industry and spend less time in the step-by-step legislative
process. ``That's not what I do best, but I had to do it.
   ``It's time to put that to rest for a while and let me be
governor. Let me represent this state, sell the state, move people
in terms of the feelings about the state. I'm enjoying this part of
my term.''
   Roemer also is modifying his approach to dealing with
legislators. A former state representative, P.J. Mills, was brought
in as chief of staff and several members of the staff have departed
_ voluntarily and involuntarily.
   ``The more `we' I can put into this and the less `me' I can put
into this, the more better off we are,'' he said, adding that his
future dealings with the Legislature would be ``a little less
confrontational. We don't have to win every fight, we don't even
have to fight every fight.''
   Alario is reserving judgment. ``What he says he's going to do
and what he does often doesn't come out the same way.''

<HEAD>Robert Mitchum Back as Gumshoe in Private Eye Spoof</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Misquote of poem in graf 19, bgn, `Doing a ..., is CQ; note
correct quote in 22nd graf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can tell the old, retired, slightly rundown
gumshoe is back on the job. He offers his younger brother, an
ex-cop, a pint of Levy's Select Irish Whiskey to help out. ``House
brand,'' he explains.
   So it goes for Robert Mitchum in ``Jake Spanner, Private Eye.''
But his new movie, airing Nov. 15 on the USA Network, is not the
``Farewell My Lovely'' or ``The Big Sleep'' kind of classic Mitchum
detective movie.
   ``This is a complete charade,'' Mitchum says of this cable
venture, which co-stars his brother, John, as the ex-cop; a son,
Jim, as a cop, and Ernest Borgnine as retired mobster Sal ``The
Salami'' Piccolo.
   The film, he reports, includes one scene ``with a bunch of naked
girls around the pool. I think it's all done very discreetly.''
   Students of the cinema may consider ``Spanner'' close in spoof
spirit to Mitchum's ``His Kind of Woman.'' That 1951 epic makes one
suspect that, during filming, the cast partook of strong drink and
had fun.
   ``I don't remember what it was all about,'' Mitchum insists. He
does recall the fun part. And that producer Howard Hughes made the
cast film it twice, the idea being to make a good film a great one.
That was no fun, he says.
   Mitchum, whose more recent work includes the two ABC
mega-miniseries, ``War and Remembrance'' and ``Winds of War,'' has
a dry, sardonic sense of humor befitting a star who has logged 46
years in movies and TV movies.
   Now 72, he has been around and about. His early days dossier
includes ditch-digging; a shot at boxing; assistant to the
astrologer Carroll Righter; the Long Beach Theatre Guild, and
writing for radio.
   That should prepare a man for anything, particularly writing
scripts where the producers, he recalls, ``would say `we need 17
pages by Wednesday,' and they wouldn't say 17 pages of what.''
   He laughs when asked if he ever feels he could write a better
script than many offered him. ``Well, I've just shown the attitude
that Johnny Huston had. He said, `If they want 'em bad, kid, we can
make 'em bad, too.'''
   Fortuneatly, his first substantial role, one that got him an
Oscar nomination in 1945, was in a good movie. He played the
war-weary infantry captain in ``The Story of G.I. Joe,'' a film
based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning column by war correspondent Ernie
Pyle.
   His first insubstantial roles were in 1943, in ``Hopalong
Cassidy'' movies. He had no trepidations about becoming an actor
then, he says, only about getting his horse to go forward and to
stop:
   ``I didn't know how to ride a horse, really. As a matter of
fact, I didn't know if you were supposed to bring your own horse.''
   Mitchum's plain, sleepy-eyed, unpretentious style often has won
acclaim, that usually occurring when he likes the movie he's in.
   Away from the cameras, he avoids the Hollywood ramble. He is a
private man. He packs a tight suitcase, odd but nice in an era when
it takes a two-by-four to stop a star from talking about his or her
personal life.
   It is known, however, that Mitchum has played guitar and likes
jazz guitarists such as Barney Kessel. But he quit as a player a
long time ago, he says: ``There are too many good ones.''
   He also has written poetry. But again, that's history, he
insists: ``No. I never see anything but the back of a check to sign
now.''
   Still, he likes ``all the coherent poets,'' particularly William
Wordsworth, the English romantic. This sparks a memory of a time a
Wordworth passage even showed up in a film he made with Katharine
Hepburn.
   Doing a fine basso version of her distinctive speech pattern,
Mitchum recalls that, reading the script, she ``comes up and says
`The world is too much with us late ends soon,''' and then demands,
``Who said that?''
   ``I said, `Nobody ever said that.' She said, `What?' I said,
`What the hell's it mean?'''
   They repaired to the studio's library to check the line and its
punctuation, Mitchum recalls. Then, the actor with a rep for
playing tough guys proceeds to surprise his listener by quoting
part of the passage from memory:
   ``The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and
spending, we lay waste our powers ...''

<HEAD>Tax Away Stock Market Volatility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Lee Iacocca's view, the remedy for extreme
stock market volatility might lie more in tax reforms than in
restraints imposed by the exchanges or regulators.
   His suggestion: ``How about a 40 percent tax on assets held less
than 90 days, 28 percent up to two years, 15 percent up to five
years, and after that the tax rate goes to zero?''
   Iacocca expressed his views in a recent speech to magazine
publishers and editors in which he stressed the need for Americans
to take the long-term view in building the economy, the better to
compete with Japan.
   It's crazy, he said, ``but the whole country seems to be in a
short-term feeding frenzy _ make a quick buck and get out, look out
for yourself, live for today. And the hell with the future.''
   The blunt-speaking chairman of Chrysler Corp. said he would also
include a modest tax on huge pension funds, which pay no capital
gains taxes and whose trading practices are sometimes blamed for
volatility.
   Such measures, he suggested, would force Americans to take a
long-term view _ to think as investors rather than traders.
   As importantly, a longer-term view would allow corporate
managers to develop their own long-term thinking, especially
regarding improvements that would strengthen a company but not pay
off immediately, he indicated.
   ``Do you think more companies would be building research and
development centers if they didn't pay a penalty in their stock
price for investing in such long-term assets?'' he asked, adding:
   ``We're upside down in the world by penalizing savings and
investment and ecnouraging borrowing and consumption.''
   He offered two other tax suggestions:
   1. Increase federal revenues with a consumption law, beginning
with gasoline. In fact, he said, ``start moving our whole tax base
more toward consumption. Tap into the underground economy for a
change.''
   2. ``Stop all this (corporate) takeover nonsense by requiring a
stock to be held for six months before its voting rights can be
exercised,'' and in addition eliminate interest deductions on debt
incurred for hostile takeovers.
   Iacocca's attack on short-term thinking was broadly based.
   Educators, he said, were guilty of permitting the highest
functional illiteracy rate in the industrial world. It worries him,
he said, that one of every four Americans ``can't read our damn
ads!''
   He said the short-term view was also a malady of politicians,
``because they're always running for office.'' He observed that
elected officials must always be prepared to answer one question:
``What have you done for me lately?''
   But many of his most penetrating observations were in reference
to Wall Streeters, a ``gang'' that he said were short-termers
almost by definition.
   ``Brokers and analysts make money betting right on what a
company does every 90 days,'' he said. ``Whether that company will
be stronger than ever or bankrupt in three years is almost
irrelevant.''
   Iacocca made his remarks Oct. 23 at a combined meeting of the
Magazine Publishers Association and the Association of Magazine
Editors. Hoping for wider distribution, Chrysler distributed copies
of the speech this week.

   The second-graders fidgeted and giggled
as they filed into Westminster Presbyterian Church and settled into
their desks after being bused three blocks from public school. Arms
shot up as they vied to read a sign taped to the chalkboard: ``Only
kind words are spoken here.''
   The Westwood Elementary School pupils are among thousands of
public school children across the country who receive Bible
instruction during school hours from private groups that conduct
classes off school property.
   Whether in permanent classrooms or in buses or trailers parked
just off school grounds, the classes are a way around the Supreme
Court ban on religious teaching and prayer in the public schools,
said Roger D. Blankenship, executive director of the National
Association for Released Time Christian Education.
   ``It's a marvelous alternative and provides an access for a need
expressed by the American people at large,'' Blankenship said.
   The court, while banning religion in public schools, has upheld
providing off-campus religious instruction during the school day.
   ``When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates
with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public
events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions,''
the court held in a 1952 New York case. ``To hold that it may not
would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that government
show callous indifference to religious groups.''
   Even though released time has been affirmed by the court, the
concept may not be immune to challenge, said Sebastian Graber, an
attorney for the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union who is studying the possibility of filing a lawsuit, although
he has not decided on what grounds.
   ``I wouldn't rule out a general challenge at this time,'' he
said. ``The Supreme Court might be asked to reconsider the issue.''
   But advocates believe they are on firm legal ground. ``In the
'80s, we have been picking up momentum, and in the '90s there will
be tremendous growth if I have anything to do with it,'' said
Blankenship.
   The thousands of children in all grades enrolled in such
programs in 19 states still are only a fraction of the nation's
40.3 million full-time public school students, said Jerry Traister
of Gatlinburg, Tenn., a member of the NARTCE board.
   It's hard to provide an exact figure for released-time
enrollment because many programs ``operate on shoestring and don't
report enrollment because they want to avoid legal challenges,''
Blankenship said. The mere filing of a lawsuit could end the
programs because of the cost of hiring a lawyer.
   Although any religion may provide released-time instruction,
Christian groups have had a virtual monopoly on the practice since
released time began in 1914 in Gary, Ind., with non-denominational
Weekday Religious Education.
   Weekday Religious Education was provided in the public schools
until the practice was banned by the Supreme Court in 1948, when
about 2 million children were participating in WRE programs
nationwide.
   The ruling forced the programs off school grounds, but didn't
temper the fervor of those attempting to provide Bible education.
   ``There were threats of court suits that so many school boards
weakened,'' said Olive I. Clark, coordinator of Weekday Religious
Education in Virginia. ``The programs survived where they were
strongest.''
   She insisted that the programs, usually financed by churches and
individuals, is not a circumvention of the high court's ban, but is
``really the only way you can get to the large population of young
children, about 40 percent of whom have no church connection.''
   Robert S. Riffee, who heads the released-time program in
Nottoway County southwest of Richmond, said the instruction is
important because public schools are giving children humanism,
``keeping God out of the schools.''
   ``We need to have these youngsters exposed to the Bible,'' he
said.
   The 60-year-old Virginia Weekday Religious Education program has
14,000 students, the largest in the nation, Miss Clark said. The
weekly or monthly classes, which usually last 30 minutes to an
hour, must be approved by school boards, and children who
participate need written permission from parents. The classes,
which run through the academic year, are conducted during school
hours because that is when ``we can get such a large percentage of
the children.''
   The age of the students varies with the 13 Virginia localities
that have programs; the participation rate is about 85 percent,
Miss Clark said.
   Whether a community has released time is up to the local school
board, said Jim Fondriat, a spokesman for the Virginia Department
of Education. ``The state does not get involved in this at all.''
   The children in Virginia Wingfield's class at Westminster
Presbyterian are among more than 700 in Waynesboro students who
participate in the program.
   The Waynesboro Council of WRE, which has its own bus to
transport children, offers ``a straightforward presentation of the
Bible,'' biblical history and geography, said Miss Clark, who
directs the program.
   The 55-minute classes generally are held during recess or
physical education class. ``They don't miss any regular
instruction,'' said James W. Nichols, an aide to the Waynesboro
school superintendent, Thomas L. Varner.
   Released-time curricula are as varied as the groups that provide
them.
   While Traister's CBM Ministries stresses memorization of Bible
passages, the Haversham Christian Learning Center in Cornelia, Ga.,
offers ``no biblical studies whatever,'' said Ken Wright, its
director of development.
   The center, 50 yards from Haversham Central High School, offers
a program for teen-agers that builds self-esteem and communication
skills while focusing on preventing pregnancy and suicide and
helping teens get along with parents.
   But ``we don't hesitate to open a class with a prayer,'' said
Wright, who also is a director of the 5-year-old NARTCE.
   Miss Clark dismissed any suggestion that children not enrolled
in released time at schools with high participation are stigmatized.
   Children who stay behind are with their teachers, who provide
enrichment activities, Nichols said. ``There is no evidence of
being stigmatized. There is a lot less of stereotyping of students
by their peers than by parents.''
   But a mother whose 8-year-old son doesn't participate said there
is ``a lot of peer pressure'' to join. ``The classroom teacher
would single my child out. He didn't want to go to school,'' said
the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I don't believe
it belongs during school time.''

   After an aged Indian woman, Bessie Snake,
lost her husband when he and his two mules were killed by lightning
while plowing, his younger brother dutifully married the widow.
   That obligation is part of the religious traditions of the
Delawares and some other tribes, matching a responsibility laid
down in the biblical laws of ancient Judaism.
   ``The similarities of early native American religions and
ancient Hebrew religion are astonishing,'' says historian Duane
Hale of the Creek tribe, a researcher of the American Indian
Institute at the University of Oklahoma.
   He also notes congruent strains with early Christianity, such as
Indian expectations of a Christ-like benefactor and emphasis on
communal sharing of everything in common and on modesty by not
calling attention to oneself.
   ``All American Indians were _ and most are today _ deeply
religious and devoted to their belief in one supreme being,'' Hale
said in an interview. He discounted past charactertizations of some
old tribal rites as pagan.
   ``I don't think it's pagan to go up on a mountain and pray to
try to get a vision,'' he said, describing the ``vision quest'' of
the Sioux and some other tribes. ``It's similar to what the
biblical prophets did.''
   Hale, 47, former co-chairman of the Department of Navajo and
Indian Studies at Navajo Community College in Arizona and now with
the university's institute here, researches and writes tribal
histories.
   Since 1983, he has completed them for six tribes. He also
conducts training workshops to help Indians across the country
learn how to preserve tribal lore. Participants have come from
about 200 of the nation's 300 recognized tribes.
   Thirty-seven of them have tribal headquarters in Oklahoma, which
remained mostly Indian territory until 1907. The university's
Western History Collections library is considered the best existing
on the plains tribes.
   While Indians generally have depended on handing down their
religious traditions orally, ``there's a great danger they will be
lost,'' Hale said. ``In many cases they have been.
   ``There are not enough Indian histories. Many of the elders are
dying, and I try to teach them to write their histories. Some are
beginning to record it and put it in locked files only for the
tribe.''
   While Indian religion sometimes is portrayed as highly distinct
from biblical faith, Hale sees definite resemblances, judging on
the basis of his advanced biblical studies as well as first-hand
inquiries into Indian religion.
   ``Christianity and early Indian religion have been so interwoven
that it is often difficult now to tell which came first for them,''
Hale said. Of 1.4 million U.S. Indians, most are Christians but
many also retain tribal insights, he said.
   The Native American Church, which combines both Christianity and
native religion, stemmed from the ``ghost dance'' religion started
in the 1890s by a Paiute Indian from Nevada, Wewoka, preaching
return of the buffalo and Christ to lift up the downtrodden.
   ``It spread like wildfire,'' Hale said, adding that it uses the
hallucigenic peyote bean ``as a sacrament,'' which also is used in
a ``limited way'' in some other tribal religions.
   He said these also make extensive use of chants, the drum, the
four directions, the circle, the smoked pipe and smoke from burning
cedar waved about by a feather to ward off evil.
   However, religious details vary from tribe to tribe, and often
remain obscure, since there were no reliably balanced accounts of
Indian concepts for the first 100 years of contacts with Europeans,
he said.
   On how he determines what religious elements are originally
Indian, he said: ``I only accept what the elders tell me is true.
Some of it possibly came from back there in the seed of
missionaries to some degree. At this point, nobody knows
absolutely.''
   Yet some biblical-type ideas among Indians seem definitely their
own, such as views of humanity's creation, a great flood, afterlife
and anticipated return of some variously named special teacher _
such as ``Nanaboosh'' or ``Great White Rabbit.''
   ``In Indian religion everything is related to nature,'' Hale
said. ``There's a special relatedness with animals and geographical
features, sacred mountains, sacred rivers, sacred places. Natural
forces are intermeshed with supernatural beliefs.''
   Some Indian religious rituals are confined to the tribe. While
Hale has been allowed in various secret ceremonies beyond his own
tribe, he said, ``There are things you're not going to see nor find
out about on the outside.'' Asked about the secrecy, he said:
``Everything the Indian has shared with the white man has
disappeared. The only way to keep something is keep it within.''
   He emphasized that tribal beliefs focus on a monotheistic God,
called by various names such as the Sioux ``Wakan Tanka'' or
Chickasaw ``Great Manitu,'' names with such meanings as ``Great
Spirit'' or ``He Who Makes Everything.''
   Bessie Snake, the remarried Anadarko, Okla., widow in her
mid-90s, her memories going back to early Indian ways, was quoted
as saying, ``We always knew God and prayed to him.''

<HEAD>Ann Jillian Returns in New Comedy Series</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ann Jillian says her new comedy series for
NBC brings out her motherly instincts.
   Jillian, who has no children, plays the mother of 14-year-old
actress Lisa Rieffel in ``Ann Jillian,'' as the show is called.
   ``She makes me miss having a teen-age daughter,'' she said.
``Our relationship is the whole basis of the show. I've just lost a
husband and she's lost a father and we're very supportive of each
other. It's a comedy, but it's about self-esteem, friendship and
trust. There are a lot of young people in the show, but always the
focus is on that magical relationship between a mother and
daughter.''
   The series marks Jillian's return to regular television after
numerous TV movies and miniseries. In 1985 she underwent a double
mastectomy for breast cancer. Her last series was a brief return to
``It's a Living'' when the former ABC comedy was picked up for
syndication. She starred in NBC's ``Jennifer Slept Here'' in
1983-84, and as a child she was in ``Hazel.''
   Jillian also stars with Tim Matheson in the NBC movie ``Little
White Lies,'' a romantic comedy filmed partially on location in
Rome. Both the movie and premiere of the series were tentatively
set for late November or early December.
   In ``Ann Jillian,'' she plays a recently widowed woman who moves
to a small Northern California town where she and her husband spent
their honeymoon. She takes a job in a Victorian-style shop that
sells coffee, jams, cookies and muffins.
   ``Our dream had been to return to the town,'' she said. ``You
know, with the porch swing and everything. But her husband was
killed on the job as a fireman.''
   She calls ``Little White Lies'' her reintroduction to the
audience before the premiere of ``Ann Jillian.'' Her last movie was
``Original Sin,'' telecast by NBC last February.
   ``This is the first funny thing I've done in years,'' she said.
``The past four or five things I've done have all been dramas. I'm
not complaining. I got three Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe
nominations. I won a Golden Globe for `The Ann Jillian Story.'''
   That movie told of her battle against cancer.
   In ``Little White Lies,'' Jillian plays a policewoman who goes
to Rome on vacation and meets a doctor played by Matheson. However,
each lies to the other and makes up a phony background. She tells
Matheson she's a business executive and he tells her he's a
hospital orderly.
   She wants to keep her identity secret because she thinks men
want to date her so she can fix traffic tickets. He's afraid that
women only want to go out with him because they want to marry a
doctor.
   ``We were in Rome for only three days, so we spent long hours in
front of the camera,'' said Jillian, who was accompanied by her
husband and manager, Andy Murcia. ``We started before dawn each day
and worked until late at night. Andy and I had been there on
vacation a month before so we were able to suggest the best places
to film.''
   Her husband makes his film debut in ``Little White Lies'' as a
loudmouth American tourist.
   ``He plays a patient of Tim's who nearly gives away his phony
identity,'' she said. ``I felt like a stage mother. I wanted to
tell Andy, `Smile, baby.' He hit his marks and was great.
   ``If the movie does well in the ratings we could do some
sequels. The chemistry between Tim and I was wonderful, which you
really need for a romantic comedy. We had to do a lot of kissing
and after a while it became technical just figuring out how to do
it different each time. We had one kissing scene in which the
cinematographer caught a flash of gold light behind us as the sun
sparkled on the Tiber River and the dome of St. Peter's at the
Vatican.''
   Jillian went through some training at the Los Angeles Police
Academy and talked to some women detectives to prepare for her role.
   She also got some pointers from her husband, a former police
sergeant in Chicago.
   ``Andy showed me how to use a gun, although my character doesn't
use one in the picture,'' she said. ``He showed me simple things
like how to flip a badge. I'd come home from filming and talk
police jargon and Andy would laugh. He said: `It's a trade. I'm an
actor now and you're a cop.'''

<HEAD>Robert Redford Uses Star Status in Down-to-Earth Activism</HEAD>

   At Robert Redford's place, even the
senators wear blue jeans.
   For years, this rustic mountain resort was the private hideaway
of Redford the movie star. But now, Redford the environmental
activist has opened it to a high-powered crowd. He's enlisting
politicians, business leaders, scientists and others to help him
find common ground in the polarized landscape of environmental
politics.
   Lured by Redford's fame, they play by Redford's rules: Leave the
stiff collars and rigid ideologies at home; relax and try to see
opponents as at least partly human.
   Redford has long been known as one of Hollywood's premier
do-gooders, using the rugged, casual charm that launched his film
career to call attention to environmental issues.
   But as times change, so does Redford.
   At 52, he has softened the radical edges that marked his early
activism. Since 1983, when he founded the Institute for Resource
Management, he has been more mediator than instigator, drawing
together adversaries in disputes such as Bering Sea oil exploration
and energy development on Navajo lands.
   The normally low-key institute took a higher profile in August
by sponsoring ``Greenhouse Glasnost.'' It was an unusual meeting of
American and Soviet officials, scientists, environmentalists and
entertainers designed to highlight the threat of global warming due
to the greenhouse effect.
   Last month, Redford tackled nuclear energy, bringing together
industry representatives and environmentalists at Sundance to
debate whether the nation's struggling nuclear power industry
should be revived.
   Activism is nothing new to Hollywood, where almost every cause
has its celebrity champion. But Redford, in an interview, explained
that his passion for the environment long preceded his stardom.
   He was 10 years old, recovering from a mild case of polio, when
his mother took him to Yosemite National Park. He was awestruck.
``I said to myself, `That's it _ I want to be a part of that.'
   ``I shifted right then. I spent more time outdoors. I started to
hike. I went to Yosemite to work, and I learned to climb there.''
   His native Los Angeles, booming after World War II, also
affected him.
   ``The air was going bad. The fruit groves were disappearing and
giving way to malls and suburbs. Everybody just came and grabbed
what they could grab and built what they could build. I took that
personally. I wanted out of there.''
   His wanderings took him to Colorado, Europe and New York. But he
knew in 1961 that he had found home when he and his wife, Lola Van
Wagenen, bought two acres in a canyon near Mount Timpanagos. Here,
in the rugged beauty of Utah's Wasatch Range, he could ski some of
the West's finest powder and find the empty, silent spaces he
craved.
   He expanded the homestead as his film career gained speed. After
several successful movies in the late '60s, culminating with
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' he bought nearly the whole
canyon, complete with a rundown ski resort. He named it after his
character in the movie.
   But he soon discovered he couldn't hide from the development
pressures that had forced him from Los Angeles. Highway officials
proposed widening the Provo Canyon road, which passes near
Sundance. Redford campaigned against it, arguing the project would
help only truckers while ruining a peaceful canyon and a popular
trout-fishing stream.
   That local involvement led to environmental battles around the
country. He lent his name to liberal political candidates; he
showed up at scenic rivers and toxic waste sites; he lobbied for
energy-conservation laws.
   In 1975, a consortium of utilities proposed building a
coal-fired power plant on Utah's Kaiparowits Plateau. Redford
researched the project, concluded it was a boondoggle, and jumped
into the fray. The project was shelved, and Redford was burned in
effigy by angry opponents.
   Despite his victories, Redford disliked the contentiousness of
environmental politics and the ``boneheaded arguments'' he heard on
both sides.
   His presence publicized issues, but it also heightened
opposition. ``You were almost canceling yourself out,'' he said.
   He founded the Institute for Resource Management so he could
take a quieter, less inflammatory role.
   It complements another Redford organization also dedicated to
the human factor. His Sundance Institute has sponsored film, dance
and screenwriting workshops at the resort since 1980, helping
independent artists pursue their visions without the pressure to
``go commercial.''
   The IRM works on the premise that nobody, including an
industrialist, wants to destroy the planet. Typically the institute
puts adversaries together in a room for a few days and lets them
seek their own solutions.
   Not all conferences occur at Sundance. One of the institute's
best-known attempts to reach common ground started at sea _ and
nearly sank there.
   It was August 1985, the issue was oil drilling in the Bering
Sea, and Redford thought a pleasure cruise in California's Morro
Bay would ease tensions between the oil executives and
environmentalists who had reluctantly agreed to meet.
   But the adversaries weren't talking, and the boat started
heaving in 9-foot waves. ``Pretty soon everyone was sick,'' Redford
said. ``The image of environmentalists and industry heads throwing
up together was something I won't forget. I also thought it was the
end of our organization.''
   It proved instead to be the human factor he seeks, eroding
participants' reserve. The conference led to an extraordinary
agreement that recommended drilling in some areas and placing
others off-limits.
   Interior Department officials say they adopted many of the
agreement's provisions in their Bering Sea drilling plans _ though
not enough to satisfy Redford, who still contends the agency
``shelved it.''
   Redford manages to avoid the Hollywood penchant for all flash
and little substance, said Frederic Krupp, executive director of
the Environmental Defense Fund, who spoke of the actor-activist's
``vision and hard work.''
   Redford also is gaining some friends in industry. His old
nemesis from the Kaiparowits battle _ Howard Allen, head of
Southern California Edison _ now is chairman of the IRM board.
   ``In recent years,'' Allen said, ``he has developed a cautious
respect for productivity, economic considerations and balance.''
   He's also developing new ways to integrate his film career and
environmental interests. His two institutes collaborated this year
on a documentary, narrated by Redford, about Yosemite. And last
year Redford directed ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' in which poor
New Mexican villagers battle a recreational development. The
villagers win, of course.
   Redford's own development at Sundance aims to complement nature.
Architectural Digest recently praised the resort's attempt to
``echo the canyon's geology'' with rough-hewn siding and old
tree-trunk columns that help the auditorium, lodge and guest
cottages blend into the background.
   Once a year, Redford requires all Sundance employees to drop
their usual tasks and plant a tree. At the global warming
conference, while speeches droned on, Redford sometimes gazed
wistfully out the window at children playing by a pond.
   It was the human factor again.
   ``At the point when people start repeating themselves, or the
same person wants more time on the floor, that's the time to get
out,'' he said. ``That's the time to go plant a tree.''

<HEAD>USDA Report Says General Economy Has Good Vibes for Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improvements in the global economy and a
steadier U.S. dollar are helping boost the outlook for American
farmers in the year ahead, Agriculture Department analysts
Elizabeth Mack and Ralph Monaco say.
   ``Solid foreign growth prospects and only modest changes in the
value of the dollar point to continued moderate export increases,''
they say. ``So, export demand will continue to put some pressure on
U.S. manufacturing capacity, increasing the likelihood that
spending on new plants and equipment will continue.''
   Mack and Monaco, writing in the November issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, said general economic growth ``looks likely to be
mildly supportive of U.S. agriculture'' over the next six to 12
months.
   In their review, the two economists said assessments of the
general economic situation have changed considerably over the last
year, ``shifting progressively'' across three main possibilities:
an inflation spiral similar to that of the late 1970s, an eased
monetary policy induced by recession, and recently a ``decelerating
export growth'' due to the rise in value of the U.S. dollar abroad.
   ``Adroit policymaking and midyear commodity price slides have
eliminated the first two possibilities as probable outcomes over
the coming six months,'' the report said. ``The current expansion
is virtually assured to last well past its seventh birthday (this
month).''
   But economic forecasting is not without pitfalls and
rollercoaster thrills. Consider what has happened in the last
couple of years.
   In early 1988, many economists speculated about rising inflation
and another upward price spiral that could spell trouble in the
months and even years ahead.
   By mid-1988, the report said, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board warned it might be necessary to cool off the economy.
Interest rates began to rise.
   Consumer prices, which rose 1.8 percent in 1986 and 3.6 percent
in 1987, rose 4.1 percent in 1988. And in the first quarter of 1989
overall consumer prices grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent,
while producer prices jumped 10.2 percent.
   ``But food and energy price hikes accounted for most of
inflation's quickend pace,'' the report said. ``Producer prices for
finished food products rose 5.2 percent in 1988, but spurted an
annualized 13.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, perhaps
because of (last year's) drought.''
   Producer prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline and
heating oil jumped at an annual rate of 41 percent in the first
three months of 1989, mainly because of tighter OPEC production
restrictions and global oil mishaps.
   ``Rising interest rates began to take a toll on interest
sensitive components of demand, housing and autos in particular,''
the report said. ``The economy slowed sufficiently that by the
middle of the second quarter of this year, fears of an impending
recession replaced worries over spiraling inflation,'' the report
said.
   With inflation easing, the Fed eased back on monetary policy to
ward off recession, and interest rates came down. A third-quarter
Census Bureau survey of anticipated spending for plants and
equipment suggested continued robust growth.
   ``As inflation and recession fears dissipated during the first
three quarters of 1989, concern began to mount about the rising
value of the dollar,'' the report said. ``By September, the dollar
was up 12 percent from the first of the year.''
   A rising dollar tends to reduce U.S. export volume and increase
imports by raising the prices of goods sold to foreign countries
and reducing prices of items imported by the United States.
   ``While the dollar has gone up throughout 1989, it is still
about 37 percent below its historic peak in 1985,'' the report
said. ``Some analysts associated the recent rise with climbing U.S.
interest rates and relatively slow money growth. With U.S. interest
rates flat or slightly falling, some now expect the dollar's value
to diminish.''
   Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund indicate that while
U.S. dollar movments are likely to be modest over the next few
months, growth in major developed countries ``suggest continued
healthy demand'' for U.S. exports, the report said.
   The IMF forecast put Japan's real economic growth at 4.7 percent
in 1990, West Germany's at 3 percent and Canada's at 2 percent. The
three account for about 40 percent of U.S. exports. Economies of
developing countries, which also accounted for 40 percent of
overall U.S. exports in 1988, are expected to show continued robust
growth.

   Chrysler Corp. once again is facing tough
financial times, but things are different than they were 12 years
ago when Chairman Lee Iacocca sought help in Congress for loan
insurance.
   The company, analysts said Monday, is moving aggressively to cut
its costs and improve profitability, and the next target may be
labor. Chrysler is trying to carve $1 billion from its $26 billion
annual budget and is trimming its salaried work force by about 8
percent, or 2,300 jobs.
   The company is changing its structure, but not key personnel or
their titles. Chrysler Motors Corp., the carmaking arm of the
company, will cease to be on New Year's Day.

<HEAD>Unix Rivals to Step Up Talks on Cooperation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rivals for control of the Unix software standard
say they are expanding discussions on cooperation that could lead
to a healing of the split between them.
   The statement Monday was good news for computer users, who have
been pressing hard for a single Unix standard. Unix is a base layer
of software that makes it possible for programs to run on many
different kinds of computers, the same way compact discs can be
played on many different brands of compact disc players.
   Unix is split now between a group that includes American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the originator of Unix, and a rival camp
whose main members are International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   The split means that programs written for one version of Unix
won't necessarily work with the other version. The latest AT&amp;T
version was released last week, while the one from the rival Open
Software Foundation is due out in late 1990.
   ``What we're trying to do is remove the assumption and
perception that we're all competing with each other,'' David Tory,
the president and chief executive of the Open Software Foundation,
said in a telephone interview.
   ``We genuinely want to converge, both parties, and the industry
wants us to as well,'' Tory said.
   Discussions have been going on for the past year, and if they go
well they may lead to ``something big and dramatic'' around the end
of this year, said AT&amp;T's Michael DeFazio, director of system
software for the company's Unix software operation.
   Even if the talks don't result in a major breakthrough, the two
groups will continue working on areas of cooperation in the area of
open software, DeFazio said.
   IBM, Digital and others formed the Open Software Foundation in
May 1988 out of fear that AT&amp;T was controlling Unix for its own
commercial advantage. AT&amp;T attempted to allay such fears by ceding
control of Unix standards to an independent group called Unix
International, of which it is a member.

   The Pepsi logo will appear in a new Nintendo
video game, making Pepsi-Cola Co. the first soft drink maker to tap
into electronic games for commercial exposure, the companies said.
   Under an agreement announced Monday between Pepsi and Tradewest,
which is licensed to manufacture video games for Nintendo of
America Inc., Pepsi's logo will be featured in Magic Johnson's Fast
Break.
   The professional-style video basketball game, to be released
early next year, is set in an arena packed with cheering fans.
   The Pepsi name appears in the game's opening title sequence and
on signs at courtside. The soft drink maker's logo also is on the
scoreboard shown at the end of each quarter.
   ``Pepsi's identification in the game mirrors the real life
display of logos and banners that adorn athletic venues across the
country,'' said Michael D. Simpson, Pepsi's executive vice
president of marketing and national sales.
   The amount of money Pepsi is paying to be a make-belive game
sponsor was not disclosed.
   Only one other company ever has had its symbol shown in a
Nintendo game. The Racket Attack game used the logo of the Wilson
tennis racket and sporting goods manufacturer.
   The hookup between Pepsi and Nintendo is part of a trend that
has developed as companies search for alternative advertising
outlets.
   ``As traditional advertising mediums become increasingly
cluttered and segmented, advertisers must respond creatively,''
Simpson said.
   The proliferation of commercials on television plus changes in
viewing habits _ including the widespread use of video cassette
recorders and the practice of changing channels to zap past
commercials _ has persuaded advertisers to promote products in new
ways.
   Pepsi has had some experience and success with nontraditional
marketing methods. For instance in 1987, Pepsi placed the first
commercial ever on a home video cassette, putting the Diet Pepsi
``Mustang'' ad was placed on the film ``Top Gun.''
   The beverage giant says video games potentially are a major
marketing medium. It is estimated that nearly 26 percent of U.S.
households will own a video game machine by the end of this year.
   Nintendo's entertainment system that turns a TV set into a game
screen is projected to be in 22 percent of American homes by the
end of this year.
   Nintendo of America, a subsidiary of Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd.,
dominates the U.S. electronic games market. Some of its most
popular titles feature the mustachioed Mario Brothers.
   Pepsi already has a promotional alliance with Nintendo on a $10
million national campaign for the holiday season.
   During the two-month campaign, which began Nov. 1, Pepsi will
give away thousands of Nintendo's newest gadget, the Game Boy
hand-held video game, through contests and sweepstakes. Other
Nintendo and Pepsi products also will be available through the
promotion.

<TEXT>
   Times are tough again for Chrysler Corp., which
has launched a crash diet to shed $1 billion in expenses in 14
months, but the atmosphere that led to concession contracts in the
early 1980s isn't present this time around.
   ``There is a lot of bad news that's coming all at once,''
analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. in New York said
Monday. ``But I think management should be given credit for taking
the initiative for what the market is going to be like in the
1990s.''
   On Jan. 1, Chrysler Motors Corp., the carmaking arm of the
company, will cease to exist as a separate division, spokesman
Steve Harris said Monday. No key personnel or titles will change,
Harris said.
   ``We're merging Chrysler Motors into Chrysler Corp. and the
legal entity of Chrysler Motors goes away,'' Harris said. ``The
move is purely technical, legal and tax-oriented. It will not have
any impact on people or titles and will not change the company's
internal or external operation in any way.''
   Harris declined to say how much tax money the company expects to
save because of the move.
   That news comes on the heels of Chrysler's announcement Friday
that it will stop car production at its Jefferson Avenue assembly
plant in Detroit in February, more than a year earlier than
originally anticipated, will cut one of two shifts at its carmaking
plant in St. Louis and close a parts plant in Wisconsin next year.
   About 4,000 hourly workers will be affected. The consolidation
involves the elimination of the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
subcompact models.
   Within the next year, Chrysler will face increasing competition
for its two most profitable vehicles _ Jeeps and minivans _ and
will deal with lower earnings due to the projected softening in the
North American auto market. And it will sit down at the bargaining
table with the United Auto Workers union.
   On Friday, UAW Vice President Stan Marshall, in charge of the
union's Chrysler Department, sounded an ominous note as the UAW
prepares preliminary work toward negotiations next summer.
   ``This decision is bound to have a detrimental impact on our
future relations,'' Marshall said of Chrysler's announcement
Friday. ``It reinforces the view that the corporation's commitment
to retaining the good faith and loyalty of its workers is sorely
lacking when the going gets tough.''
   While things are tough for Chrysler this year, they aren't the
same as they were a decade ago, when Chairman Lee Iacocca was
haunting the halls of Congress looking for guarantees for millions
of dollars in state and federal loans.
   A dozen years ago, interest rates and gasoline prices were much
higher than now and the Japanese auto invasion was gearing up to
rob U.S. makers of their market share.
   Chrysler had to go to the federal government to guarantee
millions of dollars in loans to keep it afloat. It also went to the
UAW with contracts calling for worker concessions.
   During the 1980s, Chrysler and the UAW agreed to modify work
rules at some plants and to cooperate on everything from factory
floor decisions to those made in the board room.
   In 1990, for the first time in years, the UAW's contracts with
the Big Three expire on the same day, Sept. 14. And an end may be
at hand to the practice of ``pattern bargaining,'' in which the
union targets one company, reaches a contract with it and then
signs similar agreements with the other two, said labor analyst
Dale Brickner.
   ``What you're going to see is contracts tailored to individual
corporations,'' said Brickner, associate director of the School of
Labor and Industrial Relations at Michigan State University in East
Lansing. ``The old theory of pattern bargaining is a dead duck.''
   Marshall says that's bunk.
   ``We just got back to pattern bargaining again and that's
exactly where we'll stay,'' he said Monday. ``Chrysler's profits
are still way up from where they were during the lean time.''
   In the first nine months of 1980, Chrysler lost $1.48 billion;
during the same time this year, it made $717.5 million.
   ``They are getting too worried about their stockholders and not
enough about their workers,'' Marshall said.

<HEAD>Southland To Sell Citgo Stake To Venezuelan Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Southland Corp., the nation's largest
convenience store retailer, says it will step out of the oil
business and realize a more than threefold return on its 6-year-old
investment in Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   Southland, which acquired Citgo in 1983 by issuing $254 million
in stock, sold half of the Tulsa, Okla.-based company in 1986 to
the Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela for
$290 million. On Monday, it announced plans to sell the other half
to the Venezuelan company for $675 million.
   Southland said terms of the agreement had not been completed and
remain subject to an acceptable definitive agreement.
   The sale would give the Dallas-based operator of the 7-Eleven
convenience store chain a boost as it works to continue meeting
huge debt payments resulting from the company's $4.9 billion
leveraged buyout in 1987 that took the company private.
   The deal also would give Venezuela a greater U.S. market share
for its crude oil.
   The transaction would make Citgo the first large U.S. oil
company to be acquired by a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   OPEC members have carried out a campaign of acquiring the
``downstream'' side of the oil business _ refining and distribution
facilities _ in order to guarantee access to industrialized markets
in the face of falling oil prices during the last decade.
   The Citgo purchase comes on the heels of a joint venture formed
last week by Petroleos de Venezuela and Union Oil of California
that includes 50 percent shares of major assets such as Unocal's
Chicago refinery near Lemont, Ill.
   Petroleos de Venezuela also bought Jan. 1 the half-interest in a
Corpus Christi refinery from Champlin Refining that it did not
already own.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia paid $1.28 billion for half of Texaco
Inc.'s refining and marketing operations in 23 Eastern and Gulf
Coast states.
   One of Citgo's principal assets is the nation's eighth-largest
refinery, located in Lake Charles, La., said Southland spokeswoman
Cecilia Stubbs Norwood. The refinery is able to efficiently convert
low-grade crude oil into high octane fuel.
   Citgo, created from the refinery, marketing and transportation
operations of the old Cities Service Co., earned $165.6 million on
$4.1 billion in revenues last year, a 24 percent increase in sales.
In the quarter ended June 30, earnings were $39.2 million on $1.3
billion in sales, compared with $33.9 million on $1.02 billion in
sales in the year-ago quarter.
   Southland, taken private by the founding Thompson family in the
1987 buyout, said in May it would seek ways to cash in on its
interest in Citgo, and the sale price is in the range analysts had
expected. The Venezuelan company has first rights in acquiring
Southland's stake.
   Southland has some large payments coming due on its debt, with
$258 million due Dec. 31 and an additional $250 million due through
next year. Some analysts have questioned Southland's ability to
meet those payments, but the company has disputed those forecasts.
   Southland said it would continue as a prime retailer of Citgo
products.
   In the quarter ended June 30, Southland lost $67.01 million.
   Besides the Lake Charles refinery, Petroleos de Venezuela will
acquire pipelines running from the refinery to Chicago and New
Jersey, 43 oil terminals and access to 300 other terminals
scattered across the U.S.
   Citgo supplies 6 percent of the U.S. aviation fuel market, 5
percent of the lubricant market and 4 percent of service station
sales.
   Venezuela also owns part of four refineries in West Germany, two
in Sweden, one in Belgium, and the huge Isla refinery in Curacao,
capable of processing 300,000 barrels a day.
   Venezuela in 1988 processed about 945,000 barrels a day of
refined oil inside Venezuela, and 630,000 barrels in its overseas
refining operations, placing it among OPEC leaders in refined oil
production.

<HEAD>Congress Gets an Earful on U.S.-Japanese Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While U.S. and Japanese negotiators resumed
talks on how to eliminate structural barriers that have contributed
to the $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, American business
leaders were telling Congress why the talks were needed.
   They told a Senate panel Monday that they are more interested in
opening up Japanese markets than protecting American markets.
   The business leaders also told the Senate Finance Committee's
international trade subcommittee that changes are needed on both
sides of the Pacific to solve the U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance.
   ``Japan's systems for buying and distributing goods are the
biggest obstacle facing U.S. manufacturers who export or do
business in Japan,'' said R.K. Morris, director of international
trade policy for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   He and other witnesses complained about Japan's distribution
system under which firms purchase parts and supplies almost
exclusively from long-term business partners and companies either
make their own supplies or keep tight reins over their suppliers.
   But Morris, who just returned from a monthlong trip to Japan,
added: ``We should not kid ourselves. We cannot expect real help
from the Japanese in reducing their surplus or our deficit unless
we in the United States can demonstrate the very great importance
we attach to constructive change in this area.''
   Mitchell E. Kertzman, speaking for the American Electronics
Association, said, ``We believe the imbalance in commercial
relations between the U.S. and Japan will destroy the international
trading system unless it is effectively addressed.''
   He said U.S. electronics exports to Japan are only $6.3 billion
per year, compared with $26.8 billion of U.S. electronics imports
from Japan.
   He also said there must be changes in this country.
   ``Frankly, it is our hope that our Japanese friends will press
the U.S. government to deal with its own economic problems that
impact the bilateral trading relationship. High among these
problems is the high cost of capital driven by our enormous budget
deficit and our tax system which favors consumption over savings
and investment,'' he added.
   A harder line was taken by Texas oilman and sometime corporate
raider T. Boone Pickens, who called corporate Japan ``a closed
shop.''
   He said the ``most damaging'' structural barrier to free trade
was Japan's ``cartel-like system of interlocking corporate
ownership.''
   Because of that, Pickens claimed, ``a relatively small group of
insiders dictate corporate policy.
   He said his own problem with Koito Manufacturing Co., a Japanese
auto headlight maker, ``is symbolic of the current trade relations
between the United States and Japan.''
   Pickens, known for his often hostile raids on U.S. companies,
has been battling with the management of Koito for representation
on its board. But he has been rebuffed despite his 26 percent stake
in the company.
   ``The entire system of Japan is geared toward the denial of a
meaningful flow of information to shareholders,'' said Pickens.
   Nearly all the day's speakers supported the continuing
structural impediment initiative talks between U.S. and Japanese
representatives.
   The talks, first held Sept. 4 and 5 in Tokyo, are an outgrowth
of a White House decision in May that found Japan, India and Brazil
responsible for restrictive trade and investment practices under
U.S. trade law.
   At the same time, the United States and Japan agreed to discuss
a number of ``structural impediments'' outside the procedures and
timetables of U.S. trade laws.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for
payments to tens of thousands of women injured by the Dalkon
Shield, but one attorney said ``ultimate justice can never be
done'' for victims of the birth control device.
   The high court on Monday rejected a challenge by 650 women to a
$2.5 billion trust for victims of the intrauterine device made by
A.H. Robins Co.
   The fund was established by Richmond-based Robins, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in 1985 amid a flood of claims because of
the Dalkon Shield. The ruling means women injured by the IUD could
begin receiving compensation by next spring.
   It also clears the way for the purchase of Robins by American
Home Products Corp., a New York-based food and drug manufacturer
that agreed to buy Robins for $700 million in stock and to finance
the trust. The deal was conditional on approval of the trust, which
was established as part of Robins' bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   ``Many of these women have been waiting for years for resolution
of their claims,'' said Michael Sheppard, director of claims
resolution for the trust. ``This is a major step forward.''
   An estimated 112,800 women have filed claims with the trust and
42 percent have been paid, Sheppard said. He predicted payments
under Monday's ruling could begin as early as March.
   Marketed in the early 1970s, the Dalkon Shield allegedly caused
infections that brought infertility, spontaneous abortions, pelvic
inflammation and, in some cases, death. Sales of the Dalkon Shield
ended in 1974 but the product wasn't recalled until 1984.
   ``Listen to the misery caused by the Dalkon Shield and you
realize that ultimate justice can never be done, even with a $2.6
billion payout,'' said Guerry R. Thornton Jr., an Atlanta attorney
who represented the Dalkon Shield Victims Association.
   ``Almost all claimants accept the fact that justice is a
relative concept, the greatest good for the largest number.''
   Sharon Lutz, a Detroit lawyer representing 18,000 women who
urged the court to uphold the settlement, said it had been ``a
long, long struggle for a terrible, terrible tragedy, but today's
great news marks the beginning of the end.''
   Robins spokesman Roscoe Puckett Jr. said: ``The company is very
pleased that the way finally has been cleared for consummation of
its reorganization plan.''
   Linda Hightower, director of the Dalkon Shield Victims
Association in Atlanta and one of the women injured by the IUD,
said she was terrified the challenge to the trust set up to
compensate victims would mean more long years of battles.
   ``I had much rather deal with the trust ... than to have direct
dealings with the Robins company,'' Ms. Hightower said. ``They made
it very difficult for the women they injured to get compensation
for their injuries.''
   One dissenting vote was cast in the court's decision to reject
the challenge. Justice Byron R. White voted to grant full review to
those arguments.
   The women who took the case to the Supreme Court contended the
settlement wrongly barred future lawsuits against Robins officials
and others, and maintained the trust fund wasn't large enough.
   Alan B. Morrison, lead lawyer for the claimants challenging the
settlement, said he wouldn't ask the court for a rehearing.
   Early out-of-court settlements with individual women averaged
$50,000, and that had risen to $75,000 before the bankruptcy, said
Douglas Bragg, a Denver lawyer representing some women.
   The higher figure would bring the settlement cost to nearly $5
billion, the lower to more than $3 billion.
   Bradley Post, an attorney representing the challengers, said
nearly half the remaining settlements are likely to average
$100,000.
   Sheppard said the trust has set the end of February as a target
date to send a packet of information and a questionnaire to those
with outstanding claims.
   American Home Products' chairman, John R. Stafford, said he
expected the company to complete its acquisition of Robins by
year's end.

<TEXT>
   Last month's deadly earthquake ripped
the economic heart out of this community by ravaging the Pacific
Garden Mall, but merchants hope to salvage the Christmas shopping
season by moving to tents.
   ``I know that if I'm not open the day after Thanksgiving, I'm
bankrupt,'' mall businesswoman Margaret Wilson told the City
Council last week.
   Hardest hit in this quaint, seaside town 60 miles south of San
Francisco was the mall, a typically eclectic California collection
of about 250 shops.
   They sold everything from rare books to imported coffee beans to
beads as well as many necessities in turn-of-the-century buildings
linked by open-air walkways along a tree-lined street.
   Three people were killed in the mall and several dozen of its
buildings crumpled by the Oct. 17 quake, which registered 7.1 on
the Richter scale, killed 66 people in Northern California and did
$7 billion in damage.
   On Monday, Gov. George Deukmejian signed a temporary
quarter-cent sales tax increase into law to raise a projected $800
million for earthquake relief.
   The hike, which takes effect Dec. 1 and lasts through 1990, adds
to a statewide sales tax of 6 cents on the dollar, higher in some
areas because of local levies.
   The tax rise was part of a package of quake relief legislation,
enacted in a special session of the Legislature, that includes $200
million in assistance from state reserve funds and $150 million in
tax relief.
   Now that they've gotten over the shock of the quake, many Santa
Cruz merchants have put aside competition and banded together.
   With a lot of work and a little luck, they say those hardest hit
by the quake will be able to come up with enough money to lease the
tents and reopen by Thanksgiving weekend.
   Ms. Wilson, owner of the variety store Lily Wong's, is among the
majority of mall merchants who have vowed to rebuild. Her store was
damaged, but can be repaired.
   ``My guess is, it's going to be a cliffhanger every single day
until (the mall itself) opens,'' Ms. Wilson told the City Council.
``But we can do it and it will be open and we will have a Christmas
downtown.''
   The council agreed to donate $20,000 toward rental of three huge
tents, with a total floor space of 20,000 square feet. It would
cost $314,000 to lease the tents for the year the merchants figure
they'll be displaced.
   City officials also are trying to identify other sites that
could be used as retail space, said Ann-Marie Mitroff, a city
spokeswoman.
   Among those is a Bank of America building and a former county
jail, said Ms. Mitroff. The neighboring city of Scotts Valley has
agreed to donate to the merchants a 5,000-square-foot portable
building, she said.
   ``It is crucial the businesses get back on their feet as soon as
possible,'' she said.
   The mall merchants collectively sell about $100 million worth of
merchandise annually and generate about $1 million a year in sales
tax revenue for the city, she said.
   As many as a fourth of the mall's businesses now face the
wrecking ball, if they haven't been torn down already, Ms. Mitroff
said.

<HEAD>World Trade Boomed to $2.7 Trillion in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world traded a record $2.7 trillion worth
of goods last year, with the United States and 19 other industrial
countries accounting for $2 trillion of it, the International
Monetary Fund reported.
   The overall total was an increase of 15 percent over the year
before, a rise only slightly less than the 18 percent increase of
1987. Trade also increased when measured in tonnage instead of
dollars, and it was increasing faster than world output as it has
generally done since the 1970s.
   But a separate study by the fund warned of new restrictions.
   Inclusive figures in the IMF's annual ``Direction of Trade
Statistics Yearbook'' for 1989 were made available on Monday. They
covered 161 countries including China.
   The Soviet Union and some of its allies, which are not members
of the IMF, were handled separately. The fund reported their trade
also increased substantially, after declines or small changes over
the past five years, but they accounted for only 2 percent to 3
percent of the world's commerce.
   West Germany shipped $323 billion worth of goods as the world's
biggest exporter, which it has been since 1986. The United States
showed the biggest increase _ 26.7 percent _ to follow close behind
with $320 billion. Japan was third with $265 billion.
   The United States remained the biggest importer with $460
billion worth, compared with West Germany's $251 billion and
Britain's $189 billion.
   At the other extreme, the fund could not find any exports to
report from Tuvalu, formerly the Ellice Islands in the Pacific.
Tuvalu, with a population of only 8,000, imported $4 million worth.
   Third World countries, especially the rapidly industrializing
countries of Asia, boosted their imports. Taiwan bought $50 billion
worth of foreign goods, up from $35 billion the year before, and
South Korea $51 billion instead of $41 billion. Both were still
selling much more than they bought: Taiwan $60 billion worth and
South Korea $61 billion.
   Africa's trade also increased, but at 10.5 percent it grew more
slowly than in the rest of the world.
   Latin America's trade continued strong growth _ 16 percent for
exports and 15 percent for imports _ though the pace was slower
than in 1987.
   In the Middle East, exports grew by only 3.4 percent as oil
sales levelled off. Middle East imports increased at about the same
pace as the world's: 15.3 percent.
   The share of the Third World as a whole in global trade
increased to more than 26 percent but did not reach the levels of
the earlier 1980s, when it accounted for almost a third.

<HEAD>Pickens Demands Increase in Koito Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas-based oilman T. Boone Pickens is demanding
that Koito Manufacturing Co., in which he is the largest
shareholder, pay an increased dividend for the first half of fiscal
1989, Koito said Tuesday.
   In a letter received by Koito Monday, Pickens demanded that it
increase its dividend to 7 yen per share from the current 5 yen,
Koito spokesman Shinji Hagiwara said.
   He said Koito would notify Pickens of its decision after a
meeting of company executives on Nov. 21.
   Pickens, known for his often hostile raids on U.S. companies,
has been battling the management of Koito, a Japanese auto parts
maker, for representation on its board.
   He has complained that despite a 26 percent stake in the
company, he has been denied a seat on the board, although Toyota,
the Japanese car maker, has three seats with only 19 percent of the
company's stock.
   In his letter, Pickens said the extra dividend payment would not
go to the Azabu Motors Co. group, from which Pickens bought many of
his shares, Hagiwara said.
   He said Pickens' comments about Azabu were in response to an
earlier inquiry from Koito, which had been concerned that Pickens
would pay the extra dividend to Azabu.
   Koito believes the extra dividend demanded by Pickens is
intended to cover a 1.17 billion yen ($8.2 million) payment to
Koito by Azabu in fines for rapid trading in its stock, said
another Koito official, Mikio Tsuruta.
   ``Although Mr. Pickens said the money wouldn't go back to Azabu,
they are partners, and Azabu admitted that,'' he said. Pickens has
refused to comment on their partnership, he said.
   ``It doesn't seem very wise if our dividend will indirectly help
make up Azabu's loss, does it?'' Tsuruta said.
   The Finance Ministry earlier this year found that Azabu had
violated rules prohibiting rapid resale of shares and ordered it to
turn over the profits gained from its sale of Koito stock to the
company.
   Earlier this year Koito shareholders voted to deny Pickens a
seat on the board. Pickens said in Washington recently that his
difficulty in obtaining management rights in Koito ``is symbolic of
the current trade relations between the United States and Japan.''
   Pickens repeated his assertion that his purchase of Koito stock
was not intended for speculative purposes.
   ``We would never do anything to damage the company,'' said
Pickens, denying that he planned a so-called greenmail campaign, in
which a corporate raider buys a company's stock in hopes the
company will buy the shares back at a higher price.

   Texas Instruments Inc. signed an agreement with the

southern Italy over a period of four years.
   The U.S. electronics manufacturer said that $715 million will be
paid for by Italy's Ministry for Development of the South.
   Officials said the investments will be used for the construction
of a semi-conductor plant at Avezzano, in the Abruzzi region, about
60 miles east of Rome; expansion of two other Italian facilities
located in southern Italy; construction of a research and
development center at Avezzano; and personnel training facilities.
   ``The expansion of operations in Italy will add approximately
1,000 new jobs to the already 2,000 existing in our country,'' said
Roberto Schisano, managing director of Texas Instruments Italy.
   He signed the agreement with Riccardo Misasi, Italian Minister
for Development of the South.
   Texas Instruments will own all facilities.

<HEAD>CFTC Accuses Former Merc Chief of Winking While Brokers `Robbed'
Customers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter is
among character witnesses scheduled to testify for a former Chicago
Mercantile Exchange chairman accused of failing to stop two
employees from bilking investors of thousands of dollars.
   Brian Monieson, head of GNP Commodities Inc. in Chicago, is the
focus of a hearing before a Commodity Futures Trading Commission
administrative law judge considering the regulatory agency's
allegations.
   Although the CFTC does not allege that Monieson himself engaged
in fraud, it contends in an 18-page complaint that from at least
January 1986 until May 1986, ``He did not act in good faith and-or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the fraudulent trade
allocation by'' two GNP brokers.
   Monieson ``refused to see what everyone else could see, and that
was that his customers were being robbed,'' CFTC attorney Patricia
Donahue said in a statement Monday at the start of the seven-day
hearing. But Monieson's attorney, Jerrold Salzman, said the CFTC's
case is flawed, based on ``conjecture, speculation'' and unreliable
evidence.
   Salzman contends his client did not directly supervise the
workers named in the CFTC complaint _ Norman Furlett and Ira
Greenspon _ and he argued that Monieson ``believed in good faith''
that their customer dealings were honest.
   Furlett and Greenspon have since left the company. Their
attorney, James Koch, said the two ``never stole a dime, didn't
defraud any customers.''
   ``We're here today because the CFTC is on a runaway train on the
wrong track,'' he said in his opening statement.
   Monieson, 53, founded GNP in 1972, headed the Mercantile
Exchange from 1983 through 1985 and remained at GNP during that
time.
   Yeutter, who served as Merc president under Monieson, is
expected to make a statement on Monieson's behalf that will be read
into the record at the hearing before George Painter, a CFTC
administrative law judge.
   Yeutter has worked with Monieson ``and has known him for years
and he will offer his testimony as a U.S. citizen who feels very
strongly about something,'' a spokeswoman said.
   Others scheduled to testify for the defense include Robert
Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, who said
recently of Monieson, ``His moral character is above rproach.''
   The CFTC alleges that the brokers at GNP, described by Salzman
as a top clearing member of the Merc and Chicago Board of Trade,
engaged in ``allocated trades'' that defrauded customers of
thousands of dollars.
   The term refers to initiating futures contracts without the
required customer account numbers, then keeping profitable trades
for themselves while sticking customers with the losers.
   ``This is a particularly insidious fraud you have because a
customer can't win'' and doesn't know he's being bilked, Ms.
Donahue told the judge.
   According to the CFTC, Monieson was told several times between
June 1985 and May 1986 that the two brokers were engaging in
fraudulent activity. But he chose to ignore the warnings and did
nothing to stop the brokers' actions, Ms. Donahue said.
   The defense maintains that the allegations of fraud stem from
complaints by a disgruntled lower-rung employee who was fired from
GNP and vowed to seek revenge.
   If found guilty, the three defendants could be permanently
barred from trading and fined hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<TEXT>
   With fanfare more typical of movie or amusement
park openings, Compaq Computer Corp. has introduced two computer
systems it says will revolutionize the industry.
   The Houston-based firm used indoor fireworks, laser lights and
booming synthesizer music Monday to announce Deskpro 486-25 _ a
system touted to be the world's most powerful desktop personal
computer _ and the Systempro personal computer system, said to be
another industry milestone.
   ``Our new product offers true general purpose flexibility ...
meaning it will not become obsolete,'' Compaq President Rod Canion
said.
   ``You could compare it to the IBM PS-2, Model 80, which is a
floor-standing unit,'' he said. ``But the Deskpro 486-25 has more
expansion capability even though it sits on a desk.''
   The Deskpro 486-25 uses an Intel Corp. 486 microprocessor as its
heart and has three times the computing speed of its predecessor,
which used a 386 chip.
   The Systempro, designed for network and multi-user situations,
functions with a high-speed drive array storage system in a tiny
area. It fits under a desk yet has the computing power of
minicomputers that require racks of equipment, according to Compaq.
   ``It's not just a higher horsepower engine, but a new way of
doing things,'' Canion said. ``What we're really doing today is
setting the wheels in motion toward a major fundamental change in
the computer industry.''
   The Compaq announcement came one day before rival computer maker
NCR Corp. unveiled its 486-based personal computer. Unlike Compaq's
Deskpro, however, NCR will use a system similar to the IBM Personal
System-2 line of personal computers.
   NCR also announced that its entire personal computer line would
be sold through Businessland Inc.'s 125 locations worldwide.
   IBM has not introduced a personal computer built on the 486 chip
yet, but it did come out with a card that lets users plug the 486
chip into their existing personal computers.
   The 486 chip is so powerful that it will allow personal
computers to do certain jobs now done by engineering work stations,
minicomputers and even mainframes.
   Compaq detected some minor problems with the chip last month and
informed Intel, which has said it would begin shipping a fixed
version of the chip by the end of this month.
   The uncertainty about the new chip, combined with slowing sales
in the American market, prompted Compaq last week to announce that
its fourth-quarter earnings would be below those of a year ago.
That announcement triggered a 15 percent plunge in the price of
Compaq stock.
   On Monday, however, Compaq's stock jumped 75 cents a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, closing at $89.25.
   The new Deskpro 486 will be offered in three models, ranging in
price from $13,999 to $20,499 with first shipments expected at
Compaq dealers by late December or January.
   The Systempro, also in three versions, ranges from $15,999 to
$25,999, with shipments to begin in December.
   Compaq, founded in 1982, had worldwide sales last year of about
$2 billion.
   The company's phenomenal growth came as it made computers that
followed the IBM standard. Compaq, however, refused to follow IBM
in 1987 when IBM brought out its Personal System-2 line, using a
new data pathway known as Micro Channel.
   Compaq and eight other personal computer makers deny IBM's
assertion that Micro Channel is the way of the future and say they
have found a way to extend the life of the old data pathway, which
they call Extended Industry Standard Architecture, or EISA.

<TEXT>
   In an advertising battle against a
rival cereal maker's health claims about oat bran, Kellogg Co. has
launched a $40-million campaign touting the cholesterol-cutting
powers of psyllium.
   Ads Monday in USA TODAY and U.S. News &amp; World Report, also
scheduled to run in Time and Newsweek magazines, show a red boxing
glove holding a stalk of psyllium grain. ``If you think oat bran is
tough, meet the new champ,'' the caption reads.
   Kellogg is taking a poke at General Mills Inc., which analysts
say has used an emphasis on oat bran to increase its cereal market
share to 27 percent from about 22 percent in the past year.
Kellogg's share has slipped to 38.6 percent from more than 40
percent.
   ``Anything that changes the emphasis from oats is in Kellogg's
best interest due to their under representation in the oat bran
category,'' said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered both Kellogg and
General Mills in September to document the safety of psyllium, a
grain grown primarily in India. An FDA spokesman said the agency is
reviewing Kellogg's response.
   ``We're so confident that (psyllium) is safe that an ad like
this is just natural for us,'' Kellogg spokeswoman Celeste Clark
said. The ads are part of a $40-million campaign for the Heartwise
cereal introduced in August.

   The stock market was lower in early trading
today, pressured by ongoing concern about corporate profitability
in the fourth quarter, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 9.63 points to
2,572.54 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST after a sharp
drop on Monday.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of about 5 to 3
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 583 issues down, 346 up and
517 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.25 million shares.
   Wall Street observers said the stock market's weakness reflected
investor concern about the bleak outlook for corporate profits.
   ``The basic problem is profitability. If we did that poorly in
the third period what's going to happen in the fourth?'' said Larry
Wachtel, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.84 to 183.93.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.78 to 367.90.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.34 points to
2,582.17.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 349 up, 1,185 down and 430 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.48 million shares, against 131.50
million in the previous session.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., suffering from a
continuing slowdown in the financial markets, said today that it
has begun another round of layoffs.
   A source said the layoffs could result in as much as 2 percent
of Shearson's work force being cut in the next few weeks.
   The layoffs, which are expected to affect all departments in the
securities firm, would be the largest on Wall Street this year.
   Shearson notified its 38,500 employees of its decision Monday in
a two-paragraph internal newsletter, said company spokesman Steven
Faigen.
   ``The (layoff) process began yesterday,'' he said.
   Faigen declined to provide details on the layoffs, saying only
that ``several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs in the
next few weeks.
   However, a company source speaking on condition of anonymity
said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the work force, could
be cut.
   Shearson and other securities firms are expected to show a
decline in trading profits this year as a result of the stock
market's plunge of last month and the general pressure on takeover
stocks.
   The wariness of individual investors since the October 1987
stock market crash continues to hurt the securities industry.
Securities firms in New York City alone have cut nearly 18,000 jobs
from a peak of 163,000 two years ago.
   In its internal newsletter, Shearson said the job cuts were
decided after reviewing expenses and in light of an impending move
by a number of its employees to a new office building.
   ``The decision to further reduce expenses of all kinds reflects
the continued slowdown of activity and the recurring overcapacity
in the financial markets,'' the newsletter said.
   ``The steps announced today are designed to improve overall
productivity and ensure that appropriate resources are focused on
the business areas with the highest potential for growth and future
profitability,'' it said.
   Last year, Shearson laid off about 1,200 employees, and since
then, it has trimmed another 300 jobs.
   Shearson, a subsidiary of financial services giant American
Express Co., is the second-largest securities firm in the nation,
behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   For the first three quarters of this year, Shearson earned $106
million, or 98 cents a share, down 3 percent from earnings of $110
million, or $1.05 a share, last year. Revenue rose to $9.6 billion
from $7.6 billion, but expenses also climbed, to $9.4 billion from
$7.5 billion.

<HEAD>Financing Dispute Could Halt Thrift Bailout, Official Warns</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 5th graf, However, in, with official contradicting
Seidman on funds. This also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>

   The federal official in charge of bailing out the
savings and loan industry says he'll soon have to call a halt to
thrift institution rescues unless the administration and Congress
swiftly resolve a politically touchy financing dispute.
   Legislation enacted in August provides $50 billion for closing
or rescuing S&amp;Ls to a new agency, the Resolution Trust Corp. But
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who is
in charge of the RTC, says it needs to temporarily borrow at least
an additional $50 billion, which would be repaid as the agency sold
loans and real estate acquired from failed S&amp;Ls.
   Without the temporary funds, the RTC could raise cash either by
the quick sale of properties once owned by S&amp;Ls _ a move likely to
unsettle already depressed real estate markets _ or it will have to
keep money-losing S&amp;Ls open, adding to the burden on taxpayers, he
said.
   ``We are very close to being out of funds to resolve
institutions without additional funds. This is a matter of weeks,
not months,'' Seidman said after delivering a speech Monday to the
97th annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   However, in Washington, Daniel P. Kearney, president of the
administration board that oversees the RTC, contradicted Seidman.
He told a House Banking panel that the initial $50 billion should
last through next year.
   The bailout agency has handled 33 thrift failures so far, has
another 260 institutions under its control and expects to take over
200 to 300 more in coming months.
   But it is caught in a dispute between the administration, which
wants the additional borrowing kept out of the federal budget
deficit, and congressional Democrats, who would swell the deficit
by tens of billions of dollars, increasing pressure on President
Bush to agree to a tax increase.
   ``That's obviously a hot political question. ... We're kind of
caught in the middle,'' Seidman said.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who as chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee is one of the key legislators pressing for the
S&amp;L borrowing to be ``on budget,'' told 3,600 convention delegates
that Congress and the administration are acting irresponsibly in
avoiding consideration of a tax increase.
   ``We must stop pretending that taxes must not be part of the
debate and start talking about the fairest and most efficient way
to raise revenue,'' he said. ``Everything has to be on the table,
all taxes and all spending.''
   Meanwhile, Seidman questioned whether two provisions of the S&amp;L
law were hurting the industry's long-run prospects. One forces S&amp;Ls
starting July 1991 to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing,
up from 60 percent currently. The other imposes higher deposit
insurance premiums on thrifts compared with commercial banks.
   He said thrifts must be able to diversify to avoid becoming
overly dependent on any one line of business. He said there must be
a ``level playing field'' on deposit insurance premiums.
   In another development, James Barth, chief economist of the
Office of Thrift Supervision, disclosed that S&amp;L industry losses in
the July-September quarter were at least $2.5 billion _ a large
amount, but still the best showing since the industry reported $1.8
billion in red ink in the third quarter of last year.
   That brings losses for the first nine months of 1989 to $9.7
billion, about the same pace as last year's record $13.4 billion
loss.
   Barth also said asset levels and deposit flows in September show
that S&amp;Ls are striving to meet tough new capital standards,
announced Monday and effective Dec. 7, by shrinking their
portfolios rather than by raising new capital.
   In September, thrifts sold $15 billion in assets, up from a
record $13.4 billion in August. Deposit outflows totaled about $9
billion, up from $5.1 billion in August and close to the record
$10.8 billion in January, he said.
   The standards, required by S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted three
months ago, are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to
absorb losses before an institution fails and federal deposit
insurance kicks in.
   The thrift office estimated that 800 of the nation's 2,600
solvent S&amp;Ls, holding about 45 percent of the industry's $1.3
trillion in assets, fall nearly $20 billion short of the new
capital standard.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said Tuesday it has completed its
$3.4 billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,
the film and television production giant.
   The Japanese electronics and records company said its $200
million tender offer for the Hollywood production concern
Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. had also expired, and that about
99.5 percent of that company's shares were either tendered or
promised by the deadline.
   Sony reaffirmed that it intended to name the heads of
Guber-Peters, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, to top posts at Columbia
Pictures.
   Talks were said to be continuing between Sony and leaders of the
Warner Bros. studio over releasing the two producers whose credits
include ``Batman'' from an exclusive five-year contract to makes
moves at Warner.
   Sony completed its tender offer for Columbia stock last week,
and 99.3 percent of its stock was tendered under the $27 a share
offer.
   The second part of the merger was completed Monday, converting
the remaining Columbia shares into the right to receive $27 a share
in cash.

<TEXT>
   Cash-starved Braniff Inc. has suspended all
regular passenger flights, jeopardizing some 1,800 jobs and
angering employees who had stuck with the airline during two
bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``These people that bought Braniff, they need to be put on trial
by Braniff employees and taken out for a public flogging,'' Leo
Bailey, a laid-off customer service agent, said when he heard the
news in Kansas City, Mo.
   In a statement issued at midnight Monday, Braniff said the
action was taken to preserve assets while a reorganization plan is
developed and a sale of the airline is considered.
   There were no immediate reports of passengers being stranded by
the suspension of Braniff's 46 daily passenger flights.
   In Orlando today, Braniff's headquarter offices and ticket
counters were empty and no passengers were seen.
   ``I think the impact is not going to be that severe in that many
people have booked on other airlines. I think the word was out and
people were booking elsewhere,'' said Dave Napoli, assistant
general manager at Kansas City International Airport, where Braniff
had operated 20 daily flights.
   About 30 Braniff planes were parked at the airport this morning,
Napoli said.
   The company advised ticketholders to check if other airlines
would honor the tickets. People who bought tickets with a credit
card were told to consult with the card company, and those who
purchased tickets with cash or a check after Sept. 28 were given a
toll-free number to call for a refund.
   The suspension of flights came as a surprise to many of the
employees who remained with the airline after it filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code Sept. 28 for the second time.
   ``We're all in shock,'' said Jim Hamilton, a Braniff pilot based
in Dallas. ``We were hoping that someone would buy Braniff and want
to run it, but maybe there was nothing left to buy. It's just a
case of complete mismanagement.''
   Braniff didn't address the possibility of layoffs other than to
say employees would be notified of their status, a prospect that
left union officials frustrated.
   ``What a mess,'' said V.O. Delle-Femine, executive director of
the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, upon hearing the news
in Rhode Island.
   ``Ever since the bankruptcy, upper management has given no
response, no answer to the employees of the company,'' said Charlie
Stitz of Gladstone, Mo., a Braniff flight attendant who was called
back to work Nov. 1.
   BIA Acquisitions, an investor group formed by PaineWebber Inc.,
bought Braniff in June for about $100 million and became the
airline's third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Braniff had 4,800 employees when it filed for bankruptcy again
in September. At the time, it said it was cutting the number of
cities served from 36 to 11: San Diego; Los Angeles; San Francisco;
Phoenix; Dallas; Chicago; Kansas City; Orlando; New York; Newark,
N.J., and Washington.
   The airline had a workforce of about 1,800 before the suspension
of service.
   Under a court-administered reorganization plan, the company had
put 46 of its 256 pre-Sept. 28 flights back in the air by Friday,
said Sandy Smith, a spokeswoman at Braniff headquarters in Orlando.
But the effort was doomed by a cash shortage, she said.
   ``We didn't come up with any other alternative financing and
options like that. There just wasn't any more cash,'' Smith said.
   The last flights were arriving at about the time of the
announcement and the planes would remain at their destinations
indefinitely, Smith said.
   Braniff will try to expand its charter service while studying
its options, including sale of the company, said William G. McGee,
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   The airline lost $31.8 million during the first six months of
this year on sales of $293 million.
   On Friday, Braniff laid off about 100 mostly administrative
employees.

   The stock market turned mixed in moderate
trading today after opening lower amid ongoing concern about
corporate profitability and interest rates, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.23 points to
2,583.40 at 11 a.m. EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indictor
was down 9.63 points.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 698 issues down, 527 up and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.74 million shares.
   Wall Street observers said the market's broad-based weakness
reflected investor concern about fourth-quarter corporate profits
after an unexpectedly weak showing in the third period. On Monday,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points, as market
players reacted to third-quarter reports.
   ``The basic problem is profitability. If we did that poorly in
the third period what's going to happen in the fourth?'' said Larry
Wachtel, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``They're also concerned about interest rates,'' added Brad
Weeks, head of equity trading, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Analysts said a decline in short-term interest rates is needed
to revive corporate profitability.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.14 at 184.63.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had lost
0.89 to 367.79.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed in quiet
trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures were mixed and corn was steady at the opening,
with prices getting support from unexpectedly large export figures
from the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   Analysts say selling pressure could build because the
Agriculture Department's crop report, due Thursday, may show larger
than expected corn and soybean crops.
   Wheat prices opened slightly lower. There are reports the Soviet
Union may enter the market soon, which is giving some support to
wheat prices.
   As trading opened, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.04\ a bushel; corn was
a { cent lower to a \ cent higher with December at $2.38 a bushel;
oats were } cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $1.42{ a

<HEAD>Central Newspapers Reports Dip in Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Newspapers Inc., which owns papers
in Indiana and Arizona, today blamed a 12 percent drop in
third-quarter income on tax rate adjustments.
   The newspaper chain founded by Vice President Dan Quayle's
grandfather reported after-tax earnings of $6.5 million during the
third quarter compared with $7.4 million during the same period a
year ago.
   Profit per share came to 24 cents, down from 28 cents during the
third quarter of 1988.
   CNI adjusted its 1989 effective tax rate to 38.9 percent from
35.9 percent to reflect expected timing differences resulting from
an investment in Ponderay Newsprint Co. CNI owns a 13.5 percent
interest in Ponderay.
   Company officers projected that fourth-quarter earnings would be
adversely affected by a $1.3 million pre-tax loss from the
operations of Ponderay Newsprint.
   CNI's third-quarter revenue was $100.8 million, up 2.3 percent
over the $98.5 million a year ago.
   The company also reported a 9.9 percent increase in operating
income to $10.9 million from $9.9 million last year.
   CNI reported revenue of $317.1 million for the first nine fiscal
months ended Sept. 24, up 3.5 percent from the $306.3 million
during the same period of 1988.
   Net income for the first three quarters was $26.3 million, up
15.1 percent over the $22.8 million a year ago. Income per share
was 99 cents compared with 86 cents the year before.
   CNI publishes eight newspapers in Indiana and Arizona, including
the Arizona Republic, The Phoenix Gazette, The Indianapolis Star
and The Indianapolis News.
   The company also publishes the Arizona Business Gazette and, in
Indiana, The Muncie Star, The Muncie Evening Press and The
Vincennes Sun-Commercial.
   CNI sold stock to the public for the first time in September.
   The stock offering had been approved over the summer by
shareholders as part of a recapitalization plan. The Eugene C.
Pulliam Trust, which has had voting control since 1965, permitted
the plan as long as it retained at least 53.77 percent voting power.
   Pulliam, the vice president's grandfather, was publisher of the
two Indianapolis papers. His son, Eugene S. Pulliam, Quayle's
uncle, is the current publisher.

   The market opened weak after Monday's steep drop, then seesawed
through the morning session.
   Wall Street observers said the market bounced back from earlier

ease credit.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on Monday as

   Stocks in London rose Tuesday in slow trading.
Technical factors and less fear of an imminent hike in British
interest rates helped prices.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up
8.6 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,178.2, its session high.
   The key index advanced throughout the session after posting its

and New York's modest rebound before London's close.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished 6.8 points higher at
1,753.8. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.35 points to

<HEAD>EC Members Disagree On Telecommunications Deregulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications ministers of the 12
European Community countries disagreed Tuesday on a proposed plan
to liberalize telecommunications services.
   The ministers could not decide what powers would be reserved for
national communications authorities after the proposal would take
effect at the end of 1992.
   But they agreed to continue working through a committee of
experts, and scheduled a meeting for Dec. 7 at which they hope to
reach a compromise.
   The proposal, made by the European Commission, would enable
private companies to offer many ``value-added'' telecommunications
services that are currently reserved for public telephone
monopolies in some countries.
   That proposal is accompanied by another Commission initiative,
known as the ``open network provision,'' which would require public
telecommunications networks, now in the hands of national
monopolies in most EC countries, to be opened to private companies
for a reasonable fee.
   The Commission proposal on services ran into objections from
France, which wants to reserve for national authorities the right
to decide what services and users would have access to the national
telecommunications grid, according to EC sources.
   Other countries, such as West Germany and Britain, argued that
reserving such powers for national authorities would amount to a
re-regulation of their own, more liberalized markets for
telecommunications services.
   The telecommunications proposals are part of the EC's push to
create a single internal market for goods and services by the end
of 1992.

<HEAD>Former Regulator Says Senators Asked Him to Allow Lincoln Investments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-7, Bob Maynes ... to UPDATE with quotes from
DeConcini spokesman. Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's former chief savings and loan
regulator testified today that four senators asked him in a
closed-door meeting in 1987 to drop a proposed regulation that
would have curtailed risky investments by Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.
   Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, told the House Banking Committee that the request was made
by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and John McCain, R-Ariz., at an April 2, 1987,
meeting in DeConcini's office.
   ``Sen. DeConcini ... said he and the other senators were there
on behalf of their friend at Lincoln Savings ...,'' Gray said. ``He
said that if I withdraw the regulation ... they would get their
friend to make more home loans.''
   ``It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' he testified. ``It was a
quid pro quo. I told Sen. DeConcini I would not withdraw the
regulation.''
   Bob Maynes, a spokesman for DeConcini, said the Arizona senator
and three other senators have consistently taken issue with Gray's
description of the meeting.
   ``There were five people in that room _ Gray and the four
senators,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``and all four
senators have said on the record that Gray is totally and
completely inaccurate.''
   Maynes said a description of the meeting provided subsequently
by William T. Black of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's regional
office in San Francisco supports the senators' accounts of what had
transpired there. Maynes said Black's account of the meeting was
based on a briefing he had been given by Gray.
   The four senators have acknowledged that they received more than
$1.1 million in political contributions raised by Phoenix
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American
Continental Corp., parent company of the Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln.
   The regulation, which was put into effect last summer only as
part of a $157 billion taxpayer bailout of the S&amp;L industry, would
have curtailed Lincoln from continuing to invest federallly insured
deposits in risky real estate ventures.
   As the result of those investments which later turned sour, the
government last April sezied control of Lincoln at an estimated
cost of up to $2 billion to taxpayers for repaying savers whose
federally insured deposits were lost.
   ``Sens. Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn and McCain had evidently
bought off on the scheme when they met with me,'' Gray testified.
``The receipt of very substantial gifts from Charles Keating and
his associates had long since put them in the right frame of mind
to ... embrace the notion that there was somehow a vendetta against
Lincoln'' by regulators.
   ``When enough money flows, it's apparently easier to be
gullible,'' Gray said.
   He recalled that Keating also had hired Alan Greenspan, now
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and then a private economist,
to press his case that Lincoln's investments were sound and argue
against the need for the regulation.
   Gray also outlined how former Treasury Secretary and White House
chief of staff Donald T. Regan orchestrated President Reagan's
appointment of Lee Henkel, a business associate of Keating, to the
bank board.
   ``Charles Keating had finally achieved his wish,'' Gray said.
``Mr. Keating had gotten this far because of his political
influence _ translate that as money _ all the way to and through
the White House .... And with friends like Sens. DeConcini, McCain,
Glenn and Cranston, what was to stop him?''
   Keating also had been scheduled to testify today, but his new
attorney on Monday asked that his appearance be postponed for two
weeks. Today's hearing was the fourth held by the Banking Committee
on why Lincoln was allowed to keep operating for two years after
federal examiners said it was posing a threat to the government's
deposit insurance funds.
   Bank board officials in California recommended on May 1, 1987,
that the government seize Lincoln because of its mounting losses.
Gray, whose term expired two months later, passed the problem on to
his successor, M. Danny Wall, now director of the new Office of
Thrift Supervision in the Treasury Department.
   Lincoln was seized by the bank board in April, nearly two years
after federal examiners first recommended taking it over.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created by Congress to
clean up the thrift mess, filed a $1.1 billion suit in September
against Lincoln, American Continental, Keating and his relatives
alleging fraud and racketeering.
   Wall has acknowledged he met with Keating after taking office
and said he subsequently rejected the recommendation of the board's
regional office in San Francisco to take Lincoln over.
   He has defended the action, saying the San Francisco officials
had enough information to restrict some of Lincoln's activities but
not enough to warrant taking it over without first going through a
lengthy court battle.
   Instead, Wall ordered that supervision of the troubled thrift be
transferred to the board's Washington headquarters while a second
audit was conducted by field examiners from other parts of the
country.
   Members of the second team testified last week their audit was
hampered by directions from Bank Board officials in Washington to
ignore the previous audits and the high salaries that were paid to
Keating and his relatives.

<HEAD>Amended Suit Accuses Northrop of $20 Billion Fraud on B-2 Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp.'s B-2 stealth bomber program
cheated the government out of more than $20 billion, according to a
revised lawsuit filed by one current and five former Northrop
employees.
   The lawsuit exposes ``one of the most massive frauds ever
perpetrated in the defense procurement industry,'' said Herbert
Hafif, attorney for those who filed the suit.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer on Monday unsealed the
65-page suit, which raises the estimate of the alleged fraud from
between $400 million and $1 billion as was estimated in the initial
suit filed in February 1988.
   Northrop ``was doing more than simply mischarging or supplying
false parts or falsifying tests,'' said Hafif.
   The suit says Northrop ``lacked the current historical pricing
data and technical knowhow to develop and build'' the bat-shaped
aircraft, which is designed to elude radar and which made its first
flight last summer.
   Hafif has filed several other suits on behalf of current or
former employees against the aerospace company, whose stock price
has sagged following repeated allegations of wrongdoing and fears
that Congress may cancel the B-2 bomber as too expensive.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said the company had not had
time to study the amended lawsuit. But he said allegations in the
original complaint had never been substantiated, noting that the
government has not intervened in the case, as it is allowed to do
in such ``whistleblower'' suits.
   ``The last time he (Hafif) made an attack on the B-2 program,
the government investigated for eight months and found there was no
basis for intervention,'' Cantafio said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Daniels declined to say if
government lawyers were reconsidering whether to intervene in light
of the new allegations.
   Separately Tuesday, Northrop president and chief executive Kent
Kresa tried to reassure a group of financial analysts in New York
that production of the B-2 was going ahead and that Northrop
remains on firm ground. Kresa noted that a Senate-House conference
committee had authorized production of two B-2s in 1990 and
continued funding for five more in 1991.
   The whistleblower suit enables the plaintiffs to share in treble
damages with the government if it succeeds.
   The suit alleges Northrop originally misrepresented its ability
to undertake the B-2 bomber project in 1980 and subsequently
misrepresented its progress at each level of development of the
plane.
   Northrop originally promised to build 132 B-2s by 1993 for about
$40 billion, but the government now estimates it will cost $70
million if it is completed.
   ``Northrop began to manipulate the information it was
contractually and statutorily obligated to truthfully report ... in
order both to hide technical problems and to continue receiving
payments from the United States,'' the suit said.
   New plaintiffs joining the suit are Eugene Ottaviano, former
manager of the electronic data processing audit department for the
B-2 program, and Richard Croswell, former manager of manufacturing
technology.
   The other plaintiffs are Jean-Francois Truong, a former process
integration manager for the program; engineer Curtis Dane;
strategic analyst Richard Sylvester, and Terrence Schielke, a
former senior audit manager.
   Schielke, the only current Northrop employee, has since been
reassigned as an accountant for the company's van pool program.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
Tuesday in lethargic trading in Europe.
   Gold prices rose sharply.
   Dealers said dollar traders appeared to be marking time in the
absence of new reports on the state of the U.S. economy which could
provide some clues as about the Federal Reserve's next move on
credit policy.
   ``There's no news out, and technically, (the dollar's) not going
anywhere,'' said an economist at a U.S. bank in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.63 Japanese yen from
143.45 yen on Monday. Later in London, the dollar fell 143.45 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5810 from $1.5795 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.8442 West German marks, down from 1.8517;
1.6175 Swiss francs, down from 1.6240; 6.2520 Frenchfrancs, down

Italian lire, down from 1,357.25; and 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1712.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $384.50 a troy ounce, up
from $380.25 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of
$384.00 an ounce from $380.25 late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 an ounce to close at
$381.57.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.26 a troy

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker, FTC Settle Dispute over Iron Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black &amp; Decker Inc. has settled a two-year
dispute with the Federal Trade Commission over the use of safety
claims in advertisements for its automatic shut-off irons.
   Although the ads were pulled shortly after the FTC raised
objections to their use in 1987, Black &amp; Decker until Monday had
refused to accept FTC guidelines restricting the use of private
laboratory claims in product advertisements.
   The conflict revolved around the company's use of an endorsement
from the Michigan-based National Fire Safety Council Inc., which
had given the iron its ``exclusive'' certification of safety after
it was hired by Black &amp; Decker to conduct tests on its product.
   The FTC has questioned the use of such claims in ads because it
believes they give consumers the mistaken impression that the
endorsement is sanctioned by an official agency.
   Black &amp; Decker began using the National Fire Safety Council's
endorsement in 1987, but pulled the advertisement that year after
the FTC raised questions about the council's qualifications and
testing procedures, said Howard E. Geltzer, a spokesman for the
company.
   One of the ads in the campaign said: ``All irons should come
with this seal. Only one does.''
   The ad displayed the safety council seal and a photograph of the
Automatic Shut-Off Iron, which was introduced in 1984 as the first
clothes iron to beep and turn itself off automatically when left on
and unattended for several minutes.
   Geltzer said Black &amp; Decker used the council's endorsement under
the assumption that it was qualified to make such certifications.
   But the FTC suggested that Black &amp; Decker officials knew the
council was not equipped to make fire-safety judgments, and it
accused the appliance manufacturer of using ``false and
misleading'' advertisements.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier to Challenge Compensation Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies should find it easier to
sue in federal court to challenge compensation awards to injured
workers following a Supreme Court decision Tuesday.
   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, allowed an Illinois insurance
company to go to federal court to challenge a worker compensation
award to a Texas man.
   The court said insurers may sue in federal court even though the
employer they insure is based in the same state as the injured
worker _ as long as the insurance company is from another state
than the opposing side.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said federal
law bars such federal lawsuits when insurance companies are sued.
   But the law clearly does not apply when the insurance companies
are doing the suing, Marshall said.
   The distinction may seem incongruous, Marshall said. But, he
added, ``We cannot doubt that Congress meant what it said.''
   The case stems from a compensation claim awarded Larry W. Brewer
for an injury he suffered on April 4, 1986, while working for
Whitmire Line Clearance Inc. in Lamar County, Texas.
   Legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe
Brewer's job, his injuries or the size of the compensation award.
   Northbrook National Insurance Co., based in Illinois, insures
Whitmire for worker compensation claims. The insurance firm went to
federal court in 1987 to challenge the award to Brewer made by the
Texas Industrial Accident Board.
   A federal judge threw out the insurer's suit and the ruling was
upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   At issue was a doctrine called ``diversity jurisdiction'' which
gives federal courts authority to rule on civil disputes when the
opposing sides are from different states.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a lone dissent, said worker
compensation is primarily a matter of local interest with which
federal courts ``have only minimal contact.''
   The case is Northbrook vs. Brewer, 88-995.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart's Quarterly Profit Climbs 29 Percent; Limited's Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The large discount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Tuesday said
its third-quarter profit climbed 29 percent, boosted by strong
sales growth.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. posted a 21 percent gain
in its third-quarter income on a 10 percent increase in sales.
   Wal-Mart, the country's third largest retailer, announced its
after-tax earnings rose to $232.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in
the three months ended Oct. 31 from $180.9 million, or 32 cents a
share, in 1988's third quarter.
   Sales at the stores Wal-Mart operates in 27 states totaled $6.28
billion in the third quarter, up from $4.99 billion a year earlier.
   At the end of the quarter, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer
had 1,347 Wal-Mart stores, 118 Sam's Wholesale Clubs, 14 dot
Discount Drug stores and three Hypermart USA units. Wal-Mart ranks
third in terms of sales after industry leader Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and No.2 K mart Corp.
   David Glass, president and chief executive officer, said
Wal-Mart's third-quarter performance reflects attention to customer
service, disciplined inventory management and merchandising
programs.
   ``We expect the fourth quarter to be highly competitive but
believe our inventory levels, our associates' involvement and
continued efforts at exceeding our customers' expectations will
enable us to meet our goals and objectives,'' Glass said in a news
release.
   For the first nine months of Wal-Mart's financial year, income
rose 26 percent to $650.04 million, or $1.15 a share, from $514.04
million, or 91 cents a share, through three quarters of 1988.
   Nine-month sales amounted to $17.7 billion, up 25 percent from
$14.12 billion during the comparable portion of 1988.
   Separately, Limited said its net income rose to $84.9 million,
or 47 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 28 frm $70.4
million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $1.11
billion from $1.01 billion.
   Leslie H. Waxner, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Limited pursued a cautious strategy during the autumn, keeping
inventories below last year's level, on a square foot basis.
   ``My view was that the general economy was softening and lacked
strong consumer demand,'' Waxner said. ``I believe our third
quarter earnings are a reflection of that conservative inventory
position.''
   He said business in the third quarter ``was focused
conservatively on the quality of sales and profitability.''
   Waxner expressed a more upbeat attitude toward the fourth
quarter, which is a crucial time for retailers.
   ``The current success of our merchandising effort and the
acceptance of our fashion direction gives us more optimism as we
enter the fourth quarter,'' Waxner said.
   Retailers pick up about a third of their annual revenues and a
half or more of their yearly profits in the two-month peak holiday
shopping season.
   For the first nine months of this year, Limited's earnings rose
55 percent to $193.8 million, or $1.07 a share, from $124.99
million, or 69 cents a share, the prior year. Nine-month sales rose
13 percent to $3.07 billion from $2.71 billion.
   Limited is one of the country's leading specialty apparel chains
with 3,120 stores. Stores owned by the Columbus, Ohio-based company
include The Limited, Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret,
Lerner, Lane Bryant and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Rebound Amid Interest Rate Optimism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rallied from a weak opening amid
renewed investor optimism that the Federal Reserve might move to
lower interest rates. Wall Street analysts said the Fed's addition
of reserves to the banking system through customer repurchase
agreements sparked a rise in the bond market that helped boost
stock prices.
   Investors interpreted the Fed activity as an indication that the
next move might involve a cut in the discount rate, the rate the
central bank charges its member banks, traders said.
   The yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell sharply after the
Fed's move. The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks
charge each other for overnight loans, also declined.
   Stock prices opened weak then waffled through the morning
session following the previous day's losses.
   ``It appears that the Fed might be doing a little easing and
that's why the market has rallied,'' said Ralph Bloch, chief market
analyst with the investment firm Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on
what analysts said was a response to unexpectedly weak
third-quarter earnings reports. The bleak outlook for
fourth-quarter corporate profits and interest rates worries had
also helped depress prices, analysts said.
   Last week's better-than-expected unemployment report rekindled
worries that the Fed would not ease credit anytime soon. Investors
hope for a decline in short-term interest rates to revive corporate
profitability, analysts said.
   Analysts also attributed the day's gains to bargain hunting and
technical factors after Monday's steep declines.
   ``We were oversold after yesterday,'' said said L. Crandall
Hays, analyst with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. continued laying off
employees Tuesday in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its
work force by year's end and experts predicted other securities
firms would make similar reductions in coming months due to a
continued slowdown in the financial markets.
   ``It's not a problem just for Shearson; everybody has it,'' said
Perrin Long, who follows the industry for Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. in New York. ``I think we'll be seeing several
cutbacks but in smaller numbers ... to avoid a lot of media

   Shearson and other Wall Street firms, particularly retail
brokerages catering to individual investors, have been under
increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of
rising operating expenses.
   Most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year
due to the stock market's October plunge and the general pressure
on takeover stocks, which had been the driving force behind the
market's earlier advances.
   The lingering wariness of individual investors since the October
1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry.
   ``I wouldn't sit here and wait for his (individual investor's)
imminent return in size,'' said James P. Hanbury, a securities
analyst with Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co. in New York. ``With business
slow and expenses high something's got to give.''
   Total employment by New York Stock Exchange-member brokerages
has fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262,173 employees in
September 1987 to 229,455 by mid-1989. The firms had added about
120,000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash.
   The decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the
growth of revenue. Jeffrey Schaefer, director of research for
Securities Industry Association, an industry trade group, said
overall revenue grew from $50 billion in 1986 to $52 billion last
year. Although revenue rose to $60 billion by mid-1989, it was
expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter, he said.
   Shearson _ second only to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in terms of the
number of U.S. retail brokerage offices _ began laying off some of
its 38,500 employees Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph
newsletter that more across-the-board cuts were planned, said
company spokesman Steven Faigen.
   Shearson cited, among other things, the slowdown of market
activity, which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds
that generates commissions and trading profits.
   Shearson, a subsidiary of financial services giant American
Express Co., earned $106 million, or 98 cents a share, during the
first three months of this year. That was off 3 percent from
earnings of $110 million, or $1.05 a share, last year.
   Faigen declined to provide details on Shearson's layoffs and
said only that ``several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs
in the next few weeks. But a company source speaking on condition
of anonymity said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the total
work force, could be cut. That would be the largest staff reduction
on Wall Street this year.
   A year ago, Shearson laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then
it has trimmed another 300 jobs.
   Other Wall Street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this
past year.
   Last week, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. laid off more than 100
employees in its taxable fixed-income sales division. The firm had
announced earlier this year that it was selling its entire retail
brokerage division of 2,300 workers. Over the past three years it
has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10,000.
   Among the others, First Boston Corp. last spring laid off 200
employees, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has let go dozens of bond traders
and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. laid off about 120 employees,
largely in its municipal bond and stock departments.
   Long said that in addition to gradual cuts, many firms ``are
paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring.''

<HEAD>Lenient Sentences Renew Debate on RICO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lenient sentences in the Princeton-Newport
racketeering case renewed debate Tuesday on whether the
racketeering statute, originally designed to fight organized crime,
should be used in white-collar cases.
   Opponents of the Racketeer and Influenced Organization Act said
the three- and six-month sentences given Monday indicate that the
law, which carries a maximum term of 20 years, was used
inappropriately in the Princeton-Newport case.
   Others said the short sentences were another example of the
disparate treatment between white-collar defendants and defendants
in other crimes.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Carter sentenced to prison five
former officials of Princeton-Newport Partners LP and a former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader who were convicted July 31 in
the first racketeering trial of securities professionals.
   The case drew wide criticism because of the use of the
racketeering law, which allows prosecutors to freeze a defendant's
assets before trial. The statute also allows forfeiture of
ill-gotten gains upon conviction.
   Several defense lawyers who were interviewed Tuesday also said
Carter's sentences were a reflection of recent revisions in Justice
Department rules governing the use of the racketeering law.
   The changes included restricting the use of tax violations, on
which the Princeton-Newport case was based, in bringing
racketeering charges.
   ``I think the sentences reflect that these kinds of cases are
not appropriate for RICO and it was wrong to use the statute in the
first place,'' said defense attorney Michael Armstrong.
   Armstrong represents Lowell Milken, the brother of former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief Michael Milken, in their
racketeering and fraud case. Much of the same evidence from the
Princeton-Newport case is expected to be introduced at the Milkens'
trial, scheduled for March 1990.
   The Princeton-Newport case involved a series of prearranged
stock transactions between 1984 and 1986. The government alleged
that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to generate
phony tax losses.
   Princeton-Newport, based in Princeton, N.J., and in Newport
Beach, Calif., went out of business after the indictment was
brought in August 1988. Defense lawyers said at the time that the
charges alone destroyed the firm.
   Armstrong said that the financial repercussions of RICO,
including the potential loss of a business, place unfair pressure
on white-collar defendants to try to settle the charges through a
plea bargain.
   ``It's been used by certain prosecutors in the last few years as
a blackjack to threaten people involved in perfectly normal kinds
of disputes with the extreme racketeering penalties that the statue
provided even before trial,'' he said. ``So you had people who
feared the unknown of an extreme penalty pleading guilty to avoid
it even though in their own minds they hadn't done anything wrong.''
   Michael Goldsmith, a law professor at Brigham Young University,
called Carter's sentences ``an outrage.''
   ``I believe that his handling of this case will become a classic
example in law books of disparate treatment between white-collar
defendants and street crime defendants,'' said Goldsmith, who also
serves as vice chairman of the American Bar Association's Criminal
Justice Section RICO Committee.
   He said the new policies of the Justice Department were simply
an effort to impose high-level control over the types of cases
brought under RICO, something he said government officials had been
doing all along.
   ``The key point is that it is true that RICO was written
primarily with organized crime in mind,'' he said. ``However, the
legislative record is clear that Congress also intended to strike
at long-term systemic white-collar crime.''
   Harvey Goldschmid, a securities law professor at Columbia
University Law School, played down the importance of the
Princeton-Newport sentences.
   ``The sentences obviously reflects some sense of this group
suffering a great deal,'' Goldschmid said. ``If I were on Wall
Street, given the special circumstances here, I wouldn't take great
comfort in the prospect that this, the relatively lenient
sentences, will occur too often in the future.''

<HEAD>Drexel Unveils New Junk-Bond Index, Says Market Is `Cyclical'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the prime booster
of the junk bond market, unveiled a new index Tuesday to track the
performance of these high-yield securities and said improvement in
this troubled market may be near.
   ``About the time that everyone declares the high-yield market is
dead it will rebound,'' said John F. Sorte, a Drexel executive vice
president. ``This is a cyclical business.''
   Drexel said its new high-yield index will track the performance
of about 700 junk bond issues, or about two-thirds of the $200
billion in outstanding junk bonds. It replaces a narrower junk bond
index that monitored 110 issues.
   The new index, which Drexel said is the result of months of
research, should provide a much broader and clearer picture of the
prices of junk-bond issues, which often are difficult to track due
to the thin trading in this market.
   Unlike high-yield indexes compiled by some other investment
houses, Drexel's index will track actual price changes of all the
bonds it follows. The prices will be provided by traders who deal
in these issues. The so-called matrix indexes compiled by some
other Wall Street companies use the prices of a few benchmark bonds
to calculate the overall market's performance.
   The monthly Drexel index tracks total return on junk bonds,
which includes any price changes plus interest payments.
   Drexel said the growth of the junk bond market in recent years
prompted it to devise the new index, which includes the newer
variations in high-yield bonds, such as deferred-interest bonds,
interest-reset bonds and zero coupon bonds.
   High-yield bonds are those rated below investment grade by the
credit rating agencies. They typically are issued by small
companies or those lacking a credit history. They also are used to
raise money for leveraged buyouts, in which a group buying a
company pledges as collateral the company's assets.
   Since they carry a higher risk of default than investment-grade
bonds, junk bonds yield more interest.
   While saying reports of the death of the junk bond market are
premature, Sorte told reporters the leveraged buyout business that
fueled the issuance of high-yield debt should remain slow for the
foreseeable future.
   The LBO market was sent in a tailspin when several large, highly
publicized deals began to come apart earlier this year. Some
junk-bond issuers, such as Canadian retailer Campeau Corp. and Merv
Griffin's Resorts International, said they would have trouble
paying interest on their junk bonds, raising questions about the
viability of the high-yield market.
   Sorte said two factors have crimped the LBO business: The cost
of raising funds has risen, due to the junk bond troubles, and
investors in these deals are demanding that they involve less debt.

   The dollar weakened Tuesday against all major
currencies, reflecting concern that U.S. interest rates are heading
lower.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, rose sharply here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $386.20 a troy ounce, up $4.70 from Monday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$384.75 an ounce, up $4.50 from Monday.
   Currency traders said worries that the Federal Reserve might be
easing its credit policies, in the face of recent evidence showing
an economic slowdown, depressed the dollar's value but supported
gold prices.
   ``The dollar's upside position is very limited under that
scenario,'' said Ronald H. Holzer, chief dealer for Harris Trust &amp;
Co. in Chicago.
   He said traders were paying particular attention to the federal
funds rate, which is the interest on overnight loans between banks
and a rate over which the Fed has some control. Fed funds traded at
8{ percent late Tuesday, down from 8 11-16 percent late Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed up at 143.63 Japanese yen from 143.45 yen
Monday. It traded at 143.45 yen in London, and at 142.95 yen in New
York, down from 143.85 yen.
   The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling
rose to $1.5810 from $1.5795 in London late Monday, and to $1.5865
in New York from $1.5765 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
quotes, included: 1.8430 West German marks, down from 1.85325;
1.6165 Swiss francs, down from 1.6245; 6.2470 French francs, down
from 6.2820; 1,348.00 Italian lire, down from 1,356.50; and 1.17125
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17075.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday, included:
1.8442 West German marks, down from 1.8517; 1.6175 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6240; 6.2520 French francs, down from 6.2805; 2.0820
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910; 1,349.00 Italian lire, down from
1,357.25; and 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $384.50 an ounce, up from
$380.25 Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $384.00 an ounce from
$380.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 an ounce to close at
$381.57.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.265 a troy ounce, up from $5.238
late Monday. Silver rose in London to $5.26 an ounce from $5.25.

   Oil futures prices finished mixed Tuesday in
quiet trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
closed down 8 cents at $20.02 a 42-gallon barrel. The January
contract ended at $19.79 a barrel, unchanged from Monday.
   Refined products traded on the exchange finished mixed.
   Analysts said the market focused on buying heating oil contracts
and selling gasoline futures.
   No. 2 heating oil for December delivery gained 0.17 cent to
59.83 cents a gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline for
December dropped 0.05 cent to 52.41 cents a gallon. Contracts for
later delivery were higher for both markets.
   The price changes marked a flip-flop from Monday, when heating
oil fell and gasoline rose.
   Peter Beutel, energy analyst for Elders Futures Inc., said
heating oil has gained consistently against gasoline in the last
months but reversed directions on Monday because of selling in
heating oil to gain profits.
   He said there were no outside factors moving the oil futures
markets Tuesday.

   The stock market rallied Tuesday amid renewed
investor optimism that the Federal Reserve might move to lower
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished 14.96 points
higher at 2,597.13 after a sharp loss on Monday.
   Wall Street observers said the Fed's addition of reserves to the
banking system through customer repurchase agreements sparked a
rise in the bond market that helped boost stock prices.
   Investors interpreted the Fed's action as evidence that the next
move could be an easing of the discount rate, said Michael Metz,
equities analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. The discount rate is the
interest the central bank charges its member banks.
   ``Investors were in the mood to listen to favorable rumors and
seized on this as a rationalization to nibble a bit,'' said Metz,
adding that such an interest rate move by the Fed was unlikely.
   Investors hope for a decline in short-term interest rates to
revive sagging corporate profitability in the fourth quarter,
analysts said. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
47.34 points on what analysts said was a response to unexpectedly
weak third-quarter earnings reports and a bleak near-term outlook.
   The yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell sharply after the
Fed's move, reflecting bond investors' optimism about a rate cut.
The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge each
other for overnight loans, also declined.
   ``We finally got the turn that we needed to stimulate the stock
market,'' said L. Crandall Hays, analyst with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.
   Stock prices opened weak then seesawed through the morning
session following the previous day's losses.
   Analysts also attributed Tuesday's gains to bargain hunting and
technical factors after Monday's steep declines.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 9 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
813 issues up, 662 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.00 million
shares, up from 135.48 million on Monday.
   Analysts said that program trading, a computerized form of
buying and selling large blocks of stocks, has remained a factor in
price movements but did not cause wide price swings in the last two
sessions.
   ``Program trading is there, but it's not gotten as volatile, as
whippy, as before,'' said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst for the
investment firm Raymond, James &amp; Associates.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 191.458 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, stock markets overall rose by $14.420
billion, or 0.44 percent, in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.97 to 185.74.
   Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, Tosco rose 7\
to 25[ on reports that several companies had expressed an interest
in buying the company or its refinery in northern California.
Philip Morris climbed [ to 40~; Chrysler gained [ to 20; and IBM
rose } to 97].
   Chemical Bank, meanwhile, lost [ to 31[; BankAmerica declined ]

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.54 to 381.39, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index climbed 2.20 to 334.81.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market ended
1.38 higher at 449.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 368.51, down 0.17.

<HEAD>Sugar Prices Soar As Demand Outstrips Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices climbed sharply Tuesday on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as demand continues to outstrip
supplies on the world market.
   On other markets, copper and precious metals futures surged,
pork and livestock futures gained, energy futures were mostly
higher and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Sugar futures settled .22 cent to .50 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in January at 14.40 cents a pound.
   The market continued to show concern over the availability of
Brazilian sugar despite the announcement Tuesday by government
officials that Brazil will honor 492,000 metric tons of export
contracts.
   Adding to the surge in prices was the sale of a large block of
sugar to Cuba, said Erik Dunlaevy, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine
Corp. in New York.
   He said the sale to Cuba, a sugar exporting country, was to help
that country fulfill supply contracts with China and Japan.
   ``The supply situation tightened up substantially overnight,''
Dunlaevy said, adding that market is living on a hand-to-mouth
basis.
   ``The market is set,'' he said. ``Whenever someone buys a large
amount of sugar, the market will go higher, then drift until the
next purchase, when the market will go up again.''
   Reports that miners at Codelco's Chile operations will vote to
strike this week sent copper prices up sharply on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Analyst Jim Steel of Refco Inc. in New York noted that the
market was ready for a price surge because of the steep decline in
copper prices in recent weeks. The falloff was due to the
settlement of strike last month in British Columbia.
   The problems at the Codelco mine are due to a restructuring of
management, which also is limiting the influence of the unions,
Steel said.
   December copper rallied to a session high of $1.1290 a pound
before profit taking pushed back to a close of $1.1115 for a gain
of 1.55 cents.
   Precious metals prices climbed on the Comex as the dollar
slumped.
   Gold settled $4.60 to $4.70 higher with November at $386.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to 2.9 cents an ounce higher with
November at $5.265 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork bellies were up the daily trading limit on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with gains fueled by orders from
commission houses and short covering.
   The buying was supported by projections of firm fresh belly
prices. The surge in pork bellies prices spilled over to live hog
futures, which were also helped by strong cash prices at terminal
markets.
   Steady to higher prices at feed cattle sales help lift livestock
futures prices.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent higher with December at
74.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent higher
with November at 83.05 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent to .73
cent higher with December at 48.32 a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.53 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 61.55 cents a
pound.
   Oil futures prices finished mixed in quiet trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, as the market focused on buying heating
oil contracts and selling gasoline futures.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 8 cents lower
with December at $20.02 a barrel; heating oil was .17 to .55 cents
higher with December at 59.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with December at 52.41 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in modest trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 2} cents higher with December at
$4.05\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at
$2.38 a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at
$1.43{ a bushel; and soybeans were \ cent lower to 3{ cents higher
with November at $5.64\ a bushel.

   A Senate subcommittee voted 7-6 Tuesday to
impose strict new controls on auto exhaust pollution, but opponents
and supporters agreed the issue will be fought over again.
   The provision, similar in its initial stages to one approved by
a House subcommittee, was passed over the objections of the auto
industry and the Bush administration, who contended consumers would
pay an extra $500 a car as a result.
   An initial set of reductions would begin with 1993 models,
making all cars meet standards required in California, currently
more stringent than those in force elsewhere. By 2003, an
additional 50 percent cut in emissions of major pollutants would be
required.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the subcommittee, disputed
the $500 figure, equating the cost of pollution reductions in the
next century to the purchase of ``a nice new hubcap.''
   The ranking Republican, Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island,
said the panel should have deferred action until it studied his
plan to let automakers choose how to reduce harmful emissions early
in the 21st Century.
   Chafee, backed by the administration, said the auto companies
should be able to choose between cutting tailpipe emissions or
building cars that could run on fuels that burn cleaner than
gasoline.
   ``We ought to look at oil companies'' to produce cleaner fuels,
Chafee said. ``Why should they be let off the hook in doing
something on clean air?''
   Baucus, chief sponsor of the subcommittee legislation, said he
could support a clean fuels amendment, but only in addition to the
second round of tailpipe reductions.
   He said a committee hearing on the issue would be held Nov. 20,
but a fast-track committee schedule would force the next arguments
onto the Senate floor.
   The 7-6 vote Tuesday was a straight party-line split that
reflected the Democratic control of the subcommittee. This would
likely dissolve on the floor, where the line would be drawn between
supporters and opponents of the auto industry.
   Building cars to run on other fuels is a major feature of
President Bush's clean air proposals, which did not propose new
exhaust pollution reductions.
   The Senate bill's pollution reduction requirements for
non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would
be tougher than those in the major clean air legislation approved
by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in that they would
start taking effect a year earlier.
   Also, the House bill would go beyond the California standards to
requirements resembling the Senate provisions only if a study found
such a course feasible, necessary and cost-effective. The Senate
measure contains no such ``second look.''
   The House provisions were the product of a major agreement
designed to remain that chamber's position at least through
conference committee negotiations expected next year.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman and a
backer of environmental groups and Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.,
committee chairman and a friend of the auto industry, negotiated
the pact to end a decade of feuding that stalled progress on clean
air legislation.
   William Rosenberg, the Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for air programs, said ``it makes a lot of
sense'' to let automakers choose the method of reducing motor
vehicle pollution in the next century.
   He said Chafee's clean fuels alternative _ which was not
formally introduced _ would become effective starting in 1995,
eight years sooner than the Senate bill's second round of
reductions. He argued that automakers could save consumers $7
billion by choosing clean-burning fuels over additional tailpipe
reductions.

<HEAD>Van de Kamp Allows Consolidation of American's Northern California
Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Stores Co., awaiting final word on
whether the merger of its Lucky and Alpha Beta markets violates
antitrust law, said Tuesday it had worked out a deal to sell 13 of
its 36 Alpha Beta stores in Northern California and merge the others
with Lucky operations.
   American and the state attorney general's office also agreed that
if the attorney general wins the antitrust case, any additional
divestitures by American in Northern California will be limited to
$1 million a week in sales.
   That could amount to as many as seven or eight more stores,
depending on how much business they do, Deputy Attorney General Chet
Horn said.
   Most of the 550 Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarkets are in Southern
California, and the divestiture of the 13 stores, combined with
earlier divestitures, essentially settles the anti-trust case in the
northern part of the state, Horn said.
   ``Clearly the bulk of the problem was in the south,'' Horn said.
   He said that in the Napa market area in Northern California,
American also agreed to open no new stores for three years. They
already have two stores there now, Horn said.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp contends that the $2.5
billion merger would cost shoppers $400 million a year, and has
taken his suit seeking to block it to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
has yet to rule on the case.
   In the meantime, a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles prevents American from going ahead
with the merger.
   American Stores, in a release from its headquarters in Salt Lake
City, said it had worked out a deal with Van de Kamp to allow the
sale of 13 stores in Contra Costa, Monterey, San Mateo, Santa Clara
and Alameda counties to other supermarket operators.
   The remaining stores north of Kern, San Luis Obispo and San
Bernardino counties will be integrated into Lucky operations.

   The U.S. Postal Service is about to begin
testing peel-and-stick postage stamps in 15 cities, but buyers will
have to pay extra for the convenience.
   Eighteen of the 25-cent stamps will be sold in a sheet that folds
into a booklet. The price will be $5, 50 cents more than the face
value of the stamps.
   ``It is expected to appeal to consumers willing to pay extra for
a deluxe product,'' the Postal Service said in announcing the test
marketing program.
   The stamp, which displays artwork of an eagle and shield, will go
on sale for the first time Friday at a stamp show in Virginia Beach.
Va.
   The 30-day test period will follow, with sales in Atlanta,
Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Denver, Houston,
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, Phoenix and St. Louis.
   Collectors may order the stamps from the agency's Philatelic
Sales Division, Washington, D.C., 20265-9997.
   It will be the second self-adhesive stamp offered by the postal
service. A self-sticking Christmas stamp was issued in 1974, but
problems were encountered with the glue. Postal officials say they
believe they have solved those problems.
   ``Market research indicated that consumers place a high value on
the new features we are offering and feel it is appropriate to
charge extra for them,'' said Assistant Postmaster General Gordon C.
Morison.
   ``By selling the new product in 15 major cities and soliciting
consumer responses, we will be able to make a sound decision about
future production for national distribution,'' he said.
   Postal officials say the new stamps will not become stuck
together in humid weather, and the glue will act slowly enough to
allow them to be repositioned on envelopes.
   In addition, the adhesive is water soluble, so that after use the
stamps may be soaked off envelopes by collectors.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Major Creditors Two Weeks To Reach Compromise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys in the Hunt bankruptcy reorganization
case say they're not sure they can meet a federal bankruptcy judge's
order that a settlement be reached or the assets will be liquidated.
   Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson on Monday cited the continuing
drain on the estate of ex-billionaire William Herbert Hunt, in
announcing he would convert the case from a Chapter 11
reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Nov. 20.
   The ruling gives major creditors just two weeks to work out a
compromise that they have failed to reach since the oilman and son
of the late H.L. Hunt filed for bankruptcy in September 1988.
   ``We were happy the judge gave us two weeks to fix it. He could
have just converted it today,'' said Stephen McCartin of Gardere &amp;
Wynne, Hunt's attorney.
   Other attorneys weren't so optimistic, saying privately that they
doubted the gap between two major creditors in the case could be
bridged in such a short time.
   If it is converted to Chapter 7, the remaining assets of Hunt's
once vast estate would be sold off rapidly, with most of the
proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service, the largest creditor
in the case with a claim of $300 million in back taxes.
   The judge also said the continued litigation facing the estate
was drying up what few proceeds remained.
   ``The court cannot continue to sit by idly while this
continues,'' Judge Abramson said.
   Under bankruptcy procedures, creditors and the debtor file
reorganization plans and try to reach a consensus on repayment of
debt. Plans have been filed by Hunt and three major creditors. But
the judge said Monday that none of the reorganization plans before
him were confirmable.
   The ruling has no impact on Herbert's brother, Nelson Bunker
Hunt, who also sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11
last year.
   Herbert Hunt, who was on hand with his wife, Nancy, to hear the
decision, has assets currently valued at $125 million to satisfy
debts of nearly $900 million, bankruptcy court filings show.
   A Chapter 7 liquidation of Herbert Hunt's estate would reap $60
million to $70 million, or roughly half the $125 million that would
be divided among creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   Hundreds of smaller creditors would get nothing if the estate is
liquidated under Chapter 7, attorneys involved in the case say.
   ``I am quite disappointed. I think this is a disaster for the
unsecured creditors,'' said Claude D. Montgomery, attorney for the
bankruptcy trustee in the Hunt International Resources Corp. case.
   ``The stuff in this estate is incredibly illiquid,'' said Thomas
O. Gorman, an attorney representing Minpeco S.A., a major creditor
in the case. ``It just depends on whether they have to sell it all
tomorrow.''
   The ruling was prompted by the ongoing dispute between Minpeco, a
mining concern owned by the Peruvian government, and Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co., a New York bank that has a $36 million claim in
the case.
   Manufacturers Hanover says its claim should have priority over a
$132 million judgment Minpeco is trying to collect from the two Hunt
brothers. The judgment, which has swelled to more than $250 million
with interest and attorneys fees, stems from the Hunt's silver
conspiracy case.

<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with House approving bill to create
a congressional panel to investigate Eastern strike; No pickup; ADDS byline;
A shorter version moved on general newswires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House gave final congressional approval
Tuesday to legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate
the 8-month-old strike against Eastern Airlines, a measure the Bush
administration has threatened to veto.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, is a watered-down version of
organized labor's initial attempt to get Congress to demand that
President Bush intervene in the strike, something the president
refused to do when the walkout began March 4.
   The idea for a four-member congressional panel was substituted
for the initial bill demanding that Bush use his power to halt the
strike and name an emergency board to settle the dispute. In
refusing to intervene in March, Bush said the dispute should be
settled by Eastern's unions and management and that emergency
situations justifying intervention did not exist.
   A month ago, the administration, in a statement issued by the
Office of Management and Budget, threatened to veto the legislation
creating the commission, which was approved by the Senate last week.
OMB said Tuesday that position had not changed.
   Labor urged Bush to reconsider.
   ``The House now joins the Senate in an action long overdue,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement. ``We urge the
president to quickly sign this bill into law. For the president to
do otherwise would strip the administration of any pretense of
fairness in this dispute.''
   In a separate development, Eastern again asked a federal
bankruptcy court to extend its exclusive right to submit a proposed
reorganization plan and its deadline for detailing how that plan
would work.
   Eastern filed a motion Monday asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland to extend the exclusivity period for its reorganization
plan by 60 days to Jan. 12. During that period, other parties to the
case cannot file reorganization proposals for Eastern under Chapter
11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.
   The Miami-based airline also requested a 30-day extension, to
Dec. 13, of the deadline for filing its disclosure statement, which
is designed to provide details of how it intends to emerge from
bankruptcy. Eastern, which was struck by its pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants on March 4 in an ongoing walkout, has hired
replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier.
   Lifland has not yet set a date for considering Eastern's
requests, airline spokesman Robin Matell said Tuesday from Miami. He
said the requests were motivated by the size and complexity of
Eastern's bankruptcy proceeding.
   Lifland previously had granted Eastern two extensions of its
exclusivity period and one deferred deadline for filing the
disclosure statement.
   Under the bill passed by the House, a Democrat and a Republican
from the House and one each from the Senate would be appointed by
their respective party leaders in Congress to the commission, which
would make recommendations on how to settle the strike and on
maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry. The panel also
would make recommendations on how to protect employee collective
bargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving airlines.
   The report would be due 45 days after enactment.
   Its recommendations, should they include presidential
intervention, would not be binding on Bush but could lead to
additional legislation.
   The unions have contended that Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo, Eastern's owner, has siphoned Eastern cash and assets for
the parent company and wants to use bankruptcy to kill the unions,
as he did when Texas Air bought Continental Airlines, which emerged
from bankruptcy protection as a non-union carrier.
   Texas Air has said concessions by Eastern's union workers were
necessary for it to remain competitive.
   In another development, a meeting of the Eastern creditors'
committee scheduled for Tuesday in New York was canceled.
   Adam Harris, an attorney representing the creditors' panel, was
not immediately available to explain why the session was called off.
   Eastern's creditors have been studying the company's revised
reorganization plan, drawn up after attempts to sell its Latin
American routes to American Airlines fell through. The creditors'
committee had been scheduled to vote on the revised plan on Tuesday.
   Sources close to the situation said late last month that
creditors were near agreement on accepting Eastern's revised plan,
after the committee dropped plans to develop alternatives to the
company's proposal.

   Donald H. White will retire as president and
chief operating officer of Hughes Aircraft Co. on Dec. 1 and will
not be replaced immediately, the company announced Tuesday.
   Malcolm R. Currie, Hughes chairman and chief executive since June
1988, said White's duties will be assumed by the executive committee.
   Hughes spokesman Ray Silvius said White, 58, will eventually be
replaced, but for now Currie will rely on the company's three
executive vice presidents.
   The company, a General Motors Corp. unit, is in the middle of a
six-month streamlining that includes the layoffs of 6,000, or 8
percent, of its 75,000 workers. The program is designed to prepare
for tighter federal defense budgets.
   White, a former Northrop Corp. and IBM executive, joined Hughes
in 1974 as vice president and controller and assumed his current
duties in 1983. He will ``pursue longstanding personal plans,''
Hughes said.
   During his time with the company, annual sales grew from $1
billion to $7 billion per year.

   One co-founder of Carolco Pictures Inc. has

   Carolco announced a definitive agreement Tuesday in which Mario
Kassar, who holds 36 percent of Carolco, will buy out Andrew Vajna,
who also holds 36 percent. Kassar will become the sole chairman of
the company upon completion of the deal, expected by the end of the

   Kassar previously had been reported to be negotiating for Vajna's
stake.
   The company didn't reveal the terms of the buyout. Carolco has
nearly 30 million shares of stock outstanding, which would make
Vajna's holdings worth more than $100 million.
   Carolco rose 25 cents a share to close at $10.12{ on Tuesday in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Kassar and Vajna had been partners in Carolco for nearly 14
years. Officials said Vajna had tired of his heavy day-to-day duties.

   Datapoint Corp. shareholder Martin S. Ackerman
said Tuesday he is terminating his consent solicitation in a bid to
oust company chairman Asher B. Edelman and his board of directors.
   ``We are pleased by the broad based support received from many
independent Datapoint shareholders,'' Ackerman said in a statement.
``At this point, we have terminated our consent solicitation and are
reviewing all our options which include continuing to seek relief in
the federal and Delaware courts.''
   Ackerman and Edelman have been battling in state court in
Delaware and federal court in New York.
   Representatives of Datapoint did not immediately return telephone
calls Tuesday.
   In his statement, Ackerman said he received consents to replace
Edelman that represent about 31 percent of the outstanding Datapoint
shares. Edelman controls about 40 percent of Datapoint stock.
   Ackerman has challenged Edelman's purchase in September of about
30 percent of the company's stock. Ackerman said that purchase made
it ``virtually impossible'' for his consent solicitation to succeed
without judicial relief.
   Datapoint, meanwhile, has claimed Ackerman launched his
stockholder solicitation without filing disclosures required by
federal law.
   The consent solicitation had to be complete within 60 days of
Ackerman's original consent on Sept. 7.
   Ackerman blamed Edelman for Datapoint financial problems.
   In Securities and Exchange Commission documents he claimed that
since Edelman took control of Datapoint in 1985 its stock value has
declined about 58 percent during a period in which the Standard &amp;
Poors Composite Index increased 81 percent.

<HEAD>Honeywell ``Well Under Way'' in Sale of Defense and Marine Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. confirmed Tuesday what most
analysts had concluded in July when the company announced a sweeping
restructuring: Its weapons business is for sale.
   Chairman James Renier also said the company will further reduce
its stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese controls maker.
   In July, Honeywell said it would retreat from its $1.4 billion
weapons business to focus on automated building controls and space
and aviation contracts. But Renier didn't confirm until Tuesday at a
meeting with financial analysts in New York that the
Minneapolis-based company's Defense and Marine Systems division is
for sale.
   Chief Financial Officer Christopher Steffen said the selling
process is ``well under way.'' If the unit can't be sold, Steffen
said, Honeywell will consider a spin-off or joint venture.
   ``At this point, based on the level of interest expressed in the
business, we expect to sell Defense and Marine Systems,'' he said.
``We expect the sale will generate substantial proceeds that will
directly benefit shareholders.''
   He did not disclose potential buyers or estimate when a deal
could be completed.
   Honeywell stock closed Tuesday at $80.25 a share, down 25 cents
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Weapon sales last year represented about 20 percent of
Honeywell's $7.1 billion in revenue. When the unit is pared, the
overall percentage of Honeywell sales derived from U.S. government
contracting will be less than 20 percent.
   Renier said the sale of the weapons business is based on ``a more
difficult procurement environment.''
   On Oct. 24, Honeywell announced the sale of 16 percent of its
equity ownership in Yamatake-Honeywell for $280 million. On Tuesday,
the company said it is negotiating a second sale, most likely a 9
percent stake. That would leave Honeywell with a 25 percent holding
_ still the largest Yamatake-Honeywell shareholder.
   Honeywell's restructuring, which included the reduction of 4,000
jobs, is designed to make the company less attractive to corporate
raiders.

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. said Tuesday it had reached a
$30 million settlement in 20 class action civil suits filed after a
January 1988 diesel fuel spill in the Monongahela and Ohio rivers.
   Under the proposed settlement, which received preliminary
approval Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Ashland will receive credit
for about $14 million it has paid or agreed to pay to settle claims
by businesses, individuals and several states.
   An additional $6.2 million will be paid to defray costs of
administering the settlement, attorneys' fees and to provide for
compensation for claims of certain parties whose water service was
cut off for one or more days.
   The balance of the funds will be used to satisfy qualifying new
claims, wage losses, business interruption and property damage, the
company said.
   Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., was fined $2.25 million earlier
this year for negligence in the Jan. 2, 1988, spill, which
threatened to disrupt drinking water supplies for more than a
million people in three states.
   About 700,000 gallons of oil entered the Monongahela River, which
flows into the Ohio, when a tank at Ashland's Floreffe Terminal, 25
miles south of Pittsburgh, ruptured. Both rivers are sources of
drinking water.
   Authorities blamed the accident on a dime-sized flaw in the
tank's World War II-era steel.
   Ashland Chairman John R. Hall said the settlement was agreed upon
by all parties to avoid expensive and protracted litigation.
   ``The settlement will be substantially covered by insurance and
will not impact the company's earnings,'' Hall said. ``This action
essentially concludes all outstanding litigation associated with the
spill.''
   Once it receives final court approval, all claims will be
reviewed by a settlement administration committee consisting of a
representative of Ashland and a representative of the plaintiffs.

<TEXT>
   A United Technologies Corp. division and
Tulsa-based Nordam will make a noise-reduction system for Boeing
Co.'s 737-200 aircraft engines under a contract that ultimately
could be worth more than $2 billion, officials said Tuesday.
   Nordam's 1,200 employees manufacture bonded composite military
shelters, commercial aircraft interiors and noise suppression ``hush
kits'' for McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s DC-8 aircraft.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, the United Technologies subsidiary, makes 90
percent of the engines that power the 1,000 737-200 aircraft used by
the nation's commercial airlines.
   The noise-reduction devices are expected to cost $2.5 million to
$3 million per engine.
   Nordam officials said a final design for the hush kits for Pratt
&amp; Whitney's JT8D engine will be selected in May 1990, with
certification expected by the FAA in late 1991.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney will be the program's technical director. Nordam
will hold the FAA's Supplemental Type Certificate and related parts
manufacturing authority for the system.
   Nordam will manufacture all parts of the hush kit except
modifications to the engine itself, which will be done by Pratt &amp;
Whitney, said Peggy Kay, a P&amp;W spokeswoman in Hartford, Conn.
   Nordam says it is the world's largest privately held,
FAA-approved repair station for bonded composite structures. The
19-year-old company had 1988 sales of $100 million.
   ``There may be several other (commercial noise suppression)
efforts out there, but we don't think they will be cost effective,''
Ms. Kay said. ``Nordam has shown us that their technical ability
certainly meets our needs and they have the manufacturing facilities
to produce these under our technical direction.''

   Karl D. Bays, chairman of Whitman Corp.
and former chairman of Baxter International Inc., died from a heart
attack he suffered upon his return from a business trip to Europe.
   Bays, who died Monday at Lake Forest Hospital in this northern
Chicago suburb, was 55.
   At Whitman, formerly IC Industries, Bays masterminded the sale of
the company's 3,000-mile Illinois Central railroad, which helped

   Chicago-based Whitman owns Pet Inc., a specialty foods operation;
Pepsi Cola General Bottlers; Hussmann Corp., a producer of
refrigeration and environmental control systems; and Midas

<HEAD>Commodore Reports $6.5 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodore International Ltd. on Tuesday
reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of $6.5 million, which it
blamed on a decrease in demand for the company's computers.
   The loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 translated into 20 cents
per share on sales of $165.3 million, compared with a profit of $9.6
million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $200.2 million in the same
quarter a year ago.
   Irving Gould, chairman and chief executive, cited a drop in sales
of the C64 computer group. Despite the softer computer market,
demand for the company's Amiga 500 personal computers increased,
Commodore said.
   ``We are encouraged by the performance of the Amiga 500 and our
professional products,'' Gould said. ``For the current Christmas
quarter, we are aggressively increasing advertising and marketing to
help stimulate growth in all our markets worldwide.''
