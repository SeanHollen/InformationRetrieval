   Miss Ohio won the talent competition
and Miss Missouri won the swimsuit contest in the first preliminary
competition of the Miss America Pageant on Tuesday.
   Kristin Huffman, 24, sang a classical vocal piece titled
``Csardas'' to win the talent contest. She performed in a tomato-red
sheath trimmed in gold sequins and a flowing red train, and carried
a sequined mask trimmed in red ostrich feathers.
   Miss Huffman, a olive-eyed blonde from Canal Winchester, Ohio,
hopes to perform at the concert level and teach voice at a college.
   She said her performance was magnified because her parents _ both
singers _ were in the audience.
   ``I felt good vibes from them,'' she said.
   Miss Huffman said she knew she performed well because ``the heat
was coming off me.''
   She graduated from Northwestern University with a masters in
music. For 21 years, she has performed with her family's
professional singing group for community, business and church groups.
   She has also assisted in special musical educational programs for
the mentally handicapped and founded a singing group called
``Friends &amp; Neighbors.''
   Miss Huffman, however, said the preliminary win does not
guarantee her the crown. ``I don't plan on relaxing,'' she said.
``This is only the beginning.''
   In the swimsuit competition, Debbye Turner, a 5-foot-7{,
118-pound University of Missouri senior, won in a canary yellow
swimsuit.
   Miss Turner, 23, from Mexico, Mo., hopes to become a veterinarian
specializing in small animal internal medicine. She works out by
swimming and weight lifting.
   After winning, she said all she could think about while walking
down the runway were the five cookies she had for dinner. ``I was
hungry,'' she said. ``I don't believe in starving.''
   Miss Turner said she was probably ``a little smaller'' three
months ago when she won her state pageant, but had still worked hard
to maintain her shape for the national competition.
   ``Being on stage in a swimsuit does motivate one not to have a
tummy,'' she said.
   Tuesday's competition was the first of three nights of swimsuit,
talent and evening gown rounds. The winners of the preliminary
evening gown competitions are kept secret to heighten the suspense
for the finals.
   The three preliminary competitions for the 51 contestants are the
first steps to the live televised Miss America Pageant on Saturday.
On Friday night, the contestants participate in the famous Miss
America Parade on the resort's Boardwalk.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will compete to succeed
Miss America 1989 Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   After the three preliminary nights, the total scores will
determine the finalists, and those 10 then start over again Saturday
night.
   In the final night's judging before a new panel of celebrity
judges, talent counts for 40 percent, evening gown for 15 percent
and swimsuit for 15 percent. The interview with the preliminary
judges is carried over from earlier in the week to count for 30
percent of the score.
   The 63rd annual pageant will be broadcast live on NBC at 10 p.m.
EDT Saturday. Gary Collins and Miss America 1971 Phyllis George
Brown will host.

<HEAD>The Gentleman Politician Who Wants to Be Mayor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a city known for its brusqueness, where
officeholders are often loud and brash, David Dinkins comes across
as something of an anomaly: a gentleman politician.
   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, defeated Mayor Edward
I. Koch for the Democratic mayoral nomination on Tuesday, thus
earning a chance to become the city's first black mayor if he can
outpoll Republican Rudolph Giuliani in November.
   He is a cautious and thoughtful politician, a healer and
conciliator and consensus-builder, according to his supporters.
   ``A quiet man who reaches out to people,'' said state Attorney
General Robert Abrams.
   Even opponents, like the contentious Koch, concede that Dinkins
is ``a very decent guy.''
   But they question whether a nice guy can run a city facing a
myriad of difficult problems, stand up to special interests fighting
over its $27 billion budget, and ride herd over its more than
200,000 employees.
   ``He has been careful to the point of timidity and his indecision
sometimes frustrates his colleagues,'' The New York Times said of
Dinkins when it endorsed Koch.
   Dinkins, 62, has been in public life for more than two decades.
Although he says he was ``hopelessly hooked'' on politics from his
first race, he does not have a reputation as being driven or a big
risk-taker.
   ``I've never had the ambition particularly to be the city's first
black mayor,'' he said last year. He announced his decision to run
after forming a committee to examine what was needed for a mayoral
bid _ a step that was derided by some.
   A Trenton, N.J., native, he graduated in 1950 from Howard
University with a mathematics degree. He moved to Harlem in 1951 and
was married two years later.
   He graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1956, got involved in
Democratic politics and was elected to one term in the state
Assembly in 1965.
   He served as city clerk for 10 years until he won the borough
presidency in 1985 on his third attempt.
   The city's highest elected black officeholder, Dinkins has stuck
to his middle-of-the-road approach in the city's often seething
cauldron of racial and ethnic politics.
   He has been outspoken against apartheid in South Africa, yet was
slow to comment on the Tawana Brawley case. When he did he was
critical of her advisers. He also has denounced statements by Louis
Farrakhan as anti-Semitic.
   In a display of independence, he supported Jesse Jackson's 1984
presidential bid when other black leaders backed Walter Mondale.
Jackson returned the favor by coming to New York twice to campaign
for Dinkins.
   One problem that has haunted Dinkins was the four years _ 1968-71
_ when he said he forgot to pay his income taxes.
   He brushes off questions about that now, saying it was an
oversight that he has rectified.
   He chooses instead to talk about his record as borough president
on such issues as housing and homelessness, AIDS services, infant
mortality and education.
   Of average height and with a slight paunch, he exudes confidence
and carries himself in a reserved and dignified manner. He's an avid
tennis player with a mean forehand, even though he's a grandfather.
   ``I've been described as a nice guy, as a gentleman,'' Dinkins
said last February. ``But I'm also an ex-Marine. And I don't intend
for a second to get shoved around in this or any other campaign.''

<TEXT>
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire said
Tuesday it has agreed with creditors and shareholders on major
points of a bankruptcy reorganization plan, but Gov. Judd Gregg said
the state had found a better deal.
   The agreement was reached three days ahead of a deadline set by
the federal bankruptcy court in Manchester for reorganization plans
and for buyout offers from other utilities.
   But Gregg told reporters at a news conference that a deal by
Massachusetts-based New England Electric System was ``a dramatic
improvement'' over proposals by Public Service and Connecticut-based
Northeast Utilities.
   Gregg, who earlier backed the Northeast Utilities plan, said the
New England Electric proposal has the state's ``primary
endorsement.''
   New England Electric said that under its plan, electricity rates
for New Hampshire customers would increase 4.8 percent for each of
the next seven years, regardless of whether the Seabrook nuclear
plant operates.
   The $6.2 billion plant, finished three years ago, is idle for
lack of a federal operating license. Public Service is the plant's
lead owner.
   The Public Service and Northeast Utilities plans call for 5.5
percent increases for seven years, and additional 1.1 percent hikes
for five of those years if Seabrook never operates.
   Northeast Utilities is offering about $1.9 billion for Public
Service, whether or not Seabrook runs; New England Electric's offer
is $2 billion if Seabrook runs, $1.9 billion if it is canceled; and
Public Service valued its new proposal at $2.2 billion.
   Public Service said creditors and investors already accepted the
major points of its proposal, which means its plan could be
implemented much sooner than the other two, which don't have such
approval.
   Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., financial advisers to the
committee that represents Public Service stockholders, said they
agreed to the Public Service plan ``very reluctantly because it's
very painful.'' He said it represented losses of $1 billion to
stockholders and $300 million to bondholders.
   He said the New England Electric plan would inflict another $200
million in losses on investors.
   Northeast spokesman Jeffrey Kotkin declined to compare plans
without seeing details of his competitors' proposals.
   Details of all plans must be submitted to bankruptcy Judge James
Yacos by Friday. Yacos plans hearings on the proposals into
mid-November, and then shareholders and creditors will vote on the
plans.
   Public Service, the state's largest electric utility, filed for
bankruptcy protection in January 1988 under the burden of its 36
percent share of the Seabrook plant.
   Public Service had been unable to agree with creditors,
shareholders and the state on a reorganization plan, and the state
still is holding out.

   The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant was
put on alert Tuesday because state officials feared that an earthen
dam might fail, sending herbicide-contaminated water from a holding
pond into suburban water supplies.
   State health officials said they were concerned more that the
runoff water holding pond contains herbicides than its radiation,
which is ``low but measurable'' and comparable with other water
sources around the state.
   Holding Pond C2 empties into Woman's Creek and from there into
Standley Lake, which provides drinking water for the suburban Denver
communites of Westminster, Thornton and Northglenn.
   Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons, is 16 miles northwest of Denver and is operated for the
Department of Energy by Rockwell International Corp.
   DOE officials had expressed concern about the earthen dam when
heavy rainfall filled the pond to 75 percent of capacity. They asked
the state Department of Health for permission to release some water
without treating it.
   The state Office of Emergency Preparedness, which coincidentally
was holding a drill at Rocky Flats on Tuesday morning, at 10 a.m.
issued an alert, the third-highest level of preparedness for the
facility.
   In a 2:30 p.m. news conference, Colorado dropped its alert after
an inspector for the state engineer's office declared the dam was
sound.
   Health officials denied DOE's request to release the water
without treating it, saying the pond contains the herbicide
atrazine, a possible carcinogen, as well as manganese and sulfide.
   FBI agents and EPA investigators raided the plant earlier this
summer for evidence of illegal dumping of hazardous materials. A
federal grand jury is investigating the matter.

   Three former Hopkinton police dispatchers
will share $1,500 from the town for being told they couldn't write
letters to the editor.
   Lynette Labinger, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
handled the case, said the town agreed Monday to pay each of the
former dispatchers $500 to settle their U.S. District Court lawsuit.
The town also accepted an injunction against barring future letter
writing by police dispatchers, Labinger said.
   The three had drafted a letter to The Westerly Sun last year
complaining about the Town Council's decision to lower their salary
increases.
   They argued they were ``grossly underpaid'' and should earn more
than clerical employees because dispatchers made life-and-death
decisions.
   After a reporter made inquiries about doing an article on the
dispute, Police Chief George Weeden barred the dispatchers from
sending the letter. The ACLU claimed that was a violation of their
free-speech rights.
   ``We're confident we would have prevailed at trial, but this was
a good and easy way to settle it,'' said Town Solicitor Patricia A.
Buckley.

<HEAD>Administration in Talks with Saudis on Leasing Emergency Oil Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is seeking to save
money on U.S. emergency oil reserves by possibly leasing _ rather
than buying _ oil from Saudi Arabia and other major producers,
sources say.
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer expressed his government's
interest in the idea during private talks last Thursday with Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins, although no specific proposals were made
by either side, the sources said.
   The talks with the Saudis and other potential foreign suppliers _
including Norway, Kuwait, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates _
are in a preliminary stage and the United States has made no
decision to shift from the current practice of buying and holding
title to all the oil put into the oil reserve, sources said.
   The main reason for leasing would be to reduce the cost of
filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in 1975
in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo led by Saudi Arabia. Mexico
currently is the exclusive supplier under a sales contract due to
expire Nov. 30 and providing 60,000 barrels a day.
   The oil is held in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and
Texas. Congress earlier this year ordered the Energy Department to
study leasing and to assess interest among foreign suppliers.
   Nazer told Watkins his government was interested in a crude
leasing deal as a way of strengthening Saudi ties to the United
States, which is the largest market for Saudi crude, said the
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They're very interested,'' one source said, adding that leasing
was the first subject raised by Nazer in the meeting at Energy
Department headquarters.
   No details of a possible leasing deal were discussed, and Watkins
told Nazer the next step could be a meeting of the two sides'
technical experts, the source said, adding that senior U.S. and
Saudi officials will pursue the matter further during regularly
scheduled talks in October.
   James Akins, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from
1973-76, said a leasing arrangement would appear to be a good move
for the Bush administration.
   ``From the point of view of the United States it's an
extraordinary good deal,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I
can't see anything wrong with it, although I can't see any greater
economic benefit for the Saudis.''
   Leasing rather than buying additional oil could be cheaper and
could allow the administration to fill the reserve faster. Some
critics have noted that because the nation is importing more of its
daily crude requirements, the strategic reserve's value as an
emergency fallback is diminishing.
   At one point in 1985 the reserve held the equivalent of 115 days'
worth of U.S. oil imports. Now it holds 73 days' worth, even though
the reserve itself has continued to grow.
   The Energy Department has not yet worked out the mechanics of a
possible leasing arrangement, although it is expected that a lease
would allow the United States to take possession of the oil in the
event of an emergency, the source said. A means of setting a
purchase price would be included, too.
   ``We're at the stage of entertaining any bright ideas'' about how
a lease could be structured, said one source.
   Norway also has expressed interest in the leasing idea, although
it has far less unused production capacity that could be activated
for such a supply arrangement than do the Saudis.
   Tore Sandvold, energy counselor at the Norwegian Embassy, said he
discussed leasing with Energy Department officials in August. He
said his government had made no decisions on the matter and ``it's
really just in the question-and-answer stage right now.''
   Mexico has rejected the leasing idea, one U.S. source said, while
Kuwait, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates have indicated an
interest.

was 82.
   Allen teamed with J. Herman Banning of El Reno in 1932 in an
18-day flight from Los Angeles to New York. Both were acclaimed as
aviation pioneers in a Smithsonian Institution exhibition.
   Allen was 17 when he learned to fly at old Tarbutton Field north

<HEAD>Human Activities Harming Wildlife on Federal Preserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife on federal preserves is being harmed
by human activities ranging from military dogfight practice to
waterskiers, congressional investigators reported today.
   Interior Department managers know that secondary uses of refuges
are ``causing direct harm to wildlife,'' General Accounting Office
investigators concluded.
   But they bow to ``intense'' local pressure for more recreation
facilities, or are forced by law to share ownership of the land with
other government agencies or private interests such as those with
drilling rights, the report said.
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, reported on the refuges at
the request of Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the House
Government Operations environment subcommittee and Rep. Gerry E.
Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
environment subcommittee.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior Department,
which manages the preserves, acknowledged the problems in testimony
prepared for a joint hearing of the two committees.
   David Olsen, an assistant director of the wildlife service, said
a review is underway to see whether the management system should be
changed.
   The GAO investigators found that:
   _On the Des Lacs refuge in North Dakota, power boating and
waterskiing have disturbed migratory bird nesting and the broods of
newly hatched chicks. Duck and other bird production is 50 percent
less than it could be.
   _At the Chincoteague refuge in Virginia, off-road vehicles and
thousands of visitors on the beaches are threatening the breeding of
piping plovers, an endangered bird, and reducing other migratory
bird populations.
   _At the Cabeza Prieta refuge in Arizona, military air exercises
including air-to-air missile firings are believed to be harming the
desert bighorn sheep and the endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope.
The military is authorized to conduct the exercises.
   _Livestock grazing at the Browns Park refuge in Colorado is
hampering efforts to improve goose and duck production, disturbing
the nesting birds and destroying plant growth necessary to provide
optional nesting habitats.
   _Drilling for new gas wells and operating existing wells at the
D'Arbonne refuge in Louisiana is destroying the habitat of
endangered red cockaded woodpeckers and other wildlife. A federal
judge has permitted the continued drilling.
   With federal law requiring that refuge use be compatible with
wildlife protection, Olsen said, ``The issue of compatibility
determinations will receive a lot of attention'' in the government
review.
   He said activities such as waterskiing on the Des Lacs refuse
``would clearly seem incompatible. However, it is an historic use of
the area, one which the local public has come to expect, and is
therefore extremely hard to curtail or eliminate, as you might
imagine.''
   He said the proximity of certain refuges to urban areas ``leads
inevitably to pressure'' for picnic grounds, camping facilities,
beaches, boat ramps, baseball fields, target ranges and other forms
of recreation.
   ``Once any of these forms of non-wildlife oriented public use
becomes established, it often increases and becomes difficult to
terminate,'' he said.
   The GAO report concluded, after conducting a survey of refuges,
that managers ``reported that secondary uses are occurring'' on 92
percent of all refuges, and ``include all manner of public, economic
and military activities'' such as power boating, mining, military
air exercises, and use of off-road vehicles.
   Managers told the GAO they were ``sometimes willing to accept the
adverse effects of some harmful activities as the price of obtaining
the good will of the local public or various economic interests.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly a decade of progress on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test by female and minority youngsters stalled during the
last school year. The nation's top education official termed the
results ``disheartening.''
   Statistics presented by The College Board on Monday show a
widening race and gender gap among the 1,088,223 high school
students who took the SAT in 1989:
   _ White students in the high school class of 1989 gained 2 points
on their combined SAT scores to 937, and now average 200 points
higher than blacks whose math-verbal scores were unchanged from the
previous year at 737;
   _ Women's combined scores dipped 2 points to 875. Male
test-takers averaged 934, 1 point higher than a year earlier.
   For all students, SAT averages showed little change for the
fourth consecutive year. Average verbal scores dropped a point to
427 from 1988; math scores were unchanged at 476, for a combined 903.
   The combined national averages have changed little since 1985
when they hit 906.
   Average composite scores on the ACT Assessment, the college
entrance test that predominates in 28 mostly Midwestern and Western
states, dipped 0.2 point in 1989, to 18.6. Averages on the four-part
exam, assessing English, math, social studies and natural science
skills, are scored on a scale of 1-35.
   The results were ``disheartening at the end of a decade marked by
substantial education reform efforts,'' said U.S. Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos.
   The scores, Cavazos said, pointed to ``an urgent need to
restructure the nation's elementary and secondary schools, to create
intellectual opportunities for all.''
   The SAT, sponsored by The College Board and administered by the
Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., is the predominant
college entrance exam in 22 states. The two-part multiple-choice
test is scored on a scale of 200-800, with a combined 1600 being a
perfect score.
   The ACT, taken by 855,171 high school students during the last
school year, is administered by American College Testing of Iowa
City, Iowa. The organization announced that beginning October,
students will receive 12 scores instead of the current five,
including seven new subscores in specific content areas of English,
math and reading.
   Robert G. Cameron, executive director of research and development
for the College Board, said he was disappointed by the erosion in
average verbal scores. He attributed the decline in part to an
increase in recent years in the number of test-takers whose first
language is not English.
   The latest results also were certain to fuel the perennial debate
over whether the tests are valid predictors of college success, and
whether, as critics insist, the tests are biased against females and
minorities.
   Critics led by the Cambridge, Mass.-based ``FairTest'' say SAT
questions tend to cover subjects that male and affluent test-takers
are more likely to be familiar with.
   College Board president Donald M. Stewart attributed the
continued lag in SAT averages among women and minority students to
inequities in educational opportunities.
   ``College Board research reveals a strong relationship between
the strength of a student's high school preparation and his or her
test scores,'' Stewart said. ``That's why we believe that score
differences among ethnic groups and between men and women reflect
wide disparities in academic preparation _ or lack of it.''
   He nonetheless noted that scores among most minority groups have
been gaining more rapidly than among whites during the 1980s, at
least until this year. Average scores among blacks, for example,
gained 28 points on the SAT's math portion and 21 points on the
verbal since 1979.
   The latest scores ``prove that the College Board and ETS have
failed to address the issue of bias,'' said Bob Schaeffer, co-author
of a newly-published book, ``Standing Up to the SAT.''
   ``The SAT is simply not a level playing field for women and
minorities.'' American Indians suffered the biggest drop among
ethnic groups, averaging a combined 812, down 9 points on the verbal
section and 7 on the math.
   The best gain was by Puerto Ricans, who rose 5 points on the
verbal to 360, and 4 on the math to 406. During the decade, the
group's combined SAT scores have risen 33 points.
   Among other groups, Asian-Americans, the highest scoring ethnic
group, gained a point to 409 on the verbal section, and 3 on the
math to 525.
   Mexican-Americans averaged 2 points better in the math to 430 but
lost a point on the verbal at 381, for a combined 811; among other
students identifying themselves as Hispanic, verbal scores were up 2
to 389, and up 3 to 436 in the math.

<HEAD>Federal Government Criticizes Environmental Group's Anti-Pesticide
Campaign</HEAD>

   Three federal agencies are denouncing an
environmental group's campaign against the use of pesticides on
food, saying it pressures grocers to make regulatory decisions
better left to the government.
   The effort by the National Toxics Campaign ``appears to attempt
to put the onus for pesticide regulation inappropriately on the U.S.
grocery industry,'' said a joint statement by the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the
Agriculture Department.
   The Boston-based environmental group on Monday announced
agreement with a small number of grocery chains to sign a pledge
designed to reduce pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables.
   However, the federal agencies said the government seeks ``to
balance the benefits and risks of pesticides,'' and accused the
environmentalists of ignoring the fact that pesticides rid food
products of diseases that could pose serious health concerns.
   The grocery industry also attacked the effort, saying the
environmental group was ``seeking to create a major crisis of
confidence'' in the nation's food supply. Industry spokesmen accused
the group of trying ``to pit company against company and retailers
against their suppliers.''
   The use of pesticides on food has gained widespread attention
following the uproar earlier this year over Alar, which ultimately
was pulled off the U.S. market by its manufacturer after sales of
apple products plummeted, costing the industry an estimated $100
million.
   Craig Merrilees, director of the environmental group's Consumer
Pesticide Project, expressed surprise at the strong industry and
government reaction, but said the group is enlisting grocers as
allies in the war against pesticides because government regulation
has not done the job.
   ``We've given up on our government's ability to deal with
pesticides,'' said Merrilees.
   The companies that signed the agreement represent fewer than 200
stores in the United States, but Merrilees called their
participation ``a major breakthrough'' in getting supermarkets to
break ranks with most of the industry on the pesticide issue.
   Signing the agreement were four regional U.S. grocery chains and
a large Canadian chain, and Merrilees' group said it hopes to
convince other chains to join. According to industry figures, there
are more than 35,000 supermarkets in the United States.
   Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at the
University of Illinois and persistent critic of the widespread use
of pesticides, maintained there has been a ``virtual total failure
of the regulatory system'' in protecting consumers against
pesticides in foods.
   ``We're now seeing the emergence of market force pressures,''
said Epstein, who participated in the environmental group's news
conference Monday.
   The agreement announced Monday commits the retailers to little
beyond general goals of seeking a reduction in pesticides on foods.
   In the agreement, the grocers pledge to ``request'' growers to
disclose what pesticides were used on produce; to ``actively
encourage'' the phasing out of cancer-causing chemicals on produce
by 1995, and to, ``whenever economically feasible ... carry
certified organic produce and produce certified to contain no
detected pesticide residues.''
   Nevertheless, spokesmen for distributors, processors and
retailers of fruits and vegetables denounced the campaign.
   ``We do not want to be the nation's food police,'' declared Karen
Brown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group
representing more than 1,500 grocery chains and stores.
   ``These organizations are seeking to create a major crisis of
confidence in the food supply ... (and) coerce supermarket retailers
into assuming the job of government,'' said Robert Carey, president
of the Produce Marketing Association.
   The five retail grocery chains that are participating in the
National Toxics Campaign program are: Provigo Inc., the second
largest grocery chain in Canada with more than 1,000 stores; Petrini
Supermarkets, a subsidiary of Provigo, 23 stores in the San
Francisco area; Raley's Supermarkets, 57 stores in the Sacramento,
Calif., area; ABCO Supermarkets, 87 stores in Arizona; and Bread &amp;
Circus, a chain of five natural foods supermarkets in the Boston
area.

<HEAD>Autumnal Gloom: End of the Tomato Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tomato lovers who shop at farm markets or have
backyard patches of their own are nearing the time of autumnal gloom.
   It descends with the first killing frost, and nothing will
suffice until next year. Not tomatoes shipped from Mexico or the
warm southern areas of the United States.
   Soaring tomato prices were a major contributor to a sharp rise in
consumer food costs last winter, says the Agriculture Department.
Retail vegetable prices, which had been expected to ease in the
first quarter of 1989, rose an average of 5.7 percent.
   Much of that increase was blamed on cold weather in Mexico,
Florida and California, which cut supplies of fresh vegetables,
including tomatoes. There was also some lingering effect from last
year's searing drought.
   In the first half of 1989, prices paid to commercial tomato
growers averaged more than $41 per 100 pounds, up from $26 during
the same period of last year.
   A late January freeze in Mexico slowed shipments to U.S.
consumers and boosted retail tomato prices by 48 percent in the
first quarter. A freeze in Florida in late February damaged the
newly planted spring crop and added further problems.
   Prices paid to U.S. tomato growers rose to a record of $55.80 per
100 pounds in April, and retail prices averaged a record $1.32 per
pound in May.
   Gary Lucier of the department's Economic Research Service said
August figures show tomato prices at the farm dropped to less than
half of the earlier record level.
   ``We're in better shape now,'' Lucier said Monday in a telephone
interview. ``We could see some fluctuations up and down for the next
few months, but typically _ if there aren't any freezes _ I don't
see any problem.''
   After peaking in May at the record retail price of $1.32 per
pound nationally, consumers by June saw tomatoes ease back to 87
cents per pound as new seasonal supplies took hold.
   And then it was time for locally grown produce to make its market
entry _ the tomatoes, melons, sweet corn, squash and other items
that headline thousands of roadside stands and farm markets each
summer.
   ``Even the industry recognizes that in the summertime, anyway,
there's a lull in demand for tomatoes because of home gardens,''
Lucier said. ``Prices are typically at their low point.''

   The U.S. sheep flock has increased slightly in
recent years but still is one of the smallest inventories since the
Agriculture Department began keeping track in 1867. Global sheep
numbers, meanwhile, are at record levels.
   Currently, the world's sheep flock is estimated at 1.145 billion
head, up 2 percent from a year ago, according to a report by the
department's Economic Research Service. Most of the increase is in
China, Australia and the European Economic Community.
   The U.S. flock of sheep and lambs as of Jan. 1 was estimated
earlier this year at 10.8 million head, up fractionally from a year
earlier. Inventories have been declining generally for many years,
since a peak of 56.2 million in 1942.
   As a result the U.S. wool clip has also been relatively small,
although the 1988 production of shorn wool increased 5 percent from
1987 to 89.2 million pounds.
   Comparatively, U.S. mills used about 35.2 million pounds of wool
in the second quarter of this year, down slightly from January-March
but up about 4 percent from the second quarter of 1988, the report
said.
   With mill use up, wool imports have risen, totaling 31.9 million
pounds in the second quarter of 1989, up nearly 10 percent from
January-March and 26 percent more than in the same period of last
year.
   Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are major suppliers.
   The 1988-89 world output of wool is estimated at a record 7.12
billion pounds, on a greasy or uncleaned basis, up by more than 2
percent from last year, the report said.
   ``Most of this increase occurred in Australia (the main source of
apparel wool entering export trade) where excellent pasture
conditions and large sheep numbers caused 1988-89 production to be
almost 2.09 billion pounds, greasy, 3.6 percent above the previous
season,'' the report said. ``China and Argentina also experienced
larger production.''
   New Zealand, the major source of coarser grades of wool used in
carpets, blankets and heavy clothing, reported a decline in
production because of drought-related lower yields and fewer sheep.

   Last week's sale to the Soviet Union of 50,000
metric tons of surplus butter held by the Agriculture Department
averaged less than 74 cents a pound, or a little more than half of
what it cost American taxpayers.
   The sale, for a total of $80.9 million, involved a price to the
Soviets of $1,618 per ton, the department said. At 2,205 pounds per
ton, that was about 73.3 cents per pound.
   According to a recent USDA inventory accounting, the Commodity
Credit Corp. _ which acquires and stores surplus butter under the
government's milk price support program _ had about $1.40 per pound
invested in its butter stockpile. That translates into about $3,087
per ton.
   But Moscow didn't get a special price break, according to USDA
officials. Congress in 1985 and 1988 legislation ordered USDA to
sell for export 150,000 tons of dairy products per fiscal year
through September 1990.
   So far this year, sales total about 84,000 tons, including the
butter sale to the Soviet Union. Prices charged foreign buyers must
be competitive on the world market.

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut a `Shell Game' for Wealthy, Liberal Economists
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A capital gains tax cut endorsed by President
Bush is drawing fire from liberal economists who call it an unfair
windfall for the rich that will worsen the deficit and do nothing to
stimulate savings.
   ``It is at best a budgetary quick fix with harmful long-term
consequences,'' five economists said in a letter to Congress Monday.
``It is at worst yet another shell game which will redistribute the
nation's wealth toward those already most well-off.''
   One of the five, Lawrence Summers of Harvard University, said the
proposal ``may well be the worst tax idea in the history of the
republic.''
   The criticism came as the House Ways and Means Committee prepared
to resume consideration of the proposed capital gains cut. The most
recent unofficial count indicated that all 13 Republicans on the
committee and six Democrats _ a bare majority _ favored the proposal.
   The committee's Democratic leadership has been delaying a vote on
the cut, sponsored chiefly by Reps. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., and Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who opposes a reduction, has
drafted a substitute in hopes of knocking down the Bush-endorsed
Jenkins-Archer plan. Aides say Rostenkowski is broadening his
proposal so the reduction would apply to some assets already held.
   The committee expects to take a final vote this week.
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock, land and
other assets, are taxed at the same rates as wages and other income.
Bush says a capital gains cut would stimulate the economy and
increase revenue collections by encouraging taxpayers to cash in
long-held investments.
   Under the Jenkins-Archer plan, the 33 percent maximum tax rate
would be cut to 19.6 percent for capital gains for 2{ years; it then
would be raised to 28 percent and ``indexed'' so that profits caused
solely by inflation would not be taxed.
   Democrats in Congress generally oppose a capital gains reduction.
Their main arguments, presented Monday in writing by the five
economists, were:
   _Eighty percent of the benefits from the Jenkins-Archer bill
would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Noting that the 1986 tax overhaul sharply reduced all tax rates
by taking away preferences for capital gains and other deductions,
the economists wrote: ``To restore that preference now would leave
the tax system tilted unconscionably toward those who already enjoy
the greatest share of our nation's bounty.''
   _Because the reduction would be temporary, ``it will reward those
who have already made profitable investments, and not at all those
who must choose whether to invest in the future.''
   _``From a budget standpoint, a capital gains tax cut is a clear
loser. After a quick surge, revenues will fall.''
   _As to stimulating savings, the economists wrote: ``Evidence is
completely lacking that a cut in tax rates on capital gains will
have any effect on savings.''
   Three of the economists attended a news conference hosted by
Reps. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, and Sander Levin, D-Mich., Ways and
Means members who oppose a reduction.
   Summers, Joseph Minarik, executive director of Congress' Joint
Economic Committee, and Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution
spoke at the news conference. Also signing the letter were Alan
Auerbach and Alan Blinder, chairmen of the economics departments at,
respectively, University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University.
   Meanwhile, another Ways and Means member who opposes a capital
gains cut, Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., sought to deny any benefit
from such a reduction to those with incomes over $200,000 a year.

<HEAD>Government Ordering Modifications On Aging McDonnell Douglas Jetliners</HEAD>

   The government says it will order modification
of more than 1,100 McDonnell Douglas jetliners to help them grow old
safely.
   The action, similar to that taken for Boeing airliners earlier
this year, is the result of an airline industry-government task
force's effort to address growing concern over the world's aging
airliner fleet. More than half the passenger jets flying are over 20
years old.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Monday it will
issue within a few days ``airworthiness directives'' covering older
DC-10, DC-9, DC-8 and MD-80 airliners, in line with task force
recommendations announced at the same time. The cost for U.S.
airlines flying McDonnell Douglas jets is expected to total $53
million over the next four years, the FAA said.
   Industry officials, at a joint news conference with the FAA, said
it could eventually cost 10 times that much for the worldwide
McDonnell Douglas fleet over the next 20 years. But officials said
much of the work already has been done or planned and they do not
expect it to affect service or fares.
   ``Let me emphasize that the safety record of commercial aircraft
continues to be excellent,'' said Clyde Kizer of the Air Transport
Association.
   Jim Lundy, spokesman for Delta Air Lines, which flies 75
McDonnell Douglas planes, said the FAA orders do not indicate older
airlines are unsafe.
   ``This a way to make absolutely, positively sure that the
integrity of the airplane is maintained,'' he said.
   Industry officials said the McDonnell Douglas and Boeing planes
can fly safely as long as various parts of the fuselage, landing
gears and doors are replaced.
   The task force, which made recommendations affecting Boeing
airliners earlier this year, included engineers and officials from
the FAA, other government agencies, airlines, airplane manufacturers
and foreign airlines and aviation agencies. It is to report on
planes built by other manufacturers by the end of the year.
   The work is to be done after each plane reaches a set number of
landings, depending on the aircraft model and the items to be
replaced.
   So far, the government has agreed airliners can continue to fly
well beyond their original design goals as long as they are properly
maintained, although there is some support in Congress to set a
mandatory retirement age for jetliners.
   The initial McDonnell Douglas changes are less extensive and less
costly than those affecting Boeing, which average more than $1
million per plane.
   Dale Warren, McDonnell Douglas vice president, estimated the cost
under the planned FAA order would average $290,000 per plane:
$74,000 for DC-10s, $161,000 for DC-8s, $490,000 for DC-9s and
$90,000 for MD-80s.
   The higher cost for DC-9 modifications was due primarily to the
need for costly replacements in the landing gears, Warren said.
   The FAA order will cover only U.S. planes over the next four
years, with work required as each airliner logs a set number of
landings, said Ray Ramakis, assistant FAA director for maintenance
programs and flying standards. The landings threshold varies for
each type of aircraft and for the type of work to be done.
   Ramakis said the orders initially will cover 218 DC-8s, 568
DC-9s, 173 MD-80s and 194 DC-10s. The DC-8s date back to the late
1950s, with DC-9s first built in 1964 and replaced by the MD-80 in
the 1980s. DC-10s were first used in the early 1970s.
   Foreign airlines and regulatory agencies generally adopt FAA
orders for U.S.-built aircraft.
   Robert Aaronson, ATA president, said the orders are not linked to
the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa,
which killed 112 people. A separate industry-government group is
studying the design of larger airliners, partly as a result of that
crash.
   The aging airliner task force was set up after an Aloha Airlines
737 with nearly 90,000 flights lost an 18-foot section of fuselage
in an April 1988 flight over Hawaii. A flight attendant was killed.

   As the U.S. war on drugs begins to put a crimp
in drug lords' operations, Americans may become targets for
terrorists both in South America and at home, say government and
private witnesses.
   ``This assassination of government officials, legislators and
judges will no longer solely be a Colombian, indeed Andes,
problem,'' said Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``The
phenomenon may well spread to our borders. The American people must
understand the true costs of waging an aggressive campaign.''
   ``With their enormous wealth and easy access to advanced weapons,
it is not beyond the realm of the possible that Exocet missiles
might be directed against Coast Guard cutters or stingers
(anti-aircraft missiles) against U.S. commercial aircraft,''
Kupperman said Monday.
   So far, terrorist acts have focused primarily on Colombians,
including a leading presidential candidate, a former mayor of the
drug cartel center of Medellin and other officials.
   But if U.S. efforts to shut down growing, processing and shipment
of cocaine prove effective, Americans are likely to become terrorist
targets, a series of witnesses told the Senate Governmental
Operations Committee.
   If the drug cartels mount a campaign ``to have blood running in
the streets of America, I can't give you assurances we would be in a
position to pre-empt it,'' conceded Oliver B. Revell, investigations
chief for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
   Revell and others said South America's cocaine empires already
have shown their ruthlessness and inclination to use the techniques
of terrorism when their operations are pinched.
   ``They have dealt in blood since their inception,'' Revell said,
adding that he expected the first strikes to come against American
targets _ personnel and facilities _ in Colombia, the hub of the
cocaine trade.
   ``It's easier for them to operate there,'' he said. ``But that
does not mean we are not vulnerable here in the United States.'' The
cocaine cartels already have elaborate networks in place inside U.S.
borders and have carried out assassinations, primarily of other drug
traffickers.
   Revell noted that Colombian drug lords hired a team in 1987 which
assassinated Barry Seal, a former drug pilot and an informant for
the Drug Enforcement Administration, in Louisiana.
   And cartel operatives enlisted the Colombian urban leftist
guerilla group M-19 in 1985 to storm the Palace of Justice in Bogota
and assassinate Supreme Court judges.
   If the United States is successful in extraditing drug figures
for trial, ``It is quite clear that this group ... will respond
violently,'' said another witness, Brian Michael Jenkins of the RAND
Corporation. ``We have to anticipate the possibility of
hostage-taking. There is no question they have the capacity, there
is no question they have the record.''
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, lawmakers were responding to President
Bush's anti-drug initiative and making suggestions to beef it up.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., an Intelligence Committee member,
said a secret Bush directive authorizes the military ``to be
physically involved with units in the field where we have been
invited to have our law enforcement people.''
   DeConcini said the military would be able to offer protection to
drug enforcement agents and other law enforcement officials in the
field in Bolivia and Peru, and also called on the CIA and other
intelligence agencies to share information with law enforcement
agencies.
   And Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of a narcotics
subcommittee, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady to convene a summit of bank presidents to
increase the focus on money-laundering aspects of the drug problem.

<HEAD>FDA Finds Problems at 11 of 13 Generic Drug Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration plans to take
a closer look at 11 generic drug companies where inspections turned
up serious manufacturing and record-keeping problems.
   Irregularities that ranged from falsified records to
misrepresentation of test data were found at 11 of the 13 companies
that make generic versions of brand-name drugs, Paul F. Vogel,
deputy director of the FDA's generic drug compliance staff, told a
House subcommittee Monday.
   The investigations into the companies where problems were found
are continuing, and the FDA is reviewing the operations of 20 more
companies and testing samples of the 30 leading generic drugs. One
of the companies has admitted substituting a brand-name drug for its
own in sampling tests.
   ``We don't think our job is yet completed,'' said Vogel.
   The investigation, sparked by evidence turned up by the House
Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee, has resulted in
charges against three FDA employees, two generic drug makers and
former executives at the companies, as well as FDA action to remove
dozens of generic drugs from the market.
   ``We can no longer be sure that generic drugs are safe and
effective,'' said Rep. John Dingell, the subcommittee chairman.
   He added, however, ``For those drugs with broad therapeutic
ranges there is probably little danger to the consumer.''
   Vogel did not say whether disciplinary action against the
companies is being considered. But he noted in the case of one _ the
Superpharm Corp. _ ``We are presently considering our options.''
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said the FDA must rein in the generic drug makers as
more drug patents expire and become eligible for generic
applications.
   ``If there was already an incentive to pay illegal gratuities,
submit fraudulent samples and make false statements on generic drug
applications, the temptation to cut corners will grow unless the bad
actors are driven out of the industry,'' he said.
   FDA officials said deficiencies were found at American
Therapeutics Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y.; Barre-National of Baltimore;
Bolar Pharmaceuticals of Copiague, N.Y.; Par Pharmaceuticals of
Spring Valley, N.Y.; Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Morton Grove,
Ill., and Denver, Colo.; Pharmafair of Hauppauge, N.Y., a subsidiary
of Bausch and Lomb of Rochester, N.Y.; Quad Pharmaceuticals of
Indianapolis; Sidmak Laboratories of East Hanover, N.J.; Superpharm
Corp. of Central Islip, N.Y. and Bayshore, N.Y.; Vitarine
Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens, N.Y.; and Watson
Laboratories of Corona, Calif.
   Vogel said FDA found no significant problems at two
manufacturers: Able Laboratories of South Plainfield, N.J., and
Zenith Labs of Ramsey, N.J. He said neither is a major manufacturer
of generic drugs.
   Vitarine has admitted substituting the brand-name drug Dyazide
for its generic copy in tests to win FDA approval, and has since
removed its product from the market. The FDA is investigating to
determine whether Bolar did the same with its generic version of the
drug used for high blood pressure.
   Current and former officials of Par and Quad, which is a
subsidiary of Par, appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena,
but most declined to answer questions, claiming protection under the
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Among those who declined to testify were Ashok Patel, former
senior vice president of Par, and Dilip Shah, former president of
Quad, a subsidiary of Par, both of whom pleaded guilty to bribing
FDA chemists to win approval for generic drug applications.
   Comment from other companies was not immediately forthcoming.
People answering the telephone at Pharmafair and Pharmaceutical
Basics said no one could be reached until Tuesday. There was no
answer at Vitarine and at Barre-National.

   Democrats say they must take care not to head
into the 1992 presidential campaign as the party of taxes while
Republicans take credit for the war on drugs.
   ``In fighting with the president for our vision of America's
future, let's not lead with our chin,'' party chairman Ronald H.
Brown told a meeting of Democratic strategists Monday.
   ``When we entangle ourselves in talk about taxes before we lay
out clear long-term goals and objectives, we dampen the
public-spirited response of Americans who want to believe that we
can act together to make a difference,'' Brown said.
   Robert G. Beckel, a veteran Democratic political consultant, said
the response of some Democrats to President Bush's drug speech
identified their party with higher taxes.
   ``Within 24 hours of the news cycle, they (the Republicans) got
drugs and we got taxes'' as issues, Beckel said.
   Looking forward to the 1992 presidential campaign, he asked,
``Why give the next guy a drug policy in which the Republicans stand
for getting tough on drugs and we stand for taxing to get tough on
drugs?''
   Democrats have criticized Bush's program as being inadequately
funded, and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said, ``unless the president supports the
tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug
dealers are going to win.''
   The one-day conference was organized by Robert Rubin, a New York
investment banker active in Democratic affairs, and Richard Medley,
who runs a consulting firm in Washington that concentrates on
economic issues.
   Brown urged Democrats to ``starting preaching the Democratic
gospel'' by calling for ``a newly vigorous public spirit.'' But he
added, ``programmatic liberalism is not the gyroscope that guides
the national Democratic party.''
   He said rank-and-file Democrats ``believe that the New Deal
shaped our history and message as Democrats over four decades _ but
now they are ready for something more.''

   The Bush administration is giving tentative
backing to legislation that would attack the disparity between the
health of whites and minorities by encouraging training of more
black and Hispanic doctors and nurses.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy on Monday that several of the provisions in a bill
Kennedy is introducing would help in his own quest for improved
minority health.
   Sullivan, former head of the Morehouse University School of
Medicine, said he favors Kennedy's proposal to spend $117 million in
fiscal 1991 to expand minority training programs. He said he expects
the money to be added to the HHS budget rather than be transferred
from other programs.
   But Sullivan stopped short of a formal endorsement, saying the
Justice Department has expressed concern about the constitutionality
of provisions that would set aside grants for scholarships at
predominantly black medical schools.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., expressed confidence any problems could be
worked out since they involved distribution formulas rather than the
shared goal of increasing financial support for minority medical
students.
 be set
up for nursing schools.
   While the legislation would focus on stimulating medical training
for minority students, lawmakers said general health education
directed at minority groups will play a major role in improving
health among those groups.
   Hatch said at a hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee that much of the gap between white and minority health can
be closed ``through improved public education and better
coordination of services'' for minorities.
   ``Smoking among adult males continues to be about 25 percent
higher among blacks than among whites,'' he noted as an example.
   Dr. Herbert Nickens, vice president for minority health, disease
prevention and health promotion for the Association of American
Medical Colleges, called for a special congressional committee to
ride herd on how minority health issues are coordinated at the
federal level.
   He agreed that mass education is a cornerstone to improved health.
   ``Health promotion and disease prevention is an essential
component of any minority health strategy because the diseases which
kill us in America now depend heavily on our behavior and
lifestyle,'' said Nickens, a former head of the HHS Office of
Minority Health.

<HEAD>House Prepares to Vote on Flag-Protection Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel says it's
all right with him if lawmakers vote for a statute prohibiting
desecration of the flag, so long as Democrats allow a vote this fall
on a constitutional amendment.
   ``While I personally have to be opposed to the statute because
I'm supporting the amendment process, there are a number of members
who want to vote for most anything (to protect the flag),'' Michel
said Monday.
   Although there is little argument between Democrats and
Republicans about the desire for congressional remedy for a Supreme
Court decision giving First Amendment protection to flag
desecration, there has been wide disagreement about how that should
be done.
   The House was taking the first crack at the matter today in the
form of the statute pushed by Democrat leaders who don't want to go
the Republican-backed route of amending the Constitution.
   ``I happen to think the language even tends to weaken the current
statute,'' Michel said. The bill would make desecration of a flag a
federal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment.
   On the eve of today's House action, Republican and Democrats
discussed an agreement that would allow a vote on the statute as
well as a later vote on an amendment.
   These talks came as President Bush traveled to Capitol Hill and
had lunch with former House colleagues Reps. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss., and John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark. The congressmen said
Bush briefly discussed the flag issue with them.
   Although Bush made no comments as he left the Capitol, both
Montgomery and Hammerschmidt said they believed the president,
despite his preference for a constitutional amendment, would not
veto flag-protection legislation passed by Congress.
   ``He understands that, politically, members have to have a chance
to vote on a statute,'' Hammerschmidt said.
   Montgomery, chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told him Friday he would let
the House vote on a flag amendment in November.
   ``I think it's pretty locked in,'' Montgomery said.
   Montgomery said he would vote for the statute. Until now, many
veterans groups have been pressuring lawmakers to oppose the statute
because they fear it would preclude a vote on a constitutional
amendment, which they prefer.
   Michel sidestepped reporters' questions about the discussions
with the congressional leadership.
   Michel said he was ``still working'' with Foley ``with the
expectation we would have the same kind of agreement as is current
in the Senate, where there'll be a vote on the statute and assured
vote on an amendment some time later.''

<HEAD>China Unrest Disrupts Arms Shipments to Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unrest in China last May disrupted crucial
arms shipments to Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan, crippling their
drive to dislodge the Soviet-backed regime there, U.S. officials say.
   The interruption in the arms flow from China was only one strand
in a complex web of events that has stalemated the Afghan war six
months after guerrillas forced the Soviets to end a nine-year
occupation, say administration and congressional sources.
   The United States has been sending the Afghan guerrillas about
$600 million in arms a year since 1986, purchasing many of them from
China, which shipped them to Pakistan for rail transport to
Peshawar, a border town where seven major resistance parties are
based.
   Saudi Arabia has been buying the guerrillas a smaller amount of
arms, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Following the crackdown on pro-democracy forces in China, the
Chinese ``came to us and said our rail shipments are being
disrupted,'' said one source. ``We weren't sure whether that was
true or they were mad because the United States was supporting the
democratic movement there.''
   At about the same time, the CIA and its Pakistani counterpart,
the Inter-Service Intelligence, cut the flow of arms to Afghan
parties based in Peshawar.
   ``They were fine-tuning the pipeline,'' one source said, seeking
to decrease arms supplies to the lackluster Afghan Interim
Government, based in Peshawar, and send them directly to guerrillas
inside Afghanistan.
   Officials at the CIA and other agencies also badly miscalculated
the amount of aid the Kremlin was sending to the Najibullah regime
in Kabul, and misjudged the ability of that government to cling to
power, sources said.
   The head of the CIA covert aid program to Afghanistan has been
shifted to other duties, and although he has not been reprimanded,
has been ``cast as a scapegoat'' for the faltering U.S. policy, said
one administration source.
   Since the Red Army pulled out in February, sources said, Moscow
has been sending an estimated $250 million to $300 million in arms
per month to Kabul, about five times the level of aid going to the
anti-communist guerrillas.
   The guerrillas, at the urging of Pakistani intelligence, began an
assault against Jalalabad, a major administrative center in eastern
Afghanistan.
   But the offensive sputtered because the supply of arms to the
guerrillas dropped off sharply, and because of infighting among the
seven parties based in Peshawar, said the U.S. sources.
   The U.S. government, while maintaining support for the Afghan
Interim Government, has cut the supply of arms to the Peshawar
parties by half, sending the remainder directly to guerrilla leaders
inside Afghanistan.
   ``We need to get the stuff directly to the people who are doing
the fighting,'' said one source.
   The policies of the CIA, and the Bush administration in general,
have come under fierce attack from members of Congress, who have
voted large amounts of money for the Afghan resistance and expected
victory over the Kremlin-backed regime.
   ``The CIA has secretly pursued a wrong-headed Afghan policy for
years,'' the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism and
Unconventional Warfare wrote in an opinion piece that appeared
Sunday in the Washington Post.
   The congressman, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said the worst
blunder was allowing Pakistani intelligence to give most of U.S.,
Saudi and Chinese arms shipments to the Hezbi-i-Islami, the party
headed by Gulbadin Hekmatyar, one of the seven resistance leaders
based in Peshawar.
   As it shifted the flow of supplies from Hekmatyar and the other
Peshawar-based resistance parties, the Bush administration was also
developing ties with the last king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir
Shah, who was deposed in 1974 and lives in Rome.
   ``Talking with the king is not a shift in policy,'' said one
administration official. But it is part of a wider strategy to find
a way to breathe life into the faltering Afghan resistance.

<HEAD>Commodity Option Firms Accused of Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are seeking millions of
dollars in restitution from two commodity options firms charged with
misleading their customers about risky investments.
   Siegel Trading Company Inc., based in Chicago, and International
Trading Group Ltd., with headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., were
sued separately Monday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   ``This is probably the largest anti-fraud sales solicitation case
the CFTC has ever brought,'' said Dennis Klejna, director of the
commission's enforcement division.
   The suits were filed in U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California accused the firms of charging clients 45
percent commissions while giving investors advice they knew _ or
should have known _ was wrong or incomplete.
   Both lawsuits seek preliminary injunctions barring the firms from
continuing their alleged illegal practices. Klejna said the CFTC
also would seek to have the firms return all profits made through
illegal practices.
   A spokesman for Chicago-based Siegel was not in his office when
called for comment and did not return a reporter's phone call Monday
evening.
   In San Mateo, Calif., ITG issued a statement saying it was
reviewing the charges but intended to fight them vigorously. ``ITG
sales practices comply with applicable law and regulation, do not
mislead potential or actual customers and are proper in all
respects,'' it said.
   ITG also said it ``is not connected in any way`` with Siegel.
   Options are contracts that give their owners the right to conduct
a specified transaction, such as buying or selling a certain number
of shares of a given common stock, at a set price within a stated
period of time _ usually just a few months.
   Options can be highly risky and since they are usually short-term
investment vehicles, they involve a lot of buying and selling, for
which commissions must be paid each time.
   In the ITG case, the CFTC said that between Jan. 1, 1984 and May
31, 1989, more than 85 percent of the firm's customers lost a total
of $428 million _ $283 million of it in commissions collected by ITG.
   In the other case, from Jan. 1, 1984 until the present, about 85
percent of Siegel's customers lost money, totaling $33.6 million.
For the same period, the firm took in $40 million in commissions.

   Thomas Root, who gained fame and public
scrutiny when his mysterious flight private plane flight ended by
crashing in the Atlantic Ocean, is asking a court to protect his
communications law firm under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws.
   Root said Monday his money woes stemmed from non-payment from an
``entity'' he would not name.
   He has acknowledged collecting $1.64 million in fees for
representing FM radio station applicants before the Federal
Communications Commission in the last two years.
   Root refused to say if the entity was Sonrise Management
Services, a Columbus, Ga., company that has sued Root over his legal
services for investment groups that Sonrise organized.
   Asked by a reporter if it was Sonrise, Root said, ``Who do you
think it is?''
   Root said his firm, Thomas L. Root, P.C., filed for Chapter 11
protection Aug. 30 in federal bankruptcy court in the District of
Columbia.
   Root said in a statement that besides non-payment, ``The firm
also has suffered disruption of revenue because of the accident in
July 1989 of Thomas L. Root, president of the firm.''
   Root gained fame when he apparently lost consciousness while at
the controls of his single-engine plane and flew, apparently on
auto-pilot, for six hours before crashing into the waters near the
Bahamas.
   After his rescue, doctors at a Florida hospital discovered he had
been shot in the abdomen.Root says he passed out at the controls of
the aircraft and can't remember how he was shot. Federal authorities
were investigating the crash.
   Less than a week after the crash, Sonrise filed a $584,000
lawsuit against Root, alleging he failed to perform work and
double-billed a client.
   Sonrise said it had paid him $1.9 million since 1986 in advances
against legal fees for some 167 FM applicants. Root says he received
$1.64 million.
   The FCC has said Root's firm repeatedly failed to comply with
deadlines and other requirements in the FM application cases, and a
number of Root's applications have been dismissed.
   Root said Monday his firm still represented ``in excess of 50''
of those clients and that 12 had changed counsel.
   ``We're still answering our phones,'' he said. ``The firm will
remain in business.''

   Former national security adviser John

President Reagan and President Bush knew of Poindexter's actions in
the Iran-Contra scandal, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene directed Poindexter's attorneys
to explain to the court by next week how presidential and vice
presidential documents would corroborate his claims that Reagan and
Bush were aware of actions which later led to Poindexter's
indictment.
   Under indictment for allegedly covering up Oliver North's
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, Poindexter says he had no
motive to conceal North's and his own activities because Reagan
authorized them, leading Poindexter to believe they were legal.

<HEAD>Jewish Congress Asks Groups to Suspend Formal Contact With Catholics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 17-nation European Jewish Congress has endorsed
suspending formal contact between Jewish groups and the Roman
Catholic Church because of the dispute over a convent at the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   ``At issue is the word of the church. It is difficult to speak
with someone when you have this kind of problem,'' said Theo Klein,
who led the French delegation Monday at the annual meeting.
   Klein, a former president of the European Jewish Congress, said
he has appealed to Jewish organizations to suspend official contacts
with the Catholic Church. He said there had been no dissent.
   ``Each organization is free to make its own policy, so I cannot
say to you that all organizations have stopped dialogue, but I think
so,'' said Klein, who helped negotiate a 1987 pact with Catholic
leaders to remove the Carmelite convent.
   The meeting was dominated by the convent issue, which has split
Catholics and revived debates about lingering anti-Semitism in
Europe.
   Many Jews regard the convent at the camp _ where at least 2.5
million Jews were among the estimated 4 million victims during World
War II _ as offensive.
   Under the 1987 accord negotiated between Jewish representatives
and officials of the Catholic Church including Polish Cardinal
Franciszek Macharski, it was agreed the convent should be removed by
Feb. 22.
   But the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, continues to back
the convent, which was intalled in 1984 in a hut where the Nazis
stored gas used to murder Jews and other inmates.
   Glemp has said the Geneva agreement was not negotiated by
``competent people'' and, after summer protests by Jewish activists
at the convent, angered Jews and non-Jews alike with remarks many
people consider anti-Semitic.
   Two French cardinals and a Belgian cardinal who helped negotiate
the 1987 agreement have rejected Glemp's stance, insisting the pact
be carried out.
   Klein said he wrote to Cardinal Albert Decourtray, France's
Catholic leader and a party to the negotiations, in July announcing
that all formal Jewish-Catholic contacts would cease until the
convent issue is resolved.
   Since then, Klein said, he has refused all invitations from
Catholic organizations, including a recent invitation to address a
French Catholic student body.
   ``The Catholics themselves understand it is very difficult to
have a dialogue now without having solved this problem of the
Carmelites,'' he said.
   Informal contacts will continue with the European Catholic
cardinals who want to stick to the agreement, Klein said.
   ``It seems to me that in the Vatican some people will try to find
a solution, but if it will be the boss, I don't know,'' said Klein,
referring to Pope John Paul II, who has not publicly expressed his
opinion on the issue.
   Lionel Kopelowitz, president of the European Jewish Congress,
said the meeting endorsed the suspension of formal contacts.
   In a resolution, the congress urged swift removal of the convent
and said it hoped ``that the hitherto fruitful Jewish-Catholic
dialogue, strongly affected by the situation ... will not suffer
lasting damage.''
   ``Auschwitz itself is holy ground,'' said Kopelowitz. ``It needs
no memorial of any sort to any faith ... it is soaked in the blood
of all those who died.''
   Glemp has canceled a U.S. visit scheduled to start on Sept. 21,
the Polish news agency, PAP, reported over the weekend.
   The announcement came after U.S. Jewish leaders said they planned
to sue Glemp for defamation, claiming he implied that Jewish
protesters sought to harm the nuns during a July 14 demonstration at
the camp.

   Under red-tinted photographs of a smiling
Mikhail S. Gorbachev raising a vodka toast, American teen-agers are
raiding new ``perestroika boutiques'' at Bloomingdale's for a hot
new clothing fad _ Soviet military jackets festooned with campaign
medals.
   If Gorbachev is seeking a vote of confidence from the West for
his reform policies, where better to look than Bloomies, the trendy
bastion of capitalist consumerism and affluent teen-age customers on
buying sprees?
   Miraed Smith, publicity director for the New York-based
department store chain, reported a heavy demand for Soviet exports
of khaki-colored, army-style jackets with fake fur collars and
hoods, which retail for $190.
   Youngsters decorate them with elaborately colored enamel medals
commemorating everything from Lenin to Soviet space exploits and
wartime triumphs. The medals sell for $5 to $15 apiece, depending on
size.
   ``The kids think all this is sizzling and cool,'' Ms. Smith said
in a telephone interview from New York.
   Bloomingdale's, which takes pride in anticipating fashion trends,
believes it has found a ``new frontier'' in the Soviet market, said
Pat Cummings, public relations director for Bloomingdale's two
stores in the Washington suburbs of Maryland and Virginia.
   She said sales have been brisk since ``perestroika boutiques''
opened here on Friday. The counters are stacked with Soviet
T-shirts, wristwatches and _ just the item for the American shopper
_ credit card holders in red-bordered black leather.
   Ms. Smith said Bloomies started selling Soviet goods in May when
it bought some black Russian rye bread, which sells for about 30
cents in Moscow, from an unnamed American importer. ``Our people
tasted it and said it was the most luscious bread they'd ever
eaten,'' she said. ``They went absolutely wild over it.''
   Bloomies called it ``peace bread'' and sold 1,500 loaves in the
first week at its Manhattan store. ``People didn't hesitate to spend
$6 a loaf,'' she said.
   Suspecting that their customers were intrigued by almost anything
made in the Soviet Union, Bloomies' buyers ordered more: T-shirts
and sweatshirts bearing indecipherable Cyrillic slogans,
military-style wrist and pocket watches with lots of dials and
buttons, sunglasses, medals and an assortment of Russian cakes and
cookies, including hard biscuits traditionally dipped in wine or hot
tea.
   Bloomies has buyers in Moscow ordering additional goods which
they hope will arrive in time for the Christmas season and in
quantities large enough to outfit ``perestroika boutiques'' in all
of Bloomingdale's 17 stores, most of them in the Northeast but
others in Chicago, Miami and Dallas.
   Officials said negotiations are under way with Soviet authorities
for a reciprocal agreement that would allow Bloomingdale's to build
a couple of outlets in Moscow, possibly at the airport and a
downtown hotel.
   ``I think perestroika is here to stay, but boy, do I hope I'm
right,'' said Bill Lane, a Bloomingdale's buyer who sees enormous
potential in the Soviet Union as a producer of exotic new consumer
goods for the U.S. market.
   In this era of glasnost, Lane said, the military flavor of the
jackets, wristwatches and other Soviet goods appearing in American
stores carries a far different, more hopeful message than it once
did.
   ``Military is a fashion, not a means of making war,'' he said.
``It's a look. And that's a wonderful thing. We're glorifying the
end of war. We're not celebrating destruction. We're celebrating
military as fashion.''

<HEAD>Nation's Schoolchildren Increasingly Subjected to Dress, Hair Codes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For more and more high school students, mousse abuse is taboo. So
is hair down to there. And though they don't necessarily have to
dress for success, some say they must dress under duress.
   Along with perpetual peer pressure to wear ``in'' clothes and
sport the latest trendy haircuts _ whether it's a Batman insignia or
a moussed-up do _ American teen-agers are facing dress and hair
codes that impose official ideas of fashion.
   In a flashback to the '60s, some students are protesting what
they consider infringements on their right to free expression.
   ``It's very regrettable when educators fail to see that kids have
rights and that breathing down their necks about ways they should be
able to express themselves is not encouraging real education,'' said
Leanne Kats, executive director of the National Coalition Against
Censorship.
   In Henry County, Ga., for example, about 100 students picketed
the school superintendent's office last month when dozens of boys
were sent home because their hair touched the collar in violation of
a new policy.
   The same rule in Jasper, Ala., resulted in an angry school board
meeting.
   Shelia Whitfield, whose son Duane, a 10th-grader, was sent home
because his hair is an inch longer than allowed, complained the rule
was an invasion of privacy.
   ``His hair doesn't have anything to do with his education,'' Mrs.
Whitfield said.
   New dress codes are in effect in several Texas school systems,
mostly to guard against offensive or suggestive T-shirts, and in
Baltimore, where furs, costly jewelry and leather coats were banned.
   Dozens of other systems, including some in Michigan, New York and
Louisiana, have adopted voluntary dress codes for their schools to
consider.
   Gary Marx, a spokesman for the American Association of School
Administrators, said stricter dress and hair codes have not yet
become a national trend but sentiment is growing to strengthen such
rules.
   ``We do see indications here and there that schools are thinking
about dress codes and how students are attired may affect their
education and the education of others,'' Marx said. ``I think there
is a sense in society that we sometimes act the way we look.''
   Lawrence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor who
specializes in First Amendment issues, said the U.S. Supreme Court
has never dealt directly with the issue and the lower federal courts
have ruled both ways.
   The high court would likely side with school boards if it ruled
today, he said.
   ``I think it stretches the free expression clause to apply it in
schools,'' Tribe said. ``The power of compulsory education already
involves a major intrusion into a person's ability to express
himself. The school board has a broad range of powers over its
students.''
   In Baltimore, schools' spokesman Dick Holden said the new code
was aimed at eliminating ``the uniform of the drug culture.'' He
said the clothes also are too expensive for some students to afford,
leading to violence.
   ``The dress code became a major topic of discussion after some
violent incidents in our schools involving outsiders stealing, or
attempting to steal, jackets or jewelry of our students,'' Holden
said. ``Clothing had become attractions to criminal activity.''
   The New Orleans school board instituted a voluntary uniform
policy for schools, and spokeswoman Rose Peterson said about 100
schools have ``adopted some kind of uniform.''
   She cited three reasons: ``It's a security issue. When the
schools are wearing a uniform, it's easy to recognize an outsider.
For the parents, they perceive it as a lot cheaper. And it takes the
pressure off kids to wear designer clothes.''
   In Clovis, N.M., a one-year trial dress code is in effect after
students rewrote an old one that banned shorts for boys but allowed
miniskirts for girls. In protest, some boys wore miniskirts to
school.
   The new policy allows shorts and skirts if neither is shorter
than 5 inches above the knee.
   And in San Antonio, a 13-year-old student was forced to get rid
of two Batman emblems emblazoned on each side of his head with
bleach. Officials banned him from class until he came back with a
flattop.
   Among students, though, opinions can be divided.
   Many see the restrictions as arbitrary, and others worry that
some adults assume a given style of dress means a student is taking
drugs or involved in illegal activity.
   Still others, including student body President Jason Thompson of
Allen High School in Dallas, support policies encouraging neat
appearance.
   ``Fads come and go,'' Thompson said. ``Last year, when stud
earrings were allowed for the first time, almost everyone went out
and got his ear pierced. But now you don't see earrings that much.''

<HEAD>Almanac Promotes $1 Columbus Coin, Phaseout of Penny and Paper Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Farmers' Almanac, renewing its crusade
to revamp the nation's coinage and currency, is promoting a $1 coin
to replace the dollar bill to pinch a few pennies for Uncle Sam and
taxpayers.
   The almanac's 1990 edition, just off the presses, also calls for
the elimination of the penny and 50-cent piece. The new $1 coin
could be called the Columbus Dollar, honoring the explorer who
discovered the New World, the publication said.
   The almanac endorses a bill introduced by Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., to direct the Treasury to mint and circulate the Columbus
Dollar and halt production of the $1 bill 18 months after the coin
is placed in circulation.
   Under the new system, the little-used $2 bill likely would become
the most popular piece of currency, says almanac editor Ray Geiger.
   Geiger maintains that the new system would create a coinage and
currency system that reflects contemporary values and lifestyles.
   He quotes the Federal Reserve as saying replacement of the $1
bill by the $1 coin would save the Treasury more than $120 million a
year.
   ``It costs approximately 2.6 cents to print a $1 bill and the
bill lasts about 18 months before it goes to the shredder. It costs
3{ cents to mint a $1 coin, but the coin will last 20 years,'' he
said.
   ``The Farmers' Almanac, 173 years old, has always been a champion
of the common man, and we think the common man is entitled to
protect his right to a coinage that's sensible and realistic,'' he
said in an interview.
   Geiger's publication, not to be confused with the 197-year-old
New Hampshire-based Old Farmers Almanac, has previously prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks, eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code and print currency in colors other than green.
   Geiger, who claims a circulation of more than 5 million, said
this year's 48-page almanac contains the usual mix of calendar data,
household hints, one-line jokes and inspirational messages.
   It also has weather predictions by prognosticator Caleb
Weatherbee that are based on ``a secret formula based on sunspots,
the position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon.''
   Weatherbee predicts that the winter of 1989-90 will be milder
than usual with less snow, while next summer will be pleasant with
moderate rainfall.
   The campaign for the $1 coin follows last year's proposal for a
new coin worth 12{ cents _ or one ``bit.'' As Geiger saw it, the bit
would bridge the gap between the dime and quarter. That suggestion
didn't catch on.
   But the almanac remains adamant that the penny has got to go,
saying most of the 200 billion in circulation simply gather dust in
shoe boxes and piggy banks. It suggests that sales be rounded off to
the nearest nickel.
   On the $1 coin, Geiger said the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin
failed to become popular because it was not easily distinguished
from the quarter and because it was introduced as an alternative to
the paper dollar, rather than a replacement.
   The almanac even has a design ready for a new $1 coin. Art
director Ed Greenwood drew a sample coin that features a portrait of
the explorer on one side and two of his ships on the other.
   The almanac suggests that the coin be gold toned, 1[ inches in
diameter, ungrooved or unribbed on the edges, with the thickness of
a quarter. It would also be light _ .015 ounce, or one-quarter the
weight of the old silver dollar.

   Up to 15 vehicles piled up during a
hailstorm Monday on Interstate 80, killing at least three people and
injuring 12, the California Highway Patrol said.
   CHP dispatcher Vic Hopner said three deaths were confirmed in the
4 p.m. accident near Donner Pass. The injured were taken to Tahoe
Forest Hospital in Truckee, Hopner said.
   Nursing supervisor Ann Delforge said two of those killed were
pronounced dead at the accident scene and a third was pronounced
dead upon arrival at the hospital. Delforge originally said there
were four deaths.
   Two of the injured were flown to St. Mary's Hospital in Reno,
Nev., to be treated for spinal and chest injuries. The others were
being evaluated, she said.
   About 2 inches of hail fell on the Donner Pass area Monday
afternoon, and a tractor-trailer rig lost control on the slick
pavement and crushed two cars against a guard rail. At least nine
other vehicles piled up behind, a CHP spokeswoman said.
   The highway was closed more than two hours after the crash,
officials said.

<HEAD>Former President Continues Recovery From Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan, recovering from
skull surgery, should be able to return home in a few days and in
the meantime is working on paperwork and keeping up with the news, a
spokesman said.
   ``Physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful that if
the present rate of progress continues, President Reagan will be
able to return to California at the end of the week,'' Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg said Monday.
   He said no specific date has been set for Reagan, 78, to be
released from the Mayo Clinic's St. Marys Hospital.
   Mayo doctors Friday drilled a hole in the former president's
skull to remove a buildup of blood. Weinberg said the problem
stemmed from a July 4 accident in which Reagan was thrown from a
horse and hit his head.
   On Monday morning, Reagan read newspapers, watched morning
television news programs and did routine paperwork, Weinberg said.
   Later, Reagan spoke with Gen. Colin Powell, chairman-designate of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had telephoned over the weekend to
extend his good wishes, Weinberg said.
   Reagan has spoken several times by phone with his son Ron, and
has been looking through the hundreds of cards and messages he has
received, Weinberg said.
   An earlier blood clot was detected in Reagan's brain this summer
but it had healed on its own without an operation, Weinberg
confirmed Monday.
   Neurosurgeon Thoralf M. Sundt has said that the first clot was
smaller and in a different area of the brain. Because of the first
clot, brain tests were included as part of the checkup, Sundt said.
   Reagan's spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier blood
clot, detected shortly after the horse-riding accident by doctors in
Los Angeles, where Reagan lives.

<HEAD>Illinois Repeals Nation's Only Mandatory Premarital AIDS-Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor reluctantly signed legislation to
repeal the nation's only premarital AIDS-testing requirement,
acknowledging that in 1{ years only 52 AIDS cases were found among
the 250,000 tests.
   Lawmakers, health officials and civil rights organizations
applauded Republican Gov. James R. Thompson's action Monday.
   ``It was infringing on people's civil liberties, was detrimental
to the public health and had very little benefit,'' said John
Hammell, director of the AIDS and Civil Liberties project of the
Illinois American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``We're talking about tens of thousands who changed marriage
plans or went out of state.''
   The Illinois State Medical Society also congratulated Thompson on
signing the bill, and said counseling and education is more
effective in stopping the spread of AIDS than is mass testing. The
society represents 18,000 physicians.
   The repeal, effective immediately, also removed a long-standing
requirement that prospective spouses be tested for syphilis.
   That means couples will no longer be required to take premarital
blood tests to get a marriage license in Illinois, as they had been
since the syphilis measure was passed in 1938, said Mary Huck, a
spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health.
   The repeal bill provides for the department to develop a brochure
on sexually transmitted diseases that would be distributed to
couples applying for marriage licenses. Thompson said the provision
``would help achieve the objectives of the original bill.''
   The law required couples seeking a marriage license to show a
doctor's certification that they had been tested for the disease.
   Illinois had been the only state in the nation to mandate
premarital AIDS tests. Louisiana enacted and then repealed a similar
law last year.
   The Illinois requirement was approved in June 1987 over the
objections of the state public health director, Dr. Bernard Turnock,
whose confirmation was blocked for weeks by lawmakers angered by his
opposition.
   ``We were simply penalizing the citizens of Illinois and
requiring them to do some unproductive medical research for us,''
said Rep. Grace Mary Stern, a sponsor of the repeal.
   The cost of an AIDS test _ ranging from $20 to $150 per person _
was blamed for a sharp drop in the number of marriage licenses
issued in Illinois, from nearly 100,000 in 1987 to fewer than 80,000
last year.
   Counties along the state line reported the sharpest declines,
while counties in neighboring states experienced sharp increases.
For example, Wisconsin's Kenosha County issued 1,142 marriage
licenses to Illinoisans in 1988, compared with 67 a year earlier.
   Thompson said the repeal decision was difficult but necessary
since the program turned up only 52 cases of 250,000 tests.
   ``It's pretty clear people were going to neighboring states,''
Thompson said. ``What we were doing was in fact alienating people.''

   Officials today said Prince Aya, the second-in-line
to the throne, will take as his bride a college student whose humble
background gave her the nickname ``Apartment Princess.''
   The announcement by the Imperial Household Council came a day
after Kiko Kawashimashe celebrated her 23rd birthday with the
prince, the emperor and empress at Akasaka Palace, a far grander
home than the simple apartment where she lives with her parents.
   Prince Aya's choice of his college sweetheart, who has no noble
background and whose family is well-off but not wealthy, has caused
a stir among some palace conservatives.
   ``It will be hard for her because she is the closest person to
the general public ever to marry into the royal family,'' said one
palace source, who requested anonymity. ``Empress Michiko may have
been a commoner, but her family was certainly upper class.''
   Michiko, the first commoner to become empress, reportedly helped
deflect opposition to the marriage.
   The idea of 23-year-old Aya marrying before his 29-year-old
brother, Naruhito, also had met considerable opposition from palace
conservatives, another palace source said.
   ``But the crown prince seems to be in no hurry, and hasn't found
the right woman yet,'' the source said earlier this month,
requesting anonymity.
   The plans were announced after the 10-member Imperial Household
Council, headed by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, met this morning.
   ``Together with the people of Japan, I express my salutations
regarding this auspicious engagement and pray for the continued and
increased prosperity of the imperial family. ... Kiko has a
wonderful personality and is a most fitting princess,'' Kaifu told
reporters after the announcement.
   Although Prince Aya chose his bride himself, by law the council
has to meet to discuss the marriage of any male member of the
imperial family.
   In sharp contrast to the empress, whose family business is the
nation's largest flour miller, Miss Kawashima lives with her parents
and younger brother in humble on-campus housing at Tokyo's Gakushuin
University, where she studies psychology and her father, Tatsuhiko,
teaches economics.
   That university, however, is the alma mater of much of Japan's
royalty, including Aya and the emperor.
   Aya, 23, is second-in-line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after
Naruhito, who will be formally installed as crown prince next year
on a date yet to be decided.
   Aya will complete postgraduate studies in zoology at Oxford
University's St. John's College in June.
   No date has been set for ceremonies related to the wedding, but
they will not be held until after Jan. 7, when a one-year mourning
period marking the death of the late Emperor Hirohito ends.
   Hirohito, who died at age 87, is Aya's grandfather.
   Once the mourning period is over, an imperial envoy will be sent
to the Kawashima residence to present her family with gifts _ rice
wine, fish and red and white silks _ that future imperial in-laws
traditionally receive.
   The gifts seal the engagement much as a ring would in the West.
   After the presents are given, Miss Kawashima will begin
``princess studies,'' daily classes in imperial history and customs,
the constitution, foreign language and etiquette.

   The reputed money man behind Colombia's Medellin
cocaine cartel has been denied bail after pleading innocent to
money-laundering charges.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, the first of Colombia's
``Extraditables'' brought to the United States without trial, is
accused of helping the cartel launder about $1.2 billion in drug
profits through U.S. banks.
   The cartel, based in the Colombian city of Medellin, is believed
to supply 80 percent of the cocaine in the United States.
   During an arraignment Monday, U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman
ordered Martinez held without bond after prosecutors contended he
was likely to flee the country before a trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Wilmer Parker III told Feldman that
Martinez could easily afford to lose whatever bond amount was set to
ensure his return.
   Defense lawyers Ed Garland and Oscar Rodriguez said the
36-year-old Martinez was a highly educated businessman with a loving
wife and four children.
   The defense attorneys, asking the judge to place Martinez under
house arrest pending his trial, said he had never come to the United
States to set up money-laundering arrangements. They said he had
only been in the country to bring his children to Disney World.
   Parker noted that Martinez escaped an arrest attempt in Panama in
March shortly after his indictment by a federal grand jury in
Atlanta.
   The indictment was a result of a 2{-year investigation dubbed
Operation Polar Cap, which led to charges against 127 people and two
Latin American banks.
   Rodriguez said Martinez is being held in solitary confinement at
an undisclosed location, which is believed to be in the Atlanta area.
   If convicted, Martinez could receive 30 years in prison under
Colombian law, or life under U.S. law. Garland said it is not yet
clear which law applies.

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 219.22
points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 34,332.88.
   The dollar closed at 146.73 yen, down 1.04 yen from Monday's
close of 147.77 yen. It opened at 146.80 yen and ranged between
146.60 yen and 146.93 yen.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader at Daiwa Bank, said the dollar's
bullishness remained despite its temporary fall ignited by a rumor
in New York overnight.
   The dollar plunged overnight following the rumor that the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board is to hold an emergency meeting to ease
monetary policy.
   ``They say all kinds of things over there (in New York) to force
the market in a certain direction,'' he said, ``But trading here in
Tokyo is rather quiet.''
   He said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market by selling
dollars in an attempt to stop the currency's excessive strength. The
amount of the central bank's dollar-selling was unknown. The Bank of
Japan does not comment on its monetary actions.
   Traders said the dollar's trading range was narrow prior to the
release of a series of U.S. economic reports later this week,
including the nation's retail sales figures for August, due Thursday
in Washington, and the July trade figures and the wholesale prices
for August, both slated for Friday.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index moderately
rebounded in early trading as market players were reassured by the
yen's overnight rebound against the dollar, but the index's upswing
did not last as participants started selling for profit-taking.
   Trading was light due to lack of energy in the market as well as
a wait-and-see mood especially among institutional investors due to
concerns over the U.S. economic indicators due out later this week,
said a trader with a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban exile who led 1,500 men in the 1961 Bay of
Pigs invasion, then spent 28 years deeply depressed over the defeat,
was found dead after an apparent suicide.
   Jose Alfredo Perez San Roman, 58, was found dead Sunday morning
in his mobile home, where he lived alone. Police were analyzing the
handwriting on a suicide note and awaiting autopsy results Monday
before they would announce the cause, said Metro-Dade police
spokesman George Reyes.
   Roman led the 1,500-man brigade of Cuban exiles in the abortive
U.S.-backed assault on their island homeland in April 1961. They
were defeated by troops loyal to the communist government of Fidel
Castro, who had seized power in 1959 after dictator Fulgencio
Batista fled amid guerrilla fighting.
   San Roman's brother, Roberto Perez, said the Bay of Pigs defeat
and the failure to liberate Cuba haunted his brother.
   ``The Cuban invasion was his life, his reason for living,'' Perez
said. ``Afterward, it was very difficult for him to cope with the
political upheaval of exile.''
   Col. Ramon J. Ferrer-Mena, San Roman's chief of staff in the
invasion, said the commander took the humiliating defeat personally
and didn't accept the mission's failure, even as it collapsed around
the small exile invasion force.
   ``The first thing I thought when I got off the phone from hearing
that Pepe was dead ... was that it was a suicide,'' said Ferrer-Mena.
   San Roman was one of 1,189 exiles captured and imprisoned in Cuba
after the invasion. The exiles were returned to the United States 19
months later and ransomed by President Kennedy for $53 million in
food and medicine.
   Like most of the Bay of Pigs veterans, San Roman felt betrayed by
the United States for not providing vital air and sea military
support, said Mario Cabello, a veteran of the invasion.
   Robert Kennedy, the then-attorney general, said San Roman told
him after he was liberated from Cuba that 10 times as many troops
would have been needed to succeed.
   Veterans of Brigade 2506 still meet in Miami and discuss what
might have been.
   San Roman was honored as a hero in the exile community, said Col.
Humberto Olivera, another Bay of Pigs veteran.
   ``During his trial, he behaved as a commander,'' said Olivera.
``He never said `no'' and he was a man who faced a firing squad and
never turned his back on his principles. He was a brilliant man.''
   Olivera said San Roman was an honor student and graduate of
Managua Military Academy, the Cuban equivalent of West Point. He
also was one of the youngest captains in the Cuban army, Olivera
said.

<HEAD>Thoughts on Democracy Movement Split Along Generational Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three months of propaganda and political
study about the crushed pro-democracy movement, Beijing residents'
views of the protests still are split along generational lines.
   Most of the leaders of the seven-week movement that ended in
bloodshed in June were college students.
   Wu'er Kaixi, the charismatic leader who fled to the United
States, is 21. The average age of the 21 students on China's most
wanted list of student leaders is 23.
   Students say the older generation was so cowed by years of
oppression that it dared not support the students.
   An intellectual in his late 60s said recently of the current
crackdown on dissent, ``They're not paying too much attention to us
oldsters. This time it's the young ones.''
   The intellectual, who like the others spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the leadership probably believes the older
generation supports the government line, which calls the democracy
movement a counter-revolutionary rebellion that sought to topple the
government.
   ``Regardless of what they think, they know we wouldn't have the
guts to do'' what the students did, he said.
   Troops killed hundreds of civlians on June 3-4 as they put down
the popular movement. Since then, all Chinese are forced to undergo
weekly political study sessions at their work units, and college
students this fall have had several weeks of intensive political
study.
   The students were the inspiration and the force behind the
movement that was joined by hundreds of thousands of ordinary
citizens, most in their 20s or 30s.
   They are a generation that has grown up with only dim memories of
the horrors of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and for
whom the rigidity and purges of the 1950s and early 1960s are
history.
   For the youth, the past 10 years of opening to the outside world
have been the most vivid, and they have welcomed what foreigners
have brought to China _ from the ideals of democracy, freedom and
human rights, to Western cigarettes, fancy clothes and rock'n'roll.
   A Beijing University student who actively participated in the
movement spoke impatiently of his parents and their generation, who
he said were afraid of the changes he and his friends sought.
   He said that his parents were ``afraid to even think about what
we were saying,'' much less support or even take part in the
movement because of their experiences with China's rapidly changing
political winds.
   The old intellectual, who has repeatedly been persecuted during
China's frequent political campaigns, tried to dissuade young
friends and colleagues from even going to see what was happening in
Tiananmen Square.
   Many older Chinese forbade their teen-age and college-age
children to go out during the protests because they have learned it
is best not to get involved in political affairs.
   At Beijing University recently, a senior advised a foreigner
talking to school security personnel not to ask too many questions
about what happened this spring.
   ``The older folks, they don't think like us, they don't
understand,'' he said. ``If you ask too many pointed questions of
them, they may get you in trouble.''
   The old intellectual, asked if he thought what the students did
was right, said, ``You ask me what is correct and what isn't, (but)
I can't tell you.''
   The Beijing University student, however, had no doubts at all.
   While regretting the high price that was paid, he said, ``What we
did was right.''
   Others students echo his words, even three months after the
crackdown and after weeks of intensive political education at
school. But they also say they get no support from their parents for
their activities.
   A senior at a technical school said that when he went home in
late May after taking part in the hunger strike, his parents forbade
him to return to Beijing and told him the students were foolish to
think they could change anything.

   A defense lawyer said he does not plan
to challenge blood samples and other physical evidence that
incriminate Ramon Salcido in seven slayings during a wine country
rampage.
   But Marteen Miller said Monday he will seek to disqualify
Salcido's confession to Mexican authorities on the grounds that it
was not voluntary.
   Miller outlined his strategy following the first day of a
preliminary examination to determine if there is enough evidence to
hold Salcido over for trial.
   Salcido, 28, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, is accused
of killing his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law and her two
daughters, and a co-worker on April 14. He also is accused of
attempting to murder his third daughter, another co-worker and the
colleague's wife.
   During the hearing, a sheriff's deputy fought tears when asked to
identify a photograph of Salcido's daughters found with their
throats slashed in a dump.
   Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Mike McManus, the first officer to
arrive at the grisly scene, spoke haltingly as he described finding
the bodies of Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1, lying near their sister
Carmina, then 2, who survived.
   Also testifying was Richard Waller of the California Department
of Justice Laboratory, who said blood found on the body of Salcido's
mother-in-law, Marion Richards, and her 12-year-old daughter, Ruth,
appeared to be Salcido's.
   The finding also linked to Salcido a blood sample found on a
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol used in at least two of the
shootings, said Waller.
   After the hearing, Assistant District Attorney Peter Bumerts
called the physical evidence ``as conclusive as it gets.''
   ``I don't think this is a who-done-it, and I don't think Mr.
Miller has ever indicated it would be,'' said Bumerts.
   Municipal Judge Knoel Owen denied a defense motion to continue
the hearing for 30 days to assure the appearance of two special
agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who were with
Salcido when he was arrested by Mexican authorities five days after
the rampage.
   Salcido told the agents he killed his wife and a co-worker in a
jealous rage believing they were romantically involved, authorities
have said.
   Miller accused the Mexican authorities of coercing Salcido's
confession. The defense attorney said it would take 30 days for
authorities in Washington, D.C., to ensure the agents' appearance.
   Owen said he would reconsider Miller's motion if at the end of
the preliminary hearing the agents have not testified.
   The hearing is expected to last two weeks.

<HEAD>Convicted Felon Tries Froot Loop Defense in Burglary Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a jury believes Larry Robertson
had Honey Smacks in his cereal bowl, he could spend the rest of his
life in prison. But if it was Froot Loops, he could go free.
   Robertson's attorney has stirred up this confusion in an effort
to clear his client, a four-time convicted felon.
   Robertson, 25, is charged with stealing a rifle and a box of
cereal from a house in Lake Worth on Oct. 15.
   The victim said the pilfered cereal was Sugar Smacks, the puffs
of wheat since renamed Honey Smacks. But a neighbor claims he saw
the thief wearing a red shirt and blue shorts carrying an M-16 rifle
and box of Froot Loops.
   Police never located the rifle, but found Robertson around the
corner, wearing a red shirt, blue shorts and eating a bowl of cereal.
   Robertson said he was eating Froot Loops. Police said they saw
``a puffed-rice type of cereal'' and charged him with burglary and
grand theft.
   ``We all know cereal gets soggy after a minute or two, and it
loses its identity,'' said Robertson's attorney, Michael Lebedeker.
   ``My defense is that the victim said Sugar Smacks, and the
witness saw Froot Loops.''
   When Assistant State Attorney Mark Hanson heard about the Froot
Loop defense, he facetiously named two new witnesses: Toucan Sam,
the cartoon mascot on Froot Loops cereal commercials, and Dig'em,
the hyperkinetic frog for Honey Smacks.
   ``If Dig'em identifies Sugar Smacks, then there goes his
defense,'' the prosecutor said.
   Robertson also is accused of robbing and stabbing a milkman Oct.
6. If he is found guilty of the attack and the burglary at his Oct.
23 trial, he could be sentenced as a career criminal to a life term,
Hanson said.
   ``I'm just going to eat my Wheaties and Lucky Charms and hope the
jury does the right thing,'' Hanson said. ``Then he'll have more
than spilled milk to cry about.''

<HEAD>Proposition 13 Co-author Dies of Complications from AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Gann, who helped lead the
Proposition 13 tax revolt in the '70s and fought a losing battle for
criminal penalties for those who knowingly spread AIDS, died from
the effects of the disease. He was 77.
   The self-proclaimed ``people's advocate,'' who continued fighting
for ceilings on government spending into the 1980s, died Monday of
pneumonia, ``complicated by a problem with the AIDS virus,'' said
Ted Costa, his longtime political aide.
   Gann had been under treatment for a broken hip at the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center since a fall at his home on Sept. 2. He
said he contracted AIDS from blood received during open-heart
surgery in 1982, before blood screening for the AIDS virus had been
developed.
   Gann co-wrote the property tax-slashing Proposition 13 initiative
in 1978 with the late Howard Jarvis.
   Gov. George Deukmejian called Gann ``a tireless crusader on
behalf of lower taxes, fiscal responsibility and good government.''
   ``Paul and Howard Jarvis will be remembered for leading the
modern-day version of the Boston Tea Party, which culminated in the
overwhelming approval of Proposition 13,'' the Republican governor
said.
   The state Senate adjourned in Gann's memory; the Assembly had
left for the day before his death.
   Proposition 13, which cut California property taxes by 57
percent, sparked a national trend of tax-cutting movements in other
states. In 1979, Gann successfully sponsored another voters'
petition drive that set limits on state and local government
spending.
   During two decades of crusading in California, Gann sponsored or
co-authored 12 ballot initiatives for conservative causes dealing
with taxes, crime, AIDS and public salaries.
   The June 1990 ballot will include a proposal, sponsored by
Deukmejian and leaders of both parties, to modify the ``Gann limit''
on state spending to allow enactment of an $18.5-million, 10-year
transportation package.
   In his only bid for elective office, Gann won the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1980, but was crushed by 4.7
million to 3 million votes by incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston in
the general election.
   Gann first announced he had AIDS on June 9, 1987, when he
declared that his fight against AIDS would be ``the last campaign of
my life.''
   After the announcement, Gann fought for criminal prosecution of
people who knowingly spread AIDS and mandatory reporting of the
names of people who test positive for the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``I feel I have the gravest responsibility to accomplish this,
more so than anything I've ever done, actually,'' Gann said of his
war on AIDS during a 1988 interview.
   Voters in California's 1988 election rejected the measure.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Reems, who starred in the 1972 hardcore
blockbuster ``Deep Throat,'' pleaded guilty to evading federal
income taxes.
   Reems, whose real name is Herbert Streicher, pleaded guilty
Monday to one count of failing to file a tax return on income of at
least $35,000 in 1982. In exchange, the government agreed not to
prosecute charges that he also failed to file tax returns in 1984
and 1985.
   Reems, 42, faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$25,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Nov. 13.
   The government contended Reems earned at least $35,000 in 1982
for his work in the porn films ``Society Affairs'' and ``Sometime,
Sweet Susan.''
   Reems acknowledged before U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall
that he also faced unspecified state charges. The adult film star
and his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Phil Trevino, declined to
comment on the case.
   Reems, a former Malibu resident who now lives in Utah, is best
known for a role as the inquisitive doctor in ``Deep Throat.''

<HEAD>Dollar Drops Sharply, Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index bounced back after
a weeklong decline.
   After losses totaling more than 370 points over five trading
days, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues climbed 219.22
points, or 0.64 percent, Tuesday and closed at 34,332.88.
   Market players were reassured by the yen's overnight recovery in
New York, dealers said.
   The dollar plunged in New York Monday after a rumor that the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board planned an emergency meeting to ease monetary
policy.
   ``The yen's rebound helped bond prices to rise, which also
encouraged market players to buy stocks,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a
stock analyst with Nomura Securities.
   Trading was thin, however, with first section volume estimated at
500 million shares. Among gainers were electrical, shipbuilding and
construction issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 146.73 yen, down 1.04
yen from Monday's finish of 147.77 yen, its highest close in nearly
three months. It opened at 146.80 yen and ranged between 146.60 yen
and 146.93 yen.
   After opening sharply lower following its overnight plunge in New
York, the dollar moved little in Tokyo, said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a
trader with Mitsui Bank.
   ``Although some market sources had expected the dollar to fall
further during Tokyo trading, it didn't, mainly because many
investment trust companies bought the currency whenever it moved
lower,'' he said.
   ``But the dollar could fall some more, considering many market
players still have long dollar-holding positions,'' he said.
   He said the Bank of Japan's dollar-selling intervention, which
totaled some $400 million today, also was likely to check the
dollar's rise.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its exchange market
activities.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader at Daiwa Bank, said, however, that
expectations of a strong dollar persisted despite the temporary fall.
   Hanada said there was little news to prompt major moves by market
players, who were awaiting the release of U.S. retail price figures
for August on Thursday and trade figures for July on Friday.

   A man shot in the head at point-blank range
outside his home had been indicted in what authorities called one of
the worst environmental crimes in New York City history.
   Fred E. Weiss, 50, a partner in W&amp;W Properties, was shot numerous
times Monday in a late-model Jeep parked outside his home. He had
been charged with two other men and eight companies with illegally
dumping medical waste, asbestos and other hazardous materials in a
Staten Island landfill.
   In the indictment, U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the companies
operated nearly around the clock between May and September of 1988
and reaped more than $4 million for the defendants. Weiss was free
on $250,000 bond while awaiting trial on mail fraud charges and
violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Investigators said Weiss may have been slain because some of his
associates _ trash haulers linked to mobsters _ believed he was
cooperating with authorities, sources told the Daily News. The
sources were not identified.
   The killer or killers fled without being seen, police said.

   For the price of a spacious suburban
home, you can buy the entire town of Bust, population zero, complete
with one building.
   Lloyd and Helen Collins, owners of Bust, Colo., on Ute Pass say
that after seven years of running the gift shop and being mayor,
vice mayor, chief of police and the City Council of their own town
they are ready to try a new venture.
   So they are selling the place. Price: $159,000.
   Since the Collinses live in Woodland Park, near Colorado Springs,
and make the short commute to the store daily, Bust has no official
residents.
   Like Colorado Springs' early settlers, who flocked here by the
cry of ``Pikes Peak or Bust,'' tourists have been drawn into the
store at the foot of the mountain by a huge sign on the roof.
   ``Bust, Colo.,'' it reads. ``Colorado's Newest and Smallest Town,
Elev. 7,500, Pop. Zero.''
   ``Lots of people stop just because of that sign,'' Ms. Collins
said as she waited on customers recently. ``They don't believe it
and have to stop to ask about it.''
   It was the novelty of the idea and the sign that prompted the
couple to buy the store from its original owner in 1982. Now, they
hope it will strike the fancy of someone else who can carry on the
tradition.
   Until then, the Collinses are working hard to keep Bust from
going bust.

<TEXT>
   The state intends to begin its own oil
spill cleanup after Exxon removes the last of its crews this week
from the fouled coastline of Prince William Sound and the Gulf of
Alaska.
   David Ramseur, a spokesman for Gov. Steve Cowper, said the
details are still being worked out, but the governor will agree to a
state-financed cleanup to begin after Exxon withdraws Friday.
   Cowper plans to announce the plan in Valdez, home port of the
tanker Exxon Valdez, which ran aground March 24 on a charted reef,
spilling nearly 11 millions gallons of Alaska crude in the nation's
worst oil spill.
   He will spend the next few days working with the state Department
of Environmental Conservation, figuring out what kind of cleanup the
state should attempt during Alaska's stormy, dark and frigid winter.
   ``We're looking at some light, manual cleanup, picking up
remaining tar balls and funding some research and development that
goes beyond squirting hot water on rocks,'' Ramseur said.
   The governor's office had no estimate Monday of how much its
cleanup might cost. Press aide Ernie Piper said the state was
confident that, based on Exxon's past willingness to pay its oil
spill bills, the company also would cover the cost of the state's
wintertime cleanup.
   Exxon estimates its expenses for the summer cleanup at more than
$1.2 billion and disputes state and federal agencies' claims that
the cleanup has been inadequate. The company says it has treated
more than 1,000 miles of shoreline, leaving only four miles undone.
   State authorities say Exxon is overstating the work it has done
and is quitting before the job is finished.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly has
defended Exxon's decision to leave for the winter, but said the oil
company must finish the cleanup next spring or pay the government to
do the job.
   In San Diego, meanwhile, shipyard workers cut pieces of steel off
the bottom of the Exxon Valdez on Monday as repairs started on the
tanker. The repairs at National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., where
the ship is in dry dock, will take about nine months and cost an
estimated $25 million.

<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to ADD that Drewbud privately owned, CLARIFY
higher up that company is not selling finished houses. Picks up 7th pvs,
`Each share ...' ^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For days, people stood in line by the
hundreds in material-scarce Poland to pay about 13 months' wages
just for the chance to buy a prefabricated house within the next
four years.
   ``I prefer this to waiting 15 years for an apartment at a housing
cooperative,'' one man told state radio Monday, when shares in the
project went on sale.
   ``Realization of a dream'' read the newspaper advertisement
placed by the privately-owned Drewbud Bank, which offered shares
that would entitle some lucky stockholders to buy a house by 1993.
   The company said it would also give away 100 free houses annually
to stockholders.
   The company is making the first large-scale effort to sell houses
in Poland, an effort that reflects hopes that through fundamental
economic reform engendered by a truly representative government a
solution might finally be found for the country's desperate housing
shortage.
   Drewbud is not selling finished houses, however, just the
prefabricated pieces needed to put them together.
   The housing situation is so dire in Poland that just the chance
of being able to buy the elements of a house drew hopeful crowds to
the 11 banks nationwide where the 15,000 shares went on sale. Some
people stood in line as long as four days.
   Each share entitles its owner to enter one drawing for the free
houses and another to set the order in which the prefabricated
houses will be sold.
   The price for a share in the Poznan-based company was 2 million
zlotys, about $222 at the free-market exchange rate.
   The average monthly salary is about 150,000 zlotys, an income
Poles find they must supplement with cash earned on the side or with
hard currency obtained from relatives abroad or by working in the
West several months a year.
   Currently, the homes Drewbud is offering cost an estimated
180,000 zloties per square meter, or about $3,160 for a
158-square-meter two-bedroom plan.
   However, there is no accurate estimate of what the houses will
cost when sold. The inflation rate was 40 percent for last month and
is thought to be edging toward 200 percent annually.
   The price does not include the property, the cost of assembling
the house or providing connections to power, water and sewage
systems.
   Nor does it include a furnace, plumbing or any other fittings
such as floor, tile or appliances.
   The advertisement included two pages of plans for 10 styles of
homes, ``from rowhouses to manor style.''
   The plans appealed to those facing often decades-long waits for
the more typical residence, which are two or three tiny rooms in a
worn apartment block.
   A government report, citing severe shortages in almost all
building materials, high cost and government bureaucracy, said
housing construction will be 30,000 units below projections this
year.
   The difficulty of obtaining materials, as well as red tape and
expense, also stalls private efforts to build homes.
   The report, issued this week, said the efficiency of housing
construction approaches that of the late 1960s. It said the problem
is aggravated by the lack of hard currency with which to buy
materials and equipment in the West.
   But Drewbud promised homes that were ``one's own, healthy,
energy-saving, made of natural materials and easy to assemble.''
   The sale was advertised to last for five days. By Monday
afternoon, 250 of the 1,150 shares available at the Warsaw bank
branch had been sold.

<HEAD>Judge: McMartin Case `A Heartbeat Away From a Mistrial'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The possibility of a mistrial in the nearly
6-year-old McMartin preschool molestation case became more likely
with the final alternate juror replacing an ailing member of the
panel.
   ``We are a heartbeat away from a mistrial,'' Superior Court Judge
William Pounders said Monday.
   Pounders said he is ``desperately concerned'' about getting the
case to the jury soon. If one more juror drops out, the case would
have to be mistried because it would lack the required 12 votes.
   Pounders said the stress of the trial has taken its toll on
jurors' health. There originally were six alternates.
   The excused juror suffers from a blood disorder his physician
said could prove fatal if he continued to serve.
   ``The pressure is too much for the jury,'' Pounders said. ``We
have 12 healthy jurors right now that should be able to stay with
us. But the minute that one of them is gone, we've lost 2{ years of
effort.''
   Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62,
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a joint count of
conspiracy. Prosecutors allege they molested 11 children at their
family owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. Seven teachers
originally were charged in the case, which has lingered in the
courts nearly six years. Charges against the others were dismissed.
   Despite his desire to end the case quickly, Pounders granted a
prosecution request to present nine more witnesses in their rebuttal
case.
   ``It feels to me to be a clear gamble to present evidence like
this,'' he said, noting the longer the case, the greater likelihood
of a mistrial.
   ``I feel like we are in Las Vegas rolling the dice,'' he said,
``and I lose in Las Vegas. I feel like we are going to lose it.''
   But Pounders said he granted the prosecution request for more
testimony because he blames the defense for prolonging what is now
the longest and costliest criminal trial in American history.
   ``The vast majority of time has been taken by the defense in this
case,'' he said.
   He summoned the remaining jurors and told them their absent
colleague was ill with a blood disease and with shingles. The latter
disease is contagious, but he told them if they were going to
contract it, ``you would have had it by now.''
   ``These are the 12 jurors who will decide this case,'' he said.
``So your participation is vital until the conclusion of the trial.''
   The trial has been plagued by jury illnesses. Pounders frequently
has called recesses when jurors had to keep doctor appointments. At
one point, he recessed for several weeks to allow a juror to have
spinal surgery.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freighter carrying bales of newsprint
and canned food for the besieged Christian enclave ran the Syrian
blockade today as Syrian and Christian gunners fought a shelling
duel in and around Beirut.
   Police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in the
overnight duel, which escalated at 3:30 a.m. as the Princess-Hand
entered Lebanese territorial waters about 20 miles north of Beirut.
   By police count, the six-month confrontation between Gen. Michel
Aoun's mainly Christian troops and the Syrian army has claimed the
lives of 847 people and left 2,528 wounded.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said the Syrians opened up at the Princess-Hand using
radar-controlled 130mm howitzers deployed north of the Christian
enclave.
   The ship, he said, sailed ``very close'' to the
Christian-controlled coast as shells exploded around it, but made it
safely to the port of Jounieh and dropped anchor at 4:30 a.m. He
said further details about the ship's nationality and agents were
not available.
   However, the spokesman said the bales of newsprint were imported
by three newspapers operating in Christian east Beirut. He did not
elaborate.
   East Beirut and the rest of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
northeast of the capital has been besieged by the Syrians for more
that six months in retaliation for a blockade imposed by Aoun on
ports run by Syria's militia allies south of Beirut.
   Syrian gunboats have intercepted several ships trying to defy the
blockade, and several vessels have been hit by Syrian shellfire as
they approached Christian ports. Most such attacks have not been
reported.
   The daily newspaper An-Nahar published a study released by the
government-run Maritime Transport Directorate which said 27 ships
have been affected by the Syrian blockade of Christian waters, which
has killed 14 seamen and wounded five.
   The study said five of the ships were set ablaze by Syrian
shelling, six suffered direct shell hits, 11 were hit by shrapnel
and five were intercepted by Syrian gunboats and taken to
Syrian-controlled ports.
   Meanwhile, Lebanese newspapers predicted that a truce in the
Syrian-Christian confrontation would result from a meeting by a
three-man Arab mediation committee scheduled for Wednesday in Saudi
Arabia.
   An-Nahar said Aoun has agreed to the idea forming a team to
monitor the import of weapons by the warring Lebanese factions, an
issue which has been a sticking point.
   The Syrians claim Iraq, their Arab arch rival, is providing Aoun
with weapons and ammunitions by sea.
   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general has repeatedly refused
proposals for the formation of a team of observers to monitor the
28-mile Christian-controlled stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile
Mediterranean coast.
   Aoun's reported acceptance of an observation team, which could
not be officially verified, is expected to facilitate efforts of the
mediation committee, which comprises the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.
   The three chief diplomats, after Wednesday's meeting, are to
report to their leaders on the possibility of stabilizing the
situation in Lebanon.
   Kind Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid were asked by a full-fledged Arab summit
in May to find a settlement by November to Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   However, the mediation committee announced July 28 that its
efforts on Lebanon were deadlocked and blamed Syria for blocking its
mission.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of betraying
their 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab League by
siding with Moslems against Christians in the civil war, which has
taken more than 150,000 lives.

   A huge Canadian air mass early this morning dropped temperatures
to the 30s and 40s across the north-central United States, while
scattered showers fell over the mid-Atlantic states.
   Frost and freeze advisories were in effect this morning for most
of the Dakotas, western and southern Minnesota, northern Nebraska,
northeastern Colorado and portions of Wyoming.
   Light rain extended from the central high Plains across much of
Nebraska into western Iowa, while snow fell in southeastern Wyoming.
Clouds and light rain kept temperatures in the 40s in the central
Plains on Monday.
   Drizzle and light showers also dampened west Texas. Scattered
rain fell across southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois, and
along the mid-Atlantic coast.
   The high for the nation on Monday was 104 degrees at Gila Bend,
Ariz., Yuma, Ariz., and Imperial, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from Florida across the Gulf Coast states to the southern Plains,
over the central and southern Appalachians and portions of Virginia
and the Carolinas; rain or drizzle dampening the central Plains; and
scattered showers across upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin.
   Predicted highs: in the 50s over the central Rockies, the
northern and central Plains and Minnesota, with some readings in the
40s in the central Plains; in the 80s and 90s from the middle and
south Atlantic coastal states across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf
Coast states to most of Texas, in the Pacific Northwest and interior
valleys of California; around 100 degrees in the desert Southwest;
and in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 28
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 85 degrees at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Sarah continued to batter Taiwan
today, leaving seven people dead and eight missing as heavy rains
triggered landslides, flooded crops and paralyzed transportation,
officials said.
   Off the coastal city of Hualien, 110 miles southeast of Taipei, a
Panamanian freighter with 26 Turkish and Indian crew members broke
in two as strong winds drove it away from the harbor, officials said.
   Four sailors of the 12,000-ton Len Ghao swam ashore Monday
evening, and 17 were rescued Tuesday. Rescuers still were searching
for five missing crew members believed stranded on the vessel.
   Police said four people died in Hualien, including a woman who
was electrocuted, a boy who drowned in flood waters and a man who
was hit by falling rocks.
   An Australian teacher, Jonathan B. Watts, 26, died Monday when he
was swept into the sea while touring the Hualien harbor with other
instructors from a nearby English-language school, police said.
   Police said three other people died elsewhere in Taiwan and three
men were missing.
   Weathermen said Sarah's peak winds weakened today to 72 mph,
compared with 108 mph when the typhoon hit eastern Taiwan on Monday.
   Officials said flood waters as high as 4 feet smashed houses and
left 100 people homeless in Hualien.
   Torrential rains inundated 81,500 acres of rice paddies and
vegetable and fruit farms in several villages in eastern and central
Taiwan. Agriculture officials estimated the damage at $36.4 million.
   The downpour also triggered landslides and disrupted traffic on
major highways. All domestic flights were canceled today. All
schools and most government offices were closed because of the
typhoon.
   The state-run Taiwan Power Co. said power outages were reported
in 840,000 households throughout the island.
   In Manila, government and Red Cross officials said Sarah killed
21 people and left as many as 70,000 homeless in the northern
Philippines, where the typhoon triggered floods and landslides
Sunday and Monday.

<HEAD>Former Harold Washington Aide Sentenced to Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former aide to the late Mayor Harold Washington
delivered an hour-long speech protesting his innocence, but was
sentenced to eight years in prison for his conviction on fraud and
racketeering charges.
   Clarence McClain also was ordered Monday to pay $35,000 in
restitution and placed on five years' probation.
   McClain, 48, was convicted in July of racketeering, fraud and tax
evasion for taking $35,000 in bribes from undercover FBI informant
Michael Raymond.
   During the sentencing hearing Monday, McClain repeatedly handed
U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner documents that he said would prove
his innocence, and castigated the prosecution and news media ``who
created this diabolical event.''
   McClain, who did not take the stand at his bribery trial, accused
federal prosecutors of suppressing tapes he said would have cleared
him. He said he would call for a congressional investigation of his
prosecution, which was part of the FBI's Operation Incubator probe
of corruption in city government.
   McClain became so agitated during his speech that Ms. Rovner
ordered a five-minute recess so he could calm down.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Shepard told the judge that
McClain's speech was one more reason why she should not consider
leniency.
   Shepard said McClain would not subject himself to
cross-examination, but could not resist ``a chance to rant and rave
in front of an audience as if a trial had not occurred.''
   McClain was accused of accepting bribes from Raymond and the
president of a New York-based company in exchange for using his
influence to make sure the company, Systematic Recovery Services,
got a lucrative city contract for retrieving delinquent parking
fines.
   ``Clarence McClain traded Harold Washington's dream of reform for
cash and he put it in his own pocket,'' Shepard said.
   McClain served as an aide to Washington when he was a state
representative and a member of the Illinois congressional
delegation, but was dismissed by the mayor shortly after his 1983
election when reports surfaced about McClain's prior criminal
record, which included a conviction for pandering.
   McClain reportedly told Raymond and others that he still had the
ear of the mayor and could direct bribes in Washington's direction.
   Raymond, a convicted swindler, was the central figure in the
undercover investigation. Operation Incubator netted 16 convictions
in Chicago and spawned a a probe in New York City that led to 10
convictions, including that of Stanley M. Friedman, Democratic
chairman of the Bronx.
   Raymond agreed to serve as an undercover FBI operative after
being arrested on weapons charges in Nashville, Tenn., in 1984.

<HEAD>Soviet Parliamentary Delegation Arrives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese officials today welcomed the first Soviet
parliamentary delegation to visit since the two countries normalized
relations in May.
   The six-member Supreme Soviet delegation, led by Anatoly
Lukyanov, vice president of the body's presidium, will be in China
for six days and is also to tour Wuhan and Shanghai, Soviet
officials said.
   It is the first parliamentary group to come to China since
Mikhail S. Gorbachev normalized party and government ties in a May
visit, the first by a Soviet leader to China in 30 years.
Gorbachev's trip was overshadowed by massive pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   Since the movement was suppressed in a bloody June 3-4 military
assault, China has emphasized its good ties with communist and Third
World countries which, unlike the West, have generally withheld
criticism of the use of violence to put down the protests.
   The head of China's Communist Party International Liaison
Department, Zhu Liang, is currently in Moscow to discuss ways to
develop inter-party ties following the Gorbachev visit.
   Sino-Soviet relations were frozen at most party and government
levels after a 1960 split over ideological and strategic
differences, and did not begin to thaw until the mid-1980s.
   The first Supreme Soviet visit to China after the split took
place in 1985. There have been two more lower-level parliamentary
visits before the current delegation.

<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has weathered
a storm inside his party and won another term as Christian
Democratic Union leader, but with the smallest majority of votes in
his 16 years as party chairman.
   Kohl was elected to the new term late Monday and will be the
party's candidate for chancellor again during next year's tough
election battle.
   But the 59-year-old Kohl, who will be angling for a third term as
head of the Bonn government, managed just 77 percent support from
his own party faithful despite having no opponent in the vote for
the chairmanship.
   The sizeable no-vote expressed the discord within the Kohl's
party after numerous local election losses over the past two years.
   As the West German electorate has moved to the left, the
traditionally conservative Christian Democrats have drifted toward
the center, angering their most right-wing members while doing
little to win votes from the left.
   Kohl last month fired the party's long-time manager, Heiner
Geissler, triggering another intraparty dispute that reared its head
Monday on the national party convention's opening day.
   Geissler, architect of the party's comeback at the beginning of
the 1980s, initially disputed his firing by claiming it signaled a
move by the Christian Democrats ``in the wrong political direction.''
   In an effort to put a unified face on party affairs heading into
the national election campaign, Kohl offered Geissler a job as
deputy chairman of the party _ one of eight _ and Geissler was voted
into that seat Monday night.
   But some notes of discontent were voiced by moderates among the
750 party delegates at the convention who saw Kohl's removal of
Geissler as high-handed or an act of desperation.
   The Christian Democrats are currently running neck-and-neck with
the left-leaning Social Democrats in public opinion polls, which
give each party about 38 percent of the vote.
   That means the Christian Democrats need to retain a coalition
with the liberal Free Democratic Party and with their Bavarian
sister party, the Christian Social Union, to win a majority in
December 1990 national balloting.
   The Free Democrats, which poll about 8 percent in national
surveys, have indicated they will make their continued alliance
dependent on how the Christian Democrats fare in regional elections
over the next few months.
   Christian Democrat losses this year in Berlin and Frankfurt cost
the party control of those cities.
   Free Democrat support among voters has also withered over the
past year, and the party blames its drop on the declining popularity
of the Christian Democrats, with which it is aligned in Bonn.
   Continued discord within the Christian Democratic Party,
reflected in the fact that Kohl won only 571 of 738 votes for the
chairmanship, could further erode the party's popularity and its
chances for retaining leadership of the Bonn government next year.

   What was supposed to have been a fly-by of the new
Boeing 737-500 for its customers turned into a fly-behind.
   The new jet, flanked in tight formation by a 737-300 and a
737-400, was scheduled Monday to fly in front of the guests waiting
at the Museum of Flight at Boeing Field. But the jets flew over the
building and behind the spectators.
   ``I'm not sure what happened,'' said Dick Schleh, a Boeing
Commercial Airplanes spokesman. ``I think the pilots of the planes
believed they were to fly over the building and not over the
runway.''
   Some guests did catch a glimpse of the formation, although the
sun was directly overhead at the time, Schleh said.
   ``Some people saw most of the first plane, half of the second and
none of the third,'' he said with a laugh.
   The guests included officials of major customers for the 737-500,
including Southwest Airlines, Braathens, Euralair and Maersk.
   The 737-500, Boeing's smallest commercial jet, was first flown on
June 30 and is aimed at the same market as the 737-200, which first
flew in 1967 and ended production in 1988.
   The 500-series planes, which sell for $24 million to $28 million
apiece, carry about the same number of passengers as the 200 series,
but can save 20 percent of the fuel.

   A woman was sentenced to up to life in
prison for killing a ranchman during a shooting spree in which
victims were selected by a 9-year-old boy who said they were
possessed by demons.
   Sharon Lee Halstead, 36, received a mandatory life term with a
minimum of 30 years after pleading guilty to aggravated murder in
the Nov. 2 shooting death of Marston Lemke, a 59-year-old wrangler
on a Newberg ranch. She is awaiting sentencing in a second killing.
   According to court documents, Halstead was acting on the
instructions of her 9-year-old son, Leo Shively, when she killed
Lemke and Lynnann Green.
   Green was killed and her husband and 2-year-old son were wounded
in a shooting in Grants Pass three days after the Lemke killing. The
boy was shot as he sat in his high chair and is paralyzed from the
chest down.
   Halstead was accompanied by her sons, Leo and 12-year-old Harry
Shively, and her sister, Deborah Halstead, when the killings
occurred.
   Deborah Halstead has been sentenced to prison for conspiracy. The
children are in state custody, but have not been charged with any
criminal offense.
   Court documents showed Halstead believed Leo spoke for God. The
killer believed her victims were ``totaled,'' a term used to
describe someone whose body was occupied by evil spirits or demons.
   Halstead feared she, her sons and her sister would be ``totaled''
if she failed to carry out the killings.
   At Monday's sentencing hearing, Halstead told Circuit Judge
Donald Blensly she had nothing to say.
   She is to be sentenced for the Green shootings on Sept. 26. She
has pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and two charges of
attempted murder.

<HEAD>Brookhaven Scientists Create High-Temperature Nuclear Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKHAVEN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at Brookhaven National
Laboratory have created energy using a new method for
high-temperature nuclear fusion that may have the potential for
producing a clean and efficient form of nuclear energy.
   ``I would classify this as a new approach that has not been tried
by anybody else before. There may be promise,'' Dr. Robert Beuhler,
a chemist at the laboratory on New York's Long Island, said Monday.
   He said the new method involves the firing of a cluster of up to
1,300 fuel molecules at a stationary fuel target. The resulting
compression causes atoms from the cluster and the target to fuse,
producing a small burst of nuclear energy.
   ``We were quite surprised,'' Beuhler said on behalf of himself,
senior chemist Dr. Lewis Friedman and another colleague, Dr. Gerhart
Friedlander.
   But the researchers' enthusiasm was tempered by the realization
that it would take years of further work to verify whether fusion
can be achieved on a much larger scale.
   ``This is very new ground,'' Beuhler said.
   Beuhler said the method produces a small burst of nuclear energy
only once in every 10 billion times it is tried.
   The work to create nuclear fusion began in the spring, financed
by the federal Energy Department. Cluster research at Brookhaven has
gone on for more than a decade.
   The findings were accepted for publication in the Sept. 18 issue
of the journal, Physical Review Letters, he said in a telephone
interview.
   Researchers did not formally announce their findings because they
felt it was too early to tell how the new process will do at higher
temperatures and with other variables.
   He said scientists can achieve fusion now in a hydrogen bomb, but
he added with a chuckle, ``It's not very controlled.''
   In the Brookhaven experiments, the fuel consisted of tiny
clusters of molecules of heavy water, whose hydrogen had been
replaced by a heavier isotope, deuterium, which is commonly found in
sea water.
   The clusters, he said, were electrically charged and speeded up
before being fired at a solid target of atoms. The clusters heated
and compressed at impact, setting off the burst of nuclear energy.
   ``This is really stellar research, heating up a large number of
atoms to the temperatures that exist in stars,'' Beuhler said.

   The Kremlin today sent Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev to Berlin as the East German government pondered ways to
stop an exodus of its citizens to the West.
   The Tass news agency said Ligachev, thought to be a conservative
force on the Soviet Communist Party's ruling body, was invited to
Berlin by the Central Committee of East Germany's ruling Communist
Party.
   It did not say what Ligachev would do in Berlin.
   An estimated 10,000 East Germans have fled through Hungary to the
West since Budapest opened its western border to them Sunday
midnight, and Hungarian officials said 16,000 more East Germans had
arrived via Czechoslovakia.
   East Germany has bitterly criticized Hungary for allowing the
East Germans to leave, but sources say its leaders have been
reluctant to take further action because of the reported ill-health
of East Germany leader Erich Honecker.
   He was reported Monday to be in worsening condition after
gallbladder surgery last month.
   Tass on Monday criticized what it called a ``tendentious
campaign'' in the West to encourage citizens to leave East Germany.
Tass said the campaign and ``propaganda hullabaloo'' were conducted
to pressure East Germany.
   East Germany ``is an inalienable part of the Warsaw Treaty, is
our true friend and ally,'' Tass said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was lower in cautious trading in Europe
this morning as dealers awaited U.S. economic figures to be released
later in the week.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Traders said the dollar was stuck in a narrow range as market
players sifted through predictions and rumors to decide what
positions they were going to take before the release at U.S. trade
figures for July, due on Friday.
   ``I believe the dollar will find a floor at 1.9750 (West German)
marks before the trade numbers come out,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer,
vice-president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt. At
the high end of the range, the dollar was unlikely to rise above
2.0000 marks, he said.
   The Bank of Japan was sighted selling dollars early in Tokyo's
trading session today, dealers said. The action had little effect on
the dollar, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.04 yen to a closing 146.73 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a rate of 146.70 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5486 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5450 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
   _1.9847 West German marks, down from 1.9875
   _1.7120 Swiss francs, down from 1.7150
   _6.6850 French francs, down from 6.6970
   _2.2335 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2425
   _1,421.00 Italian lire, down from 1,424.75
   _1.1872 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1873
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $358.50 a troy ounce,
compared with Monday's late bid price of $358.75. At mid-morning
London bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of $358.95.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid price of $359.20, down from
Friday's $360.00. Markets were closed Monday afternoon for a holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.03 to close at a bid $359.93.
   Silver bullion prices traded at $5.08, unchanged from Monday's
late price.

   A day care center's director and assistant director
were repeatedly stabbed and chased around the facility by two men
while horrified children and a parent watched, police said.
   Two children, ages 2 and 4, and a parent were splattered with
blood as they witnessed the attack at the Apple Ridge Private School
Monday evening, said Sgt. J.W. Schildt.
   ``That was the worst crime scene I've ever seen,'' Schildt said.
``It went from room to room. There were pools of blood by each of
the telephones. One of the women tried to jump out of a window _ it
was broken out from the inside.''
   The school's director, Charlotte Sue Reed, was in serious but
stable condition today at Methodist Medical Center. A hospital
official says she sustained lacerations and a punctured lung.
   The school's assistant director, Felisha Lynette Gibbons, was in
fair condition with numerous stab wounds on her face and arms.
   Police said a former boyfriend of Ms. Gibbons came into the
center and began attacking the 25-year-old woman with a knife.
   When Ms. Reed, 45, tried to contact police, a second man demanded
her car keys and told her to get off the telephone, then began
stabbing her and cut the phone line.
   Armed with butcher knives, the men chased the women from room to
room as the victims tried to telephone police or escape.
   The assailants took both women's purses and drove away in Ms.
Reed's car, which was later found nearby, said police.
   The children and mother who witnessed the attack were unhurt,
police said.

   About 88 percent of Vietnamese boat people
languishing in this colony's fetid detention centers face forced
repatriation, the government said in figures released today.
   Over the past year, just 424 Vietnamese among the 3,455 cases
reviewed by the government won the right to stay in Hong Kong until
they can be resettled elsewhere, the figures said.
   Government officials said they expected further review would
follow the pattern of the first year and that about 88 percent of
the refugees would be denied the right to temporary stay in the
colony.
   At a news conference to disclose the findings, Francis Blackwell,
chairman of the Refuge Status Review Board, one of two agencies
supervising the screening process, said most of the Vietnamese were
``economic migrants'' and not political refugees.
   As such they should be returned home, he said.
   ``Real refugees are hard to find,'' Blackwell said. ``Lies are
legion for many migrants who pose as refugees and try to deceive not
only the director of immigration but also the board.''
   Britain and Vietnam are currently negotiating on the forced
return of the boat people to Vietnam. Blackwell said it would take
about two years for his board to finish screening all the boat
people in Hong Kong to determine who was a refugee and who was
simply an ``economic migrant.''
   Although he did not name the United States, Blackwell criticized
it for opposing forced repatriation, calling it a ``Pontius Pilate.''
   That country, he said, ``washed (its) hands of the matter some 14
years ago,'' a reference to America's withdrawal from the Vietnam
War.
   When asked whether he meant America, Blackwell replied, ``Who
devastated Vietnam?''
   Hong Kong's 55,865 Vietnamese boat people are divided up into two
groups, those who arrived before June 16, 1988 and those who arrived
after.
   The 100,000 who arrived before that date were automatically given
refugee status and many were resettled in third countries.
Currently, about 13,000 remain in Hong Kong, awaiting resettlement.
They live in open camps and have the right to work.
   The approximately 42,000 who arrived later were placed in squalid
detention centers, which include converted ferries and several
sparse islands in Hong Kong's harbor. The colony's government
require that they prove their refugee status before giving them the
right to stay temporarily in Hong Kong.
   Over the past month, there have been numerous fights at the
camps, including a bloody battle between Vietnamese groups that left
one man dead. Cholera has broken out among other Vietnamese refugees
living in primitive conditions on outlying islands.
   Under the screening process, Hong Kong Immigration Department
handles the first application. Appeals are sent to the Refugee
Status Review Board.
   Blackwell said that most of those rejected in their first test
are expected to appeal. He said the board has heard 1,719 appeals
and overturned 136 decisions of the Immigration Department to send
the boat people back.

   Alexander Haig will reveal in a future book that
he was the ``Deep Throat'' source for many newspaper stories about
Watergate, according to a published report.
   Haig will disclose his role in his memoirs, to be published in
1992 by Warner Books, according to unidentified sources in today's
Daily News.
   Haig, a former general, former secretary of state and former
presidential candidate, also was President Nixon's last chief of
staff.
   He has denied he was ``Deep Throat,'' the source who Washington
Post reporter Bob Woodward said met him in parking garages to convey
information about the Watergate scandal.
   He reportedly will be paid $2.5 million for the book, to be named
``Inner Circles,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Deep Throat'' was the key informer Washington Post reporters
Woodward and Carl Bernstein used for their Pulitzer Prize-winning
articles uncovering the 1972 Watergate scandal.

<HEAD>Koch and Dinkins Race a Dead Heat in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in New York's tightest mayoral race in 12
years decided today whether to nominate Ed Koch for an unprecedented
fourth term or send David Dinkins on his way to becoming the city's
first black chief executive.
   Last-minute polls showed the race for the Democratic nomination a
dead heat. In the Republican primary, former U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani was expected to beat Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee
Lauder cosmetics fortune.
   For the 64-year-old Koch, the race represents a fight for his
political life. The brash, garrulous mayor of 12 years started out
far behind Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, but moved up
strongly in the polls.
   On Monday, Koch pleaded with a crowd of about 500 at a rally,
reminding them, ``I'm No. 2.''
   ```Mayday' is a signal of distress for those who are nautically
minded,'' he said. ``I'm saying to everybody who understands that
expression, I need you. Come out tomorrow. Vote for me. Mayday!
Mayday!''
   Dinkins had 48 percent and Koch 47 percent in a poll of
Democratic voters taken Sunday and Monday for WABC-TV and the Daily
News. Far back were former city transit chief Richard Ravitch and
Controller Harrison J. Goldin.
   Polls have shown Giuliani with two-thirds of the vote over
Lauder, who has spent an estimated $12 million, most of it his own,
on the race against the prosecutor who put Mafia bosses, Wall Street
cheats and corrupt politicians behind bars.
   Koch's critics have portrayed him as having lost interest in the
job and have accused of him being racially insensitive for such
things as saying last year that Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jesse Jackson.
   The softspoken Dinkins has sought to portray himself as a
conciliator who could heal divisions in the city.
   Drugs, crime and homelessness were among other major issues.
   The slaying of a black teen-ager by a gang of whites in Brooklyn
Aug. 23 brought the largely unspoken issue of race to the surface,
especially after Koch criticized blacks for holding protest marches
in the neighborhood.
   Both men pinned their hopes on turnout _ Dinkins from union
workers and blacks, Koch from Jews and mainstream Democrats.
   Koch hasn't faced a battle like this since 1977, when he first
won the office in a close fight against Mario Cuomo, now the
governor. Koch handily won his primaries in 1981 and 1985.
   On Monday, Koch and Dinkins shook hands and agreed to hold a
unity rally Wednesday no matter who wins to kick off the fall
campaign against the GOP.
   ``We gotta get started on Giuliani,'' Koch said. ``This guy's got
clay knees, and the reporters are only up to his ankles.''
   On the last full day of campaigning Monday, comedian Jackie Mason
campaigned with Giuliani in senior citizen centers. Mason said
Lauder should be ``locked up or 30 years without toilet paper'' for
his attacks on Giuliani.
   Lauder, for his part, said his polls showed ``it's going to be a
major upset.'' He toured a shopping district in Brooklyn, where one
woman told him: ``I like your mother. I use her makeup all the
time.''

   China executed two men accused of corruption and
released four who turned themselves in and admitted their guilt,
news reports said today.
   Two other men who refused to admit their guilt were given life
sentences in a group trial in a city gymnasium that was aired on
national television and reported in detail in the Beijing Daily.
   More than 2,400 people, including Beijing's Communist Party chief
and Politburo member Li Ximing, attended the sentencing.
   Last week, in a similar trial, seven people who allegedly stole
weapons from troops during the June 3-4 military attack on
pro-democracy demonstrators were given jail terms of up to 13 years.
Another seven who turned themselves in were let go.
   The government has promised leniency to all student activists
wanted by police for their activities during the pro-democracy
movement. It has issued a similar promise during its current
campaign against corruption, a major issue raised by students during
the protest movement.
   Those who refuse to admit their crimes or give themselves up are
being threatened with harsh punishment.
   In the corruption cases, Wu Keqiang, vice director of a leather
factory, was accused of illegally trading in steel, other metals and
imitation leather in deals worth $92,700 between 1981 and 1987.
   He was also charged with bribing factory managers with television
sets, refrigerators, tape recorders, cameras, electric fans,
watches, washing machines motorcycles and bicycles worth $9,000 to
set up his black market transactions.
   He was sentenced to death and executed immediately after the
meeting, the report said.
   Also sentenced to die was Shen Xiaoping, 31, a purchasing agent
for an electronics company, who was charged with stealing $105,000
by using fake receipts. The report did not say if the sentence was
carried out.
   Wang Huaiyin, manager of a construction materials plant, should
have been sentenced to death for embezzlement and accepting bribes,
the Beijing Daily said. But because he gave himself up to police
last February, he was allowed to go free.
   The court also set free three others said to have voluntarily
confessed their crimes.
   In a separate report, the Beijing daily said citizens have turned
in six submachine guns, three pistols and 644 bullets in the past 10
days. That followed a call by security forces for citizens to give
up weapons seized during the June military drive to recapture
Tiananmen Square from pro-democracy demonstrators.
   In another development, the Chinese government is erecting its
own statue on approximately the same spot on Tiananmen Square where
student demonstrators raised the ``Goddess of Democracy'' that was
to become a symbol of their movement.
   The 26-foot-high statue of a worker, peasant, soldier and
intellectual will be completed before Oct. 1 National Day
celebrations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The report said the statue will be located about 105 feet south
of the national flag pole at the northern end of the square.
   The 33-foot high Goddess of Democracy, fashioned from white
plastic foam by eight Beijing art schools, was unveiled on about the
same spot on May 30. It was destroyed when military tanks invaded
the northern end of the square on June 4.
   The student statue, modeled after the Statue of Liberty, incensed
the Chinese authorities, who said it was an ``insult to the national
image and dignity.''

<HEAD>Burmese Army Marching Dissidents to Death, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Burmese army has forced hundreds of
political prisoners to take part in brutal jungle marches that
resulted in scores of deaths, with many of the victims pro-democracy
student protesters, sources say.
   The dissidents were trucked from prisons in Rangoon in early
August to the northeastern town of Namtu and blindfolded during the
last stage of the journey, the sources said. They were then
reportedly forced to become porters for the military.
   ``Those who stumbled and fell and were unable to march were
brutally beaten to death,'' said a report received in Bangkok from
the Kachin Independence Organization, one of several ethnic rebel
groups fighting the central government.
   On Friday, a spokesman for Burma's military government, Col. Aung
Thein, denied the report. Since then, three other independent
sources have provided confirmation with varying degrees of detail.
   ``We understand that political prisoners were conscripted to
serve as porters in the north,'' one Western diplomatic source
contacted in Rangoon said. ``There they were given virtually nothing
to eat, made to walk barefoot, abused and taunted.''
   The Kachins said the prisoners were bound together by ropes in a
chain _ hand-to-hand, foot-to-foot _ and forced to each haul heavy
loads of rice over rough, jungle terrain from Mongmawo-Mongyin to
Namtu, a distance of about 25 miles.
   They were stripped, beaten and taunted by the army escorts who
shouted: ``This is what democracy is all about!,'' the Kachins said.
   The sources said up to 500 prisoners were involved in the marches.
   A junta of military officers on Sept. 18 declared a coup and
brutally ended months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the
Southeast Asian nation. New arrests began in late July following
small-scale protests and the arrest of several leading opposition
figures.
   The U.S. State Department last week charged that thousands had
been arrested during the past seven weeks and some tortured while
under detention.
   ``The United States government condemns these acts of
oppression,'' spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The Kachin report quoted one porter who escaped military control
on Aug. 12 as saying he saw 14 students who had died after being
beaten. The porter said at least three to four students died daily,
and he quoted guards as saying the prisoners were deliberately being
marched to death in the Namtu area.
   Villagers living along the Namdu-Mongmawo-Mongyin road told the
Kachins they were forced by the military to bury the dead. The
condition of the surviving prisoners was not known, the sources said.
   One source, who asked not to be identified, said he saw the group
rounded up in a football stadium in Namtu before the marches began.
He estimated that two thirds were people in their 20s while the rest
were between 30 and 40 years of age. About 20 women were reportedly
among the prisoners.
   There have been numerous previous reports of forced conscriptions
of civilians and brutal treatment of porters by the Burmese
military. Some porters who escaped have been interviewed by
journalists along the Thai-Burmese border.
   Last year, the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International published two reports it said showed ``a consistent
pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmese
military.
   Kachin as well as Palaung and Shan rebel groups operate in the
Namtu area. The sources said that the rice carried by the prisoners
had been confiscated from villagers by troops of the Burmese Army's
99th Light Infantry Division who claimed it had been stored by the
locals for the Kachin insurgents.

<HEAD>Peres Says He Accepts Most of Egyptian Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said today he
supports most of the provisions in an Egyptian peace plan and is
willing to push for a Cabinet vote if the proposal is accepted by
the Palestinians.
   The statement was likely to stir unease in Israel's joint
government, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing
Likud bloc.
   Shamir said Monday that his own peace initiative, which he
unveiled in April and was approved by the government, must be
implemented ``without any additions or eliminations.
   ``Nothing is obliging apart from the peace initiative that has
been approved by the government and the Parliament,'' Shamir said.
``Those who say other things are harming the decisions.''
   The Israeli plan calls for elections in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to choose Palestinians for talks on an interim
autonomy period, with the final status of the occupied territories
to be determined later.
   The 10-point plan proposed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
includes Israeli acceptance of the U.S.-backed concept of trading
land for peace. It also calls for allowing the 140,000 Arabs in
annexed east Jerusalem to vote.
   Those points are acceptable to Labor but not to Likud. The
Israeli proposal worked out by the two parties deliberately leaves
these issues open.
   The Israeli daily Davar said today that Shamir was willing to
show flexibility on the question of letting east Jerusalem Arabs
vote and on the possible participation of two Palestinian deportees
in peace talks in exchange for a summit with Mubarak.
   Shamir's aide, Yossi Ahimeir, denied the report and told Davar it
was ``an attempt to ignite fire within Likud by showing that Shamir
is considering some concessions.'' Davar is affiliated with the
Labor Party.
   Peres, who serves as finance minister in the government, said on
Israel army radio he would be willing to talk to a Palestinian
delegation with ``positions that would more or less conform with the
10 points.
   ``I don't think I have to accept all the 10 points or their
style,'' Peres said. ``I accept most of them, and most of them are
also accepted by the Labor's central committee,'' or the party's
governing body.
   Peres confirmed that Abba Eban, a former foreign minister and a
senior Labor politician, is likely to convey his views to Egyptian
leaders during his current visit to Cairo.
   Eban's visit coincides with one by PLO leader Yasser Arafat, and
Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar said Arafat has told Mubarak he
supports the Egyptian initiative. However, Arafat left Cairo Monday
night without making any statement.
   Two leading Israeli dailies called on the government to adopt the
Egyptian proposal, which the Haaretz newspaper termed ``a positive
document.''
   The mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot newspaper accused Shamir of
undermining his own initiative by not showing ``a minimum of
tactical flexibility.''

   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting another baby in March, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The former Sarah Ferguson and her husband, Prince Andrew, were
``very pleased'' to make the announcement, said a palace statement.
   Andrew is the second son of Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh,
and the baby will be the monarch's sixth grandchild.
   For the royal family, it provided a happy contrast to the
announcement Aug. 30 that Andrew's older sister, Princess Anne, is
separating from her husband of nearly 16 years, Mark Phillips.
   If the new baby is a boy, he will supercede his sister,
13-month-old Princess Beatrice, to become fifth in line to the
throne. A girl would follow Beatrice as sixth in line.
   The palace said the duchess was ``in excellent health,'' and was
expected to fulfill her existing program of engagements, while
scaling down her activities toward the end of the year.
   Andrew, 29, a navy lieutenant, was attending a refresher
helicopter course at Portland navy base in southern England when the
announcement was made.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be age 30 in October, was
attending a literary luncheon, having recently written and published
two children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``Budgie at Bendick's Point'' and ``Budgie The Little
Helicopter'' are dedicated to Andrew and Beatrice respectively.
   Sarah and Andrew are both licensed helicopter pilots.

   An explosion and fire struck a chemical plant
early today as workers were repairing damage from a blast three
months ago, authorities said. One person was killed and at least 15
were reported injured.
   At least six of the injured were in critical condition, said
hospital officials.
   Witnesses said they could see flames shooting into the air from
10 miles away. Others said they were jolted awake by the explosion
at the Quantum Chemical Corp. plant near this town 50 miles
southwest of Chicago.
   The 2:44 a.m. blast was caused by a leak of flammable ethylene
gas, said Tim Crowley, Quantum manager of administration. The
ethylene unit was being repaired after an explosion and fire that
had shut the plant since June 7.
   The injured were Quantum workers and maintenance contractors,
said Larry Oetzel, technical manager at Quantum.
   Killed was was Robert Brown, 36, of Morris, a contract worker,
Oetzel said. As many as 24 workers were at the scene when the blast
occurred, Crowley said.
   Some of the injured were sprayed with ethylene, which the plant
combines with propylene to make plastic pellets, officials said. The
pellets are used to make garbage bags, storage containers, tackle
boxes and battery cases.
   The plant was shut down since the June 7 explosion, which was
blamed on a leak of propane and propylene gas, Oetzel said. Workers
were ``trying to bring that ethylene unit back up'' when today's
blast occurred, Oetzel said.
   The plant is across the street from a residential area and is
surrounded mostly by farmland. The fire was still burning four hours
after the explosion but was contained, Oetzel said. The fire
produced no hazardous fumes, he said.

   A ruffled pink dress concealed the tubes that
have sustained her since birth, but nothing could hide the
excitement of a toddler planning to leave a hospital where she has
lived all her life.
   Ogechi Anyanwu waved and smiled and called frequently for her
pacifier at a news conference to announce she will leave the Johns
Hopkins Children's Center Wednesday for a hospital in Missouri,
where her parents, who are from Nigeria, plan to live.
   ``Her progress has been excellent and her prognosis for leading a
normal life is terrific,'' said Dr. David Dudgeon, Ogechi's
pediatric surgeon.
   Ogechi weighed barely more than 2 pounds when she was born
prematurely at Hopkins in October 1986. Within 10 days, she
developed an intestinal disease called neonatal necrotizing
enterocolitis, which kills bowel tissue.
   The disease, which strikes about one premature baby in 100,
spread quickly in Ogechi. Doctors had to remove 80 percent of her
small intestine and 50 percent of her colon.
   Without a normal intestine, Ogechi is unable to eat solid food.
Even when she rides her tricycle, a machine holding three bags that
supply her with nutrients must trail behind her.
   Two pumps provide a mixture of fats, proteins and sugars, which
she receives intravenously. Another provides 80 percent of her
calories, which she receives in a tube to her stomach.
   To give her something to taste, doctors have occasionally treated
her to tiny sponges flavored with lemon extract.
   ``It's a far cry from ice cream, but it's something,'' Dudgeon
said.
   Ogechi's condition is exacerbated by diarrhea and frequent
infections. She must take antibiotics regularly, and has returned to
surgery more than a dozen times for repairs to her intestinal tract
and insertion of intravenous lines for feeding.
   Despite her lifelong hospitalization, doctors say Ogechi is
developmentally normal. She weighs a robust 35 pounds and has an
advanced vocabulary.
   ``How many 3-year-olds do you know who know how to say
`stethoscope?''' asked Dudgeon.
   ``She is full of joy, love, very rambunctious and very giving.
She is truly a people person,'' said Maura Mahon, a nurse who cared
for Ogechi her first year.
   Nurse Mary Kay Alford, who has cared for Ogechi the past year,
said: ``Aside from the fact that normal 3-year-olds don't get their
temperatures taken every four hours around the clock, we try to give
her as normal a life as possible.''
   Alford will escort the child to University Hospital in Columbia,
Mo., where Ogechi's parents, Longinus and Edith, live. Her father
teaches computer science at Columbia College.
   Ogechi's doctors anticipate the toddler will be released from the
Missouri hospital within several months.
   Dudgeon said Ogechi's intestines have recently doubled in length
and grown in diameter, which will soon allow her to eat food
normally.
   ``I expect that within a matter of months she will be eating
solid food, although she might have to stay away from real spicy
pizza,'' Dudgeon said.

<HEAD>Detroit's Mayor Gets Easy Odds to Win Primary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters went to the polls in a primary today with
Mayor Coleman Young a sure bet to advance to November's runoff for
an unprecedented fifth term.
   The real question was who would finish second _ 13-term U.S. Rep.
John Conyers or accountant Tom Barrow.
   The top two vote-getters in the 13-way, non-partisan primary will
meet in the runoff, and political analyst and racing handicapper
Bill Ballenger judged Young a 4-5 favorite _ better than even _ to
finish first or second.
   Young's challengers have charged that the 71-year-old mayor has
been in office too long, and they ran what were dubbed ``ABC''
campaigns, for ``Anyone But Coleman.'' The dean of America's black
mayors branded his challengers ``Uncle Toms.''
   Slightly more than 30 percent of the city's registered voters
were expected to go to the polls, Deputy City Clerk Jeff Blaine
said. Turnout for the last mayoral primary, in 1985, was 23 percent,
he said.
   Ballenger, who publishes a newsletter on Michigan politics and is
the race handicapper for the Detroit Free Press, said Conyers was a
slight favorite over Barrow, while City Council President Erma
Henderson had a slight chance of finishing in the top two.
   Barrow, who like Young, Conyers and Henderson is black, is
thought to have a strong chance of finishing No. 2 because of his
appeal among whites, who make up about 25 percent of Detroit's
507,000 registered voters. Barrow got more than 55 percent of the
white vote in the 1985 primary but lost to Young 61-39 percent in
the general election.
   Conyers and Barrow have accused the mayor of neglecting
neighborhoods at the expense of downtown development and not doing
enough about drug use among police.
   Conyers, a late entry in the race, picked up the endorsement of
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who exhorted a crowd Monday to ``keep hope
alive'' by voting for Conyers. Barrow, who led last year's
opposition to Young's third effort to bring casino gambling to
Detroit, has been endorsed by a few unions and church leaders; most
have committed to Young.
   One matter that put Young into the headlines a few months ago _
the disclosure that he fathered a child by a former city
administrator _ hasn't been much of an issue.

   The man who directed the Miss America
Pageant for 35 years, firing Bert Parks and presiding over the
dethroning of Vanessa Williams, was in critical condition today
after suffering a heart attack.
   Albert A. Marks Jr., 76, was stricken at home Monday and taken to
Shore Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Margie Barham.
   Marks retired in 1988 after directing the pageant as a volunteer
for 35 years. He was succeeded by lawyer Leonard Horn, the pageant's
first full-time, paid director. Marks was stricken days before this
year's pageant.
   ``Of course, the pageant will go on,'' Horn said of this week's
preliminaries and finals Saturday night. ``Al, above all, would
understand that.''
   As director, Marks had the final say in every aspect of the
pageant, from the production numbers to the judges to the volunteer
hostesses who chaperone the 51 contestants.
   Marks, an investment broker, carried the pageant from a publicity
stunt designed to extend Atlantic City's summer resort season into a
multimillion-dollar TV production.
   He defended the pageant from criticism from the women's movement,
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
labor organizations and others.
   Marks fired host Parks, replacing him first with actor Ron Ely
and then with the current host, Gary Collins. Parks was host from
1955 to 1979, singing ``There She Is'' as the pageant's winner
walked down the runway.
   Marks also presided over the board of directors when it lifted
the crown of Miss America 1984, Vanessa Williams, after nude photos
of her appeared in Penthouse.
   In the 1960s, Marks was the first to suggest dropping the
controversial swimsuit competition, but was overruled by pageant
directors and fans. Horn has since tried to reduce the significance
of the swimsuit contest by lowering its value in the judging.

<HEAD>Appeal Begins for Man Convicted of Killing Swedish Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BITTE LARSSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the man convicted of killing
Prime Minister Olof Palme asked an appellate court today to overturn
the ruling for lack of evidence.
   ``He totally lacked a motive to murder Palme,'' defense attorney
Arne Liljeros said of Christer Pettersson, who was convicted in July
of the 1986 shooting and was sentenced to life in prison.
   Liljeros said Pettersson sympathized with Palme's politics and
admired the Social Democratic leader. Liljeros also said there was
no forensic evidence pointing to Pettersson as the killer.
   Palme and his wife, Lisbeth, were walking home from a late movie
on Feb. 28, 1986, when an assailant shot Palme and wounded his wife.
   Pettersson, 42, had been convicted in a split decision by the
lower District Court jury, with six lay jurors voting to convict and
the panel's two professional judges voting to acquit.
   The conviction came even though no motive was established, no
murder weapon was found and no one saw Pettersson shoot Palme.
   The Svea Court of Appeals, which will hear many of the 43
witnesses who testified in the lower court, consists of four
professional judges and three lay jurors. Two new witnesses were
also scheduled to testify.
   The prosecution today asked the court to change Pettersson's
conviction of endangerment in the shooting of Mrs. Palme to one of
attempted murder. Asking for stiffer sentences during appeals is the
prosecution's prerogative under the Swedish system.
   The lay jurors in the lower court based their judgment heavily on
the testimony of Mrs. Palme, who said she saw Pettersson standing
nearby just after her husband was shot. She did not testify to
seeing him with a gun, however.
   Liljeros complained he had not been allowed in the room when Mrs.
Palme picked out Pettersson in a police lineup after Pettersson's
arrest in December.
   ``I haven't heard any statements, seen any reactions or been able
to pose any questions,'' about the first identification by Mrs.
Palme, Liljeros said.
   Arguments in the appeal were scheduled to end Oct. 5.
   If the lower court's decision is overturned, Pettersson must be
released immediately.

   Unusually large squadrons of hostile yellow
jacket wasps, joined by an aggressive new species, are sending
people to hospitals along the West Coast.
   ``Those suckers are eating us alive,'' said Ruth Budesa, of the
Northern California town of Sonora.
   At least one horse died after disturbing a nest of the
meat-eating yellow jacket, also known as the meat bee.
   ``One sting is enough to kill a hypersensitive human,'' said
George Poinar, an entomologist at the University of California,
Berkeley. ``Fifty to 75 stings are enough to kill a normal human.''
   Last weekend, more than 20 sting victims sought aid at the
Yosemite National Park clinic, including a woman who went into
shock. Rangers say more than 100 people have been treated for wasp
stings in the past three weeks.
   ``This in my 10 years of experience is the worst I've ever seen
for meat bees,'' sad Ed Heneveld, who works in the Tahoe Forest
Hospital emergency room in Truckee. ``I've treated five people
myself who have been stung inside the mouth.''
   Entomologists say last winter's mild weather allowed more wasps
to survive. In addition, a new and aggressive strain of wasps from
northern Europe has settled on the West Coast, the entomologists
said.
   The Germanica species builds nests to house 5,000 to 6,000
workers. The native California species builds nests for only 150 to
300 workers.
   In addition to California, heavy activity has been reported in
Oregon and as far north as British Columbia, said Roger Akre, a
University of Washington entomologist.
   ``The beaches are just humming with them right now,'' said Glenn
Bissell of the El Dorado County Health Department. Bissell said
traps he set out in the Lake Tahoe area are catching more than 50
wasps a week, the worst in a decade.

   Despite her governing Labor Party's worst
electoral showing since 1930, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
seems likely to remain in office.
   When the dust settled from Monday's turbulent national vote, the
balance of power seemed to have changed little because the
conservative opposition also lost ground.
   Voters had switched allegiances as never before.
   A radical right-wing party went into the election with two
parliament seats and came out with 22. A far-left party doubled its
strength.
   ``This election clearly shows that the new generation is sick and
tired of the old parties,'' said Trygve Bull, a retired educator and
former leftist politician.
   As in the 1985 election, Mrs. Brundtland and her allies were left
just shy of a majority. But it was unclear if the opposition parties
could overcome their disunity to unseat her.
   According to official results with all but the absentee ballots
counted, Labor won 63 seats in an expanded 165-seat parliament, or
Storting, and 17 seats went to its allied Socialist Left Party. The
three-party non-socialist alliance _ Conservatives, Christian
Democrats and Center Party _ received 62 seats.
   Shunned as a partner by all other parties, the rightist Party of
Progress swept up 22 seats in a stunning performance that indicated
widespread disenchantment with the social welfare policies of the
last 40 years.
   A lone independent won a seat on a local list after he broke with
Labor.
   Labor was hurt by record unemployment of 5 percent and discontent
among this country's 4.2 million people with a growing shortage of
hospital facilities, day-care centers and care for the aged. About
82.4 percent of registered voters turned out.
   Official results showed Labor with 896,717 votes, or 34.3 percent
of the ballots, down 6.5 percent from the 39.8 percent it polled
four years ago. The Conservatives had 580,425 votes and 22.2 percent
of the vote.
   The Progress Party won 340,461 votes for 13 percent of the total,
nearly triple its percentage from the last election, and the
Socialist Left's 261,814 votes represented 10 percent, or nearly
double its past percentage.
   In a post-election television debate of party leaders, Mrs.
Brundtland watched silently while her opponents traded
recriminations. ``You are the ones creating chaos,'' one accused the
rest.
   Despite the setback, Mrs. Brundtland said she had no intention to
quit, and doubted that any center-right alliance could last for
long. ``A non-socialist coalition could break up at any time,'' she
said.
   Her refusal to step down meant the opposition would have to
defeat her in a no-confidence motion when parliament convenes on
Oct. 2.
   Opposition leader Jan P. Syse of the Conservative Party, which
also suffered heavy losses, admitted that ``it was not the best
result for forming an alternative government.''
   The opposition parties were split over tax issues, welfare
programs, agricultural subsidies, relations with the European
Community and immigration policies.
   Carl I. Hagen, the Progress party's blunt-speaking leader, said
he was prepared to help topple the Labor government in a
no-confidence vote and to negotiate a majority government. But he
accused the other non-socialists of locking him out.
   ``You say no to even entering the room to discuss the question
with us,'' he said in the television debate, blaming them for the
chaos in the rightist camp.
   ``The next government will have to be a minority government,''
said Center Party leader Johan J. Jakobsen. ``The 12 percent who
voted for the Progress party can't dictate policies that the other
88 percent of voters will have to live with.''

<TEXT>
   One hundred white paper flowers were laid on a
street in London's Chinatown today, marking 100 days since the
Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   Chen Yizi, the highest-ranking official known to have escaped
China since the June 3-4 crackdown, led the ceremony in Gerrard
Street attended by about 50 supporters.
   It was part of a number of events held worldwide to mark the
military crackdown, in which the respected human rights group
Amnesty International estimates at least 1,000 people died.
   ``It is important to remember what happened and why it
happened,'' said a Chinese poet, Duo Duo. ``Today is a day to
remember Tiananmen (Square), which was a humiliation to us all, to
humanity and for all mankind.''
   At the ceremony, Chinese students and supporters laid the flowers
in an arrangement spelling the Chinese word for grief and a refugee
played a tape of gunshots that rang out in the square when soldiers
moved in to break up a sit-in by demonstrators.
   The ceremony was organized by a group called the June 4 China
Support and China Appeal.
   Chen is former head of the Institute of Restructuring the
Economy, an organ of the state council, or cabinet, and was a close
advisor to the purged Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang.
   He arrived in London Saturday with fellow exile, Wan Runnan, the
founder of a computer company.

   The skeletal remains of thousands of American
Indians will be buried in their native soil under an agreement
announced today by the Smithsonian Institution, members of Congress
and Indian leaders.
   ``Today, a process has started that will allow the ancestors of
native Americans to at last find their final resting place,'' said
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs. ``It's a day that will be celebrated by
Indian leaders throughout Indian country.''
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., an American Indian who was
instrumental in achieving the compromise, said the provisions would
be included in a bill before the House that will establish a
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington.
   ``Under this agreement, the Smithsonian is going to inventory the
human remains and funerary objects, which are those objects that are
placed in gravesites with Indian people when they are buried,''
Campbell said at a news conference.
   ``Those remains that can be identifed, either specifically or by
the name of tribe, the Smithsonian will notify the individuals in
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them.''
   The agreement represents a change of thinking by the
administration of the Smithsonian, which previously had said the
bones were necessary for scientific study, said institution
Secretary Robert McC. Adams.
   ``I should make clear there's a deep sense of loss on the part of
many scientists at the Smithsonian,'' he said.
   But Adams said he was persuaded by years of listening to
anguished Indians and reading about the atrocities committed against
Indians during this country's western expansion.
   ``That becomes a weight that one ultimately cannot carry,'' he
said.
   Suzan Harjo, head of the National Congress of American Indians,
said the Smithsonian was setting a precedent bound to influence
museums all over the country, which have the remains of an estimated
600,000 Indians.
   ``There is no doubt about it _ the Smithsonian is king of the
hill when it comes to setting policy,'' she said.
   The Smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, most of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. About
4,000 remains came from the Army Medical Museum and were transferred
to the Smithsonian at the turn of the century. Many of those were
the result of grave-robbing.
   Indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several
years on religious grounds. But Adams had said the Smithsonian would
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or
traced to living descendants. In the last 18 months, only the
remains of 18 Blackfeet were returned, according to Adams.
   Inouye and Campbell are sponsoring bills to establish a National
Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The museum would be
created when the collection of the Museum of the American Indian in
New York City is transferred to the Smithsonian. The shift can't
take place without legislation providing funds and giving the
Smithsonian authority to build.
   The Smithsonian said last week it would keep a museum at the
current site in upper Manhattan in addition to building a Washington
museum. The New York museum's collection is the world's largest
collection of Indian artifacts.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers today approved the Soviet bloc's
first government led by non-Communists after Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki urged them to change virtually every aspect of Polish
life.
   The vote was 402 in favor of Mazowiecki's Cabinet, none against
and 13 abstentions.
   Mazowiecki, smiling, lifted his hands in the ``V'' for victory
sign that for so long represented illegal opposition to the
Communist government. The parliament rose to applaud.
   ``My biggest dream has come true,'' he said.
   The names of the new Cabinet ministers were read, with the
loudest ovation going to Jacek Kuron, the new labor minister who
spent nine years in prison for his opposition activism.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who turned down a chance to lead
the new administration to remain a private citizen, promised full
support to the new government headed ``by one of us.
   ``For the first time in half a century, Poland has a government
that can be considered by millions of people as their own,'' he said
in Gdansk.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said of the new government: ``We are prepared to cooperate with that
government and develop our relations with Poland.''
   After the vote on the Cabinet, Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski's nominee to head the National Bank, Communist Politburo
member Wladyslaw Baka, was approved by a 230-43 vote, with 83
abstentions.
   The Communists retain four posts in the 23-member Cabinet,
including the strategic ministries of defense and internal affairs.
They also will run the transportation and foreign trade departments.
   Mazowiecki, a Solidarity editor who last month became the East
bloc's first non-Communist prime minister in more than four decades,
promised in a speech before the vote that his government would
overhaul all institutions previously controlled by the Communists.
   He said the country's economic crisis was swelling the ranks of
the poor and called for immediate action against the triple-digit
inflation, including Western tax reform, making the zloty
convertible with Western currency and creating a stock exchange.
   ``The new government will act under the pressure that at any
moment the construction of democracy that only just started can
collapse under the economic crisis,'' he said.
   Marian Orzechowski, the Politburo member who heads the Communist
parliament delegation, rose to support Mazowiecki.
   ``My party is not going into opposition,'' Orzechowski said. ``We
will govern together, and together be responsible for the fate of
the nation.''
   Mazowiecki also outlined plans for putting the security apparatus
and the judiciary under what he termed ``social control'' _ even
though the Communist incumbent was nominated to continue as head of
the ministry overseeing them.
   He said he would free the judicial system of political influence,
amend laws on association, gatherings and censorship and create a
new democratic constitution.
   The new prime minister received an ovation as he, Jaruzelski and
lawmakers convened in the bustling, columned parliament chamber.
   ``I am coming as a man of Solidarity, faithful to the legacy of
August'' 1980, when the union became the first legal labor
federation in the East bloc, Mazowiecki told parliament.
   Communist authorities reinstated Solidarity in April after a
seven-year ban and union-backed candidates won all but one seat they
were allowed to contest in elections the next month, which were
Poland's freest in more than 40 years.
   After speaking for 40 minutes and taking several sips of water,
Mazowiecki, looking exhausted but composed, asked for a recess.
   He was examined by doctors who found no serious problems, said
Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a senator and Solidarity activist.
   The prime minister nominated 23 people to Cabinet-level posts, 11
as ministers. Solidarity will have 12 votes on the Council of
Ministers because Mazowiecki is also a member.
   The candidate for the Foreign Ministry is considered an
independent.
   Mazowiecki was elected prime minister Aug. 24 after Communist
Prime Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak resigned when he was unable to
form a government.
   The Communists have four Cabinet posts, and the Peasant Party and
the Democratic Party, which switched their long alliance with the
Communist Party to form a coalition with Solidarity last month,
received four and three posts respectively.
   Once in place, the Solidarity government must cope with a $39
billion foreign debt and a work force demoralized by long lines for
scarce, poor quality goods.

   The Bush administration will hold admissions of
refugees to the United States to 125,000 in the next fiscal year, an
increase of slightly less than 8 percent from this year, the
chairman of a House panel said today.
   The administration, which doubled the allotment for people from
the Soviet Union this year to 50,000, has decided the country cannot
handle more and will leave the figure the same for the year
beginning Oct. 1, said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who heads the
House subcommittee on immigration.
   But Morrison, speaking at the start of subcommittee hearings
about the administration's proposed plan, said the government's
proposal only provides funding for 84,000 refugees.
   ``Where do we get the money for the rest?'' he asked a panel of
private witnesses. Government officials will testify Wednesday.
   Morrison also expressed concern about the backlog of an estimated
20,000 Soviet emigres in Rome and Vienna awaiting U.S. decisions on
their eligibility to enter this country. He said the administration
had wasted money through this processing method and changes would
have to be considered.
   The administration would like to shut down the Vienna and Rome
facilities and handle all applications at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
by increasing the current staff of several processors to more than
two dozen.
   Morrison said Congress will also debate pending legislation that
would determine the criteria for granting refugee status to Soviet
and other emigres.
   Under a revision of regulations ordered last year, each person
applying must prove individual eligibility for refugee status, which
means government aid in resettlement and admission outside the
normal immigration rules. Previously, Jews from the Soviet Union
were automatically considered refugees.
   The new decision has made the backlog grow.
   The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps resettle Soviet
Jews, told Morrison's subcommittee that 46 percent of the applicants
in Moscow had been rejected for refugee status.
   Karl Zukerman, executive vice president of the organization,
predicted that at least 72,000 Jews will apply to enter the United
States next fiscal year.
   Overall, this year's refugee quota, arrived at by the
administration each year in consultation with the House and Senate
Judiciary committees, is 116,000 people, up from 94,000 at the start
of the 1988 fiscal year last Oct. 1.
   The 125,000 figure for next year would include 4,000 whose
resettlement would be paid for by private organizations.
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the number of people facing
persecution around the world grows every day, at the same time as
U.S. budget resources are shrinking. He urged other countries to
help the United States share the burden.

   Alexander Haig today denied as ``totally
untrue'' a published report saying he would reveal in a future book
that he was the ``Deep Throat'' source for many newspaper stories
about Watergate.
   ``My efforts then and now have been to preserve the presidency,
not to tear it down,'' said Haig, who was Richard Nixon's chief of
staff in his last 16 months in office.
   ``The story regarding my being `Deep Throat' is totally untrue,''
Haig said.
   The New York Daily News, quoting unnamed sources, said Haig would
disclose that he was ``Deep Throat'' in his memoirs, to be published
in 1992 by Warner Books.
   Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who
wrote many of the stories that led to exposure of the Watergate
scandal that brought about Nixon's resignation, have conistently
refused to identify ``Deep Throat,'' who they said was a major
inside source.
   The Washington Post won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
public service for its Watergate coverage.
   Haig came to the White House with the Nixon administration in
1969, serving as military assistant to the president and to National
Security Adviser Henry Kissinger until 1973. He left briefly to be
vice chief of staff of the Army and returned to succeed White House
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, who had resigned in the Watergate
affair. He served as secretary of state early in the Reagan
administration.

<HEAD>Tentative Accord Reached in Sacramento Teachers' Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,400 teachers began returning to work today in Sacramento,
Calif., after reaching a tentative contract agreement in the
nation's biggest school strike. Teachers also ended walkouts in
Illinois and Michigan.
   The settlements left some 5,300 teachers on strike, affecting
more than 93,000 students in eight states.
   Details on the agreement that ended the two-week Sacramento
strike were not released, but union spokeswoman Pat Walden said
major issues in the contract are salary, class size and working
conditions in the 47,000-student district. Teacher salaries average
$32,509.
   Substitutes, administrators and non-striking teachers had kept
schools open.
   In Illinois, negotiations solved a teachers' strike in Quincy but
did little to end the state's largest walkout, in Elgin, or avert a
new one in the Chicago suburb of Roselle.
   Quincy's 6,800 students headed back for a half day of school
today and faced a full day Wednesday for the first time in two
weeks, said superintendent Myrl Shireman.
   But 1,500 teachers and 27,000 students were still off the job in
Elgin, west of Chicago, where teachers worked four days without a
contract before walking out Sept. 5. They were joined by about 250
school employees in Roselle, who voted to strike Monday.
   In Michigan, students returned to class today in the
Melvindale-North Allen Park, Ferndale, Ishpeming and Saginaw
Township districts. Strikes continued in four other districts.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced
today a nine-month extension of the current sugar import quota year
and an increase of about 860,000 tons in the amount of foreign sugar
that can be imported.
   Import quotas are used to protect domestic producers from cheaper
foreign sugar being dumped on the U.S. market.
   The original 1989 quota year began Jan. 1 and was to have ended
Dec. 31. The extension lets the quota year run through Sept. 30,
1990.
   ``This change puts quota shipments for the new 21-month quota
period at a somewhat higher level on a 12-month equivalent basis
than the previously announced quota of 1,125,255 metric tons,''
Yeutter said in a statement.
   Now, with the extension, the new 1989-90 quota will be 1,986,950
tons, an average of 94,617 tons per month, or a 12-month equivalent
of about 1,135,400 tons _ an increase of about 1 percent from the
old quota.
   Yeutter said the change in the quota was ``an action
independent'' of a ruling earlier this year by the General Agreement
on Tariff and Trade that the U.S. sugar import quotas are in
violation of international trading rules.
   ``We are continuing to look at the options for bringing these
quotas into conformity with the GATT, but a decision on how to do
this has not been made,'' he said.
   ``In the interim, this modification of the import quota and the
quota period is necessary to correct for a tightness in our sugar
market, particularly during the last quarter of this calendar
year,'' Yeutter said.
   Shipping patterns are being adjusted to assure that 135,000 tons
of the increase provided by the stretched quota period are allowed
to enter the United States during the October-December quarter, he
said.
   ``We will continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis whether
additional modifications in the quota are necessary,'' Yeutter said.
   New country-by-country quota allocations were announced today by
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   The allocations include a reallocation of Panama's initial quota
of 30,537 tons and leave 23,403 tons of the new Panama quota
unallocated and ``not yet authorized for shipment to the United
States,'' the announcement said.
   Panama's remaining 23,403 tons ``may subsequently be allocated to
other countries, as was done in 1988 and as has just been done for
their initial quota allocation of 30,537 metric tons,'' it said.
   Other allocations for the period Jan. 1, 1989 through Sept. 30,
1990, in metric tons of 2,205 pounds each, include:
   Argentina, 81,366.

   Police and FBI officials said
they would study videotapes today of a weekend riot at a paper mill
to learn who incited the mob violence against non-union construction
workers.
   ``If we have 200 trials, so be it,'' City Attorney Joseph Boyle
told the City Council on Monday.
   Koochiching County Attorney Dave Johnson, who charged six people
Monday with a variety of counts, said he would file charges today
against 18 others arrested in the violence Saturday at the Boise
Cascade Corp. mill.
   In addition, four union mill workers were suspended while company
officials determine if they participated, said Boise spokesman Bob
Anderson, a former mayor of the town of 6,500 on the Canada border.
   During the weekend melee, rioters set fire to vacant trailers,
overturned cars and threw rocks. Law enforcement officers used tear
gas to break up the crowd and arrested 31 people. Five people were
injured, and damage was estimated at $1.3 million.
   The melee involved mostly union construction workers angered by
the use of non-union labor on the mill's $535 million expansion
project.
   Police planned to join FBI agents and sheriff's officials in
studying videotapes police made Saturday to determine who instigated
the violence.
   Earlier, police watching the tape identified five or six people,
who will be arrested and charged, Johnson said. A meeting between
company and union officials also was planned for this afternoon to
review the tapes, Anderson said.
   ``There could be a penalty up to and including discharge,''
Anderson said. ``If there is nothing found the employees will be
paid as if they worked all their hours.''
   ``If they start going after the mill employees they'll have a
real mess on their hands,'' said Bruce Ness, a 20-year mill employee
who was one of the four suspended. Also suspended was Ness's father.
   ``We were just standing on the street watching,'' Bruce Ness
said. ``I guess Boise Cascade is trying to say we don't have any of
our own civil rights.''
   Union leaders condemned Saturday's riot but said violence could
break out again.
   An FBI agent arrived in International Falls because some rioters
crossed state lines to get to the Boise plant, Johnson said. Two of
the six people charged Monday were from Michigan; the others from
Minnesota.
   The charges against the six included riot, damage to property,
arson, trespassing and assault, Johnson said. They appeared before a
judge who set the maximum bail in each case of $13,000 to $30,000.
   All six remained in jail, along with 18 others arrested, Johnson
said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Wins Order to Stop Stockbrokers' Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer fed up with unsolicited sales calls has
won a court order barring the nation's biggest brokerage and its
12,000 stockbrokers from calling him at work.
   ``It's been something that has bothered a lot of people, but they
don't have the sense they can do something about it,'' said Alan J.
Schlesinger.
   Merrill Lynch said it will appeal the order, which was issued
June 2 in Superior Court and was reported today in The Boston Globe.
   William Fitzpatrick, general counsel for the Securities Industry
Association, said, ``It sounds like he's using an atom bomb to deal
with a gnat.''
   ``Being a fellow lawyer, I guess he doesn't have enough brains to
hang up,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   Schlesinger said he took action after getting a couple of
unsolicited calls from stockbrokers every month for years. In 1984
and 185 he wrote to Merrill Lynch _ the most persistent firm _
asking that it order its brokers to stop calling.
   The last straw came in 1988 when Schlesinger returned a call from
an woman in New York and found she was a Merrill Lynch broker with
an investment proposal. ``At that point, I said I am going to get
their attention,'' he said.
   Fred Yager, a Merrill Lynch vice president, said he believes the
company will win on appeal.
   ``We have 12,000 brokers working for us alone,'' he said. ``It's
virtually impossible to prevent another call from getting through to
him accidentally.''
   Merrill Lynch said that after Schlesinger won the court order it
asked its Boston-area brokers to stop calling him. Two week later, a
Merrill Lynch broker who said he was unaware of the court order
called Schlesinger with a sales pitch.
   Schlesinger filed for contempt charges and was awarded $300 in
court costs.

<TEXT>
   Congress is being asked to designate journalist
Terry Anderson's birthday next month as a national day of prayer for
the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., today introduced a joint resolution to
mark Oct. 27 as National Hostage Awareness Day. The resolution says
church bells should be rung for one minute at noon that day.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and has been held the longest
of any of the eight Americans still believed to be alive.
   Anderson will be 42 on Oct. 27.
   ``It's ... an exercise in conscience for the American people, so
we can say we did what we could,'' Henry said at a news conference.
``This is something we want to have all Americans rally behind.''
   Also at the news conference was David Aikman, foreign affairs
correspondent for Time magazine and chairman of the Journalists'
Committee to Free Terry Anderson.
   Aikman said other activities being planned for Oct. 27 include a
nationwide essay writing contest for high school students, who will
write on the subject, ``How I would cope with being a hostage.'' The
winner will receive $1,000.
   The contest and awareness day are intended to keep international
attention forcused on the hostages as publicity over the presumed
murder of hostage Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins fades, Henry said.

   Federal agents seized more than 2,700 pounds of
cocaine and a freighter and arrested 19 people in the biggest drug
busts since President Bush announced his battle plan against drug
trafficking, officials said.
   Seven Danish crew members of the freighter were ordered held
without bail Monday. Their ship was seized the day before and
authorities found more than 1,100 pounds of cocaine in bales thrown
overboard. Also arrested were six people waiting aboard speedboats
nearby to pick up the drug, officials said.
   On Monday, agents seized a 42-foot fishing boat and claimed an
additional 1,600 pounds of cocaine, Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman John Fernandes said today. Six people were arrested.
   The freighter, registered in the South Pacific island nation of
Vanuatu, was intercepted in Bahamian waters. Fifteen bales of
cocaine floating alongside and three speedboats were also seized,
authorities said. Another bale was found on the freighter.
   Each 70-pound bale consisted of plastic packages bundled around
flotation devices.
   At a hearing Monday, authorities said it was unusual for Danes to
be arrested in drug cases in the area.
   ``At first I couldn't find a Danish interpreter,'' said the head
of federal court interpreters for Miami, Irene King-Tomassini.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's Cali cocaine cartel is more
efficient than its more well-known Medellin counterpart and as a
result, it may be shipping more drugs to the United States,
according to a Senate report today.
   The report by the Senate permanent subcommittee on
investigation's minority staff says U.S. law enforcement agencies
agree the Cali cartel, ``although smaller in number, runs a much
more businesslike, less high-profile operation than the Medellin
cartel.''
   ``Medellin appears to be more loosely organized, informal and
spontaneous in its operational style than Cali,'' the report says.
``In fact, some law enforcement officials believe Cali actually
ships more cocaine to the United States than Medellin.''
   Mary Vincent, who presented the report, said there are estimates
that the Medellin cartel has as many as 100,000 members, and the
Cali cartel from 2,500 to 6,000 members.
   Bruce M. Carnes, a top aide to national drug control policy
director William Bennett, told the subcommittee that ``the enemy is
the organizations that produce cocaine and other dangerous drugs,
transport it to our shores, distribute it to retailers and users
throughout America, and launder the profits and return them to the
organizations' coffers.''
   The objective of the war on drugs, he said, ``is to put these
organizations out of business, dismantle them.''
   Under questioning by subcommittee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
Carnes acknowedged that the two primary measures of drug abuse in
the United States, the household survey by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse and a high school survey, are not comprehensive.
   The household survey does not measure use by students in dorms or
people in institutions and the survey of high school seniors does
not take into account those young people who have dropped out of
school.
   ``So basically what you're saying is after 20 years of fighting
the so-called war against drugs that's been declared by at least
four to five presidents of both political parties...we still not
only don't have adequate tools and we aren't using the tools in the
right direction, and the ones we are using to measure our success or
failure are not even developed yet. Is that too strong?'' Nunn asked.
   ``This glass is half full in my view and I think we're better
than we used to be,'' Carnes said.
   The subcommittee report says Fabio Castillo, a Colombian
journalist who fled his native country due to threats from drug
traffickers and who was to testify before the subcommittee today,
``believes that Cali is indeed the more significant of the two
cartels.''
   A rivalry between the Medellin and Cali organizations ``does not
yet appear to have either threatened the existence or significantly
affected the operations of these two cartels,'' says the report,
which was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
   Sen. William V. Roth, Jr., R-Del., the panel's ranking minority
member, said the report and hearings this week are ``the first major
public effort to expose in detail these organizations, their
membership, and their methods of operation.''
   ``We can't win the war on drugs if we don't know the enemy,''
Roth said in a statement.
   Administration drug experts say 80 percent of the cocaine in the
United States is processed in and shipped from Colombia, although 60
percent of the coca leaf is grown in Peru, 30 percent in Bolivia and
only 10 percent in Colombia.
   While the report confirms the belief that the Medellin and Cali
cartels dominate the cocaine trade in the Western Hemisphere, it
notes ``secondary trafficking groups'' along Colombia's north coast
``rent a variety of their smuggling services'' to the top two and
conduct their own trafficking operations.
   Larger drug trafficking organizations are run like corporations,
with each stage of the cocaine processing and distribution handled
by a separate department, the report says.
   ``We found definite indications that a trafficker of the stature
of (Medellin cartel leader Jose Gonzalo) Rodriguez Gacha, for
example, will have his own (coca) paste suppliers, his own
laboratories, his own stash sites and his own warehouses in the
United States,'' the report says.
   The report, resulting from a year-long investigation, does not
attempt to determine how the organizations may have been changed or
disrupted by the crackdown imposed by Colombian President Virgilio
Barco.

<HEAD>Hassan Calls for Arafat Address to United Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan called on the
Bush administration today to permit Yasser Arafat, the chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, to address the United Nations
in New York.
   ``We think Arafat should be granted diplomatic recognition,''
Hassan said after a 45-minute meeting with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   Jordan nearly 20 years ago suppressed the PLO and killed
thousands of its Palestinian supporters. But King Hussein's
government now demands a role for the PLO in the Arab drive to force
Israel to relinquish the West Bank and Gaza.
   The territories, held by Jordan and Egypt until the 1967 Mideast
War, are now under Israeli control. The PLO demands establishment of
a state on the land, while the United States supports an Israeli
proposal for limited self-rule to be followed by broader
negotiations.
   Hassan, scheduled to see President Bush later in the day, said
this was a ``wait-and-see'' period in Mideast diplomacy. But, he
said, ``the human imperative has to come to the fore'' and referred
to the region under discussion as Palestine.
   Arafat, in an interview last weekend with a Saudi Arabian
newspaper, said he would address the U.N. General Assembly session
that opens Sept. 25 in New York. But Richard Boucher, a State
Department spokesman, said Monday the PLO chairman had not applied
for a visa.

   A judge had a teen-ager's mouth taped
shut in court for swearing at him during an earlier appearance.
   The 14-year-old stood before Juvenile Court Judge Robert M.
Foster on Monday with his hands cuffed, his ankles shackled and a
5-inch strip of tape over his mouth. He was sentenced to training
school for assaulting three juvenile detention workers during one of
his 13 previous commitments.
   The ``gag order'' was the result of an Aug. 1 hearing. The judge
had ordered the teen-ager held for 24 hours, and he responded with
an obscenity. The judge added 41 days for contempt. The teen-ager
used another obscenity.
   During Monday's hearing, the boy's mother stood beside him. She
said she did not object to the gag.
   ``I told him a thousand times about his mouth,'' she said later.
``When he makes his bed hard, he's going to have to sleep in it.''
   Earlier this year, Foster sentenced a youth to a night in jail
for wearing a T-shirt and shorts to court. Foster requires boys to
wear a tie and trousers and girls to wear slacks or dresses in his
court.

   With Jim Bakker's fraud trial resembling
an episode of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,'' the TV
evangelist's decorator today took jurors on a video tour of Jim and
Tammy's glitzy VIP hotel suite.
   Using a screen set up in front of the jury box, James Taggart
described the gold-plated bathroom fixtures, antique beds and
mirrored walls of the Heritage Grand Hotel's fourth-floor
presidential suite, where the Bakkers stayed at times.
   ``Who requested you to do the work?'' prosecutor Jerry Miller
asked.
   ``Mr. Bakker,'' Taggart responded.
   Under cross-examination, Taggart testified that other celebrities
stayed in the 4,000-square-foot suite, but they had to be cleared
through Bakker's office.
   On Monday, Taggart, using a wooden pointer and enlarged
photographs of Bakker's homes, described other decorating work he
did for the evangelist.
   Taggart's testimony came three days after he was sentenced to
more than 17 years in prison and fined $500,000. Taggart and his
brother David were convicted of evading $525,000 in taxes on money
from PTL.
   James Taggart said Bakker ordered him to give his Highland Beach,
Fla., condominium ``a very glamorous look.'' PTL bought and
renovated the condo in 1982 for $500,000.
   Taggart said he sought to give the oceanfront unit the
``theatrical presence'' Bakker liked: plenty of mirrors, and
motorized drapes with invisible seams. He said he decorated the
condo for Christmas 1982 with a tree that cost $5,000 and featured
hand-blown glass ornaments.
   Don Hardister, the Bakkers' former bodyguard, testified on Monday
that the couple's son, Jamie, had a two-story tree house at Tega Cay
that at one time was air conditioned.
   The prosecutor asked what happened to the air conditioner.
   ``I took it out and put it in the doghouse,'' Hardister said.
   Bakker is on trial in federal court on 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy and could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined
more than $5 million. Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in
ministry funds to live in high style.
   ``The Bakkers had a tendency to grow very bored with what they
had,'' Taggart testified about Bakker and his wife, who is not
charged. ``It was not unusual to see something completely replaced
more than once.''
   The Bakkers' five-level Tega Cay, S.C., parsonage underwent
extensive redecorating, Taggart said. The master bedroom was changed
completely at least twice and the living room three times, he said.
   PTL ``partners'' _ big money contributors who were promised three
nights' lodging a year for life in the evangelical empire's hotels,
also took the stand today, including a woman with 13 children and 21
grandchildren.
   Sarah Combs of Spanishburg, W.Va., said she and her husband, a
disabled coal miner, were living on $400 a month but donated $1,000
of a $19,000 black-lung compensation fund for a partnership in the
Heritage Grand Hotel.
   But she said, ``Every time I called, I would talk to someone else
and they would give me a different reason why there wasn't any
room.''
   In all, 23 witnesses testified Monday, most describing the
Bakkers' lifestyle, including:
   _ A $570 shower curtain for daughter Tammy Sue's bathroom and
$439 worth for throw pillows for her bedroom.
   _ An insurance policy that covered more than $158,000 worth of
furs and jewelry. PTL paid the premium, which totaled about $2,500
in 1985.
   _ $83,000 in security equipment at the Bakkers' Gatlinburg,
Tenn., home.
   _ A $10,910 Rolex watch Mrs. Bakker purchased.
   At least once, Taggart said, Bakker joked about his expensive
trips. During a trip to Palm Springs, Calif., Taggart said, Bakker
told those present to ``thank the PTL partners.''

   Anti-nuclear activists today protested the
launch next month of a nuclear-powered space probe, but
administration officials say President Bush will not block the
flight.
   The president is expected by next week to authorize the use of a
48-pound nuclear generator to provide electrical power for the
Galileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch to Jupiter from the shuttle
Atlantis on Oct. 12.
   The nuclear powerplant is similar to the one the Voyager 2
spacecraft used so successfully on its 12-year journey to Neptune
and beyond, and on 21 other space devices. But protesters worry
about a release of radioactivity should the Atlantis have an
accident similar to the one that destroyed Challenger.
   A recent safety analysis by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration concluded, ``the probability of an accident resulting
in a release of plutonium ranges from 1-in-2,500 to 1-in-2 million
and any release from these low probability events would be very
small.''
   About a half dozen sign-carrying protesters stood outside NASA's
national headquarters today, passing out a flyer that said, ``Keep
Project Galileo's plutonium on the ground.''
   One sign said, ``If Galileo explodes, kiss Florida goodbye,'' and
another said, ``One pound of plutonium could kill every person on
Earth.'' The demonstrators represented the Maryland Safe Energy
Coalition, which is headquartered in Columbia, Md.
   This weekend, a group called the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice, says it will begin a 200-mile ``peace walk'' from Cape
Canaveral to Kings Bay, Ga., to protest both the Galileo probe and
the Trident missile program.
   A spokesman said the walk will be completed Oct. 8 and the
protesters will return in time for the Atlantis launch.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the
launch pad'' to halt the October launch, said Bruce Gagnon of
Orlando, leader of the Florida group which has staged past
demonstrations against Trident launches.
   King's Bay is where the Trident is flight tested.
   A lawyer for the Christic Institute, Larry Sinkin, said the group
will file suit in federal court later this month to stop the
Atlantis launch, citing among its reasons ``the very poor record
NASA has of estimating risks'' and ``the reliability of the shuttle
itself.''
   The president's science advisers are studying risk assessments of
the launch and a separate safety evaluation, Thomas P. Rona, deputy
director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy,
said Monday.
   An administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity,
asked if the Galileo launch will be approved, replied ``certainly.''
   Rona declined to say what the recommendation to Bush will be but
said ``every possible design precaution has been taken. ... My
personal opinion is that the shuttle is far more reliable now than
before.''
   Elizabeth Prestridge, spokeswoman for the National Space Council
which is chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, said the staff
considers the Galileo probe safe. And a congressional source said
there is no doubt the president will allow the launch.
   The review process, which makes White House approval mandatory
before nuclear isotopes can be launched into space, has been in
effect since 1977.
   The nuclear devices are called RTGs, for radioisotope
thermoelectric generators. They have never caused a spacecraft
failure, although three of the 22 have been involved in space
mission accidents with no release of plutonium.
   Galileo will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and it will
insert a probe into the atmosphere to investigate thick cloud layers
covering the huge planet. The trip is a complicated one in which the
spacecraft will twice return near Earth for gravity boosts to gain
necessary velocity to reach Jupiter in 1995.

   Four Israeli employees of the U.S. Embassy have
been arrested on charges they were involved in a scheme to produce
counterfeit U.S. visas, the embassy announced Tuesday.
   The four were arrested by Israeli police Monday for alleged
participation in a conspiracy involving the purchase of U.S.
non-immigrant visas, an embassy statement said. It said no American
employees of the embassy were believed involved.
   Non-immigrant visas are issued to tourists, visitors on exchange
programs and people with specialized, short-term jobs.
   The Maariv newspaper said in a report Tuesday that police had
uncovered ``a network of people producing bogus visas'' to the
United States.
   It said the investigation started several weeks ago and that
police believed the false visas were being produced with stamps and
documents stolen from the embassy.
   ``There are apparently dozens involved in the affair, some acting
as middlemen between visa seekers and the counterfeiting ring,''
Maariv reported.
   The paper said the people seeking the visas were Israelis with
criminal records or citizens who lacked the necessary documents to
qualify for legal visas.

town of Orivesi and caused drinking water to be contaminated,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
   Local officials in the southern town said dozens of pantyhose had
blocked the sewers, causing overflowing and contamination of water
pipes and the water table.
   The blockage was discovered Monday. ``It looked like someone had

   President Bush told the nation's schoolchildren
by television today that saying no to drugs ``won't make you a
nerd.''
   In a midday speech from the White House library, Bush called
drugs an ``equal opportunity destroyer.''
   ``They have no conscience,'' he said. ``They don't care where the
money comes from. They just murder people. Young and old, good and
bad, innocent and guilty _ it doesn't matter. For too many, drugs
mean death.''
   The president's address was broadcast live by all four major
television networks for viewing in schools, and marked the latest
round in Bush's campaign to fight the flood of drugs in American
society.
   The speech came a week after Bush unveiled a $7.9 billion
national drug strategy that calls for more prisons, more
prosecutors, tougher sentences and aid to Latin American nations to
help combat drug cartels.
   Many Democrats have assailed the package as too modest, and Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, said he was introducing legislation today to boost it to
$10.1 billion. To pay for the increase, Byrd proposed cutsin many
domestic and defense programs of 0.575 percent.
   ``Presidents don't often get the chance to talk directly to
students. So today, for each of you sitting in a classroom or
assembly hall _ this message goes straight to you,'' Bush said in
his 15-minute speech.
   ``Most of you are doing the right thing,'' he said. ``But for
those of you who let drugs make their decisions for them, you can
almost hear the doors slamming shut.''
   The president equated drugs with death, and displaying the badge
of a slain 22-year-old rookie policeman, said: ``I keep this badge
in a drawer in my desk to remind me of that.''
   The badge belonged to New York City police officer Eddie Byrne,
who was killed in 1988 while protecting a witness in a drug case. It
was presented to Bush during a campaign appearance in New York last
year by Byrne's father.
   Bush displayed the badge several times during the presidential
campaign.
   ``In the early hours of a cold February morning, sitting in a
police cruiser, Eddie was blown away at point-blank range _ killed
on the order of a drug kingpin. Cold and caculated,'' the president
said.
   ``To me this badge is a constant reminder _ that Eddie Byrne's
life was not given in vain,'' the president said.
   In a speech that aides said was particularly tailored to
schoolchildren, Bush said: ``I'll let you in on a secret: we all can
succeed. If you don't use drugs, you can be anything you want to be
... So don't blow it.''
   ``Saying `no' won't make you a nerd. It won't make you a loser.
In fact, it will make you more friends than drugs ever will. Real
friends.''
   At another point in the speech, the president held up a baseball
and told his audience: ``I used to play baseball. Knew I'd never
make the big leagues. But I made a lot of friends.'' He stressed the
importance of friends ``on and off the field.''
   Bush, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, spoke in measured tones
during the speech and looked directly into the camera.
   Bush's drug program, which calls for spending $717 million more
in the upcoming fiscal year than he had previously requested, has
run into stiff opposition from many congressional Democrats. Some
have claimed it doesn't go far enough and others have denounced his
proposal to cut other domestic programs to help finance it.
   In advance of today's speech, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater accused Democrats of playing ``price tag politics'' with
the drug war.
   Fitzwater said the White House expected millions of students to
watch Bush's address.
   The president combined his warnings against drug use with a plea
that drug-free students help troubled friends. ``I'm asking you not
to look the other way,'' he said.
   ``You know, all of you in a classroom know, who's got a problem.
Today I'm not just asking you to get help. I'm asking you to find
someone who needs you. And offer to help.''
   Asserting that ``the day of the dealer is drawing to a close,''
Bush said: ``Some think there won't be room for them in jail. We'll
make room .... Some think there aren't enough prosecutors. We'll
hire them _ with the largest increase in federal prosecutors in
history.''
   ``No matter who you are, or how strong you are, drugs take
control of your life. But without drugs, you're in control. You can
determine your future. And that means staying in school,'' the
president said.
   And, he added: ``Using illegal drugs is against the law. And if
you break the law, you pay the price. Because the rules have
changed.''
   Earlier, White House Communications Director David Demarest said
that, in preparing the address, ``there was a fair amount of
consideration of who the message was directed to. It is not heavily
laden with particular policy information.''
   ``It is more of an effort to communicate to the kids why drugs or
doing drugs is a mistake and why it's important for kids to try and
help other kids, for them to intervene in someone else's life,''
Demarest added.
   Bush on Monday sought to dispel new speculation, raised by the
weekend disclosure of a secret White House directive, that he was
prepared to send U.S. combat forces to the three Andean drug-supply
nations of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   ``Let me state clearly, none of the Andean nations have asked for
U.S. troops. And there is no contemplation of the use of American
armed forces in any combat role there,'' the president said.
   Speaking at a ceremony honoring the Treasury Department's 200th
anniversary, Bush said no U.S. military forces would accompany host
government forces on actual field operations.
   ``Our personnel will provide training, equipment, and operational
support,'' Bush said. ``And I will see that it works exactly that
way.''

<HEAD>Australian City Plans Elaborate Program to Drive Out Big Toads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toads that grow to the size of dinner
plates are invading Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city, and
local authorities are planning an elaborate program to get rid of
them.
   ``For toads in Brisbane, this summer is shaping up as a
nightmarish scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' the Sydney
Morning Herald said Tuesday, the day the eradication project was
announced.
   Plans include ringing the city's suburbs with recordings of the
rattling call the male toad uses to attract females. When the
unsuspecting females arrive, trappers will shove them into plastic
bags and freeze them, said Greg Stegman, a city councilman in charge
of the eradication plan.
   Residents who find toads around their homes are being advised to
sprinkle detergent on them because it ``does the job quickly,''
Stegman said.
   He promised that the city of 1 million in the northeastern state
of Queensland will be toad-free within five years.
   The Queensland Museum said the toads pose a major threat to
Australia's fauna and wildlife. Biologists say the toads, when
cornered and frightened, squirt a liquid that can asphyxiate a dog
the size of a German shepherd.
   The cane toads were first introduced to Australia in 1935, when
they were brought in from South America to end a beatle plague that
was destroying crops.
   Since then, they have marched across northern Australia and are
heading south. The biggest weigh more than five pounds, and children
occasionally use them as footballs.
   Stegman said the current infestation began after the toads began
to wake up after their winter hibernation.
   ``They're in plague proportions,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating
that people stamp them to death or spear them with pitchforks, but
something has to be done.''
   Anne Nakano of Brisbane complained that the space underneath her
home, which is built on stilts, is crawling with toads. ``We stamp
on them when we open the front door in the morning to pick up the
milk,'' she said.
   The city council decided against offering a bounty for every toad
killed because ``knowing the Australian entrepreneurial spirit,
they'll start breeding them,'' Stegman said.
   The state of Queensland is holding a contest to find the biggest
toad to be entered in the Guinness Book of World Records. The
leading candidate is Mary Lou, who measures one foot across, weighs
six pounds, and eats 11 mice a day in addition to eggs mixed with
insects.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters today dumped truckloads of
dirt on a heap of 1.5 million tires and knocked down a smoky fire so
fierce that water just vaporized, but the pile of rubber could
smolder for weeks.
   The blaze, the second fire in four years at the used-tire dump,
now has townspeople asking: Where is Ernie Hunt?
   Hunt is the attention-loving guy who assembled the tires at the
seven-acre dump before it was taken away by the state over the 1985
blaze. Hunt began amassing the tires 15 years ago, charging gas
stations 50 cents a tire.
   ``Mr. Hunt remains at large,'' said Geoffrey Huntington, the
assistant attorney general who has been dealing with the dump. Hunt
is wanted on a perjury warrant accusing him of lying at hearings on
the seizure of the site.
   The stubborn fire broke out Sunday, sending flames 40 feet into
the air and billowing acrid, black smoke that could be seen 25 miles
away.
   About 250 firefighters from 45 communities in three states worked
to contain the fire. Sixty-five trucks and 10 loaders through the
night hauled tons of dirt from a sand and gravel pit.
   ``We switched from water because even at 2,500 gallons a minute,
the water was vaporizing,'' said David Tordoff of the Environmental
Protection Agency said. ``Instead, we will smother it.''
   About 50 residents were evacuated. Some began returning to their
homes late Monday.
   William Toland, state fire marshal, said the cause of the blaze
appeared suspicious. ``It was out of control right from the
beginning,'' he said. ``The fire just absolutely raged.''
   Six years ago, Hunt received a $22,000 down payment from a London
company that had planned to ship the tires to Africa. With the
money, Hunt bought a luxury automobile. But the tires were never
moved. In July, the state contracted with a Buffalo, N.Y., company
to shred the tires for shipment to Greece to fuel a cement plant.
The removal was to have begun shortly.
   ``It's not Ernie so much,'' said Danville resident Jackie McLean.
``I used to say to him, `Hey, Ernie, what are you going to do with
all those tires?' And he'd say, `Someday somebody will want them.'
He was just following the American dream. The towns knew what he was
doing. I blame the communities.''
   ``He was quite a character,'' said Tim Dube, past whose house
Hunt used to drive his car. ``He liked the attention.''
   But said Dube: ``The state and the communities should have done
something years ago.''
   Tordoff said his agency earmarked up to $1 million from the
Superfund for the effort. He said EPA scientists were monitoring
air, soil and ground water for harmful chemicals from the fire. The
1984 blaze smoldered for several weeks.
   Tordoff estimated that 2{ acres of tires 30 to 40 feet high were
on fire.
   Amy Juchatz, a state toxicologist, said the smoke could cause
respiratory problems and other irritation and that lead and zinc
fumes and other chemicals, possibly cancer-causing, could be inhaled
or could contaminate the soil.

<HEAD>Experts Say Global Warming Could Devastate Low-Lying Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rise in ocean levels caused by the melting of
polar icecaps during a global warming trend could devastate
low-lying countries and submerge some islands, environmental experts
said Tuesday.
   The world's poorest countries are likely to be hit hardest, the
experts said, as higher temperatures destroy traditional crops and
spread tropical diseases.
   Specialists at a three-day conference on the world's environment,
sponsored by the Japanese government, said low-lying countries like
Bangladesh could lose up to 20 percent of their land area as sea
levels rise. Thousands of Pacific islands could disappear as a
result of melting polar icecaps, they said.
   Scientists have predicted the Earth will warm gradually over
coming decades because of an increase of man-made gases in the
atmosphere that prevent heat from escaping. The phenomenon is known
as the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Dennis Tirpak, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's Global Climate Change Division, said temperatures are
likely to increase by 3 to 5 degrees and ocean levels could rise up
to 6{ feet if current emissions of the gases continue through the
next century.
   The gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane and
chlorofluorocarbons, are created by the burning of fossil fuels and
industrial and agricultural processes.
   ``The limited financial resources of developing countries in Asia
and the greater dependency of many of these countries on natural
resource production make them especially vulnerable to the impacts
of global warming,'' Tirpak said.
   In addition, the environment in many developing countries may be
particularly sensitive to climatic changes because of previous
damage from rapid population growth and deforestation, he said.
   If current trends continue, global warming will be ``more extreme
than anything which has occurred during the period of written
history,'' said Irving Mintzer of the University of Maryland's
Center for Global Change.
   ``The stresses which would result from such a rapid climate
change threaten to undermine the stability of modern civilization,''
he said.
   Tirpak said rising temperatures could endanger food production
and economic growth in developing Asian nations, where agriculture
contributes up to 80 percent of income and employment.
   The sensitivity of rice, Asia's staple food, to high
temperatures, and widespread farming of marginal lands make the
region particularly vulnerable to soaring temperatures, he said.
   Rising temperatures also could worsen droughts in India and other
nations and cover portions of India's western coast, Bangladesh,
Egypt, Indonesia and the Maldives with sea water, officials said.
   ``The homes and lives of millions of people living in the deltas
of the Ganges, the Nile, the Mekong, the Yangtze and the Mississippi
could be at risk,'' Mintzer said.
   The 60 officials and specialists participating in the conference,
part of a new Japanese environmental initiative, are expected to
release a set of recommendations Wednesday to combat global warming
and protect the environment.

   Vietnam has turned over the remains of
three more Americans killed in the Vietnam War, the official Vietnam
News Agency reported Tuesday.
   The report said the remains were handed over Monday in Hanoi to a
representative of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center.
   Since 1974, Vietnam has turned over the remains of 394 Americans,
the agency said.
   As of late last month, the U.S. government has said there are
2,340 servicemen still listed as missing from the war in Indochina.
Most _ 1,707 _ are unaccounted for in Vietnam. The rest are in Laos,
Cambodia and China.
   On July 31, Vietnam turned over the remains of 31 servicemen.
   Progress on resolution of the MIA issue has been dramatically
speeded up since the middle of last year. More remains have been
turned over and Vietnam has allowed joint U.S.-Vietnamese teams to
go into the Vietnamese countryside to investigate possible MIA sites.

<TEXT>
   At least 10,000 East Germans jammed
resettlement camps in West Germany today and thousands more arrived
in Hungary, waiting to follow the newly opened path to the West.
   Residents of this border town filled a convention hall with
banners and balloons to welcome the immigrants.
   ``This reception is really amazing,'' said Ute Kindl, a young
East German woman. ``I'm really speechless over the warmness and
kindness here.''
   Resettlement camps were overflowing here today, one day after
Hungary broke with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally, and allowed
East Germans to cross freely into the West.
   Bavarian border police said they estimated the number of
immigrants in West Germany at ``over 10,000.''
   There were conflicting reports about how many East Germans had
crossed into Hungary since Monday morning. Maj. Janos Hornyak of the
Hungarian border guards said 6,529 East Germans arrived between 6:30
a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. today.
   He said all but 1,181 entered from Czechoslovakia, which is
sandwiched between Hungary and East Germany, and the rest entered
from Romania.
   In the Czechoslovak capital of Prague, witnesses said more than
half of the 400 East Germans holed up in the West German Embassy
today left the grounds today.
   Several refugees said East Germany had promised not to punish
them if they returned home and would let them apply to emigrate to
the West. The refugees had camped out in hopes of being allowed to
emigrate to West Germany like their countrymen in Hungary.
   The remarkable path westward was cut by Hungary, which is
embracing liberal political reforms and seeking closer economic and
diplomatic ties with Western nations.
   East Germans have used Hungary's looser borders to flee to the
West for years. That stream turned into a steady flood in May, when
Hungary removed many border fortications with Western neighbor
Austria, and turned into deluge on Sunday when thousands of East
Germans vacationing in Hungary were allowed to emigrate en masse.
   The refugees, who came through three separate crossings, had
completely filled five temporary camps near the Austrian border in
Bavaria and officials were seeking more shelter in military barracks.
   Chief federal government spokesman Hans Klein criticized East
Germany for its public condemnation of the unprecedented exodus.
   ``It's not Ice Age verbiage, but rather Stone Age verbiage that
they have reacted with,'' Klein told a news conference in Passau
late this morning.
   Soviet Politburo hard-liner Yegor Ligachev arrived today in East
Berlin, Soviet and East German reports said. It was expected he
would discuss the refugee situation with officials.
   Most of the refugees arrived in private cars and at least 100
buses bringing them through Austria into the southern West German
state.
   Michael Tietmann, director of the Tiefenbach refugee camp just
outside Passau, said many of the emigres who had cars arrived later
than expected. ``A lot of them told me they had gone shopping in
Vienna and took in the sights before going on'' to West Germany,''
he said.
   About 60,000 East Germans were reported in Hungary on Sunday _
most of them on vacation _ but an Interior Ministry official in
Budapest said Monday that 26,000 of them had returned home.
   East Germany's Communist government expressed anger at West
Germany and Hungary for arranging the exodus, but announced no
immediate retaliation.
   East Germany's ADN news agency accused West Germany of ``luring
away and misleading citizens of our land'' through an ``unrestrained
slander campaign.'' It said Hungary had ``unilaterally suspended''
agreements between the two countries regulating movement of people
across borders.
   Many East Germans here expressed fears that their relatives back
home would face reprisals.
   ``Our parents still don't know for sure what we have done,''
remarked one young man who arrived with his wife from Leipzig. The
couple asked not to be identified by name.
   ``We just hope this won't hurt them. They (East German security
officials) have a way of making life difficult for people whose
relatives have fled to the West,'' the man said.
   It was not known how long the exodus of East Germans out of
Hungary would last or be permitted. News reports said the East
Germans might restrict travel to Hungary in retaliation, but East
Berlin denied the reports.
   Some of West Germany's 61.3 million citizens have expressed
concern about how their country can absorb an estimated 100,000 East
Germans likely to arrive this year, up from nearly 40,000 last year
and the largest number since 207,000 fled in 1961. About 400,000
ethnic Germans from other Soviet bloc countries also are expected to
arrive this year.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday said his countrymen expressing
discontent were insensitive.
   ``We have no right to resist the search for personal happiness of
our countrymen from East Germany,'' he said.
   While West German unemployment is about 9 percent, not enough
young people are signing up for apprenticeship programs to work as
craftsmen, and most of the East German refugees are young craftsmen.
   Klein, the government spokesman, said officials received 8,000
job offers in Passau alone for the refugees.
   Inside Passau's sprawling Niebelungen Halle civic center, the
West German Red Cross and other relief groups had set up tiered bunk
beds, kitchens, and consultation centers for other new emigres.
   Hundreds of people gathered in front of the center to greet the
arriving East Germans.
   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country has
aided a mass exodus of refugees from an allied Communist nation. The
exodus is the biggest since the Berlin Wall was built.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass condemned Western media
for what it called a ``tendentious campaign'' to spur illegal East
German emigration.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
praised Hungary for boldly opening its western border in defiance of
a Warsaw Pact ally.
   The exodus came after weeks of talks between the two Germanys
failed. On Sunday night the Hungarian government formally announced
it would allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.
   Before this week, about 6,000 East Germans had already fled this
summer through Hungary.

   North Korea on Tuesday proposed
negotiations to remove U.S. nuclear weapons allegedly in South Korea
and convert the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.
   Army Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung, saying a U.S. nuclear arms buildup on
the penisula could start another Korean War, made the North Korean
proposal at the 451st meeting of the Military Armistice Commission
in this border truce village.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Larry Vogt, speaking for the U.N. Command,
refused to discuss the communist request on grounds it was a
political issue and did not come under the jurisdiction of the
commission, which was formed after a 1953 armistice ended the
three-year Korean War.
   The U.N. Command, led by the United States, was formed in 1950
with 16 foreign countries that rushed troops to help South Korea
repel invaders from the North.
   North Korea has frequently demanded the United States remove
nuclear weapons it says are in South Korea and it proposed a
nuclear-free zone at a commission meeting May 9.
   U.S. forces have refused to confirm or deny the presence of
nuclear arms.
   Vogt charged the communist North with propaganda and misusing the
commission to ``rehash trumped-up charges.'' The meeting was called
by the North.
   Vogt suggested the meeting of the armistice commission discuss
proposals to ease tension along the Demilitarized Zone that
separates the two Koreas.
   Vogt said joint teams should investigate alleged armistice
violations and work to return remains of American soldiers who died
in the Korean War. North Korea has said it has the remains.
   Choe, chief communist delegate to the commission, contended the
United States has deployed ``a colossal amount of nuclear weapons
ranging from mini-nuclear shells and bombs to operational and
tactical nuclear missiles and constructed a number of storehouses
for nuclear weapons'' in at least six areas in the South.
   He said unless the nuclear arms are withdrawn and South Korea is
converted into a nuclear-free zone, ``confrontation and hostile
feelings cannot be removed, nor can confidence be built between both
sides forever.''

   A bipartisan resolution was introduced in
Congress on Tuesday to mark journalist Terry Anderson's birthday
next month with a national day of prayer for the eight Americans
held hostage in Lebanon.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the longest held
American captive. The resolution, co-sponsored by 84 members of
Congress, would set aside Oct. 27 as National Hostage Awareness Day.
   ``It's ... an exercise in conscience for the American people, so
we can say we did what we could,'' Rep. Paul Henry, the Michigan
Republican who introduced the resolution, said at a news conference.
``This is something we want to have all Americans rally behind.''
   The resolution calls for church bells across the country to be
rung for one minute at noon Oct. 27, Anderson's 42nd birthday, and
asks the United Nations to declare a simultaneous International
Hostage Day.
   David Aikman, foreign affairs correspondent for Time magazine and
chairman of the Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, said
at the news conference that he believed publicity has helped keep
Anderson alive.
   Aikman said high school students are being asked to participate
in an essay contest, writing about ``How I would cope with being a
hostage.'' The winner will receive $1,000.
   The other Americans still held in Lebanon are: Thomas P.
Sutherland, dean of agriculture at American University in Beirut;
Frank H. Reed, American director of the Lebanese International
School; Joseph J. Cicippio, acting comptroller of the American
University; writer Edward A. Tracy; and J.J. Turner, Alan B. Steen
and Robert B. Polhill, professors at Beirut University College.

   Democrats in Texas and California today hope to reclaim two House
seats in special elections prompted by the resignation of Speaker
Jim Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho in a Capitol Hill
bloodletting over ethics.
   New York Mayor Edward Koch is looking for a come-from-behind
victory in the Democratic primary over David Dinkins, who could
become the city's first black mayor. And in Detroit, Mayor Coleman
Young is expected to brush back a swarm of primary challengers who
want to keep him from winning a record fifth term in November.
   Among other elections around the country today are mayoral
primaries in Buffalo, N.Y., New Haven, Conn., and Minneapolis and
St. Paul, Minn.
   In the congressional races, Democrats are basking in the support
of the leaders they are trying to succeed. Although Wright and
Coelho resigned because of alleged ethics violations, both remain
popular and have been central figures in the campaigns.
   Wright has campaigned for Democrat Pete Geren, a Fort Worth
lawyer and former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas. Geren faces
Republican Bob Lanier, a TV medical commentator, who has countered
with endorsements from President Bush and former Dallas Cowboys
coach Tom Landry.
   Lanier said he initially worried that Wright's endorsement would
be a major factor in the race but now believes ``it hasn't been
quite as much as we anticipated.''
   Still, he conceded that he's ``swimming upstream'' as a
Republican in a district with a long history of sending Democrats to
Congress.
   In California's San Joaquin Valley, Coelho has endorsed
Democratic state Assemblyman Gary Condit in a low-key race against
Republican Clare Berryhill, a former assemblyman and state
agriculture chief.
   Berryhill and Condit are considered the leading candidates among
the six running. Unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of
the vote, there will be a runoff.
   The New York City race, once considered a lost cause for Koch,
has turned into a cliffhanger between the brash mayor and his
soft-spoken challenger.
   Koch sent out an SOS call to his supporters Monday, saying he
needed a big turnout to win his party's nomination for an
unprecedented fourth term.
   ``I'm saying to everybody who understands that expression: `I
need you. Come out tomorrow. Vote for me. Mayday! Mayday!,''' Koch
said at a lunchtime rally.
   At a school dedication, Koch pulled Dinkins aside to call for a
unity rally on Wednesday, no matter who wins.
   ``I think that's a nice gesture,'' said a smiling Dinkins, who is
the Manhattan borough president. ``I mean, he recognizes that the
likelihood is that I'm going to succeed, and he offers to help me, I
think that's fine.''
   Koch said it was important for his party to work on defeating
Republican Rudolph Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor who leads
cosmetic heir Ronald Lauder in the GOP race.
   In Detroit, Young faces a dozen challengers, including Rep. John
Conyers, a 13-term Democratic congressman who says Young has been
mayor too long.
   Conyers, who like Young is black, has benefited from the vocal
support of Jesse Jackson, who exhorted a crowd Monday to ``keep hope
alive'' by voting for Conyers.
   A poll released Sunday showed Young well in front, with Conyers
running neck-and-neck with accountant Tom Barrow for second place.
The top two finishers in the non-partisan primary advance to
November's general election.
   Nine candidates are battling to succeed St. Paul Mayor George
Latimer, who is quitting after nearly 14 years to become a law
school dean. Across the river in Minneapolis, Mayor Don Fraser faces
six challengers.
   The top two vote-getters in each city will advance to the Nov. 7
general election.
   Buffalo Mayor James Griffin, a maverick Democrat, faces two
challengers in his party's primary but is also running unopposed for
both the Republican and Conservative party nominations.
   In New Haven, Democratic state Sen. John Daniels is trying to
become the first black mayor of the Connecticut city, which is about
half white. His opposition for his party's nomination in the
overwhelmingly Democratic city comes from John DeStefano Jr., the
hand-picked candidate of Mayor Biagio DiLieto, who is retiring.

   Thousands of voters ditched Norway's two
largest parties in general elections, and analysts Tuesday gave the
governing Labor Party coalition only a 50-50 chance to survive a
right-wing challenge.
   Neither grouping got a majority in parliament from Monday's
balloting, and conservatives must gain the support of an
increasingly popular far-right party if they hope to topple Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.
   Mrs. Brundtland, whose party suffered its greatest postwar
defeat, said she will remain in office until opponents oust her
minority government. The non-socialist parties planned meetings next
week to discuss forming a coalition.
   Voters fed up with high unemployment, rising prices and little
perceived difference between the Labor and Conservative parties
streamed to the far-right Party of Progress and the Socialist Left,
the analysts said.
   ``This election was marked by enormous changes, and just the same
nothing changed,'' said political scientist Lars Svaasand of the
University of Bergen.
   Whichever side succeeds, it probably will control a minority with
limited ability to complete Norway's economic recovery, Svaasand
said.
   The VG newspaper called it ``the election that Norway lost.''
   ``There is a clear polarization in the system. Both the largest
parties suffered setbacks, but the Conservatives were the big
loser,'' said analyst Bernt Ole Aardal of the Institute for Social
Research.
   Analysts gave Mrs. Brundtland roughly equal chances of remaining
in government, with some suggesting she might be forced out
initially but regain power over the divisive non-socialist bloc.
   To gain power, the opposition bloc must come to terms with the
Progress party of Carl I. Hagen, who challenges the foundations of
Norway's social democracy. The party soared from two seats in the
1985 parliament to 22 in the new one.
   The non-socialist bloc won a slim majority of 84 seats to 80 for
Labor and the allied Socialist Left, which doubled its strength. The
single independent, Anders Aune, will probably support Labor, still
Norway's largest party.
   Hagen said he will support a vote to topple Mrs. Brundtland but
warned that if he is not included in a coalition his party will be
another opposition party.
   ``If they want the benefit of our support, it is at the cost of
our having influence,'' he said.
   ``The other non-socialist parties don't want anything to do with
the Progress party but they may be forced into cooperating,''
Svaasand said.
   Aardal said relations in the non-socialist bloc are tense and
that ``it will take a while until we see a solution for the whole
period.''
   ``My guess is that the government will operate on an
issue-by-issue basis. But that doesn't necessarity mean that it will
be inefficient and unstable. It has happened many times before in
Norwegian history,'' he said.

<HEAD>Illness Kills Two in Jail; Inmates Seek Early Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for inmates at the county jail asked a
judge today to release up to 500 prisoners early because of a
bacterial infection that has killed two inmates and sickened as many
as 35 others.
   James Oitzinger also asked U.S. District Judge James DeAnda to
isolate inmates at risk of contracting the illness either because
they already are sick or have impaired immune systems.
   The hearing was expected to continue through the day.
   A bacterial infection known as pneumococcus bacteremia killed two
inmates Thursday, according to doctors. They said the two, ages 21
and 30, had had their spleens removed, leaving them more susceptible
to the infection.
   Since then, 18 more inmates have been admitted to Ben Taub
Hospital and at least 17 are in the jail infirmary, reporting
flu-like symptoms, authorities said. Cultures indicated pneumococcus
bacteria in five of the inmates at Ben Taub, one of whom is missing
his spleen and is in very critical condition, Dr. Stephen Greenberg,
an infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine, said
Monday.
   ``We don't ever see five cases of pneumococcal bacteremia coming
from one place at one time,'' Greenberg said. Bacteremia is an
infection that attacks virtually all bodily systems.
   The cause of the other inmates' symptoms is not yet known, and
neither are the source of the outbreak and exactly how it spreads,
doctors said.
   Greenberg said outbreaks have been seen in the military and among
South African miners, groups that live in crowded conditions.
   The Harris County Jail, designed for 4,200 inmates, houses about
8,300. Although no specific measures were ordered by health
authorities, jail officials canceled religious services,
recreational activities and classes.
   Oitzinger, who represents inmates in a suit over jail
overcrowding, asked for early release of up to 500 inmates in jail
on misdemeanor charges.
   At the hearing, Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen testified that medical
experts told him the outbreak was not caused by overcrowding. ``The
jail's not the breeding place and certainly not the environment''
for the illness, he said.
   Two doctors from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
toured the jail Monday with state and local health officials but
declined to comment on their findings or plans to curb the spread of
the bacteria.
   Authorities were preparing to screen 3,200 inmates who indicated
they at risk of contracting the infection.
   Klevenhagen said he expects the number to be narrowed to about
500 once health officials question the group about any chronic
illnesses and immune-system problems.

   Gunmen believed to be Sinhalese
radicals killed the sister-in-law of former president Junius
R.Jayewardene at a traffic intersection in downtown Colombo on
Tuesday, police said.
   Gladys Jayewardene, 72, was gunned down by two men on a
motorcycle, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the killing but police blamed
the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese extremist group that has
been trying to overthrow the government since 1987.
   Mrs. Jayewardene, the wife of the former president's younger
brother, Ronald, was the chairwoman of the State Pharmaceutical
Corp., a government-owned firm responsible for distributing medicine.
   Many of the drugs sold by the pharmaceutical corporation are
imported from neighboring India, which sent peacekeeping troops to
Sri Lanka two years ago. The deployment of the troops sparked a
violent protest by the People's Liberation Front, including a demand
to boycott Indian goods.
   Military officials blamed the radical group for 12 other deaths
in the country's south and center since Monday. At least three
people were killed in fighting between Indian soldiers and Tamils
rebels in the north.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said police found the bodies of 11 unidentified Sinhalese men on
Tuesday in Panadura town, 15 miles south of Colombo.
   On Monday, the director of a private supermarket chain was
abducted from his car at gunpoint and killed, the officials said.
They said R.S. Perera's body was found in Kahawita, a Colombo suburb.
   The killings occurred as the government prepared to meet leaders
of opposition parties Wednesday in a bid to end the ethnic violence.
   The violence was sparked by a Tamil movement for a separate
nation in the northeast. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, claim the Sinhalese-dominated government
deprives them of jobs and education.
   Junius Jayewardene's government attempted to end the insurgency
with an India-sponsored peace accord in July 1987, but it was
rejected by the largest rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, who said it did not grant enough concessions to the Tamils.
   The Tigers turned their guns on Indian peacekeeping troops
deployed to monitor the accord.
   Besides the Tamil violence, the Sinhalese front's campaign has
claimed 5,000 lives since 1987. Most victims have been Sinhalese, a
community that makes up 75 percent of the population.
   The group protests the July accord, saying it gave too many
concessions to the Tamils and compromised the country's independence
by inviting Indian soldiers to Sri Lanka.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has invited the Sinhalese front to
Wednesday's meeting but the guerrilla group has not responded. It
has rejected at least five calls from the government for cease-fires.
   Two Tamil Tiger representatives will attend the meeting as
observers, government officials said Tuesday. They said most of the
23 political parties have accepted Premadasa's invitation.

<HEAD>Democrats Push to Expand Bush's Anti-Drug Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats today pushed for a $2.2
billion expansion of President Bush's anti-drug plan, but top
administration officials immediately said they would urge a veto if
the proposal reaches the White House.
   In a statement released by the Office of Management and Budget,
administration officials said Bush's $7.9 billion proposal ``made
the tough choices,'' while the Democratic alternative ``throws money
at the plan.''
   The clash came as Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, formally proposed the legislation with the
backing of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas also said the
Democratic proposal was too expansive, and legislative leaders met
off the Senate floor to discuss the measure, which Byrd sought to
add to the transportation appropriations bill.
   Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney, drug policy coordinator
William J. Bennett, Budget Director Richard Darman and other senior
advisers will recommend to the president that he veto the Democratic
plan, the OMB statement said.
   Meanwhile, Bennett told the House Foreign Affairs Committee
today, ``I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we are talking
about a $50 billion program over five years'' to fight drugs.
   But several members told him it would be unacceptable for the
administration to find those funds by shifting money out of other
vital domestic programs.
   Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., told Bennett: ``I don't want to
see one dime diverted from from essential domestic purposes that are
in fact part of the drug problem; I think that would be a tragic
mistake.''
   Fascell said funds should not be shifted from such programs as
education, health, welfare, housing or from programs designed to
help communities deal with the impact of large-scale legal and
illegal immigration.
   ``That doesn't help communities win the drug fight,'' Fascell
said.
   Bennett suggested that a large percentage of the needed money may
come from drug users themselves in the form of heay fines imposed on
drug offenders.
   ``Substantially increased fines will come back into the
Treasury,'' he said.
   Byrd said Monday his plan would increase the government's
anti-drug budget by $3.9 billion above the level Congress would have
otherwise provided. To pay for the extra spending, Byrd proposed
across-the-board cuts in many domestic and defense programs of 0.575
percent.
   ``He may have the best solution on the funding side of the
equation,'' Dole said of Byrd's proposal before debate began. ``I'm
not certain of the amount, but perhaps that's something we can work
out.''
   Byrd said Monday he was seeking to transfer money to drug
spending from other programs because Bush has refused to consider
tax increases.
   ``The president says, `Read my lips,''' Byrd told reporters. ``He
says he won't support any increase in taxes. So I have to do what I
can do.''
   Byrd, whose panel oversees about half of all federal spending,
said he would introduce the proposal as an amendment to the $11.9
billion transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1990. That
bill also contains language permanently banning cigarette smoking on
all domestic airline flights.
   Byrd not only topped the dollars Bush would spend, but said his
proposed across-the-board cuts were fairer than what the president
proposed.
   Last Tuesday, Bush asked Congress to increase anti-drug efforts
by $717 million. He said he would trim a handful of programs,
including immigration aid, rural development, housing and a Defense
Department radio system. The president has ruled out a tax increase
to pay for the new drug spending.
   ``The drug epidemic facing this country is a crisis that affects
us all,'' Byrd told reporters. ``In my view it is critical that we
look for solutions that will seek to spread not only the pain but
also the gain in a fair and even-handed manner.''
   The funds Byrd proposed spending include $1 billion for new
prisons, $200 million to help state and local law enforcement
agencies, $81 million for new federal attorneys, $97 million for the
FBI and $59 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   He would also spend $1.1 billion for drug and alcohol treatment,
$289 million for education, $45 million for customs agents, $43
million for the Customs Service to buy new helicopters and
airplanes; $100 million to help drug-addicted veterans, and $100
million for public housing authorities to deal with drug problems.
   Of the extra spending, Byrd said 53 percent would go to law
enforcement and 47 percent to education, treatment and prevention
programs.
   Social Security and other benefit programs would be exempted from
his spending cuts, Byrd said.
   Because the Pentagon budget will be close to $300 billion next
year, the cut in defense spending would total more than $1.5 billion.
   Byrd said when he explained his amendment to Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, ``He liked it.''
   He also said he had spoken to the Democratic chairmen of most of
the 13 Appropriations subcommittees and to the ranking Republican on
the committee, Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
   ``His reaction was positive,'' he said.

have an unusually high brain cancer rate, the union and the company
say.
   The study will focus on GM's Hydra-Matic plant in Ypsilanti, west

   The study will be part of an investigation by Harvard University
into hazards caused by fluids used in cutting machine. Earlier
studies have linked the fluids to increased risks of stomach,

but that it wasn't known how many Hydra-Matic workers have had brain
cancer.

<HEAD>Disabled: Bureaucracy Leads Handicapped To Want To Die</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disabled activists are disturbed by recent court
rulings that let quadriplegics choose death over life with
paralysis, a trend they contend subtly encourages the disabled to
end it all.
   Advocates for the disabled say the case of Larry McAfee _ the
Atlanta man who won a court order allowing him to shut off the
ventilator that has kept him alive since 1985 _ is but one example
of what happens when state health systems fail to give their
disabled patients a chance at life outside of hospitals and state
institutions.
   Paul K. Longmore, a California historian and quadriplegic, said
institutionalized care for the disabled is the norm in most states.
   ``Many states are like that,'' Longmore said. ``Essentially,
states like Georgia ... give disabled people two choices: the
nursing home or the cemetery.''
   McAfee, 33, was injured four years ago in a motorcycle crash. He
received at-home care until his health insurance ran dry; then he
became a ward of the state.
   No nursing home in Georgia could take him in. Social workers
arranged for him to live in an Ohio facility, but that home returned
McAfee to Georgia in January.
   He lived in the intensive care unit of an Atlanta hospital until
August, when he went to a nursing home in Alabaster, Ala.
   Before he left, McAfee asked a Fulton County judge to let him
die, saying he could no longer cope with being paralyzed from the
chin down. McAfee's court petition came on the heels of a similar
request from a Michigan quadriplegic, David Rivlin, who carried out
his wish in July.
   ``Year after year, day after day, it just slowly drains
everything you have,'' McAfee said at a news conference last weekend.
   McAfee's lawyer, Randall Davis, said Tuesday his client's wish to
die stemmed from his ``abhorrence to being dependent'' on other
people for his care.
   ``The cost of his care in his situation and ... that there are no
resources left for him was a factor, but not the predominant
factor,'' Davis said.
   McAfee has not said when he plans to end his life.
   When Superior Court Judge Edward Johnson granted McAfee's
petition to turn off his life support system, he said McAfee's
desire to die outweighed the state's interest in preserving life.
   That ruling and the one in Michigan were scary, said Longmore,
43, who has used a ventilator for 25 years since being crippled by
polio.
   ``These two coming together within two months have really shaken
a lot of people up,'' he said. ``I hear a lot of people saying they
are fed up with the bigotry that says we are better off dead.''
   But Davis said, ``A lot of these people making these statements
don't know Larry McAfee at all. He says he doesn't like to be
dependent on anybody else.''
   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers said the state cannot
interfere in a competent adult's decision to stop living.
   Mark Johnson, a counselor at an Atlanta spinal center and a
paraplegic, called the state's attitude cavalier.
   ``It's real interesting how the discussion of suicide turned into
a discussion of refusal of medical treatment,'' he said.
   Briefs filed in support of McAfee's decision _ by Bowers, the
Roman Catholic Archidocese of Atlanta and the Georgia Medical
Association _ probably didn't help McAfee's morale, Longmore said.
   ``He's getting a lot of messages from non-handicapped people
telling him that he really is better off dead,'' Longmore said.
``The only people who are telling him they want him to try to live
are other disabled people.
   ``And here we are, among the most devalued people in society.
What kind of credibility do we have?''
   Longmore said he was particularly disturbed that the judge
directed the state to appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme
Court but didn't force McAfee to await the outcome.
   Such an order, he said, is ``the first time any state in this
country has tried to set up legally assisted suicide for disabled
people.''
   ``Inevitably, people with disabilities will be pressured into
choosing suicide,'' he said. ``That's extremely dangerous.''
   Mark Johnson questioned whether states try to prevent the sense
of inadequacy felt by McAfee and Rivlin, who disconnected himself
from a life support machine and died July 20 after winning a court
battle. Rivlin, 38, had been on a respirator since a 1971 surfing
accident and wanted to die rather than become bitter because he had
no hope for recovery.
   ``Why would anybody be allowed to get to that point to where they
feel that way?'' Johnson asked. ``How are you supposed to feel good
about yourself?''
   ``I don't want to see (McAfee) die,'' Longmore said. ``I know how
hard it is. I know if I had gone through the same kind of battering
by the system, I would want to die too.
   ``I also know it doesn't have to be that way.''

   Key chains, wallets and other objects that
inmates took from hostages during the 1971 Attica prison uprising
will be buried in a capsule Wednesday on the 18th anniversary of the
bloody riot.
   Inmates buried the incriminating objects shortly before the
prison was retaken by authorities in a hail of state police gunfire
on Sept. 13, 1971. Forty-three inmates and 11 guards were killed
during the riot and retaking of the prison 30 miles east of Buffalo.
   Guards using a metal detector during a routine sweep of a
prison's yard discovered the cache in 1986, but the find was not
publicized until now. They found enough corroded padlocks, keys to
prison gates and doors, personal car keys, key chains and empty
wallets to fill two and a half shopping bags.
   On Wednesday, officials plan to bury the objects in a capsule
near a monument to the prison guards killed during the riot.
   The items were discovered on Sept. 9, 1986 _ an anniversary of
the outbreak of the rebellion.
   ``They were found on the 15th anniversary, 15 minutes to the hour
that it started,'' said prison Sgt. Robert Kauffman. ``That's what
was so ironic about it. It was very somber at the jail after we
brought them in. A lot of the old-timers came down and saw them and
got very quiet.''

<HEAD>Bush Tells Yeltsin Administration Has Positive Relationship with
Gorbachev</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush told Soviet maverick Boris
Yeltsin his administration enjoys a ``very positive relationship''
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the White House said today.
   The president met with the Soviet official, an outspoken critic
of some of Gorbachev's policies, for about 15 minutes, according to
a statement by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The statement said Bush ``dropped by'' a meeting between Yeltsin
and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Fitzwater earlier had suggested that the session would be little
more than a handshake between the president and the visiting Soviet
figure, saying: ``We don't want to do anything to foster internal
conflict that might be associated with this trip.''
   However, Fitzwater's later statement said the meeting included
discussion of overall U.S.-Soviet relations and of drugs.
   Yeltsin said in a speech prior to the meeting that he wanted to
tell Bush, ``We have to combine our efforts to rescue perestroika,
which is in a super-critical situation today.''
   ``The president said that there is much interest in Mr. Yeltsin's
visit. He expressed his view that the overall bilateral relationship
is in good shape,'' said Fitzwater's statement.
   ``In this connection, the president noted his very positive
relationship with General Secretary Gorbachev and reiterated his
support for perestroika,'' it continued.
   ``The president emphasized that the American people share his
hope for the success of the reform movement in the Soviet Union,''
the short statement added.
   Vice President Dan Quayle also ``dropped by'' to greet Yeltsin,
the statement said.
   Fitzwater said Bush met with Yeltsin shortly before his
nationally televised anti-drug speech to school children.
   The spokesman said the president mentioned the speech to the
Soviet official ``and the problem that drugs have created throughout
the world. The president and Mr. Yeltsin both agreed that drugs are
a major problem that touches on both American and Soviet societies.''
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin, ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987 but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support in a contested election, arrived Saturday on a private tour.
He has been prodding Mikhail Gorbachev to step up the pace of reform
in the Soviet Union.
   ``We didn't want to indicate that we were trying to provide a
platform for dissent,'' Fitzwater said.
   Yeltsin also was to meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Barbara Milkulski, D-Md.
   He announed Monday night that he would cut short his U.S. visit
to go home to attend meetings on pressure from various nationalities
for independence from the Kremlin.
   In his speech today at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
Yeltsin said perestroika had not improved the delivery of food and
other consumer goods to the Soviet people.
   He repeated earlier statements that unless Gorbachev improves the
consumer goods situation in the Soviet Union, he faces an upheaval
from below. He has said Gorbachev has six months to a year to
achieve progress.
   ``I have a lot to tell President Bush,'' Yeltsin said, but did
not spell out what requests he might make of the U.S. government.
   White House officials had said Monday the administration did not
want to send the wrong signal to Gorbachev by having Bush meet with
Yeltsin, who has been prodding the Soviet leader to speed reforms.
   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Yeltsin said he
approved of the exodus of thousands of East Germans through Hungary
to West Germany, where they have been granted citizenship.
   ``It should be regulated by international agreements stating that
people have the right to live where they want,'' Yeltsin said.
   Speaking Monday evening at Columbia University, Yeltsin said the
Kremlin has suppressed numerous peoples in its power for too long.
   ``The feeling of national dignity was constantly being crushed in
our country,'' he said through an interpreter. ``If they even wanted
to build a school, they had to go hat in hand, so to speak, to
Moscow. It was very offensive.''
   Giving Soviet republics more power to govern themselves would
greatly reduce tensions, he said.
   The problem is serious enough, he said, that he was cutting his
two-week tour by a week to attend a special meeting in Moscow to
discuss the nationalities issue. If the problem is to be solved, the
ruling Politburo must be reinvigorated with progressive-thinking
leaders, Yeltsin said.
   ``We have so many odious and incompetent people in the
Politburo,'' he said. ``All they do is raise questions and never
answer them. They are hanging on to their positions with dear life.
We need to catapult them out like they do with ejection seats. But
the question is, who is willing to push the button?''
   He said the Soviet people should ``throw off our false pride and
take a lot from the American experience'' of running a country.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said Yeltsin's views were his own and not necessarily the
government's.
   Yeltsin's visit is organized by the Esalen Institute
Soviet-American Exchange Program. He is receiving $25,000 per
speech, which will pay for the trip and contribute to AIDS research
in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Colt to Rehire Strikers With Back Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge ordered the
Colt Firearms Division to rehire 800 strikers with back pay, a
ruling the union said could mean as much as $40 million for workers
who have picketed for 3{ years.
   The decision by Judge Marvin Roth, although not final, delighted
striking members of the United Auto Workers.
   ``They're jumping up and down,'' Robert Madore, a regional UAW
official. ``They can't believe we won the whole decision.''
   Madore estimated back wages at $40 million _ an average of
$50,000 per worker.
   ``This is wonderful,'' said Marie Lambert, who worked for Colt
for 14 years before the strike. ``There haven't been any Christmas
presents for my kids for the past three years.''
   Roth, in a ruling dated Thursday and released Monday, found that
the gun maker had engaged in unfair labor practices during the
strike.
   The company has until Oct. 5 to appeal to the National Labor
Relations Board. If neither side appeals, the board will adopt
Roth's decision, said John Sauter, assistant regional director for
the board in Hartford.
   Michael G. Dunn, a spokesman for Colt Industries in New York,
said Colt had not yet decided whether to appeal.
   About 1,050 workers walked off the job at Colt plants in Hartford
and West Hartford in January 1986 after working 10 months without a
contract.
   The division, which was put up for sale by Colt Industries in
April, kept the plants operating with replacements and about 200
union members who crossed picket lines.
   The judge found that Colt unilaterally changed working
conditions, failed to bargain in good faith, offered to settle
separately with employees who quit the union and rejected a 1986
offer to have strikers return under their old contract.
   Roth dismissed Colt's allegations that its negotiators had been
threatened by the union but found that union members had threatened
people and property during picketing. He ordered an end to such
behavior.
   A state board ruled in 1988 that the Colt workers were victims of
a lockout and entitled to millions in unemployment benefits. Colt
has appealed that decision.
   Colt was founded in 1836 by Samuel Colt, inventor of the first
successful repeating pistol. The company later developed its
six-shooter, the legendary gun that won the West. It also makes the
M-16, the Army's standard rifle.

<HEAD>Former Saturday Evening Post Editor Dies at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLD LYME, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard D. Thruelsen, who wrote about
science and aviation and covered World War II during a long career
as a writer and editor for the Saturday Evening Post, has died. He
was 81.
   Thruelsen died Sunday at home, a spokesman for the
Alderson-Prentis Funeral Service said. The cause of death was not
disclosed.
   Thruelsen joined the magazine as an associate editor in 1936,
became a senior editor in 1958 and retired in 1962.
   He learned to fly in the 1920s and came to the magazine as an
expert on science and aviation. He later served in World War II and
helped cover the war for the Post.
   Thruelsen served in intelligence and information units in the
war, but went on numerous bombing missions with the 8th Bomber
Command. Based on those experiences, he wrote ``Target, Germany,'' a
book depicting a day in the life of a crew member of a B-17 bomber.
   His other books included ``Men at Work,'' published in 1950;
``Voyage of the Vagabond,'' 1965, and ``The Grumman Story,'' 1976.
   He is survived by a son, two daughters and a granddaughter.
Funeral arrangments were private.

<HEAD>US Reinforces Ban on Sugar Imports from Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department strengthened its ban on
sugar imports from Panama today by denying that country any share of
a quota increase being allocated to sugar-exporting countries.
   In addition, the department said the administration is expanding
the list of Panamanian companies and individuals affiliated with the
Panamanian government to which Americans cannot make payments.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the actions are a direct
result of the continued unwillingness of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
``to respect the will of the Panamanian people by stepping down and
permitting the installation of a freely elected government.''
   As part of the economic sanctions the United States imposed
against the Central American country last year, Panama's sugar quota
was suspended and cost the Panamanian government $15 million in
revenues, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Panama's share of a general quota increase announced by the
Office of the Special Trade Representative would have been 23,403
tons, she added.
   Ms. Tutwiler had no additional information on the expanded list
of Panamanian companies and individuals to which the Americans
cannot make payments.
   The administration has refrained from imposing sanctions on China
after the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on grounds that
such action would hurt the Chinese people. Asked why the
administration does not apply the same rationale to Panama, Ms.
Tutwiler said Noriega is hurting the Panamanian people more by
refusing to step down.
   The administration took the new actions 12 days after
Noriega-dominated Council of State selected a long-time Noriega
associate to be Panama's unelected president.
   At the time, the administration said it would have no diplomatic
dealings with the new leadership.

<HEAD>NRC Staff Approves Evaporation of Water at Three Mile Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Mile Island plant operators should
be allowed to boil away 2.3 million gallons of radioactive water
left over from the nation's worst nuclear accident, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission staff says.
   The staff Monday amended the Unit 2 reactor license to allow the
process, concluding there would be no ``significant effect on the
quality of the human environment.''
   The full NRC will vote on evaporation procedures in six weeks.
   GPU Nuclear Corp. has said the water contains radioactive tritium
and trace amounts of cesium 137 and strontium 90. The three isotopes
cannot be completely removed from the water and will be released
into the atmosphere during evaporation.
   The plant operator has said it hopes to begin the two-year, $4
million process in November. The water has been stored since the
March 1979 accident, when the Unit 2 reactor lost cooling water and
half the radioactive core melted.
   Two citizens groups, Susquehanna Valley Alliance and Three Mile
Island Alert, contend that any further release of radiation would be
hazardous.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Mark Anniversary of Beijing Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people, many wearing black
armbands, rallied to cheer escaped leaders of China's pro-democracy
student movement Tuesday, the 100th day since its suppression.
   In London, 100 white paper flowers were laid on a street in the
Chinatown section to commemorate victims of the crackdown. Other
protests were held in Taiwan and the Portuguese territory of Macao.
   China's state media did not mention the day.
   Many of Hong Kong's favorite pop singers performed during a
nearly three-hour concert to mark the day, but the loudest cheers
were for leaders of the movement who escaped Chinese authorities.
   Wu'er Kaixi, a charismatic Beijing student who was one of China's
most wanted activists, vowed success for the fight for freedom in a
speech to the hushed crowd.
   ``Democracy will come to China, but it's going to be a long and
difficult road,'' Wu'er said in a voice cracking with emotion. ``If
we unite with a democratic spirit, one day we will rebuild the
Goddess of Democracy in Tiananmen Square.''
   He was referring to the statue that became the movement's symbol
in the final days before Chinese troops entered central Beijing on
June 3-4 to clear Tiananamen Square of pro-democracy activists.
   China says about 300 people died in the street clashes, but
Western security sources say the toll may have been 3,000.
   Also addressing the crowd by long-distance telephone were student
leader Li Lu and dissident intellectual Yan Jiaqi. Organizers did
not say from where the three leaders spoke.
   The military suppression traumatized this British colony, which
is to return to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Police estimated the crowd at more than 20,000, while organizers
said it could be up to 50,000.
   China's government in recent weeks has harshly criticized Hong
Kong residents who continue to support the pro-democracy movement,
which Beijing authorities call a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Seventeen people staged a 32-hour hunger strike at the local
Xinhua News Agency office, which is China's de facto embassy in the
colony. In front of the building was a poster bearing the Chinese
character ``ai'' _ which means mourning.
   Some fasters wore headbands that said, ``We shall not forget.''
   Memorial activities began Monday night, when up to 100 people
surrounded by glowing lanterns sat in silence for three hours at a
downtown monument to war dead. The lanterns were in the shape of the
tents used by Chinese students who occupied Tiananmen Square before
the crackdown.
   About 700 people carrying candles and chrysanthemums attended a
concert Tuesday in a Taiwan park despite heavy rains from Typhoon
Sarah. The mourners sang songs and recited poems to praise the
pro-democracy movement.
   In Macao, a Portuguese territory near Hong Kong that also will
return to Chinese rule at the end of the century, about 1,500 people
gathered for two memorial programs.
   Chen Yizi, the highest-ranking official known to have escaped
China since the crackdown, led the ceremony, which was attended by
about 50 supporters.
   Chen is former head of the Institute of Restructuring the Economy
and was a close adviser to Zhao Ziyang, the purged Communist Party
chief.
   At the ceremony, a refugee played a tape of gunshots that rang
out in Beijing when soldiers moved in to end the movement.
   ``It is important to remember what happened and why it
happened,'' said a Chinese poet, Duo Duo. ``Today is a day to
remember Tiananmen, which was a humiliation to us all, to humanity
and for all mankind.''

   Here is a text of President Bush's remarks
Tuesday to the nation's school children concerning drugs:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   You know, somehow the fall always feels like a time to start
over, a time full of possibility, and everyone gets a new chance.
   Now, I know there are Americans of every age watching. And to
those at home or at work, I ask you to talk with your families and
co-workers about drug abuse. Presidents don't often get the chance
to talk directly to students. And so today, for each of you sitting
in a classroom or assembly hall, this message goes straight to you.
   When I was thinking about what I wanted to say to you today about
drugs, I tried to put myself in your place, to look at it from your
perspective. But, you know, the harder I tried, the harder it got.
   It may seem to you that your parents and your teachers grew up in
simpler times. But most of them lived through the civil rights
struggles. Some of your fathers fought in Vietnam. And for many of
you, your parents and teachers were among the first to face drugs.
If you care enough to talk to them, you might be surprised at how
much they do understand.
   I used to play baseball. I knew I'd never make the big leagues
but I made a lot of friends, friends I learned to count on, both on
and off the field. And we trusted each other to come through, no
matter how tough it got, and I learned from that. I learned that the
kind of people you make your friends can either give you strength or
take it away.
   I'm not sure why it is, but some people just make you find the
best in yourself. They can help you become a better person, help you
discover more of who you are. There are others who may seem like
friends but they're not and they prove it every time they offer you
drugs.
   Every day, with a thousand small decisions, you're shaping your
future. It's a future that ought to be bright with potential, and
most of you are doing the right thing. But for those who let drugs
make their decisions for them, you can almost hear the doors
slamming shut.
   It isn't worth it. We know that now. Attitudes that once
encouraged or excused drug use have changed. Among high school
seniors, cocaine use has dropped by about a fifth, and overall drug
use is at the lowest levels in 10 years.
   But even if you don't use drugs, you ought to be angry about them
because you are being cheated by those who do. Add it all adds up.
Drug and alcohol abuse cost this country billions of dollars a year,
and I don't know how to quantify the human suffering that drugs
cause, but I do know we are all paying for it. We are all feeling it
every day.
   Every time someone does drugs or sells drugs, or even just looks
the other way, they are supporting an industry that costs more than
money, it costs lives. Each of you has a decision to make and dozens
of chances to make it, at a party, on the street, in the school
parking lot. And parents, teachers, coaches, politicians,
presidents, no one else can make that decision for you.
   But if you talk to someone you trust, they may remind you of
what's at stake. Yes, it's your decision. I can't tell you how to
make it, but I will tell you what it means.
   You all watch TV, you see the news, the crime, the devastation.
Every dollar that goes to drugs fuels the killing. As long as there
are Americans willing to buy drugs, there will be people willing to
sell drugs and people willing to kill as a cost of doing business.
   There is a connection between the suppliers, and even occasional
or weekend users that can never be forgotten. Casual drug use is
responsible for the casualties of the drug war. From the city
streets of America to the street bombings of Colombia, even dabblers
in drugs bear responsibility for the blood being spilled. And unlike
those of you in school this fall, those killed by the drug trade
never do get a second chance.
   Drugs are rightly called an equal opportunity destroyer, they
have no conscience. They don't care where the money comes from. They
just murder people, young and old, good and bad, innocent and
guilty, it doesn't matter. For too many, drugs mean death.
   I keep this badge. I keep this badge in my drawer desk to remind
me of that. It was worn by a young, rookie cop named Eddie Byrne, 22
years old, not much older than some of you. He was out trying to
stop the drug trade, protecting a witness so that a dealer could be
brought to justice. Eddie Byrne had three brothers, a girlfriend
he'd known for four years. He loved fishing and football _ he was a
running back at Plain Edge High School in New York _ and he had a
lot of friends in his neighborhood. And Eddie Byrne had dreams. But
in the early hours of a cold, February morning, sitting in a police
cruiser, Eddie was blown away at pointblank range, killed on the
orders of a drug kingpin, cold and calculated.
   I've heard some say, ``If you do drugs now and then, well, you're
not hurting anybody, it's no big deal.'' Well, the next time you
think about using drugs, I want you to think of Eddie Byrne, and I
want you to think about the family that lost him. To me, this badge
is a constant reminder that Eddie Byrne's life was not given in
vain. This is a promise: The killing must, and will stop.

<TEXT>
   Where you're sitting right now, or you're sitting there in
school, I know you've got your dreams, everyone does. But out on the
street a nightmare for America is happening, every day, every night.
Somewhere a teen-aged girl who ought to be in school is giving birth
to a baby already addicted to cocaine, and that baby is coming into
this world shaking and twitching from withdrawal, so sensitive to
the touch that it can't be held or fed properly.
   How can drugs cause so much pain? How can they lead brothers to
kill brothers? And mothers to abandon children? And behind all of
the senseless violence, the needless tragedy, what haunts me is the
question, ``Why?''
   I have one answer. Drugs are still a problem because too many of
us are still looking the other way, and that's why I wanted to talk
to you today. I am asking you not to look the other way.
   Maybe you are in trouble, or on the edge of trouble. Maybe you
know someone who is. Maybe you've got younger brothers or sisters,
you know they are looking up to you. Don't risk your life or theirs.
And if you are struggling with the kind of problem that can truly be
the toughest, if you have parents who have problems with drugs or
alcohol, find someone you can trust, talk to them about it.
   You know, all of you in a classroom know who's got a problem.
Today I am not just asking you to get help, I'm asking you to find
someone who needs you and offer to help. I'll say it again, if
you're not in trouble, help someone who is.
   We all want to succeed, and I'll let you in on a secret. We all
can succeed. If you don't use drugs you can be anything you want to
be.
   Maybe you've heard Michael Jordan say, ``You've got at least
three quarters of your life to go, that's three more lifetimes to
use, so don't blow it.''
   Saying no won't make you a nerd, won't make you a loser. In fact,
it will make you more friends than drugs ever will _ real friends.
But, if that's not enough reason, there is another side.
   Using illegal drugs is against the law, and if you break the law
you pay the price because the rules have changed. If you do drugs
you will be caught, and when you are caught you will be punished.
You might lose your driver's license _ some states have started
revoking users driving privileges _ or you might lose the college
loan you wanted, because we are not helping those who break the law.
These are privileges, not rights, and if you risk doing drugs you
risk everything, even your freedom, because you will be punished.
   Now, I can imagine a few whispers out there, maybe you think
we'll never get drugs under control, that it's too easy for the
dealers to get back on the street. Well, those days are over, too.
The revolving door just jammed.
   Some think there won't be room for them in jail. We'll make room.
We're almost doubling prison space. Some think there aren't enough
prosecutors. We'll hire them, with the largest increase in federal
prosecutors in history. The day of the dealer is drawing to a close.
   No matter who you are or how strong you are, drugs take control
of your life. But without drugs, you're in control. You can
determine your future, and that means staying in school. If you're
thinking about dropping out, think it through. Maybe you know
somebody who wants to quit school. Talk to them about it. And if you
have friends who have already dropped out, talk to them, too. Find a
way to bring them back.
   Today I've asked you to think about the terrible cost drugs are
making us all pay every day. But even more important, I'm asking you
to think about what you can do to make a difference for someone else.
   Last winter, after I was sworn in as president, I said that from
now on in America, any definition of a successful life must include
serving others, helping others, and I hope you all believe that.
   There's a story about a young boy and an old man who are walking
along a beach, and as they walked, the boy picked up each starfish
he passed and threw it into the sea. And the old man asked him why.
   ``If I left them here,'' the boy said, ``they would dry up in the
sun and die. I'm saving their lives.''
   ``But the beach goes on for miles, and there are millions of
starfish,'' the old man said. ``How can what you're doing make any
difference at all?''
   And the boy looked at the starfish in his hand, threw it out into
the ocean, and answered, ``It makes a difference to this one.''
   You're here to make a difference, for yourself and those around
you. So learn to count on each other. Take care of each other. Give
someone else another chance, and make the days mean something.
   Have a good year, and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday approved the first
government in the East bloc not led by Communists, giving half the
seats to Solidarity but reserving the key ministries controlling
defense and police for the Communists.
   ``For the first time in half a century, Poland has a government
that can be considered by millions of people as their own,'' said
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa from Gdansk, where the independent
movement struggled through eight years of Communist repression to
its triumph.
   ``My biggest dream has come true,'' said Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, also of Solidarity, after his Cabinet was approved by a
vote of 402 in favor, none against and 13 abstentions.
   The new Cabinet, called the Council of Ministers, includes
Mazowiecki, 11 Solidarity members, and a foreign minister
independent but sympathetic to Solidarity. The Communists have four
seats.
   The Solidarity-aligned United Peasant Party holds four seats, and
Solidarity's other coalition partner, the Democratic Party, has
three.
   The Communists, in addition to controlling the army and police,
will retain considerable influence through President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, a Communist. The new government also has promised
allegiance to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   Still, Mazowiecki, once a political prisoner, promised an
overhaul of Communist institutions in an eloquent speech that he was
forced to interrupt for 45 minutes when he felt faint from
exhaustion.
   He called for reforming the police and the justice system,
liberalizing laws on associations, gatherings and censorship,
creating a new democratic constitution, removing political and
ideological barriers to promotion, giving universities full autonomy
and battling ``catastrophic'' environmental pollution.
   The main focus was Poland's economy. Mazowiecki said the ranks of
the poor were swelling and warned that production and living
standards, already lower than 10 years ago, were likely to decline
further.
   ``The new government will act under the pressure that at any
moment the construction of democracy that only just started can
collapse under the economic crisis,'' he said.
   He called for immediate steps to combat triple-digit inflation,
including tax reform, making the zloty convertible with Western
currency and creating a stock exchange.
   Mazowiecki, a Solidarity newspaper editor who became the East
bloc's first non-Communist prime minister, rejected a past when the
Communist government ``wanted to rule not only over the lives but
the minds'' of Poles.
   ``Poland can be lifted only by a society of free citizens and by
a government that enjoys the confidence of the clear majority of
society,'' he said.
   Marian Orzechowski, the Politburo member who heads the Communist
parliament delegation, rose to support Mazowiecki.
   ``My party is not going into opposition,'' Orzechowski said. ``We
will govern together, and together be responsible for the fate of
the nation.''
   In the Soviet Union, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said, ``We are prepared to cooperate with (the new)
government and develop our relations with Poland.''
   State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington
the approval of the new government is another step ``in what has
been a historical process of transformation.''
   ``The new government can count on our continued support,'' she
said.
   A succession of once-inconceivable events led to the moment when
Mazowiecki celebrated the new government with the ``V'' for victory
sign and when Jacek Kuron, who spent nine years in prison for his
activism, sipped champagne as the new labor minister.
   The Communist Party, realizing it was unable to control economic
and social tensions alone, began negotiating early this year with
Solidarity, which it had sought to crush after declaring it illegal
in December 1981.
   The April accords that resulted from the ``round-table'' talks
led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status and
unprecedented democratic elections in June. Solidarity won those
elections decisively.
   Walesa negotiated a coalition with the United Peasant and
Democratic parties, which had been docile Communist allies.
Mazowiecki became prime minister Aug. 24 after Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak
was unable to form a Communist-led government and resigned.
   In addition to the defense and interior ministries, the
Communists will run the strategically important Transportation
Ministry. They also retain a degree of responsibility for the
economy through the Foreign Trade Ministry.
   Mazowiecki told Parliament he came ``as a man of Solidarity,
faithful to the legacy of August'' 1980, when Solidarity became the
first legal independent union in the East bloc.
   ``The legacy of August is also the ability to overcome disputes
and divisions, the ability to find partnership and renounce the idea
of taking revenge for the past,'' he said.
   After 40 minutes, Mazowiecki, looking exhausted, asked for a
recess. He was examined and a doctor said fatigue was to blame.
   Returning, he said: ``I am very sorry but this is a result of
several weeks of too intensive work and I have reached the same
condition as the Polish economy. But I have overcome it, and I hope
the economy will do it as well.''

<HEAD>Nation's Schoolchildren Increasingly Subjected to Dress, Hair Codes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Students returning to class this fall are returning home if their
hair's too long or skirt's too short, as more high schools across
the country enact new hair and dress codes to impose official ideas
of fashion.
   But some parents and students say there's too much ado about
hairdos and the clothes kids wear. They argue that long hair or
tattered jeans tell little about how a student will do in class.
   Several Texas school systems have new dress codes, mostly aimed
at offensive or suggestive T-shirts, and Baltimore schools banned
furs, costly jewelry and leather coats. Dozens of other systems,
including some in Michigan, New York and Louisiana, adopted
voluntary dress codes for schools to consider.
   A Houston father filed a lawsuit Tuesday against school
officials, accusing them of sexual discrimination and civil rights
violations for barring his two sons from class for a second
consecutive year because of their long hair.
   In Jasper, Ala., a mother complained about an invasion of privacy
after her son was sent home because his hair was an inch longer than
allowed by school policy.
   ``His hair doesn't have anything to do with his education,''
Shelia Whitfield said at an angry school board meeting that brought
comparisons to the individual rights arguments of the 1960s.
   So far, the courts are on the side of authority.
   Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor who
specializes in First Amendment issues, said the Supreme Court has
never dealt directly with the issue and the lower federal courts
have ruled both ways. Still, he said, the high court would likely
side with school boards if it ruled today.
   ``I think it stretches the free expression clause to apply it in
schools,'' Tribe said. ``The power of compulsory education already
involves a major intrusion into a person's ability to express
himself. The school board has a broad range of powers over its
students.''
   Sentiment is growing for stricter dress and hair codes as school
administrators seek a sense of normalcy and discipline in
classrooms, said Gary Marx, a spokesman for the American Association
of School Administrators.
   ``We do see indications here and there that schools are thinking
about dress codes and how students are attired may affect their
education and the education of others,'' Marx said. ``I think there
is a sense in society that we sometimes act the way we look.''
   Civil libertarians see the codes as irrelevant to learning.
   ``It's very regrettable when educators fail to see that kids have
rights and that breathing down their necks about ways they should be
able to express themselves is not encouraging real education,'' said
Leanne Kats, executive director of the National Coalition Against
Censorship.
   In Henry County, Ga., about 100 students picketed the school
superintendent's office late last month when dozens of boys were
sent home because their hair touched the collar in violation of a
new policy.
   In Baltimore, schools spokesman Dick Holden said the new dress
code was aimed at eliminating ``the uniform of the drug culture.''
He said the banned clothes are too expensive for some students to
afford _ leading to violence.
   ``The dress code became a major topic of discussion after some
violent incidents in our schools involving outsiders stealing, or
attempting to steal, jackets or jewelry of our students,'' said
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. ``Clothing had become attractions to
criminal activity.''
   In New Orleans, school board spokeswoman Rose Peterson said about
100 schools have adopted some kind of uniform.
   She cited three reasons for the policy: ``It's a security issue.
When the schools are wearing a uniform, it's easy to recognize an
outsider. For the parents, they perceive it as a lot cheaper. And it
takes the pressure off kids to wear designer clothes.''
   Sometimes, both the rules and the reactions are laughable.
   In Clovis, N.M., a one-year trial dress code is in effect after
students rewrote an old one that banned shorts for boys but allowed
miniskirts for girls. In protest, some of the boys wore miniskirts
to school.
   The new policy allows shorts and skirts if neither is shorter
than 5 inches above the knee.
   And in San Antonio, a 13-year-old middle school student was
forced to get rid of two ``Batman'' emblems emblazoned on each side
of his head with bleach. Officials banned him from class until he
came back with a classic flattop haircut.
   Many students see the restrictions as arbitrary, but others,
including student body president Jason Thompson of Allen High School
in Dallas, support policies encouraging neat appearance.
   ``Fads come and go,'' Thompson said. ``Last year, when stud
earrings were allowed for the first time, almost everyone went out
and got his ear pierced. But now you don't see earrings that much.''

   Black civil rights leader Medgar Evers will
be remembered in the city where he was slain in 1963 with a
life-size bronze statue to be unveiled next year, a fund-raising
group announced Tuesday.
   ``Many of our young people know nothing about Medgar Evers. I
think a special concerted effort should be made so these young
people will know that we are wading in the blood and standing on the
shoulders of those who have gone before us,'' Bettye Hunt of
Jackson, a board member of Medgar Evers Statute Fund Inc., said at a
news conference.
   Byron de la Beckwith of Greenwood was tried twice in Evers'
shotgun slaying outside his home. But each time the case ended in a
hung jury.
   An annual Medgar Evers Homecoming Banquet and related events
across Mississippi already honor Evers, the first field secretary in
Mississippi for the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Fund President Mirtes Gregory of Jackson said the group already
has raised $12,000 toward a target of $50,000. She said 1990 is the
target year for completion of the fund-raising and unveiling of the
statue.
   The statue will be done by sculptor Jay Warren, a faculty member
at the Johnson Atelier Sculptor Institute in Mercerville, N.J.
   The statue fund's honorary board members include bluesman B.B.
King and singer-actor Kris Kristofferson.

<TEXT>
   In a jammed tent city in
picturesque Bavaria, Uwe and Norma Koenig eagerly scan a bulletin
board offering jobs ranging from bakers' assistants to electricians.
   For the couple tasting their first day of freedom, getting back
to work is the No. 1 priority.
   ``It's a little scary,'' said Koenig, who worked 10 years as a
welder at a state-owned cooperative factory near Leipzig, East
Germany.
   ``It's going to be difficult at first, but we knew that when we
decided to leave. We're very optimistic, we didn't leave everything
we owned behind to just give up or fail,'' said Koenig.
   For most of the thousands of East Germans streaming into Bavaria,
the tent city in Tiefenbach is just a brief stop on the way to other
facilities set up throughout West Germany to help them get started
in a new life.
   As the emigres shower and have their first meals in West Germany,
relief workers and area businesses are at work compiling lists of
job possibilities and lodging.
   Bulletin boards with scores of job notices have been set up
inside and outside the tent city.
   Some large companies and hospitals have parked vans outside the
camp where they are interviewing potential employees on the spot.
   Local entrepreneurs have stuffed handbills listing job openings
under the windshield wipers of the East Germans' easily recognizable
Trabant sedans.
   Like most of the temporary residents at the Tiefenbach camp, the
Koenigs are taking time to decide where they want to live and where
to find work.
   ``The East German government told us for years what we could and
could not do,'' said Mrs. Koenig. ``Now we're going to do what's
best for us.''
   The Koenigs said they hoped to eventually settle in the Dortmund
area, where they have relatives.
   ``Most of these people here are young and have had technical
training of some kind,'' said Michael Tietmann, the director of the
tent city. ``For them, getting a job should not be a big problem.''
   More than 500 people are staying at the camp, nestled in a small
valley outside Tiefenbach, nine miles north of Passau.
   In the crowded camp, Red Cross volunteers scurry through the
narrow avenues between the tents serving meals, giving advice and
tending babies as their parents rest from the long journey from
Hungary.
   Most of the East Germans will move on within a day, Tietmann
said, but they are quickly replaced by new arrivals.
   Uwe Brinkmann, one of the recent arrivals, said he hoped to
eventually get a job as an elementary schoolteacher again. He
admitted it would take some time to adjust to the West German system.
   ``In East German schools, the curriculum is pretty much dominated
by (Communist) party doctrine,'' he said.
   Brinkmann said he is prepared to take lesser work temporarily to
make ends meet.
   Richard Albrecht, a 33-year-old professional gardener, agreed.
   ``The main thing is to get going,'' said the divorced father of
two children, who accompanied him West.
   But he said it is also important for him and his fellow
countrymen that they quickly be allowed to use their skills and
knowledge in West Germany.
   ``I've worked hard and know my profession. We're not beggars and
we don't want to be treated like poor cousins. We want to work hard
and earn real money for honest labor,'' Albrecht said.
   He said he was wary of some of the offers being made to the new
arrivals.
   ``There are a lot of hucksters out there trying to offer jobs to
us on the quick for much less than West Germans get paid. You have
to be careful,'' Albrecht said.
   For many of the young and unmarried arrivals, thinking about work
is still far from their minds.
   ``I've been in the West now for two days and I'm going to enjoy
myself for awhile,'' said a 22-year-old machinist from Dresden who
asked not to be identified by name.
   ``I think I'll go to Paris and then come back and look for a
job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alert Issued As Holding Pond Nears Capacity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant went
on alert today when a holding pond containing toxic substances
neared capacity because of heavy rain, authorities said.
   State officials disagreed over whether the pond contained
radioactive substances and what sort of risk a dam break or overflow
posed.
   The pond is at 75 percent capacity with its water 2{ feet below
the point of overflow, but the level has been rising a quarter foot
a day since Friday and is still climbing, said Paul Frohardt, Rocky
Flats program manager for the state Health Department.
   State operations officer Len Boulas said: ``Our concern was not
so much flood damage, but sediment in the pond, whose trace elements
are radioactive and toxic in nature.''
   However, Frohardt said a herbicide is the only toxic chemical
known to be in the pond, which could overflow into a creek that
provides drinking water to Westminster, Thornton and Northglenn.
``Even if that water needed to be discharged today, there is not a
present or substantial health risk to people downstream,'' Frohardt
said.
   He said flood damage from a dam break on the pond, which has a
capacity of 23 million gallons, could be greater than the risks
posed by toxic substances.
   Coincidentally, the incident occurred about 10:45 a.m. as the
state Division of Emergency Services was conducting an emergency
preparedness drill at the plant, said Boulas.
   Health Department officials were taking samples from the pond at
midday to determine the toxicity of the pond water. Boulas said
officials also were examining the pond itself to see whether it
might overflow or its dam break.
   The Division of Emergency Services drill today involved the
hypothetical failure of a pond at Rocky Flats, but not the one
officials became concerned about, according to division spokesman
Dave Lawton. The drill was called off.
   ``It is a normal thing _ the training exercise _ but it was
getting to be too similar to what was happening,'' said Lawton.
``And as it was playing out, some people were responding to look at
the other situation. That took them out of the exercise, and it was
getting too hard to deal with.''
   Plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons are made at Rocky Flats,
which is 16 miles northwest of Denver and is operated by Rockwell
International for the Department of Energy.
   FBI agents and investigators from the Environmental Protection
Agency raided Rocky Flats on June 6 for evidence of illegal dumping
of hazardous wastes. A federal grand jury convened Aug. 1 to look
into the matter.

   A freighter ran the gauntlet of Syrian
shellfire Tuesday to deliver bales of newsprint and canned food to
the besieged Christian enclave, police said.
   Police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in rocket,
howitzer and mortar duels across the Lebanese capital, which is
divided into Christian and Moslem sectors.
   The latest casualties increased the toll to 847 killed and 2,528
wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between Christian
army units under Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops based in Lebanon.
   The violence came on the eve of a new effort by three Arab
nations to end the violence in Lebanon. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
said he was optimistic about a settlement.
   The Syrian barrage on the Christian region escalated when the
ship Princess-Hand entered Lebanese territorial waters off the coast
of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners used radar-controlled 130mm howitzers to shell the
coastline, and scores of shells exploded around the ship, said a
police spokesman, who refused to be named in line with standing
regulations.
   The Princess-Hand anchored safely at the port of Jounieh an hour
later, and the fighting eased into sporadic exchanges.
   The ship's nationality and agents were not known.
   The police spokesman said the newsprint was imported by three
newspapers operating in the 310-square-mile enclave. He did not
identify the papers.
   The Christian enclave, home to 1 million people, has been
besieged by Syrian and allied forces more than six months.
   Syrian gunboats have seized several ships trying to defy the
blockade and head to Christian waters, and 22 vessels have been hit
by Syrian fire, Aoun's Christian government reported.
   Fourteen sailors have been killed and five wounded, by official
police count.
   King Fahd was one of three Arab leaders who suspended a
peacemaking mission assigned to them two months earlier at an Arab
summit in Morocco.
   They implicitly blamed Syria for the deadlock because it refusal
to agree to a timetable for withdrawing its 40,000 soldiers from
Lebanon. The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League mandate to quell the civil war.
   Fahd's comments came on the eve of a meeting in Jiddah by the
foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia Jiddah to
revive the peacemaking effort.
   The king told the newspapers Okaz and Bilad that ``all parties to
the conflict are more convinced that efforts must be continued to
search for the suitable solutions.''
   He also said ``all the new elements raise hope that the
tripartite committee will find fertile ground to move for peace.''
   Lebanese newspapers and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri also
predicted there soon would be a truce.
   The independent An-Nahar newspaper said Aoun has agreed to the
idea of forming a team to monitor the import of weapons by the
warring factions in Lebanon. His rejection of the proposal had
stalled peace efforts.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been Aoun's main backer, and
the Syrians insist on an observation force to block Iraqi arms
deliveries by sea.
   Berri, speaking from Damascus, told the United Arab Emirates
newspaper Al-Bayan: ``The Arab committee will achieve progress in
reaching a cease-fire.''
   The fighting broke out after Aoun blockaded the private ports
with which Moslem militias finance their operations in the
14-year-old civil war. Syria then blockaded the Christian enclave.
   Aoun pledged a ``war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians.

<HEAD>Balance of Payments Deficit Widens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade widened to $30.99 billion from April through June as the
country suffered its first shortfall in the category covering
overseas investment earnings in three decades, the government
reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the current account deficit rose by
2 percent over the January-March imbalance of $30.39 billion. It
marked the second consecutive quarterly setback and provided fresh
evidence, economists said, of how entrenched America's trade
problems are.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also trade in services.
   The deficit in merchandise trade actually narrowed during the
spring, falling by 2.3 percent to $27.7 billion, the smallest
imbalance in merchandise trade in more than four years.
   However, this improvement was offset by the first deficit in the
services category since 1958.
   That category, which primarily reflects investment earnings
between countries, registered a deficit of $176 million in the
second quarter, compared with a surplus of $1.5 billion in the first
quarter.
   Analysts called the services deficit an ominous sign as
foreigners begin to earn more and more on their U.S. investments,
making it even more difficult for the country to close its trade gap.
   ``The negative services payment is a distressing omen. We are now
paying more to foreigners on their U.S. investments than we are
earning on our assets in foreign countries and that is worrisome,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.
   While the spring services deficit was small and could well be
revised away in coming reports, analysts said the trend is clear:
The United States will be forced to transfer more and more wealth
overseas to service the growing level of foreign holdings in the
United States.
   John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting company, said he expected the services trade category
would be in deficit throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact that
the United States is the world's largest debtor country.
   Simply put, that means foreigners own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own overseas. America's net debtor position stood at
$532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by
another $120 billion this year.
   Many economists predict that U.S. living standards will begin
declining because financing the growing foreign debt burden will
make less funds available in this country.
   ``We are a half-trillion dollars in debt to the rest of the world
and debtors must eventually pay the piper,'' Hagens said.
   In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of the
current account deficit, U.S. foreign aid payments and pensions to
Americans living overseas, fell by 11.4 percent to $3.1 billion in
the spring.
   The current account deficit reflects the sum of the deficits in
services, merchandise trade and so-called unilateral transfers.
   For the first six months of the year, the current account deficit
ran at an annual rate of $122.76 billion, down only slightly from
the 1988 deficit of $126.55 billion.
   While the 1988 deficit reflected a 12 percent improvement from an
all-time high of $143.7 billion in 1987, many economists predicted
that the current account will show little improvement this year and
will actually begin to worsen again in 1990.
   They base this pessimism on the deterioration in America's
investment position and an expected slowdown in merchandise export
growth, reflecting the big rise in the dollar's value in the past
year. A higher dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive on overseas
markets.
   The Commerce Department on Friday will report on the monthly
merchandise trade performance for July. In advance of that report,
many economists were expecting the deficit to worsen to around $9
billion, up from June's $8.17 billion deficit.
   At the start of this decade, the United States was running
surpluses in its current account because earnings from American
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investment
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the
United States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   While the United States has been a net debtor for four years, the
country still enjoyed a surplus in investment earnings because many
of the U.S. investments were older and brought in more of a return
than the newer foreign investments in this country.

<HEAD>WWF Launches Major Initiative to Save Tropical Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA MACKENZIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Wildlife Fund on Tuesday
urged the 12-nation European Economic Community to rethink its
timber strategy as it launched a major initiative to save tropical
forests.
   The appeal by the organization was made in a report presented to
the European Parliament. The report was aimed at the EEC because the
trade bloc is the largest consumer of tropical hardwood, importing
more than one-third of the world's annual production.
   The report noted that within 80 years there would be no undamaged
tropical forest if current rates of deforestation continue.
   The most urgent need is to increase funds to protect and manage
these forests, the report said, urging the EEC to set aside $520
million for this.
   Chris Elliott, the World Wildlife Fund's tropical forest expert,
said the funds could be used to increase protected areas of tropical
forests, train more forest rangers, and compensate timber producing
countries for lost revenue.
   The group called on the EEC to introduce ``substantial
initiatives on debt relief to take financial pressure off developing
countries,'' which depend on timber exports.
   Elliott said countries ``mine tropical forests to pay off
interest on their debt.'' He suggested these countries should be
encouraged to view their forests ``as a renewable resource.''
   The major exporters of tropical timber to the EEC, based on 1984
figures, were Gabon, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Liberia, Congo, Ghana,
Philippines, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, according to
the report.
   The World Wildlife Fund, founded 28 years ago and based in
Switzerland, is the world's largest private conservation
organization. Its aim is to conserve the natural environment and
ecological processes essential to life on earth.
   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' tropical forests act
as a natural pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide and
producing oxygen. If carbon dioxide isn't removed from the
atmosphere, it can trap heat there, which some scientists say
contributes to a global warming trend called the ``greenhouse
effect.''

   In a department store kiosk, the stern face of
Vladimir I. Lenin glared out at the bustling crowds and glittery
goods.
   The Soviet leader's image wasn't there as a comment on the
excesses of America's bourgeois consumer culture. It was emblazoned
on a T-shirt, which trend-conscious shoppers could buy for $40.
   Also being hawked in the ``Perestroika'' kiosk at Bloomingdale's
department store: coarse rye bread, flown in from a Moscow bakery,
for $6 a loaf, and heavy, outdated-looking Soviet watches for up to
$180. Miraed Peake Smith, a store spokeswoman, said the items sold
at a bull-market pace.
   Soviet products _ and Western goods made to look like they came
from the Soviet Union _ have suddenly acquired cachet in America.
Merchandisers and Sovietologists give two reasons for the
phenomenon: Americans' boundless hunger for novelty and an appetite
for more understanding of the country in view of the changes wrought
by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The appeal is that they're hokey,'' said a woman named Mexx,
who sells Soviet watches at a market in an affluent Manhattan
neighborhood.
   ``A large part of fashion is anti-fashion,'' she said of the
watches that feature large faces, heavy casings and canteen-like
caps that screw on to the stem for an old-fashioned method of
waterproofing.
   ``I think people like them because they're grotesque,'' said
Marshall Goldman, an economist at Harvard University's Russian
Research Center.
   Advertisements capitalize on the watches' archaic appeal. ``Great
1950s design never died, it just defected to Moscow,'' chirps the
catalogue of The Sharper Image, a chain of novelty stores, about a
watch it describes as perfect for ``threshing wheat at your country
dacha or going on maneuvers near the Chinese border.''
   Portraying the Soviet Union as just another purveyor of campy
consumer goods isn't necessarily trivializing the country, said Kim
Penney, vice president of Creative Licensing Corp., which markets
Moscow State University T-shirts.
   ``We're not pretending it is going to bring world peace ... but
20 years ago they were the enemy; we have to have a better
understanding of them as people,'' she said.
   Almost anything can help fill Americans' knowledge gap about the
Soviet Union, Ms. Penney said.
   ``When we showed the T-shirt to people, some thought we made it
(the university) up,'' she said.
   Wearing such garb also might express a more serious assessment of
the country, said Ellen Chances, a professor of Russian culture at
Princeton University.
   ``The trend that you see comes from the fact that Gorbachev has
been pushing for real reforms'' and Americans are responding to
them, she said. ``We buy from countries we feel good about. Don't
forget that a few years ago, liquor stores were boycotting
Stolichnaya vodka.''
   ``It is a manifestation of the feeling that buyers are hoping the
U.S.S.R. and the United States will have a happy marriage,'' said
Ms. Smith of Bloomingdale's.
   Along with goodwill, the vogue also is bringing the Soviet Union
badly needed hard currency, said economist Judy Shelton.
   Ms. Shelton, author of the book ``The Coming Soviet Crash:
Gorbachev's Desperate Pursuit of Western Credit,'' said she believes
the selling of consumer goods ``will teach them how to market
products in the West.''
   But she added: ``I wouldn't call it a first wave'' of the Soviet
Union's becoming a robust trader in the world market. ``Soviet goods
generally tend to be pretty crummy,'' she said.
   Questions of quality apparently don't bother people who want to
ride the wave of fashion, said Mexx, the watch-seller. Pointing to a
watch guarantee written in Russian, she said: ``They have no idea
what it says, and I plead innocence.''
   Nor was she concerned that Soviet chic might be short-lived;
there's always another fad on the horizon.
   ``Last year, people were interested in Spain, so I sold Spanish
things,'' she said.
   Her view was borne out by Bloomingdale's, which took down the
Perestroika boutique last week.
   ``We're starting a `Vive La France' promotion,'' Ms. Smith said.

<HEAD>Deaths 75, Injuries Exceed 72,000 From Nursery Items</HEAD>

   More than 75 children under 5 die each year of
injuries involving nursery items, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission reported Tuesday.
   The commission also said about 72,300 children in the same age
group were injured last year in accidents involving those things.
   The figures were released in a statement announcing observance of
next week as Baby Safety Week by the commission and the Juvenile
Products Manufacturers Association.
   ``There is no substitute for adult supervision protecting
children from death and injury,'' said Anne Graham, acting chairman
of the commission.
   The commission said an average of 76.4 deaths per year related to
nursery products were reported from 1983 through 1987.
   Of these, an average of 54.4 were releated to cribs, many of them
older cribs such as those stored in attics or sold at garage and
yard sales. The commission said these cribs may have slats more than
2] inches apart, decorative cutouts or high corner posts. Such
features can result in strangulation.
   Other items of nursery equipment blamed in the deaths of children
included playpens, accounting for an average of 4.2 deaths, and high
chairs, an average of 2.4. On the average there was one death a year
connected with strollers and carriages and less than one from baby
walkers or jumpers, from changing tables and from baby gates and
enclosures.
   Other unspecified items accounted for an average of 13.2 deaths
per year.
   Baby walkers and jumpers, on the other hand, accounted for the
largest number of injuries, 17,700, followed by strollers and
carriages 13,300, cribs 12,800, high chairs 8,200, changing tables
2,300, playpens 1,700, baby gates and enclosures 400 and other items
15,800.
   The figures do not add up to the totals because of rounding.
   The commission urged parents to monitor the nursery equipment
used in child care facilities, as well as that in their own homes.

   U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon told the
Senate on Tuesday that the trial that led to his imprisonment on
perjury charges was a ``miscarriage of justice'' and that he wants
to return as an active federal judge.
   Nixon, 60, has been in prison serving a five-year sentence since
March 1988 but will continue to collect his $89,500 annual judge's
salary until he resigns, dies or is convicted by the Senate on
impeachment charges.
   ``I was wrongly convicted,'' Nixon told a 12-member Senate panel
that will summarize the evidence against him for the full Senate,
which is trying the judge following his impeachment by the House
last year.
   The case revolves around Nixon's knowledge of a marijuana
smuggling case and whether he tried to influence its outcome. It
involved the son of a wealthy businessman in Hattiesburg, Miss., who
had sold Nixon lucrative oil properties.
   Nixon denied to federal investigators and a grand jury that he
ever discussed the case with anyone. That denial was the basis for
his later conviction on perjury charges.
   Nixon, who remains chief U.S. district judge for the southern
district of Mississippi, was appointed by President Johnson and is
the last remaining Democrat on the federal bench in that state.
   He told the Senate committee Tuesday the conversations that were
the central points of his impeachment were not ``discussions'' about
the narcotics case and were was so minor that he never thought to
mention them to federal investigators or the grand jury.
   Nixon said that in March 1983 he visited oilman Wiley Fairchild
because Fairchild had asked him to keep in touch with him after he
sold him oil property in 1980.
   Fairchild was ``mad as hell'' because his son, who'd been
arrested on narcotics charges, was causing the Fairchild name ``to
be dragged through the news media,'' Nixon said.
   Furthermore, Fairchild said he thought the local prosecutor, Paul
``Bud'' Holmes and another attorney, Carroll Ingram, were trying to
blackmail him into paying more legal fees by getting his son
indicted in state court, said Nixon.
   ``I was taken aback,'' said Nixon, who said he didn't believe
either lawyer, both friends of his, would be involved in blackmail.
   ``I thought it was a figment of his imagination,'' said Nixon.
   The case had already been handled federally and the son, Drew
Fairchild, had arranged a plea bargain that kept him out of jail.
   Holmes testified last week that at unbeknownst to the elder
Fairchild or Nixon, he also had arranged a plea bargain with the son.
   Nixon testified that at one point, he went to Holmes' house to
borrow some Hank Williams records. When he got there he mentioned to
Holmes what Fairchild had said about blackmail.
   Nixon said Holmes was on the phone most of the time he was there.
He said he was about 20 feet away from Holmes but could not hear
Holmes' phone conversations because of loud background music. But he
said at one point Holmes called him over and handed him the phone.
   On the other end of the line was Wiley Fairchild.
   ``He said, `I'm glad you talked to that fellow. I'm satisfied,'''
said Nixon. ``I said, `that's good' and handed the phone back to
Holmes.''
   Nixon said he went back to playing records and Holmes talked a
little longer to Fairchild.
   Nixon said he asked Holmes why he placed the call and the
prosecutor said it was because he wanted ``to get the damn thing
straightened out.''
   The judge testified that he thought Fairchild's remark about
being satisfied was a reference to the blackmail accusation and that
he never thought about the incident again.
   He said that when questioned by federal officials and during
grand jury proceedings about whether he had discussed Drew
Fairchild's case, he did not think about the phone conversation that
night at Holmes' house.
   He said at the time he did not consider it a ``discussion'' of
the case and to this day does not.
   The House, voting unanimously for impeachment, alleged:
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do
officialy or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never
influenced anyone in the case.
   _Nixon undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during
an interview with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand
jury testimony.

   Five children ages 5 to 8 broke into a
school and stole calculators and crayons, toppled desks, smashed a
glass door and vandalized a dozen classrooms, police said.
   The two boys, ages 7 and 8, and three girls, ages 5, 6 and 7,
told police they used stones to smash a window to get into
Stonehedge Elementary School, according to police reports.
   The damage, estimated at more than $3,000, was discovered Monday
morning, although two of the children had been found in the school
Sunday afternoon when officers responded to an alarm, police said.
   Officer Thomas Marlin said money, calculators, pencils, books and
crayons were taken, and electronic equipment and hanging plants were
damaged. Desks and file cabinets were toppled, and a glass door was
smashed, he said.
   All five children are related and share a grandmother living in
Camillus. Three of them, a kindergartener and two first-graders,
live with the grandmother and attend Stonehedge. The others live in
Syracuse and were visiting the grandmother, police said.
   Donald Stebbins, principal at the 880-pupil school, said the
three Stonehedge pupils admitted vandalizing the classrooms. They
were suspended for a week, he said.
   ``They know they did something that was not correct, but I'm not
sure they understand the full impact of that,'' he said Tuesday.
   Police who went to the school Sunday said they found two children
but no sign of vandalism in the school.
   Later the same day, the grandmother reported the children
missing. When officers approached the children near the school, the
children threw a calculator, notebook, some change and school
supplies into the shrubs, police said.
   On Monday, a janitor reported finding 12 second-floor classrooms
vandalized.
   Police said they won't press charges because state law doesn't
hold children 7 and younger responsible for their actions.
   The police files, however, will be turned over to Onondaga County
Family Court for consideration of possible action regarding the
8-year-old.
   Principal Donald Stebbins said the three Stonehedge pupils had
been suspended for a week. The West Genesee School District will
seek restitution through Family Court, he said.

   The Bush administration called ``somewhat
mystifying'' Tuesday a charge by the Soviet foreign minister that
the United States has been dragging its feet on nuclear arms
negotiations.
   ``We reject any suggestion of United States' foot-dragging in the
START talks, or that negotiations have been put on a back burner,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   He said the United States was still awaiting a Soviet reponse to
U.S. proposals made ``at the latest round of the START talks,
including new ideas on verification and stability measures.'' START
is an acronym for strategic arms reduction talks.
   Fitzwater called Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's
criticism of the U.S. stance on arms control ``somewhat mystifying
in the sense that we have felt the negotiations were going ahead
rather well.''
   Shevardnadze, in an interview published Monday in the Soviet
government daily Izvestia, charged that talks in Geneva on a partial
nuclear test ban had been ``frozen'' because of the new Bush
administration's indecision.
   He contrasted the ``constraint and timidity'' of the Bush
approach with progress on arms reductions made during Ronald
Reagan's presidency.
   Shevardnadze said both countries and ``the entire world community
have lost a lot'' because of the Bush administration's ``restrained,
indecisive position.''
   Shevardnadze is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in Wyoming on Sept. 22-23 for discussions on nuclear
testing and conventional arms reductions. The talks could be a
prelude to a later summit between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Fitzwater, asked if he felt the Soviet minister was playing
politics with his criticism, said, ``I wouldn't want to characterize
his motives. I don't know.''
   But the White House went out of its way Tuesday not to antagonize
the Kremlin on another matter: the visit to Washington of Soviet
maverick Boris Yeltsin.
   Bush met with Yeltsin for about 15 minutes and ``emphasized that
the American people share his hope for the success of the reform
movement in the Soviet Union,'' the White House spokesman said
afterwards.
   Bush also ``noted his very positive relationship'' with Gorbachev
and reiterated his support for perestroika, Fitzwater said in a
written statement.
   Fitzwater said beforehand that Bush only planned to drop by
Yeltsin's meeting with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to
shake hands.
   Fitzwater said Bush did not want to ``provide a platform for
dissent'' or ``do anything to foster internal conflict that might be
associated with this trip.''
   The meeting was closed to reporters, who usually are allowed to
observe the start of Bush's meetings with visiting dignitaries.

<HEAD>Soviets Say East German Exodus Through Hungary Illegal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Refugees, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman on Tuesday stopped short of
condemning Hungary's decision to let East Germans move to the West
but indicated the exodus is illegal.
   Moscow sent a hard-line Politburo member, Yegor Ligachev, to East
Berlin. The Soviet government denied Ligachev's trip was to discuss
the refugee issue, but it was presumed the subject would be raised.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
briefing Hungary had taken ``an unusual and unexpected step'' by
allowing the Germans to go West. He added: ``The Hungarian news
agency has said that Hungary is not responsible for that situation.''
   Hungary on Sunday broke with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally,
and announced that East Germans were free to cross into the West.
Thousands of East Germans took advantage of the offer.
   V. Kondratyev, a reporter for Soviet state-run television based
in Bonn, said on the evening newscast ``Vremya'' that the exodus was
designed by West Germans ``to destablize the G.D.R. (German
Democratic Republic) authorities, create conditions for spitting
socialist friendship and for German reunification.''
   As ``Vremya'' showed East Germans packing into cars, Kondratyev
said the ``forbidden soil'' of the West was apparently a prime lure
drawing East Germans.
   ``Some (East German) citizens want to see the world, to quickly
obtain a car and home and other good things,'' the reporter said.
``Some are acting on political motives.''
   He said some West Germans are trying to attract their Eastern
neighbors by portraying East Germany as ``a country without a
future.''
   Gerasimov, chatting with reporters, said the East Germans do not
merit being called refugees.
   ``They don't have the status of refugees. Refugees are people who
are under political or religious persecution. I don't think they can
claim that ... They simply want to move.''
   Gerasimov scoffed when a reporter asked if the Hungarian decision
was a humanitarian act.
   ``I believe there are legal ways to leave the country,''
Gerasimov said. ``There's no reason to take the route via Hungary.''
   Asked if the Kremlin was worried about the exodus, he answered:
`Naturally there is some concern about this situation.'' But he then
added: ``Although our allies are in question here, this does not
affect us directly.''

   Thirty-five Colombian police officers began a
two-week course this week in court security taught by the U.S.
Marshals Service, an agency spokesman said Tuesday.
   The junior officers and senior non-commissioned officers of the
Colombian National Police are being trained at Camp Beauregard, La.,
as part of a $65 million U.S. aid package to Colombia combat drug
traffickers.
   The contingent that began the course Monday is the first of five
groups that will pass through the Army base near Alexandria, La.,
said Stephen Boyle, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.
   The officers are being trained in ``court security, dignitary
protection and street-survival techniques,'' Boyle said.
   Camp Beauregard is used by the Marshals Service to train agents
for anti-terrorist and special security details, Boyle said.
   The Colombian government has received $5 million from the Bush
administration to improve court security to protect judges a wave of
assassinations that has crippled that country's criminal justice
system.
   The Justice Department is reviewing the equipment needs of the
Colombian government and will be providing such items as armored
cars, bullet-proof vests and metal detectors under the grant.
   The department has identified 100 vehicles seized from drug
dealers that may be of use to the Colombian government, said
spokesman David Runkel.
   The U.S. marshals, the oldest federal law enforcement agency, are
responsible for protection of the federal courts and threatened
witnesses, the pursuit of fugitives from justice, transportation of
prisoners and the management of seized assets. They may be called on
to enforce court orders and to suppress riots and other civil
disturbances if federal authority is invoked.

   Ken Towery was re-elected chairman and Daniel
L. Brenner was elected vice chairman of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting on Tuesday, the corporation said.
   Towery, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and newspaper
publisher, first was elected chairman in February to fill the
vacancy created when former chairman Howard Gutin's term on the
board ended March 1.
   Towery was appointed to a five-year term on the board in November
1981 and was reappointed to a second five-year term in October 1986.
His terms expires in March 1991.
   A resident of Austin, Texas, Towery publishes three Texas
newspapers. In 1955 he won a Pulitzer for his series of stories
exposing fraud and corruption in the Texas Veterans Land Program,
the corporation said.
   Brenner is director of the communications law program and teaches
law at the University of California, Los Angeles. He also has served
as adviser to former Federal Communications Commission chairmen Mark
Fowler and Charles Ferris.
   Brenner was appointed to a five-year term on the board in October
1986. His term expires in March 1991. He currently is chairman of
the board's audit committee.
   The corporation is a private, non-profit organization chartered
by Congress in 1967 to support non-commercial U.S. radio and
television.

   California and Texas held special elections Tuesday to fill the
seats of two Democratic congressmen who resigned over alleged ethics
violations, while primary voters in New York and Detroit weighed
re-election bids by Mayors Edward Koch and Coleman Young.
   Democrats were hoping the popularity of former House Speaker Jim
Wright and former Majority Whip Tony Coelho would carry Democratic
candidates to victory in special elections to fill the two leaders'
seats in Texas and California. In Detroit, Young was expected to
coast into a general election runoff with one of two likely
challengers, but in New York, Koch faced the possibility of losing
the Democratic primary to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.
   Two other candidates _ Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and former
transit chief Richard Ravitch _ also were on the Democratic ballot
in New York.
   Koch, voting in Greenwich Village, said he and Dinkins were so
close that the primary would be decided by the Hispanic vote,
amounting to about 10 percent of the expected turnout.
   ``I'm surging,'' said Koch, who was seeking an unprecedented
fourth term. ``That's the best place to be the day before and the
day of the primary.''
   Dinkins, hoping to become New York's first black mayor, also
voted early and said he hoped to win ``with a broad base'' that
would make it easier to govern.
   The winner of the Democratic primary will face the winner of a
Republican match between former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani and
cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder. Giuliani has been well ahead in the
polls.
   Young was expected to lead a field of 13 candidates in his bid
for a record fifth term. The top two finishers will go head-to-head
in the runoff; Rep. John Conyers and accountant Tom Barrow were
considered the most likely prospects for the second spot on the
November ballot.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, voters in Wright's former district had a
choice of two political newcomers _ Democrat Pete Geren, an attorney
and former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, and Republican Bob Lanier, a
physician and television commentator.
   Wright campaigned for Geren, just as Coelho actively assisted the
campaign of Democratic Assemblyman Gary Condit, his would-be
successor in California's San Joaquin Valley. Seven other candidates
were on the ballot, including former Republican Assemblyman Clare
Berryhill. If no candidate won a majority of the vote, a runoff
would be held in November.
   Several cities besides New York and Detroit were holding mayoral
primaries.
   _ Buffalo, N.Y., Mayor James Griffin faced two challengers in the
Democratic primary, and was running unopposed on the Republican and
Conservative party ballots.
   _ In New Haven, Conn., where Mayor Biagio DeLieto is retiring,
state Sen. John Daniels ran against former city administrator John
DeStefano Jr. in the Democratic primary. Daniels hoped to become the
city's first black mayor.
   _ Minneapolis Mayor Don Fraser opposed six challengers in his bid
for re-election.
   _ In St. Paul. Minn., where Mayor George Latimer is retiring,
nine candidates were on the primary ballot. As in Minneapolis, the
top two vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 7 general election.

   The New York City race was the liveliest there since 1977, when
Koch won his first term in office after a free-for-all primary and a
general election race against then-Lt. Gov. Mario Cuomo, now the
governor.
   Koch, 64, was all but counted out as a formidable candidate a few
months ago, his popularity badly damaged by corruption scandals and
his propensity for angering entire blocs of voters _ blacks and
Irish-Americans most prominently _ with his frequently outrageous
remarks.
   Early polls gave big leads to Dinkins, 62, whose quiet, dignified
manner contrasted sharply with that of the bombastic mayor.
   But Koch steadily ate away at Dinkins' lead in the weeks before
the election and the race was considered a toss-up by the last
weekend of the campaign.
   On Monday, Dinkins and Koch ran into each other at a high school
dedication and agreed to a ``display of unity'' on Wednesday,
regardless of which candidate won the primary.
   No such display is expected in Detroit, where Young has undergone
vigorous attacks by challengers who ran what were dubbed ``ABC''
campaigns _ ``Anybody But Coleman.''
   They said the 71-year-old mayor has been in office too long and
accused him of paying too much attention to downtown business
interests at the expense of the city's poorer neighborhoods.
   The two House vacancies were the outgrowth of one of the biggest
political shakeups in congressional history _ the resignations of
Wright and Coelho in the wake of investigations into alleged ethics
violations.
   In Texas, Republicans saw the Geren-Lanier race as a rare chance
to break into a district that has long sent Democrats to Congress.
   But Lanier, 44, a pediatric allergist who is featured on the
television program ``60-Second Housecall,'' called his race an
``upstream swim'' against Geren, 37. Geren raised nearly twice as
much campaign money and had the advantage of Wright's endorsement.
   In the California race, Condit stressed his ties to Coelho, and
Berryhill conceded that there was little point in attacking the
former congressman, who remains extremely popular in his old
district.
   The major issues in the race were abortion, highway congestion
and agricultural problems.
   Berryhill opposed abortion except in cases involving rape, incest
and a threat to the life of the mother. Condit opposed abortion but
said it was a ``personal decision that one needs to make for one's
self.''

<HEAD>White House Reprimands Mosbacher on HDTV, Source Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher won't
concentrate on promoting a high-definition television industry in
the United States after being reprimanded by the White House, a
congressional source said.
   ``Mosbacher in their eyes is a renegade promoting industial
policy and they thought it was absolutely necessary to reprimand
him,'' said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mosbacher ``was made to stand in front of the class and made to
say `I believe in the free market 500 times,''' the source said.
   As a result, the Commerce Department will consider HDTV, the next
generation of television, only as part of a broad-based effort to
boost U.S. technological competitiveness, an administration source
said Monday.
   Mosbacher said for months that he was prepared to recommend that
the Bush administration loosen tax and antitrust laws to jump-start
private American industry efforts to compete with Europe and Japan
to build HDTV, which promises motion-picture clarity and compact
disc-quality sound.
   Commerce officials first promised Congress they would unveil the
government plans for HDTV by midsummer and, later, by the end of the
year.
   Now, the administration official said, the HDTV initiative is on
hold.
   ``There isn't necessarily going to be a single HDTV report as was
once envisioned,'' the official said, adding that the issue would be
viewed in a broader context.
   ``We're going to study it further and probably weave it into a
more extensive high-tech competiveness package. There's no
date-certain of when that will be ready,'' said the official, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's something that we're working toward. But it's just a
bigger animal than we thought.''
   The congressional source said the White House had reined in
Mosbacher for talking in terms reminiscent of the ``industrial
policy'' program that Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis advocated in the 1988 campaign.
   The Wall Street Journal last month quoted sources who said
Mosbacher's HDTV initiative was soundly criticized by other
government agencies and was near death.
   Advocates of HDTV say it could revitalize a moribund U.S.
electronics industry and have important applications in medicine,
defense and other industries.
   It is envisioned as a $20 billion industry by 2000 and would be a
``technology driver'' for industries such as computer chips.
   The American Electronics Association has asked Congress for more
than a billion dollars in development money for HDTV, and several
bills are pending in Congress that would provide taxpayer money to
spur the industry.
   The Defense Department has allotted $30 million in seed money for
the U.S. HDTV industry.
   But a Congressional Budget Office report last month said HDTV
claims were ``very optimistic'' and that even under the rosiest of
scenarios, HDTV sales will be small relative to other electronic
equipment markets.
   The congressional official said nervous electronics industry
officials are beginning to back away from HDTV.
   Richard Wiley, chairman of a broadcast industry panel that will
advise the Federal Communications Commission on setting a
transmission standard for HDTV by 1992, said last week there are
only eight applicants _ down from 14 _ who will be ready to begin
testing next year.
   He said testing will begin in January in Alexandria, Va., by the
Advanced Television Test Center and Cable Labs.

<TEXT>
   Talks between the government and
leftist rebels open Wednesday, but there appears to be little chance
the two sides will come together to end a decade of civil war.
   The talks in Mexico will pit representatives of a battle-tempered
guerrilla army against members of a right-wing government that
considers them little more than murderous brigands.
   ``The two ways of looking at these talks are very different,''
said Guillermo Ungo, leader of a leftist political coalition allied
with the rebels.
   ``The government views them as dialogue-concertation,
demobilization of the guerrillas and administration of democratizing
aspirins. The guerrillas see them as dialogue-negotiation, true
democratization, then demobilization.
   ``And democratization here is not a matter of aspirins. It
requires major surgery.''
   The rebel delegation includes two of the five members of the high
command of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
One of the two is Joaquin Villalobos, considered the most senior
member of the organization.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's delegation includes two
Cabinet-level officials, one of whom is a retired army colonel and
the president's chief of staff. It also includes lawyers and
academics representative of the right-wing private sector.
   The rebels said Monday their suspension of sabotage _ one of
their most effective weapons _ and declaration of an 11-day
unilateral cease-fire are clear indications of determination to
reach accords.
   But they expressed doubts about the government's good faith.
   ``We note with concern that Mr. Cristiani and his government are
placing obstacles in the way of the upcoming meeting by opposing the
logical and necessary presence of international witnesses, a
moderator and national and international observers, and in so doing,
are trying to establish a closed dialogue,'' said their communique.
   Cristiani considers this week's sessions preparatory. He says
they will deal with the mechanism for proceeding with talks rather
than substantive issues. The question of whether a moderator will
take part remains to be resolved, he says.
   The rebels have insisted that Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the
archbishop of San Salvador, participate as moderator. The
archibishop is on a tour of Europe and the United States and will
not take part in Wednesday's meeting.
   Auxiliary archbishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez is to attend the
sessions as a ``witness.''
   The rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982, El
Salvador exhibits only a democratic veneer. They say individual
liberties are systematically violated and that public avowal of
socialism still entails the risk of one's life.
   The insurgents also contend that civilian authority remains
subordinate to the veto and tutelage of the virulently anti-leftist
armed forces.
   Cristiani, in a press conference last week dealing with the
upcoming dialogue, said, ``Here there is no state of war. The FMLN
simply operates outside the law.''
   The rebels, on their clandestine radio, ridiculed the president's
perception of the state of the situation.
   ``Only President Cristiani in his marble tower thinks there is no
war in our country. If there's no war, then what are we going to
Mexico to talk about?'' they said.

<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan received a
surprise hospital visit Tuesday from his daughter, Maureen, as he
continued recovering from surgery to drain fluid from the surface of
his brain.
   Maureen Reagan had lunch with her father and his wife, Nancy, and
was arranging a special dinner for Reagan Tuesday night in Reagan's
hospital room, said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   Weinberg said he knew of no other relatives who planned to visit
Reagan in Rochester.
   Reagan, 78, underwent the skull surgery Friday at St. Marys
Hospital and his recovery is progressing as expected, Weinberg said.
   ``We're still hopeful, if the present rate of progress continues,
he will be able to return to California by the end of the week,''
Weinberg said. ``There are no plans at this point for any additional
surgery.''
   Reagan followed his normal morning routine Tuesday, reading
several newspapers and newsmagazines and watching television news
programs, Weinberg said. Reagan also been going through the many
cards, letters and telegrams that well-wishers have sent, including
messages from entertainer Bob Hope, actress Claudette Colbert and
actor Jimmy Stewart, Weinberg said.
   Weinberg also said Reagan would be canceling a 10-day trip
scheduled later this month to New York, Ohio, Virginia, New Jersey,
Massachusetts and Arizona.
   Surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a buildup of
blood caused by a July 4 fall from a bucking horse.
   The fluid was detected during a routine examination last week by
Mayo Clinic doctors. Reagan's neurosurgeon said an earlier brain
clot had been detected but it had healed on its own.

<HEAD>USDA Says Corn Crop Looking Good Compared to Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are harvesting a corn crop estimated at
7.32 billion bushels, up 49 percent from last year's drought-plagued
harvest of 4.92 billion bushels, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   But the latest estimate, based on Sept. 1 field surveys, was down
fractionally from the 7.35 billion bushels indicated a month ago.
   The report by department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said the corn crop was in ``mostly good to fair'' condition
last month.
   ``At the end of August, crop development was lagging behind
normal in most of the 17 major producing states,'' the report said.
``Harvest of corn for grain is well under way in the southern
states, but progress is slightly behind normal.''
   Corn yields were estimated at 112.4 bushels per acre harvested,
up from 84.6 bushels in 1988 but well below the record of 119.4
bushels per acre in 1987. Yields were forecast in August at 112.8
bushels per acre.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop. It is an essential ingredient for the production of meat,
poultry and dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in
1988, are expected to go up 5 percent to 7 percent this year,
according to USDA economists.
   Soybean production was estimated at 1.89 billion bushels, up 23
percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels. But that
was down 1 percent from 1.91 billion bushels indicated last month.
   Yields were estimated at an average of 32 bushels per acre this
year, compared with 26.8 bushels in 1988 and the August forecast of
32.3 bushels. The record was 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985.
   The revised estimates, based on field surveys Sept. 1, showed
total wheat production at 2.06 billion bushels, up 14 percent from
last year and 1 percent more than the 2.04 billion bushels forecast
in August.
   Wheat yields were estimated to average 32.9 bushels per harvested
acre, compared with 34.1 bushels in 1988 and the August forecast of
32.6 bushels. The record was 39.4 bushels in 1983.
   There was no new estimate for winter wheat production, which
accounts for about three-fourths of the total. Previously, USDA put
the 1989 harvest at about 1.47 billion bushels, down 6 percent from
last year.
   Production of durum wheat, which is planted in the spring, was
indicated at 93.6 million bushels, up 109 percent from last year's
drought-ravaged harvest and up 3 percent from the August estimate.
   Other spring wheat was shown at 505 million bushels, up 146
percent from the 1988 harvest and 4 percent more than estimated in
August.
   Cotton production was estimated at 12.3 million bales, down 20
percent from 1988 but up from the August forecast of 11.8 million
bales.
   In a related report on the world's supply and demand situation
for major commodities, analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90
marketing year that began on Sept. 1 is still expected to be around
7.5 billion bushels, including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean
another drawdown of U.S. stockpiles to about 1.68 billion bushels
left over by next Sept. 1, down from current inventories estimated
at 1.86 billion bushels.
   The report said corn prices may average in the range of $1.85 to
$2.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $2.55 last
season. That was only a slight change from the August forecast.
   Other 1989 crop estimates based on Sept. 1 indications, compared
with 1988 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 658.9 million bushels and an average yield of 62.6
bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988.
   _Barley, 401.1 million bushels and a yield of 46.9 bushels per
acre, compared with 290.5 million and 38.6.
   _Rice, 152.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,548 pounds
per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511.
   _Peanuts, 4.44 billion pounds and a yield of 2,688 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445.
   _Tobacco, 1.49 billion pounds and a yield of 2,130 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160.
   _Sugarbeets, 26.5 million tons and a yield of 20 tons per acre,
compared with 24.8 million and 19.1.
   _Sugarcane, 30.8 million tons and a yield of 35.7 tons per acre,
compared with 29.9 million and 35.4.

<TEXT>
   The tiny deer tick, blamed for spreading
Lyme disease, also carries another disease that has sickened at
least five people in southeastern Connecticut in the past year,
state health officials say.
   The disease, babesiosis, is relatively rare and is caused by the
infection of red blood cells with a parasitic protozoan, a
microscopic animal called Babesia microti, said Matthew J. Cartter,
state epidemiologist in the state Department of Health Services.
   Symptoms develop in about one to four weeks after exposure and
include fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, headache, sweating, muscle
and joint pain, and nausea, he said.
   Health officials issued a warning Monday as part of their effort
to get doctors to report all cases of babesiosis.
   There have been fewer than 200 confirmed cases of the disease in
the United States in the past 10 years, said Eric Mintz, an
epidemiologist for the federal Centers for Disease Control's
Connecticut station.
   Most cases have been reported from Nantucket Island and Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, Shelter Island and Fire Island in New
York, Block Island in Rhode Island and Wisconsin.
   Until 1988, only one case had been reported in a Connecticut
resident who did not acquire the disease in one of those areas.
   Although babesiosis is less of a risk to public health than Lyme
disease, it is life-threatening in people whose spleens do not
function or those with other conditions that result in a suppressed
immune system, health officials said. The infection is more severe
in elderly people and in infants, they said.
   Mintz said that unlike Lyme disease, babesiosis will not cause
long-term or recurring health problems to those in good health.
   Lyme disease causes a rash or aches and pains and a low-grade
fever, followed by arthritis-like pain in the joints or nerve damage
causing pain or numbness.

<HEAD>US Reinforces Economic Sanctions Against Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Tuesday reinforced its
ban on sugar imports from Panama and expanded the list of Panamanian
companies and individuals Americans are not permitted to pay.
   The actions reflected U.S. displeasure over recent political
developments in Panama, including the swearing in two weeks ago of a
long-time associate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as the country's
unelected president.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the moves
were a direct result of Noriega's unwillingness ``to respect the
will of the Panamanian people by stepping down and permitting the
installation of a freely elected government.''
   As part of the economic sanctions the United States has imposed
against Panama, the country's sugar quota was suspended, costing it
$15 million in revenues, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   In addition to reallocating Panama's 30,537 metric ton quota to
other sugar exporting nations, the administration also is denying
Panama participation in a general quota increase approved by U.S.
Special Trade Representative, she said.
   Panama's share of the increase would have been 23,403 tons, she
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler had no additional information on the expanded list
of Panamanian companies and individuals to which the Americans can't
make payments.
   The administration has refrained from imposing sanctions on China
on grounds that such action would hurt the Chinese people. Asked why
the administration doesn't apply the same rationale to Panama, Ms.
Tutwiler said Noriega is hurting the Panamanian people more than the
sanctions by refusing to step down.
   Other officials, asking not to be identified, said the
administration is reluctant to take stronger measures against Panama
because they could inflict further damage to the country's already
weak economy without necessarily ensuring Noriega's departure.
   Noriega has been indicted by two Florida grand juries on drug
smuggling charges.
   Most of the sanctions against Panama were imposed 18 months ago
after Noriega forced out a president who had demanded he step down
as commander of the country's military forces.
   The U.S. also has frozen Panamanian assets in the United States
worth about $300 million.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said in his annual report on the state of the world Tuesday that
there is a new international atmosphere of cooperation but that
grave problems remain in the Middle East.
   Perez de Cuellar also recommended that foreign ministers of the
15-member Security Council meet periodically to consider
international peace and security in different regions to avert
conflicts and defuse explosive situations. The idea is not new but
the secretary-general placed special emphasis on prevention of armed
conflicts, as well as peacekeeping operations to control them.
   The U.N. chief, in a 28-page survey of international problems and
progress, said the past year ``has brought little relief'' from
frequent, sometimes massive violations of human rights worldwide.
   But the world, he said, is witnessing ``the end of the era of
sterile confrontations'' between East and West. In the past year, he
said, the assistance of the United Nations was sought as never
before.
   A major U.N. accomplishment was implementation of an independence
plan for Namibia, formerly Southwest Africa, from South Africa, he
said.
   Despite U.N. successes in other areas, the situation in the
Middle East remains a source of grave concern, Perez de Cuellar said.
   Hopes for early progress because of the Palestinian National
Council's conciliatory statements toward Israel ``have sadly given
way to mistrust and doubt among the parties concerned,'' he said.
Efforts to pave the way to negotiations have proved ``frustratingly
inconclusive.''
   He said the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories has
worsened steadily since the Palestinian uprising began nearly two
years ago, and that Lebanon's government and society also are
disintegrating because of escalating violence between Christians and
Moslems there.
   Concerning the divided island of Cyprus, the secretary-general
said, ``We have now reached the critical juncture where an overall
settlement that will safeguard the legitimate interests and meet the
concerns of both communities seems possible.''
   He has been meeting with leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities.
   Perez de Cuellar said one place where U.N. involvement had not
solved a problem was in Afghanistan, where Moslem rebels are
fighting a Soviet-backed government.
   Efforts to end the fighting have failed and U.N. humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan has been ``severely impeded'' because of a
massive infusion of military aid from the United States, Pakistan
and the Soviet Union to the warring parties, he said.
   In addition, despite a year-old U.N.-supervised cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war, both sides remain far apart and a U.N. peace plan has
not been implemented, the secretary-general reported.
   Although the United Nations is at the forefront of international
efforts in peacekeeping and other areas, the secretary-general said
the organization is short of funds and greater demands are being
made for more U.N. operations.
   ``The present financial position is not reassuring,'' he said.
   As of Aug. 31, outstanding contributions to the regular budget
exceeded $688 million, including $347 million for the current year,
the U.N. chief reported. For peacekeeping operations, the arrears
were $661 million.

<TEXT>
   The only passenger to survive last week's
crash of a chartered Cuban airliner in a Havana suburb has died of
injuries, the Prensa Latina news agency said Tuesday.
   Luigi Capalbo, 22, of Parma, Italy, died Monday at Hermanos
Ameijeiras Hospital in Havana, the Cuban government agency said in a
dispatch monitored in Mexico. The victim had suffered burns over 65
percent of his body.
   The other 114 passengers and 11 crew members were killed when the
Cubana de Aviacion plane crashed into Boyeros, a residential area a
half-mile from the Havana airport on Sept. 3. The agency earlier
said 45 people were killed on the ground, but Tuesday's dispatch
gave the number as 24.
   Reports on the number of injured varied. Prensa Latina said
Tuesday some remained in serious condition, but gave no figures.
   The plane was carrying Italian tourists on a flight to Milan when
it crashed shortly after taking off in a thunderstorm.
   A preliminary report on the investigation said the pilot took off
against advice from the control tower.
   Capalbo had traveled to Cuba with three friends from his minor
league baseball team to watch Cuban teams play. Reports from Rome
said he worked for a private detective agency. Prensa Latina said he
was a first-year law student at the University of Parma.

   President Bush said Tuesday that he will
nominate William J. Tattersall as assistant secretary of labor for
mine safety and health.
   Tattersall has been deputy secretary general of the International
Iron and Steel Institute in Brussels, Belgium, since 1979. If
confirmed by the Senate, he will succeed David O'Neal.
   Bush also said he will nominate Mary Sterling, a Kansas City,
Mo., lawyer, as assistant secretary of labor management standards.
   Ms. Sterling, 33, was executive director of Bush's presidential
campaign in Missouri last year.
   She will succeed Salvatore R. Martoche if confirmed by the Senate.

   Communist East Germany on Tuesday issued a sharp
formal protest to Warsaw Pact ally Hungary for permitting thousands
of East Germans to go to the West and demanded the flood be stopped.
   The state ADN news agency also said Soviet Politburo hard-liner
Yegor Ligachev and East German government officials had issued a
joint statement harshly criticizing West Germany.
   The developments came amid indications East Berlin had begun
clamping down on trips to Hungary.
   ``The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) expects the
immediate rescinding'' of Hungary's decision to ``unilaterally
suspend'' parts of bilateral agreements on border controls, said a
lengthy report by ADN.
   ``The Hungarian side is responsible for the current situation,''
said the report.
   According to ADN, the protest note was handed over to the
Hungarian Foreign Ministry in Budapest.
   More than 10,000 East Germans who were vacationing in Hungary
have fled to the West since early Monday.
   East German newspapers devoted large amounts of space to the
exodus and portrayed it as an unjustified act caused by West Germany
with the assistance of Hungary.
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's official newspaper, ran
a report from a refugee camp at Passau, West Germany. It called the
exodus a ``provocation organized at high levels,'' and an ``illegal
action to lure away East German citizens in Hungary.''
   The Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt called the exodus
an ``anti-socialist action ... by Bonn.''
   Sources told The Associated Press that police offices responsible
for processing applications for tourist visas are filled nearly
every day with East Germans eager to go to Hungary, ostensibly for
vacation. But many more are seeing those requests turned down, they
said.
   No official figures are available on the number of East Germans
waiting for a judgment on their visa applications.
   Some unofficial estimates put the number of East Germans who
desire to emigrate to the West at 1 million.
   News of the exodus of East Germans to the West provoked bitter
cynicism among some who remained in their Communist homeland.
   ``The officials are soon going to introduce a new holiday just
for us who stayed _ The Day of Those Left Behind,'' said an East
Berlin construction worker, who would not give his name.
   The East Germans arriving in the West say they left their
homeland because of repression and frustration over the government's
refusal to adopt political reforms.
   A new opposition political group has been founded in East Germany
to try to pressure the Communist government to make democratic
reforms.
   According to Lutheran Church sources, the ``New Forum'' was
founded by 100 East Germans, including former Communist Party
members, scientists, workers and students from across the country.
   In an announcement of its founding, the group said it is tired of
a country ``filled with henchmen, informers and do-nothing
loudmouths.''
   Some Communist Party functionaries have complained they feel like
their country is like ``a ship without a captain'' with East German
leader Erich Honecker slowly recovering from gall bladder surgery.
   Western news reports have said Honecker may be dying, but
government sources deny that.

   Federal agents who hauled in 2,700 pounds of
cocaine, 17 defendants and five boats described the bust Tuesday as
a ``textbook case'' of how U.S. agencies can choke off the cocaine
pipeline from Colombia.
   The seizure of the freighter Nerma, allegedly used as a smuggling
``mother ship,'' as well as three speedboats and a trawler used to
haul the cocaine to land was described by agents as the largest
since President Bush announced his battle plan against drug
trafficking.
   Videotape provided by the Coast Guard showed a chase in which the
speedboats tried to evade a persistent, but slower Coast Guard
craft, which fired 43 warning shots near the speedboats. A fourth
speedboat escaped.
   The drug organization supervising the cocaine smuggling was based
in Miami and had been under investigation for several months, said
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Tom Cash. More arrests were
expected.
   Federal agents moved in early Sunday while cocaine was being
unloaded from the Nerma in Bahamian water, the document said.
   The cocaine was believed to have originated in Medellin,
Colombia, home of the enormous Medellin cartel of cocaine
traffickers, and was loaded onto the freighter on the island of
Aruba, off the northern coast of Venezuela.
   The cocaine had left Colombia before the Aug. 18 assassination of
Colombian presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan set off a new
crackdown in Colombia and was already ``in the pipeline'' to the
United States, the DEA estimated.
   Cash said the bust ``is indicative of the magnitude of the
pipeline.''
   ``This is a textbook case of what taxpayers get for their money''
in drug enforcement,'' he said.
   The DEA, Coast Guard, Customs and local police were involved,
officials said.
   A Coast Guard cutter had been sent to intercept the Nerma,
registered in the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, after the
ship was detected on radar Saturday, officials said.
   Coast Guardsmen boarded the Nerma early the next day after seeing
bales of cocaine, each weighing about 70 pounds, floating alongside,
court documents said. Each bale consisted of plastic packages
bundled around flotation devices.
   Seven Danish crew members aboard the freighter were arrested and
ordered held without bond Monday.
   Six more men were arrested aboard the three speedboats. And four
were arrested late Monday in Miami in the vicinity of the trawler,
which apparently picked up a load from the Nerma before the Coast
Guard reached the freighter and had sailed into the Miami River.
   The defendants face federal charges of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute.
   Authorities seized 1,100 pounds of cocaine bobbing near the
freighter Nerma. An additional 70 pounds was seized inside the
freighter and 1,540 pounds was seized aboard the trawler, the J.J.
Lorick, DEA spokesman John Fernandes said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Second Baby for Royal Duchess, 6th Grandchild of Monarch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting her second child in the spring and said
Tuesday she was ``absolutely ecstatic.''
   The new baby will be the sixth grandchild for the queen.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be 30 on Oct. 15, was speaking
at a literary luncheon hours after the formal announcement by
Buckingham Palace. Her husband, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a Royal
Navy lieutenant, was on duty at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted ... We are absolutely ecstatic,'' the duchess
told the 300 guests at the lunch in a London hotel. It was held to
honor her as the author of two children's books.
   The news was announced at the lunch by the host, television
personality David Frost.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, whose first baby was born 13 months ago.
   Prince Andrew, 29, is the second son of the queen and her
husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
   If the baby is a boy he will supersede his sister to become fifth
in line to the throne after Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince
Andrew. If the baby is a girl she will follow her sister Beatrice as
sixth in line.
   In the British order of succession, the sons of the sovereign and
their descendants have preference over the daughters.
   The announcement from Buckingham Palace said: ``The Duke and
Duchess of York are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of
York is expecting a baby in March.''
   The duchess, still known to the London tabloids as ``Fergie,''
said she had not yet thought of any names but was pleased there
would not be a very great age gap between her two children.
   The duchess, who is a licensed helicopter pilot, was a
publisher's assistant before her marriage and her two books are
about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``I now have not only two books but the prospect of two children
as well,'' she said.

<HEAD>Abortion Pivotal Issue in New Jersey and Virginia Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion will prove an important and perhaps
decisive issue in the two governor's elections this fall in Virginia
and New Jersey, Democratic consultants and analysts said Tuesday.
   But the analysts, in a discussion of abortion politics sponsored
by a liberal think tank, differed on whether Democratic candidates
are smart to promote positions in favor of abortion rights in other
races around the country.
   Democratic candidates for governor in both states holding
gubernatorial elections this year have staked out positions
generally in favor of abortion rights.
   A consultant to the Virginia Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. L.
Douglas Wilder, suggested Wilder plans to use the issue in
television advertising in his race. He faces Republican nominee J.
Marshall Coleman, who has softened his opposition to abortion but
remains perceived as the anti-abortion candidate, the analysts said.
   Frank Greer, a Washington-based media consultant to the Wilder
campaign, said: ``Until this year, we always said this is an issue
you don't want to ... pay to put on TV.''
   ``This year, people are going to be paying ... and I think that
will make it a cutting issue,'' Greer said. ``Everyone will face the
question of deciding it's an important issue in how you vote, and it
will be a determining issue, I think, in the Virginia race, in terms
of how people vote.''
   Greer commented at a luncheon sponsored by the Center for
National Policy.
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, described both Virginia and
New Jersey as ``pro-choice states.'' She said that there and
elsewhere, the Supreme Court's recent decision permitting states
more leeway in regulating abortion has presented a political
opportunity for Democratic candidates supporting abortion rights.
   In New Jersey, Rep. James Florio, a Democrat, faces Republican
Rep. James Courter.
   Lake said polls show that about 20 percent of voters are
influenced by the abortion issue, and that Democrats can be aided by
a feeling among many moderate voters ``that we shouldn't go back''
to a time when abortions were illegal.
   But Charles Cook, editor of The Cook Political Report newsletter
and a political analyst, said much of the polling showing voters in
favor of abortion are meaningless because voters will decide their
votes on other issues.
   He said it was ``very, very dangerous'' for the Democratic Party
to allow itself to become identified as the pro-abortion party, and
that candidates who push pro-abortion positions risk alienating
older Democratic voters, less educated voters and, in many states,
black voters.
   ``Where the American people are now is, they're mildly
pro-choice,'' Cook said.
   ``Any candidate that decides to go full out on abortion, one way
or the other, runs a very real risk of damaging their party base,''
Cook said. ``You risk offending your whole partisan base. ... I'd be
very leery before I crawled out on that limb.''

<HEAD>CBS' `Paradise' Jumps from Bottom to Top of Ratings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The CBS Western series ``Paradise'' stampeded
into the Top 10 of the Nielsen ratings with a special two-hour
Sunday premiere rounding up a number of Western stars from the past.
   The show, which stars Lee Horsley, leaped to ninth place for the
week ended Sept. 10 from a tie for 66th place the week before.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was first and ``The Cosby Show'' was second as
ABC's ``Roseanne'' dropped from first the previous week to third.
NBC won the week for the 64th consecutive week.
   ``Paradise'' was lifted out of its usual place at the bottom of
the ratings by a special season opener featuring Hugh O'Brian
reprising his role as Wyatt Earp and Gene Barry in his former role
as Bat Masterson. Other Western actors also appeared. The show's
regular appearance Saturday will also feature several former Western
actors.
   CBS' ``Rescue: 911,'' the only other premiere of the week, was in
a three-way tie for 20th place. William Shatner is host of the show,
which features real-life emergency rescue situations.
   The week also saw Fox Broadcasting's Sunday-night ``Married ...
With Children'' return to the Top 20. It was in 17th place for the
second time this summer, the highest a Fox show has ever finished.
   Fox's ``Totally Hidden Video'' was tied for 33rd, ``America's
Most Wanted'' was tied for 42nd place and ``Open House'' was tied
for 51st place. The Fox shows had taken a slight dip the week before
after their summer surge.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC's ``Dear John,''
NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' ABC's ``The
Wonder Years,'' CBS' ``Paradise'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
   The finish of ``Paradise'' and ``60 Minutes'' marked the first
time since July that CBS had a show in the Top 10. CBS's prime-time
programming Sunday was delayed because of the runover of its
coverage of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
11.3. ABC was second with 9.9 and CBS was third with 9.1.
   ABC had the highest rated evening news show with 8.7. CBS was
second with 8.6 and NBC was third with 8.2.
   The lowest rated network show was NBC's ``Saturday Morning
Preview.'' Here are the five bottom shows: NBC's ``Saved By the
Bell'' preview, CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS' ``3 Star Comedy
Edition,'' CBS' ``Woodstock Special'' and NBC's ``Saturday Morning
Preview.''

   There's nothing like being on a first-name
basis with George Bush _ even if the president doesn't always get
the first name right.
   Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Hillman, whose wife, Elsie, is on
the Republican national committee, received videotaped
congratulations from President Bush on Monday night as he was named
the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce's 1989 Business Leader of the
Year in Hershey.
   ``Henry, you've made a difference all your life. You're a model.
I'm proud to call you friend,'' Bush said.
   But Hillman admitted the president called him something else when
he recently sent a picture of himself and Barbara Bush.
   ``It was signed from George and Barbara Bush, with our best
regards, to Elsie and Harvey Hillman,'' he said. ``It was one of
those wonderful things in life.''

<HEAD>US To Propose Funds For 40,000 Soviet Refugees Next Year</HEAD>

   The Bush administration plans to propose to
Congress that the United States next year accept 50,000 Soviet
refugees plus 6,500 more from Eastern Europe, a U.S. official and
sources in the American Jewish community said Tuesday.
   Worldwide, 125,000 refugees would be admitted, an increase of
slightly less than 8 percent from this year.
   The 50,000 Soviet refugees, at least half of whom are expected to
be Jews, are a fraction of the 250,000 Soviet citizens the State
Department estimated last week would apply for entry to the United
States in 1990.
   Of the 50,000, the sources said, 40,000 would have their
transportation and settlement costs paid by the United States. The
10,000 others would have to depend on private organizations, friends
and relatives.
   This year's combined quota for refugees from the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe is 50,000. The new plan would allocate 50,000 slots
to the Soviet Union and set up a separate category of 6,500 for
Eastern Europe.
   Last year, as emigration from the Soviet Union began to climb,
the combined quota for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was
15,000.
   Jewel S. Lafontant, the State Department's refugee affairs
coordinator, is scheduled to testify to a House Judiciary
subcommittee Wednesday about the administration proposal.
   An estimated 40,000 Soviet Jews are expected to leave the Soviet
Union this year. Currently there is a backlog of an estimated 30,000
to 40,000 Jews with exit permits for Israel who have not left the
Soviet Union or are in Vienna and Rome, seeking entry to the United
States.
   Most Soviet Jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in
Israel. All but a fraction, however, then apply for admission to the
United States once they have left their country.
   According to the Jewish sources, who demanded anonymity, the Bush
administration will also drastically revise its processing
procedures. Tentatively, refugees who apply before Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 1990 fiscal year, will be processed in Rome and
Vienna.
   Thereafter, applications will be handled by a beefed-up U.S.
Embassy staff in Moscow and by a new office to be set up outside
Washington.
   The U.S. official, who also asked not to be named, said that the
Oct. 1 cutoff date was very likely but that it might be set back a
few months.
   While the Soviets seeking admission remain in their country,
their applications would be considered both in Moscow and in the
Washington area office.
   Israel has expressed concern that Jewish refugees from the Soviet
Union were increasingly choosing to head for the United States once
out of their homeland, depriving the Jewish state of needed settlers.
   It was not clear whether the change in U.S. procedure would
increase the flow of refugees to Israel.
   The rising exodus from the Soviet Union, which results from U.S.
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, poses administrative and financial problems for the Bush
administration.
   Eager to reinforce the right of Soviet citizens to travel freely,
U.S. officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open.
But beyond the 50,000 slots allotted for the Soviet Union,
prospective Jewish emigres will be encouraged to apply for parole
status. This requires private support for the immigrants.
   Also, the sources said, in admitting 50,000 refugees from the
Soviet Union preference will be given to those with close relatives
here. But no applicant will be declared ineligble on the grounds he
has no relative here, the officials said.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who heads the House subcommittee on
immigration, said as hearings opened that the administration's
proposal provides financing for 84,000 of the 125,000 refugees
overall.
   ``Where do we get the money for the rest?'' he asked a panel of
private witnesses.
   Morrison also expressed concern about the backlog of emigres in
Rome and Vienna awaiting U.S. decisions on their eligibility to
enter the United States. He said the administration had wasted money
through this processing method and changes would have to be
considered.

<HEAD>Bill Creates Penalties for Unsafely Storing Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill
that would allow judges to send adults to prison when children
injure or kill someone with a firearm that was not safely stored.
   ``We require childproof caps on aspirin bottles, yet we allow
loaded guns to be left in the kids' playroom,'' said Rep. David
Clarenbach. ``This bill is a small step toward sanity and a giant
leap for safety.''
   The measure would set maximum penalties of two years in prison
and $10,000 fines for adults who leave loaded guns or weapons
accessible to children under 16, resulting in an injury or death.
   The bill, endorsed by the Wisconsin arm of the National Rifle
Association and Handgun Control Inc., was touted as an effort to
reduce childhood injuries through education.
   ``This is not a gun control bill, it's a gun safety bill,''
Clarenbach said.
   He and Sen. John Plewa said the measure was in response to a
number of accidental shootings involving children this summer in
Madison and Milwaukee.
   Ir would require the Department of Natural Resources to expand
its hunter safety program to promote gun safety, public awareness
and safe use and storage of weapons. The bill also would require gun
retailers to post information about the penalties for failing to
secure loaded firearms.

   Crews finished burying an enormous pile of
burning tires under a layer of soil Tuesday after two days of work,
but the now-underground fire was expected to smolder for some time.
   State Fire Marshal William Toland said the cause of the fire
appeared suspicious.
   About 35 people living within a half-mile of the dump who were
evacuated from their homes and took shelter Sunday night at a church
were home Tuesday. Several roads in the area were reopened.
   Meanwhile, the fire means the state and a New York firm may have
to renegotiate a $1.1 million contract to get rid of the tires, a
state official said.
   The abandoned dump caught fire Sunday, the second time since
1984, sending flames 40 feet into the air and releasing billowing
smoke that could be seen 25 miles away for the next two days.
   David Tordoff of the federal Environmental Protection Agency said
EPA scientists monitored the air, soil and ground water for harmful
chemicals stemming from the fire that is expected to smolder for
some time. The 1984 fire at the dump hung on for several weeks.
   Tordoff estimated that about 2{ acres of tires stacked 30 to 40
feet high was on fire. The dump holds an estimated 1.5 millions
covering about seven acres. He said his agency earmarked up to $1
million from the hazardous waste Superfund for the effort.
   About 250 firefighters from 45 communities in three states worked
to contain the fire, using 65 trucks and 10 loaders to haul tons of
dirt onto the fire, which burned so hotly that even 2,500 gallons of
water a minute just vaporized.
   In July, the state contracted with Integrated Waste Systems Inc.
of Buffalo, N.Y., to shred the tires at the dump for shipment to
Greece to fuel a cement plant. The removal was to begin shortly.
   William Evans, of the Department of Environmental Services' Waste
Management Division, said the fire's effects would need to be
assessed and the contract possibly renegotiated.
   Charles Laubisch, a vice president of the company, walked the
site Monday with Evans. Laubisch, while not commenting on possible
renegotiations, said equipment for the cleanup is already in town.

<TEXT>
   A man who dreamed for years of a reunion with
his father died in a fire at his father's home one day after moving
in.
   Perry Eade, 28, of Rockford, hadn't seen his father, Jerry Ragan
of Dixon, since he was a child.
   During seven years in the Navy, he tried several times to contact
his father without success. In a chance meeting with Eade's cousin
earlier this year, Ragan learned his son was looking for him.
   Ragan called and invited Eade to a birthday celebration Aug. 19.
   ``We had this longing feeling that he needed me, and I needed to
see him,'' Ragan said. ``I gave him a big hug and a kiss. It was
really great.''
   Eade moved into his father's home Thursday, and the two went out
to celebrate.
   Hours later, Eade died, authorities said. The fire broke out at
3:20 a.m. Friday, said Fire Lt. Neil Freil.
   Ragan said he was awakened by smoke and ran to his son's bedroom
to try to to save him. He suffered numerous burns and cuts and was
taken to Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital in Dixon, where he was in
stable condition.
   A week before the fire, Ragan said his son had complained about
chest pains. Eade went Thursday for a checkup but never learned the
results.
   Relatives speculated that Eade may have had a heart attack while
smoking, and dropped the cigarette that started the blaze.
   A complete autopsy report will not be available for three or four
weeks.
   Eade dreamed and talked of meeting his father for years, said
family friend Goldie Stiff.
   Eade's parents had been childhood sweethearts, but his mother's
family refused to let them marry, said Ragan, 46.
   ``We sort of drifted apart, but she never denied me seeing him,''
Ragan said of his son.
   Ragan said he believes Eade didn't try to find him when he was
younger because the boy didn't want to cause problems for his
mother's husband, who helped raise him in Rockford.

   Attackers believed to be Basque separatists
on Tuesday fatally shot a prosecutor and killed a store owner with a
parcel bomb in the northern city of Bilbao, police said.
   The shooting took place at about 3:30 p.m. when two gunmen in a
car fired automatic weapons at Carmen Tagle Gonzalez, 44, killing
her instantly, police said. She had been driving home at the time,
police said. She was one of the chief prosecutors of the National
Court, which has jurisdiction over terrorism cases.
   Five hours later in Bilbao, a provincial capital 200 miles north
of Madrid, fish store owner Luis Reina Mesonera died when he opened
a parcel bomb, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
police said they suspected the Basque separatist group ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   Since beginning its 21-year-old campaign for independence, ETA
has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 people,
mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.

   Darla Schardein was born during a

impatient newborn chose the cargo bay of a helicopter as her
delivery room.
   Dawn Schardein, 28, gave birth to 5-pound, 9{-ounce Darla early
Monday after sudden labor during a visit with friends in Sun City, a
remote Riverside County city served by a hospital lacking a
maternity ward.
   Her husband, Mike, 29, rushed her to Menifee Valley Medical
Center in Sun City, about 70 miles southeast of downtown Los
Angeles, where quick thinking by emergency room workers resulted in
the calling of an air ambulance to take Mrs. Schardein to San
Bernardino, about 30 miles away.
   The baby was delivered just as the helicopter set down near Saint
Bernardine Medical Center, said flight nurse Russel West.
   ``Just as we went down, we were actually landing, she was born,''
West said. ``It was a very smooth, rapid delivery ... A nice,
healthy baby girl.''
   Mother, baby and flight crew were all doing fine.

<HEAD>Bush to Kids: Saying No to Drugs ``Won't Make You a Nerd'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with pupils' reaction, inserting 5 grafs after 19th

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a televised appeal to
millions of schoolchildren, said Tuesday that refusing drugs ``won't
make you a nerd'' and urged youngsters to help others stay away from
narcotics.
   ``I'm asking you to not to look the other way,'' Bush said in an
address beamed live from the White House to thousands of schools
across the country.
   Saying everyone knows someone who has a problem, Bush added,
``I'm asking you to find someone who needs you. And offer to help.
I'll say it again: If you're not in trouble, help someone who is.''
   On another front, as Bush made his speech the White House
uncorked a toughly worded, partisan attack against congressional
Democrats who are criticizing the administration's anti-drug efforts
as inadequate and underfunded.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Democrats were
trying ``to play price-tag politics'' with the administration's
plan, which calls for more prisons, more prosecutors, tougher
sentences and aid to Latin American nations to help combat drug
cartels.
   ``Their first answer was to tax more,'' Fitzwater said of the
Democrats. ``Then they had a daylong conference to decide why they
can't win a presidential election. And now their new answer is to
spend more.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, proposed legislation to boost
anti-drug spending to $10.1 billion, or $2.2 billion more than
Bush's program, in fiscal 1990 which begins Oct. 1.
   Byrd proposed across-the-board cuts in many domestic and Pentagon
programs of 0.575 percent. Bush had suggested taking money away from
a handful of domestic programs to pay for his program.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., indicated that despite
the White House opposition, he liked elements of Byrd's plan. ``He
may have the best solution on the funding side of the equation,''
Dole said of Byrd's proposal. ``I'm not certain of the amount, but
perhaps that's something we can work out.''
   White House spokesman Fitzwater said Byrd's proposal ``throws
money at the problem rather than providing a plan.'' The White House
said Bush's advisers would recommend he veto the Democratic version.
   While the White House argued with Democrats, the administration
offered a new price tag for the long-term cost of the drug war.
   William J. Bennett, the national drug control policy director,
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee, ``I don't think it's
unreasonable to say that we are talking about a $50 billion program
over five years.''
   At the White House, Bush spoke for 15 minutes to schoolchildren
in an address carried live by the four major television networks as
well as educational cable systems.
   The Education Department had alerted 15,000 superintendents and
55,000 principals of the broadcast, and some schools arranged to
hold assemblies where students could watch the speech and discuss
the drug problem.
   ``Presidents don't often get the chance to talk directly to
students. So today, for each of you sitting in a classroom or
assembly hall _ this message goes straight to you,'' Bush said,
speaking from the presidential library.
   ``Most of you are doing the right thing,'' he said. ``But for
those of you who let drugs make their decisions for them, you can
almost hear the doors slamming shut.''
   Calling drugs ``an equal opportunity destroyer,'' Bush said,
``They have no conscience. They don't care where the money comes
from. They just murder people. Young and old, good and bad, innocent
and guilty _ it doesn't matter. For too many, drugs mean death.''
   He said, ``I'll let you in on a secret: We all can succeed. If
you don't use drugs, you can be anything you want to be. ... So
don't blow it.''
   The president said that ``saying `no' won't make you a nerd. It
won't make you a loser. In fact, it will make you more friends than
drugs ever will.''
   First reactions from pupils in classrooms, at least publicly to
reporters, were skeptical.
   ``It's not going to make no difference. People don't listen,''
said 11-year-old Louranda Ross after listening to Bush's address
along with her fifth-grade classmates at Mattahunt Elementary School
in inner-city Boston.
   In Washington, 13-year-old Russell Davis blurted out in a
question-and-answer session after his class heard Bush tell kids to
help other kids: ``Sometimes you can't help them if they don't want
help.''
   ``If a person is using drugs and he feels he must have it, when
you offer help he might rebel against you. What can you do?''
Russell asked raising his hands in exasperation.
   ``Don't give up,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, who had come to Hines Junior High School in the southeast
section of the nation's capital to reinforce the president's message.
   Equating drugs with death, Bush displayed the badge of a slain
22-year-old rookie policeman and said: ``I keep this badge in a
drawer in my desk to remind me of that.''
   The badge belonged to New York City police officer Eddie Byrne,
who was killed in 1988 while protecting a witness in a drug case. It
was presented to Bush during a campaign appearance in New York last
year by Byrne's father.
   Bush combined his appeal to stay off drugs with a warning of
punishment for those who use narcotics.
   ``Some think there won't be room for them in jail. We'll make
room. We're doubling prison space.
   ``Some think there aren't enough prosecutors. We'll hire them _
with the largest increase in federal prosecutors in history. The day
of the dealer is drawing to a close,'' the president said.

   A jury was seated Tuesday in the
murder trial of a former nurse's aide charged with smothering five
nursing home patients with her lesbian lover.
   Although defense attorney James Piazza had sought to move the
trial out of the county due to pretrial publicity, a jury was seated
in less than two days. Opening arguments are to begin Wednesday.
   Gwendolyn Graham, 25, is charged with five counts of first-degree
murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of
female patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in suburban Walker.
   The key witness for the prosecution will be Graham's alleged
accomplice and former live-in companion, Catherine Wood of Grand
Rapids.
   Wood also was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. But
prosecutors allowed her to plead guilty to second-degree murder and
conspiracy to commit murder in exchange for her testimony against
Graham. First-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence
without parole, while Wood has a chance of parole in 10 years on the
lesser charges.
   At Graham's preliminary examination, Wood described how Graham,
of Tyler, Texas, chose frail patients who would not be able to
struggle and therefore would leave no signs of suffocation.
   Wood testified that Graham told her killing the patients helped
her ``relieve tension.''
   Piazza has called Wood a pathological liar.
   When the five patients died in 1987, their deaths were listed as
natural and no autopsies were performed. Police only began
investigating late last year after Wood's former husband told them
his former wife confessed to her part in the slayings.

   Environmental abuse appears to be
heating the Earth, damaging lungs, poisoning lakes, defacing
monuments and shrinking the food supply, scientists warned Tuesday
at a conference of chemists.
   ``Six of the warmest years in the last 100 occurred in the
'80s,'' said Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research. ``And I'll give you odds that the
'90s will be warmer than the '80s.''
   Doomsday scenarios of global warming, acid rain and ozone
depletion _ once only the province of radical environmentalists _
topped the agenda at the American Chemical Society convention.
   The amount of carbon dioxide, the largest component of the
``greenhouse effect,'' has increased by 25 percent in the atmosphere
since the industrial revolution began, and 10 percent since 1950.
Methane, another heat-trapping gas, has doubled.
   The warmth will generate more killer hurricanes, change farming
areas to deserts and raise sea levels high enough to cause major
flooding and salinization of coastal water supplies and farm lands,
Schneider said.
   A worst-case scenario would raise the temperature over the next
100 years by up to 10 degrees Farenheit, or more than the difference
between the ice ages and warmer intervals _ and that took 10,000
years to change.
   ``We probably entered (global warming) two decades ago, but it
will take another two decades or so to be sure,'' he said. ``The
problem is, the experiment is in a laboratory called the earth.''
   Prompted by growing environmental concerns, the chemical society,
which represents more than 137,000 chemists nationwide and has met
annually for 198 years, scheduled three days of special sessions
this week on atmospheric chemistry and the environment, and received
scores of related papers.
   A Texas A&amp;M researcher found that increased ultraviolet light _
an effect of the thinning ozone layer _ seems to kill phytoplankton
in the Antarctic. The tiny plants, which Sayed El-Sayed calls the
``grass of the sea,'' are the basis for the entire marine food chain.
   A paper from the University of Copenhagen said human beings may
already be feeling increased acidic air pollution in their lungs,
including chronic bronchitis among those already suffering from
asthma.
   William Wilson, of the Atmospheric Research and Exposure
Assessment Laboratory, showed that air pollution is becoming a major
issue in art and monument conservation around the world. A paper by
David Pimentel of Cornell traced the increasing insect-caused losses
of corn and other crops despite a 1,000-fold increase in the use of
polluting pesticides, and suggested other forms of managing farm
yield.
   Canadian government pollution expert Hans Martin painted a gloomy
picture of acid rain in his country, saying half of the nation's
720,000 lakes were affected by the fallout from sulfur and nitrogen
compound pollution.
   Martin showed pictures of accelerating forest damage over the
past decade from Canada to Czechoslovakia, saying little is
understood about the phenomenon, but it is clearly worsening.
   The death of the trees may be caused by pollution mobilizing
aluminum in the soil _ and aluminum, Martin notes, is also blamed
for contributing to Alzheimer's disease in humans.
   ``Our society has messed up for 10 to 20 years, and will mess up
for 10 more years,'' he warned.
   But one of the most important changes has already occurred, most
of the speakers agreed. Martin said environmental concerns are
already listed by Canadians as their biggest concern.
   Schneider said that since the long, hot summer of 1988, the
interest in global warming has increased astronomically.

   The House on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a
bill designed to overcome an unpopular Supreme Court decision and
restore criminal penalties for flag burning.
   The Democratic-sponsored bill was passed 380 to 38 and sent to
the Senate, which plans action next month.
   The lopsided tally came after Speaker Thomas S. Foley promised a
vote later on a constitutional amendment, the remedy demanded by
President Bush and many congressional Republicans to undo the
court's ruling that flag burning could be a protected form of free
speech.
   ``I remain opposed ... and I think the leadership is opposed to a
constitutional amendment,'' said Foley, D-Wash., calling such action
unnecessary tampering with the Bill of Rights.
   However, he said he had assured those seeking an amendment they
would get their vote, and he denied that that marked a political
setback. He suggested he would work to keep the amendment from
getting the two-thirds vote needed for passage.
   Some seeking an amendment softened their opposition to the
statute, once assured that the Democratic leadership would not use
it to block their alternative.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans
Committee and co-sponsor of Bush's amendment, stood up in the House
and announced he would vote for the statute.
   ``I still have doubts that we can do the job by statute, but this
is a step in the right direction,'' he said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We believe
that this bill is insufficient to provide the protections that we
seek, and therefore continue to press for a constitutional
amendment.''
   But he stopped short of any veto threat, thus heling the House
Democrats garner support for the statute.
   Conservative Republicans, however, continued to accuse the
Democrats of trying to sidetrack the constitutional amendment while
pushing a statute the GOP lawmakers contend may still be
unconstitutional.
   ``The game is obvious,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H. ``This
is the flag burner protection act of 1989.''
   The statute, a version of which is expected to come before the
Senate in early October, includes criminal penalties of up to a year
in jail plus an unspecified fine for flag burning or other
mutilation.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has promised a vote on the
constitutional amendment later next month, and Foley said Tuesday
that House action would follow the Senate's.
   Both the statute and the constitutional amendment are attempts to
address a Supreme Court ruling in June that threw out the conviction
of a man who burned a flag at the 1984 Republican National
Convention in Dallas.
   The court held that the law was unconstitutional because it was
aimed at suppressing the man's right to political expression as
guaranteed by the Constitution.
   Bush, who visited a flag factory as part of his campaign last
year, joined Republican leaders on Capitol Hill in a drive for a
constitutional amendment to give the federal government and the
states specific power to protect the flag from desecration.
   Foley and other key Democrats, however, argue that such an
amendment would dangerously create a loophole in the Bill of Rights,
and a regular statute could meet the high court's concerns.
   ``We offer a carefully drawn, constitutionally sound statute, a
law that will protect the flag with no threat to our precious right
of free speech,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on constitutional law.
   Edwards said the statute could pass muster with the court because
it does not make expression illegal, just the actual physical abuse
of the flag.
   But Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., senior Republican on
Edwards' subcommittee, said that approach gutted the purpose of the
statute.
   ``Why are we so reluctant to amend the Constitution to demand
that flag desecration be prohibited?'' he said. ``Is it too much to
ask those who consider themselves Americans to be required to have
respect for our flag?''
   The House bill includes a provision for expedited review of the
law by the Supreme Court if its constitutionality is challenged, and
an exception so that veterans groups could continue their practice
of disposal of old, worn-out flags by burning them.
   Opponents of the statute said the disposal exception was a
loophole that could protect unsavory flag burners _ that they could
dirty their flags before burning them. The bill's drafters, however,
said the dirtying itself would be illegal.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
praised a locally recruited army unit Tuesday and sidestepped
questions about murder charges lodged a day earlier against two of
its members.
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed confidence in the 6,500-member Ulster
Defense Regiment, which she said had ``suffered greatly'' in the
Irish Republican Army uprising against British rule.
   ``I have just been looking at the figures _ 179 UDR (members)
have been murdered in the last 20 years. They are a very, very brave
group of men,'' said the prime minister during a visit to Northern
Ireland.
   On Monday, two members of the mainly Protestant regiment and a
taxi driver were accused in court of killing a Roman Catholic,
Loughlin Maginn, 38.
   Maginn allegedly was targeted after security documents
identifying him as an IRA suspect were leaked to an outlawed
Protestant group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters.
   One of the two soldiers was also charged in the slaying of
another Catholic, Liam McKee, 36.
   During a full day of talks with businessmen, soldiers and police,
Mrs. Thatcher met an eight-man defense regiment patrol at the
Lissanelly army barracks in Omagh, in the center of the province.
   A member of the regiment who spoke to Mrs. Thatcher said she did
not mention the allegations of leaked documents, which authorities
are investigating.
   The soldier, who was not allowed to be identified, told
reporters: ``She assured us she was being supportive. We talked
about personal security. Nothing was mentioned about intelligence
files. Nothing dramatic was said.''
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters that claims of collusion between
some soldiers and extremists were matters for the courts.
   As for the murder charges, she told reporters: ``It is not a
matter for me. If a person is charged, they are not guilty until
they are found guilty by the courts.''
   As is usual with visits by British leaders to the province,
nothing was announced about Mrs. Thatcher's trip until after she
arrived at a Royal Air Force base near Belfast.
   Roadblocks were set up wherever she went, and police
sharpshooters were on rooftops.
   The security measures have been set up to prevent attacks by the
mainly Catholic IRA, which is fighting to unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic majority Irish
Republic.

   The Pentagon said Tuesday the United States is
prepared ``to expand the training role'' of U.S. troops sent to
assist the Andean drug battle but insisted those forces will not
take part in any local anti-drug operations.
   Giving the latest update on the U.S. effort to battle the
international drug war, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams also
defended the Defense Department against criticism from the chief of
Colombia's national police force, who complained the Pentagon is
sending the wrong equipment for the fight.
   ``There's a great deal more to go,'' said Williams, noting that
some $10.4 million in equipment has been sent to Columbia as part of
President Bush's emergency $65 million aid package to that nation.
   Williams said there are ``less than 50'' U.S. military officers
in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, but he refused to specify where their
locations.
   Controversy arose about the role of U.S. troops in the
president's new strategy following a published report that Bush had
signed a secret directive authorizing U.S. Special Forces to
accompany local forces on some patrols.
   Asked to clarify the role of U.S. advisers in the current
situation, Williams stressed _ as Bush and White House officials
have done as well _ that the troops are not there to enter combat
but to provide training, equipment and support for the local police
and military in the anti-narcotics fight.
   ``The critical point to bear in mind _ no U.S. forces, no U.S.
military personnel will accompany host government forces on actual
field operations,'' Williams said. ``But we are prepared to expand
the training role. ... It's clearly an expansion of our training
role.''
   Although Williams refused to discuss the details of Bush's secret
directive, he said U.S. forces now will be allowed to go ``beyond
the boundaries of secured garrison training areas'' in their
training missions.
   He was also asled about published comments by Colombia's Maj.
Gen. Gomez Padilla that the U.S. equipment being sent to that nation
was more suitable for conventional warfare than operations against
narcotic traffickers.
   ``This is not something where ... you fill out your Eastern
Mountains Sports catalog and mail it in. It's not that simple,''
Williams said.
   He said the items sent to Colombia have been derived as ``the
result of continuing discussions between the United States and the
Colombians. It's their request, and we match it with what we can
provide.''
   The spokesman noted that under the emergency program, the
Pentagon must send materiel gleaned from existing stocks and cannot
purchase new items.
   So far, he said, that aid has included 15 aircraft, 23 jeeps and
ambulances, medical supplies, bullet-proof vests, radios, machine
guns and grenade launchers
   The Colombian police have recieved 5 UH-1 ``Huey'' helicopters,
small arms, machine guns, grenade launchers and ammunition. The
Colombian army has been sent vehicles, radios, medical equipment,
grenade launchers and ammunition while the air force has been sent
two C-130 transport planes and spare parts, eight OA-37
reconnaisance jets and spare parts, he said.
   The judiciary has been provided 500 bullet-proof vests, Williams
said.
   ``We are undergoing extensive and continuing negotiations with
the government of Colombia, both civil and military officials, to
develop the maximum amount of benefit of our available military
equipment,'' Williams said. ``It may not be a perfect match, but the
equipment and its schedule has received a great deal of attention at
the Pentagon.''
   The spokesman said that the Pentagon believes ``that the aid that
we have offered is appropriate to the circumstance.''

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter agreed
Tuesday to consider boosting disaster payments to farmers who
harvested a second crop after severe weather destroyed their winter
wheat and cotton.
   Farm state lawmakers contend the Agriculture Department's formula
for calculating relief payments is inflexible and unfair to farmers
who planted a replacement crop after drought, hail and extreme cold
battered the Great Plains earlier this year.
   Under the current formula, some farmers who ``did nothing'' after
the drought are better off than those who planted a second crop,
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``You can't treat the guys who are trying to help themselves
worse than the guys who are waiting around for the government to
help them,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas predicted
USDA would modify its second crop formula, under which 75 percent of
the gross value of a second crop would be deducted when calculating
disaster payments for losses on the first crop.
   ``That's tantamount to saying the cost of production was 25
percent,'' said Cotton Fanning, executive assistant at the High
Plains Cotton Growers Inc. in Lubbock, Texas.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he was encouraged by Yeutter's
response to lawmakers' concerns during a meeting Tuesday in Dole's
office.
   ``The secretary recognized that changes are needed, although he
stopped short of a firm commitment,'' Bentsen said after the session.
   Gramm, who also attended the meeting, said the USDA's forumula is
``totally arbitrary'' and that farmers' costs vary. He said he asked
Yeutter to ``come up with a practical way of calculating the real
costs.''
   Bentsen has proposed that only the net value of the second crop
be deducted.
   Yeutter spokeswoman Kelly Shipp said the secretary would respond
after evaluating the suggestions.

   The House on Tuesday approved a compromise
$18.6 billion spending bill that includes money to break ground on a
$5 billion superconducting super collider physics research center in
Texas.
   The energy and water projects appropriations bill for fiscal 1990
also includes $636 million _ four times the amount allocated for
this year _ for environmental clean-ups at the nation's nuclear
weapons plants.
   The compromise between earlier House and Senate versions of the
bill was approved by the House 392-27. Senate action sending the
measure to the president's desk was expected later in the week.
   The super collider, a 53-mile underground loop to be constructed
25 miles south of Dallas, would get $225 million under the
compromise.
   President Bush had asked for $250 million for the project in his
adopted home state. The House had cut the request to $200 million
after critics called the science project an ``expensive toy.''
   The collider would be the most powerful and advanced facility in
the world for examining subatomic particles. Physicists hope to use
the machine to duplicate on an infinitesimally small scale the
conditions of the postulated ``Big Bang'' moment of creation of the
universe, and thus answer the most basic question: What is matter?
   The super collider is just one of many projects in the bill dear
to lawmakers seeking federal spending in their home states.
   Construction would begin on some three dozen new flood control
and navigation projects, more than three times what the White House
requested. However, the bill cuts total spending on water projects
by 2 percent from the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   The $636 million for nuclear production plant clean-ups is part
of $9.7 billion provided for the Energy Department's atomic weapons
program. Total cost of cleaning up the dangerous radioactive waste
from the plants, dating back to the Manhattan Project of World War
II, could run as high as $100 billion.
   The bill also provides $2.2 billion for energy research and
development, and $121 million for the Tennessee Valley Authority.

<TEXT>
   High school sports stars being recruited by
college coaches may soon be signing a piece of paper showing they
know the percentage of athletes who graduate from the school before
they sign a scholarship.
   Under strong pressure from Sen. Bill Bradley, the head of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association promised to back a federal
law requiring such disclosure unless the NCAA acts on its own next
January.
   ``If we don't pass meaningful legislation, I will personally
lobby for this bill,'' NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz told
Bradley.
   Similarly, Ithaca College President James Whalen, testifying on
behalf of the American Council on Education, pleaded with a Senate
committee to delay passing a law until college administrators have
more time to implement a disclosure plan of their own.
   If the school chiefs fail to act, Whalen promised to join Schultz
in backing legislation.
   However, Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat and Rhodes Scholar who
starred in basketball at Princeton University and for the New York
Knicks before taking up politics, said he viewed such assertions of
good intention as ``too little, too late'' and said he would not
wait for the NCAA.
   Bradley told reporters he hopes to win passage of the legislation
before the NCAA meets in January.
   Legislation would be better, he said, because there are nearly
500 U.S. colleges that are not members of the NCAA. He also said
having the ``consumer disclosure'' requirement contained in an act
of Congress would temper the temptation for college coaches to cheat
in pursuit of a better won-loss record.
   Bradley said he was ``astounded'' there was any opposition to the
bill at all because ``I really thought I was introducing something
that was apple pie and motherhood.''
   Among those testifying in favor of the Bradley bill Monday were
Oscar Robertson, a former NBA player and member of the National
Basketball Hall of Fame; Villanova University basketball coach
Rollie Massimino; Bob Hurley, coach of the top-ranked St. Anthony's
High School basketball team in Jersey City, N.J.; Richard Lapchick,
director of Northeastern University's center for the study of sport
in society and Dr. Patricia Lucas, principal of Southeast High
School in Bradenton, Fla., testifying on behalf of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals.
   Schultz said the 48 percent graduate rate for college athletes at
NCAA member institutions is actually a fraction of a point better
than the rate for student bodies as a whole.
   Schultz, who has headed the NCAA for two years, also argued that
rules put into place over the past five years to strenghten academic
achievement by athletes have not had time to show up in statistics.
   The NCAA collects graduation data from its member institutions
and issues it in an annual report. However, the report is not broken
down by individual college.
   The Bradley bill would require that the individual figures be
reported publicly to the U.S. Department of Education, broken down
by sport, and that each institution also disclose its own rates to
prospective athletic recruits and that the figures be printed on any
scholarship papers signed by the student.
   Moreover, the legislation would require the student to
acknowledge in writing that he or she has discussed the graduation
statistics with a high school guidance counselor or principal.
   Lapchick said it was particularly important that disclosure be by
sport, rather than confined to an overall rate for all the school
athletes, because the worst problems are in the big revenue sports
football and basketball.
   ``It doesn't do an inner city kid much good to know how white
male soccer players are doing or which female field hockey players
are graduating,'' he said. ``

<HEAD>Government Not to Block Protest March Led by Tutu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a highly unusual move, the
government Tuesday said it would allow a mass march condemning
alleged brutality by police riot squads. Protest marches in South
Africa normally are outlawed.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other organizers of
Wednesday's demonstration had refused to seek authorization from the
government. But Acting President F.W. de Klerk told reporters the
protest would be allowed nonetheless because of assurances that it
would be peaceful.
   ``I hope tomorrow will prove that a new spirit can arise in our
beautiful country, a spirit in which all Christians and all people
who say that they believe in peace will reach out and really start
talking to each other,'' de Klerk said.
   The march through downtown Cape Town is to coincide with the
opening of Parliament, where the National Party-controlled electoral
college is expected to elect de Klerk to a five-year term Thursday.
He has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would give some
form of political rights to the now-voteless black majority.
   Tutu and other activists allege that at least 23 people in Cape
Town's black and mixed-race townships were killed on the night of
the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections by police. Police say 15 people
were killed, 10 in black-on-black faction fighting.
   De Klerk said police were forced to act because militants were
forcefully preventing people from voting. He said ``remedial steps''
would be taken on any policemen found to have used excessive force.
   ``This is not the time to aggravate the differences that exist in
our society,'' said de Klerk. ``This is the time for finding common
ground.''
   One government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
indicated the decision to allow the march came after an appeal from
officials of the white Dutch Reformed Church, who contacted the
government after meeting Tutu and other protest leaders.
   Tutu is to be joined at the head of the march by Cape Town's
white mayor, Gordon Oliver.
   They and two other activists issued a statement inviting all Cape
Town residents to join in a ``dignified, peaceful procession ...
under the theme `Peace in Our City.'''
   The statement said the marchers would demand removal of riot
police from the townships, a halt to detentions, release of police
records to lawyers and negotiations aimed at ending apartheid.
   The government announced Tuesday that Maj. Gen. Jaap Joubert, a
senior police investigator, had been appointed to lead a probe into
the allegations of police violence.
   However, Lt. Gregory Rockman, a mixed-race policeman who has
created a furor by accusing riot squad members of brutality, said he
was not satisfied and proposed a judge be appointed to oversee a
public inquiry.
   ``This just doesn't satisfy me,'' Rockman said of Joubert's
appointment. ``They are just trying to cool us off.''
   Rockman spoke after he and about 40 other mixed-race officers met
with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and police commanders from
the Cape Town area, where riot squads and protesters have clashed
almost daily since early August.
   Tutu, among others, has hailed Rockman as a hero for going public
with his allegations that police behaved like ``wild dogs'' when
they beat schoolchildren and bystanders during an anti-election
protest on Sept. 5.
   The top-ranking mixed-race policeman, Col. John Manuel, was among
those who met with Vlok. Afterward, Manuel said Rockman has ``full
support from his colleagues and from me.''
   In another development, a former newspaper photographer told a
news conference he had been a police spy for the past two years,
providing information about anti-apartheid journalists and
organizations.
   Gregory Flatt, 21, said he was coerced into becoming an informer
while in detention in early 1987.
   He said he decided to confess his role because of the election
night violence and because he was impressed by Rockman's courage.
Both Flatt and Rockman are from the mixed-race township of
Mitchell's Plain.
   Flatt formerly worked for South, an anti-apartheid weekly
newspaper published in Cape Town.
   ``I betrayed the cause of my people and helped to maintain an
unjust system,'' Flatt said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the government's plan to close
some military bases got a mild victory Tuesday as a Senate
subcommittee voted to tie the future of the domestic bases to a
congressional audit.
   The $288.2 billion military spending bill approved by the
Appropriations defense subcommittee contains a provision that would
prevent closure unless an audit determines the savings to the
Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of locking the gates.
   A similar effort died in the House in July, but the Senate
measure is considered attractive because the General Accounting
Office audit would include all 86 bases targeted by a government
commission. The House amendment affected only 15.
   Critics have accused the Commission on Base Closure and
Realignment of using faulty data in the cases of some of the bases
ordered to close by Sept. 30, 1995. They also question whether the
commission considered the cost of environmental cleanup at the sites.
   The commission said the government would save $5.6 billion over
20 years if the bases are closed.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee will consider the defense
bill on Thursday.
   ``We view this as incremental progress,'' said David Carle,
spokesman for Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose state includes Chanute
Air Force Base in Rantoul and Fort Sheridan in Chicago, two bases
ordered to close.
   ``It shows that the subcommittee is daring to open the
base-closing issue,'' Carle said.

   Thousands of East Germans crowded refugee camps in West Germany

over 10,000 had arrived in the past two days.
   In the border city of Passau, the new arrivals were greeted with
offers of jobs and shelter. Tent camps and a reception area were set
up for the emigres.
   East Germans camping outside the West German Embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, gave up their vigil after East German authorities
promised they would not be punished if they returned home.
   Officials said thousands more East Germans were arriving in
Hungary, which opened its doors to the West Sunday.

   East Germany issued a sharp formal protest to Hungary for
permitting the exodus and demanded the flood be stopped. The state
ADN news agency also said Soviet Politburo hard-liner Yegor Ligachev
and East German government officials issued a joint statement
harshly criticizing West Germany.
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's official newspaper,
called the exodus a ``provocation organized at high levels,'' and an
``illegal action to lure away East German citizens in Hungary.''
   The Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt called the exodus
an ``anti-socialist action ... by Bonn.''
   Sources said many requests for tourist visas for trips to Hungary
are being refused, indicating that East Berlin has begun clamping
down.

<HEAD>Backers Defend Expansion of Outer Shelf Oil Drilling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of expanded drilling for oil on the
outer continental shelf contended Tuesday that the huge spill from
the Exxon Valdez tanker is impossible with an offshore rig.
   A greater risk comes from foreign tankers carrying foreign oil,
representatives of the petroleum industry and Interior Department
told a House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee.
   ``OCS (outer continental shelf) oil and gas development is
inherently safer,'' than importing oil on tankers, said Barry A.
Williamson, director of the Minerals Management Service at the
Interior Department. He noted that two of three oil spills in U.S.
waterways shortly after the March 24 Exxon Valdez accident involved
foreign vessels.
   ``Every barrel we don't produce from OCS is another barrel'' that
must be imported, he added.
   ``If we don't move forward with a domestic OCS program, our
country is going to suffer in the future,'' said Rep. Jack Fields,
R-Texas.
   The National Audubon Society contended, however, that the
pollution from offshore rigs consists of more than the spillage.
``Contrary to popular thinking, a significant amount of OCS oil and
gas activities takes place on coastal landfall areas and in
nearshore waters,'' said Dorene Bolze, an analyst for the group.
   For example, there are the residues of drilling _ muds and
cuttings _ and the liquids brought to the floor by drilling, all of
which may contain contaminants, including toxic materials.
   Additionally, there is the problem of air and noise pollution,
spills from ships used to transport the oil, and damage to wetlands
from pollution, pipeline digging and other construction, the group
says.
   Most of the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico is brought to land
by pipeline.
   As a result of major offshore oil rig disasters in 1969 and 1970
_ one off Santa Barbara, Calif., and two involving fires in the Gulf
of Mexico _ federal regulation of the industry intensified.
   There have been no well blowouts spilling more than 200 barrels
into federal waters since 1970, according to Interior Department
figures cited in the hearing.
   A 1985 report by the National Academy of Sciences, quoted freely
in the hearing, estimated that the oil spilled from offshore oil
production accounted for only 2 percent of the total marine oil
spillage worldwide.
   The Valdez accident, by contrast, resulted in the release of more
than 250,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons.
   Drilling advocates say that kind of release is impossible not
only because of the regulations and safety measures that have been
put in place, but also because the offshore wells produce oil at
only eight barrels an hour.
   Tuesday's hearing of the Panama Canal and Outer Continental Shelf
subcommittee was not to consider any legislation, but occurred
against a backdrop of responses to the Valdez incident. Several
subcommittees were making last-minute adjustments to oil spill
cleanup legislation resulting from the Valdez accident before
committee and House action later this week.
   Most outer continental shelf production is in the Gulf of Mexico
and Pacific Ocean off California. An administration task force is
studying some of the more controversial lease sales off Florida and
the Gulf coast of Florida and is expected to make recommendations to
President Bush in December.

   Typhoon Sarah lashed Taiwan with heavy
rains and high winds for a second day on Tuesday, killing at least
11 people and leaving nine missing, officials said.
   They said the typhoon set off landslides, immobilized
transportation, flooded crops and broke a Panamanian freighter in
two.
   The 12,000-ton Lung Hao with 26 Turkish and Indian crew broke
apart Monday off Hualien, 110 miles southeast of Taipei, and
rescuers still are looking for five crew members believed stranded
on the vessel.
   Four sailors swam ashore Monday and 17 were rescued Tuesday.
   Hualien was the hardest-hit area, with four people reported dead.
   An Australian teacher, Jonathan B. Watts, 26, died Monday when
swept into the sea while touring the harbor there with other
instructors from a nearby English-language center, police said.
   In addition, a woman was electrocuted, a boy drowned in
floodwaters and a man was hit by falling rocks.
   Police said four people were killed in southern Pingtung county
when strong winds made them lose control of their car.
   Officers said three people died elsewhere in Taiwan and four were
missing.
   They said the typhoon, sitting nearly 50 miles off eastern
Taipei, moved northward at 9 mph in a sweep across the island, but
weathermen said its peak winds were down from 108 mph to 72 mph.
   In Manila, government and Red Cross officials said Sarah caused
floods and landslides in the northern Philippines Sunday and Monday,
leaving 21 people dead and up to 70,000 homeless.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Says Clean Air Bill Not Unfair to 9 Producing States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's envionmental chief, taking sides
in a bitter cost-sharing dispute over President Bush's clean air
bill, said Tuesday the proposal would not force nine states to pay
more than their fare share to curtail acid rain.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, strongly contradicted figures released by Rep. Philip R.
Sharp, D-Ind., that suggested electric utility customers in the nine
states would pay a disproportionate amount of the cost of reducing
acid rain emissions.
   At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce energy and power
subcommittee, chaired by Sharp, Reilly released his own statistics
that contended the nine states would get a fair deal under the Bush
legislation.
   The states are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.
   Sharp has demanded that electric utility customers in those
states receive financial help in paying for power plant reductions
of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, emissions that form the acid
rain compound.
   This could be accomplished by forcing industries to reduce their
emissions of these same chemicals, or have electric utility
customers elsewhere pay part of the tab through special fees.
   But Reilly, lawmakers from outside the nine states and at least
one House member from Tennessee, Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, argued
that other states' utility customers already are financing the cost
of reductions made by their own utilities.
   Reilly added that plants other than utilities account for just 30
percent of the problem, and it would be much more efficient to order
all the reductions from the utilities, which cause 70 percent of the
pollution. These are power plants that burn high-sulfur coal, much
of it mined in West Virginia.
   Bush's legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airborne
chemicals, ozone and the acid rain, which is carried for hundreds of
miles before falling to earth. Acid rain destroys lakes, kills
trees, makes buildings deteriorate and causes lung problems.
   The president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons
by the year 2000, based on 1980 levels, with nine million tons
coming from power plants and one million from industrial emission
reductions already achieved. There would be an emissions ``cap'' to
prevent future releases from offsetting the reductions.
   Sharp began his hearing Tuesday by citing new figures that
contend the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77 percent
of the acid rain emissions, even though they cause only 50 percent
of the problem.
   He contended that, in the initial phase of the program, utility
customers in the nine states would ``pay for fully 90 percent of the
clean-up.''
   But Reilly then presented his own statistics, which said that the
nine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but their
actual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total.
   ``That's as fair as we can possibly make it,'' he said, adding
the Bush legislation is ``fair to those who cleaned up in the past.
It doesn't make them pay to clean up again.''
   Sharp contended some utility rates could rise by 20 percent in
the nine states, but Reilly said the five hardest-hit states would
see utility bills rise, on the average, a third of a cent per
killowatt-hour by the year 2001.

<HEAD>House Votes To Remove Postal Receipts From Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Tuesday to reverse a 1985
Reagan administration decision to include the U.S. Postal Service's
revenues and expenditures in the federal budget, a move designed in
part to stave off a rate increase.
   The bill, approved 405-11, would insulate the Postal Service from
deficit-reduction efforts, giving it the same ``off-budget'' status
accorded Social Security.
   It is designed ``to enable the Postal Service to operate in a
more businesslike manner and to relieve some of the pressure for
increased postal rates,'' a spokesman for the Post Office and Civil
Service Committee said. The bill now goes to the Senate.
   In 1985, Budget Director David Stockman included Postal Service
receipts and expenditures in the next year's federal budget _ a
practice that continues, said Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., the
committee chairman.
   ``Those receipts and disbursements now, at least on paper, affect
the federal deficit,'' Ford said.
   When Congress ordered government agencies to reduce spending in
1987, the Postal Service had to absorb a $1.2 billion cut, he said.
As a result, more than 700 post office construction projects were
delayed or cancelled, offices were closed on Saturdays, window hours
were reduced and Sunday mail processing was curtailed.
   ``This year, some budgeteers want to take another bite out of the
Postal Service,'' Ford said in a floor speech. The Bush
administration contends that a budget agreement with congressional
leaders reached earlier this year requires shifting $400 million in
postal revenues to the Treasury, he said.
   Ford said his committee rejects the idea. ``It's not good policy
and it will accelerate the next rate increase,'' he said.
   Most of the Postal Service's 1990 budget will be generated by the
mail system, he said.
   ``Today, no money is appropriated (from the federal treasury) to
pay for the costs of delivering the mail,'' Ford said. ``Those costs
are paid by postal ratepayers. And the Postal Service, as required
by law, is breaking even over the long haul.''

<HEAD>UN Cites Occupied Territories, Lebanon as Biggest Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Tuesday painted a bleak picture of events in the Israeli-occupied
territories and Lebanon, saying they were his biggest problems.
   ``The situation in the Middle East remains a profound and intense
concern,'' he wrote in his annual report, ``not only because of the
political principles at stake, but also because of the widespread
human suffering caused by failure to resolve those issues.''
   Hopes for early progress in the peace process ``have sadly given
way to mistrust and doubt among the parties concerned,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar referred to a November resolution by the
Palestinian National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, that
implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism.
   But efforts to promote a dialogue between Israelis and
Palestinians have been unsuccessful, the secretary-general said. He
said his own attempts to start negotiations have been
``frustratingly inconclusive.''
   Meanwhile, he said, the situation in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip grows steadily worse.
   At least 567 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the territories. Forty
Israelis also have been killed.
   He said the Security Council repeatedly has called on Israel to
observe international conventions on protecting civilians in time of
war. Despite appeals by the international community, however,
widespread violation of human rights persist, he said.
   Perez de Cuellar called for negotiations, ``taking fully into
account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including
those of self-determination.
   ``The longer such a process is delayed,'' Perez de Cuellar said,
``the greater will be the difficulties in intiating it and the more
explosive the situation can become.''
   The secretary-general also said the world is appalled by the
steady disintegration of government and society in Lebanon and by
the unprecedented violence in that country's 14-year-old civil war.
   On Aug. 15, the secretary-general requested an urgent meeting of
the Security Council on Lebanon. The Council appealed to the
Christians and Syrian-Moslem alliance to lay down their weapons.
   The secretary-general said he was pursuing contacts in liaison
with a tripartite Arab League committee to achieve a cease-fire.
   Perez de Cuellar said the international community bears a
responsibility to ensure restoration of the unity, sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon, as a member state
of the United Nations.
   At least 847 people have died and 2,528 have been wounded since
March 8, when the most recent fighting in the sectarian civil war
broke out between Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun and
Syrian troops based in Lebanon.
   Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1976 on an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.

<TEXT>
   Congress must investigate the shipboard blast
that killed 47 sailors on the USS Iowa, Sen. John Glenn and Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar said Tuesday.
   ``There isn't any doubt that we have to look into it,'' Glenn
said during a break in a private briefing by the Iowa blast's chief
investigator and other Navy officials.
   ``I want to find out if they reached the right conclusion and I
want to make sure this never happens again,'' said Glenn, D-Ohio and
a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``In my mind, there are serious shortcomings in the way the Navy
conducted its inquiry and I want to make sure that the little
person's voice is heard in this matter,'' said Oakar, D-Ohio, who
spent about four hours with the Navy investigators in a separate
briefing.
   The Pentagon released a report last week that said
``circumstantial evidence'' indicated gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig
intentionally sparked the April 19 USS Iowa explosion, probably in
order to kill himself. The report called Hartwig the ``principal
suspect,'' but said it would be impossible to prove guilt because
all those nearby died in the blast.
   In Cleveland, the family of Hartwig has criticized the Navy's
report and characterized Hartwig as a convenient scapegoat being
used to deflect attention from what they consider the Navy's
negligence.
   Oakar, who represents part of Cleveland, said she would seek two
probes: a General Accounting Office investigation of Navy procedures
and equipment and a House Armed Services investigations subcommittee
examination of the way the Navy handled the Iowa case.
   ``I firmly believe the Navy has some responsibility in this
matter to make sure the reputations and families of the sailors who
died in this tragedy are protected from allegations that cannot be
proven,'' she said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who joined Glenn's briefing with
Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, said he was unhappy with the Navy's
answers to his questions.
   ``I would have difficulty arriving at the same conclusions the
Navy arrived at,'' Metzenbaum told reporters.
   After reviewing the facts that led the Navy to report that the
explosion probably was deliberately caused by a suicidal sailor, ``I
would say it wouldn't even be enough evidence to submit to a grand
jury,'' said Metzenbaum, a lawyer.
   Metzenbaum stopped short of calling for congressional action but
said ``my inclination is that there should be'' an investigation.
   The Navy has said it will tighten procedures on its ships as a
result of its investigation, which showed Iowa officers were lax in
instructing sailors on firing procedures.
   Meanwhile the Pentagon released the first formal statement on the
Iowa report attributed to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Under difficult circumstances, the investigating officer did a
good and thorough job in trying to account for the factors which
caused the tragic explosion onboard the USS Iowa,'' the statement
said.
   ``I am convinced, based on the findings of the report, that the
16-inch guns on U.S. battleships are safe to fire, and the fleet
will, accordingly, go back to using them. As to how the explosion
happened, the question is obviously not resolved. The investigating
officer offered his best conclusions as required under the Navy's
investigative procedures.''

   The ancestors of American Indians will ``at
last find their final resting place'' under a plan by the
Smithsonian Institution to return Indian remains to their tribes for
burial, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs said Tuesday.
   The agreement, which reverses a long-standing museum policy that
made return of Indian remains rare, was added Tuesday to a bill
before the House that will establish a National Museum of the
American Indian in Washington.
   ``There are many people in this nation who predicted not too long
ago that this day would never come,'' said the chairman, Sen. Daniel
K. Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   ``Today, a process has started that will allow the ancestors of
native Americans to at last find their final resting place,'' he
added. ``It's a day that will be celebrated by Indian leaders
throughout Indian country.''
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., an American Indian
instrumental in achieving the compromise with the museum, said,
``Those remains that can be identified, either specifically or by
the name of tribe, the Smithsonian will notify the individuals in
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them.''
   Under the agreement announced at a news conference, the
Smithsonian will form a five-person commission, including native
Americans, to inventory and identify its collection of remains and
funerary objects _ ceremonial items buried with the Indians.
   The legislation authorizes about $2.25 million for the process:
$1 million directly to the Smithsonian, $1 million to the tribes,
and the remainder for operating costs.
   The agreement represents a significant change of thinking by the
administration of the Smithsonian, which previously had said the
bones were necessary for scientific study.
   ``It seems to me that as the head of the Smithsonian, I certainly
have an obligation to try to retain what can be retained of our
scientific collections,'' Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams
said at the news conference. ``At the same time, it's obiviously
incumbent on me ... to respect and try and alleviate the trauma of
American Indians.''
   Suzan Shown Harjo, executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians, said the Smithsonian was setting a precedent bound
to influence museums all over the country, which have an estimated
600,000 Indian remains.
   Identifying and returning the bones will probably take ``years
and years'' Adams said, and many may not be identifiable.
   The Smithsonian's collection comprises the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, many of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. The
museum also has some 17,000 funerary objects.
   Indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several
years on religious grounds. But Adams had said the Smithsonian would
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or
traced to living descendants. As a result, only 18 Blackfoot remains
have been returned in the last year and a half, according to Adams.

<TEXT>
   Soviet political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin met
briefly with President Bush on Tuesday and urged the administration
and U.S. business executives to help salvage the political and
economic reforms being pushed by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Bush ``emphasized that the American people share his hope for the
success of the reform movement in the Soviet Union,'' the White
House said in a short statement after the 15-minute meeting.
   Bush told Yeltsin his administration enjoys a ``very positive
relationship'' with Gorbachev and reiterated support for
perestroika, or the restructuring of Soviet economic and political
life, the White House said.
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin, ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in late 1987 and then dumped from the ruling Politburo, was elected
to parliament with overwhelming popular support in a contested
election. He arrived in the United States on a private tour Saturday.
   After meeting for nearly an hour with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Yeltsin said he did not expect the United States to loan
money to the Kremlin, but that he wanted American companies to
invest in the Soviet Union.
   In a statement, the State Department said that Yeltsin ``offered
his views on the kinds of changes that are taking place in the
Soviet Union, his assessment of where the reform process stood, and
of what would be needed for the reform process to move forward and
succeed. Examples:
   _ ``Acceptance of existence of private property.
   _``Importance of a mixed economy.
   _``Enticing external investment in the Soviet Union.
   ``Mr. Yelstin made it very clear he would welcome U.S. support
for perestroika. He does not want and is not seeking American
grants. Rather he sees great virtue in private American investment
in the Soviet Union.''
   Yeltsin, rushing from his meeting to catch an airplane to
Chicago, told reporters that ``in my discussion with the president
and vice president, I made a list of 10 issues that could be
discussed between us that could serve rescue perestroika.''
   He declined to give specifics, but said ``the president supported
the proposals that I suggested.''
   The State Department said Baker told Yeltsin that ``in order to
make the Soviet Union an attractive place for Americans to invest,
the Soviet Union needs to address price reform and convertibility of
the ruble.''
   The ruble, the Soviet currency, is not generally traded on world
currency exchanges. A dollar buys many more rubles on the black
market than it does in official transactions in Soviet state banks,
a sign of an ailing economy. The Soviet government is sponsoring a
world-wide competition among economists with a $25,000 prize for the
best plan to make the ruble convertible _ freely traded for dollars,
marks, francs and other currencies.
   Yeltsin's low-key White House reception reflected Bush's desire
to avoid offending Gorbachev. Presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the president didn't want to ``provide a platform for
dissent.''
   In a speech at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore before going
to Washington, Yeltsin said Gorbachev had made mistakes in his
policy of social and economic reforms.
   ``The situation in our country, after 4{ years of perestroika, is
very dangerous. We have to combine our efforts to rescue
perestroika, which is in a super-critical situation today,'' Yeltsin
said, but he did not spell out what he thinks the Kremlin needs from
Washington.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said Yeltsin's views were his own and not necessarily the
government's.
   Yeltsin's White House visit included a private meeting with
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, during which Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle dropped by, Fitzwater said.
   Defending a White House decision to bar the media and to limit
Yeltsin's time with the president, Fitzwater said ``we don't want to
do anything to foster internal conflict that might be associated
with this trip.''
   ``We view him as one of the first elected representatives in the
Soviet Union, an important spokesman for his point of view,''
Fitzwater said about Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin, a critic of Gorbachev, has emerged as the leader of a
small but vocal group of reformers within the newly constituted
Soviet parliament.
   The group, which includes Nobel Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov,
has stopped short of illegally forming a separate party or a
splinter group within the Communist Party but is widely viewed as an
opposition movement.
   ``Perestroika should not have been conducted on such a broad
front. We should have concentrated ourselves on such things as
consumer goods and food,'' Yeltsin said in Baltimore, arguing that
would have improved Soviet life and won greater support.
   Yeltsin told reporters in Baltimore that he approved of the
exodus of thousands of East Germans through Hungary to West Germany,
where they have been granted citizenship.
   ``It should be regulated by international agreements stating that
people have the right to live where they want,'' Yeltsin said.
   He said he was not opposed to unification of Germany, but said it
was not practical now. Leaders of communist East Germany oppose
unification.
   Gorbachev could face an upheaval from below if Soviet life is not
improved within a year, Yeltsin said, repeating past assertions.
   In Washington, Yeltsin also met with nine senators in the office
of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., but failed to appear at a luncheon
where he was to address about 50 people including Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and former national
security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.

   Top administration officials said Tuesday they
would urge President Bush to veto a Democratic plan to expand his
anti-drug fight by $2.2 billion, saying it ``simply throws money at
the problem.''
   Democrats stuck with their proposal, which would beef up
treatment, prevention and law enforcement initiatives, saying it was
a badly needed response to the growing problem of illegal drug use
and drug-related violence.
   Administration officials talked of a possible veto as Bush made a
live televised appeal from the White House to millions of
schoolchildren, urging them to stay away from drugs and telling them
that refusing drugs ``won't make you a nerd.''
   ``I'm asking you to not to look the other way,'' Bush said. ``I'm
asking you to find someone who needs you. And offer to help. I'll
say it again: If you're not in trouble, help someone who is.''
   Democrats said they would finance their proposal with
across-the-board cuts in hundreds of federal programs, and sought to
graft the proposal to an unrelated appropriations bill on the Senate
floor.
   White House officials met privately with Senate Republican
leaders as both sides held closed-door meetings on the latest round
of political maneuvering over the drug issue.
   ``We're going to see how strongly Byrd feels about this and we're
going to ask for negotiations,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas said about the Democratic proposal sponsored by Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Dole's comments followed a one-hour meeting in his Capitol office
attended by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, administration
budget director Richard Darman, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, drug
coordinator William J. Bennett and several top GOP senators.
   Alternatives to Byrd's package, including a $1.8 billion plan
sponsored by a Democrat and a Republican, emerged elsewhere on
Capitol Hill.
   Bennett told a House committee the administration envisioned its
efforts costing $50 billion over five years, while a Senate panel
approved a Pentagon spending bill with more than $1 billion for
anti-drug efforts.
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget distributed a
statement saying that Bush had ``made the tough choices'' when he
unveiled his $7.9 billion anti-drug plan last week. Bush's top drug
advisers will urge the president to veto the Democratic
drug-fighting proposal, OMB said.
   ``The proposed `Emergency Drug' amendment makes no choices,'' the
statement said. ``It throws money at the problem rather than
providing a plan.''
   Democrats held their ground.
   ``We're not waiting for an invasion,'' Byrd said. ``The invasion
has already begun.''
   Byrd, with the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, offered the package as an amendment to a bill providing
$11.9 billion for transportation programs for fiscal 1990, which
begins Oct. 1.
   To raise the money for the drug initiatives, Democrats proposed
slicing 0.575 percent off most defense and domestic programs,
exempting Social Security, Medicare and other benefits.
   But administration officials objected, saying that would result
in a $1.8 billion cut in defense spending ``way out of proportion''
to the cutbacks that domestic programs would suffer.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters there that the
Democratic plan was like taking ``a simple meat ax'' to the Defense
Department's budget and said ``it would create ... havoc.''
   Republicans also objected to the way the Democratic proposal
would distribute its extra funds: 53 percent for law enforcement and
47 percent for treatment and prevention efforts.
   ``That, of course, changes the president's entire drug program,''
said Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   The Democratic plan would increase the federal anti-drug budget
by $3.9 billion above the amount Congress had planned to spend, Byrd
said.
   The new spending would include $1.1 billion for drug and alcohol
treatment, $1 billion for new prisons, $200 million to help state
and local law enforcement agencies, $97 million for the FBI and $100
million for public housing authorities to fight drug problems.
   Bennett's prediction before the House Foreign Affairs Committee
that administration anti-drug efforts would cost $50 billion over
five years was met with objections from several members, who said it
would be unacceptable for the administration to find those funds by
shifting money out of other vital domestic programs.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., told Bennett:
   ``I don't want to see one dime diverted from from essential
domestic purposes that are in fact part of the drug problem. I think
that would be a tragic mistake.''
   Elsewhere:
   _The Senate Appropriations commerce, justice and state
subcommittee approved a measure that would cut defense and many
domestic programs by 0.225 percent and use the $1.8 billion raised
to pay for anti-drug law enforcement programs. The provision,
adopted on a voice vote, was sponsored by subcommittee Chairman
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and the panel's ranking Republican, Warren
Rudman, R-N.H.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Hollings' proposal
would cut $675 million from the Pentagon's budget, an amount
Fitzwater said was tolerable.
   ``We have told Hollings we would reluctantly support his
compromise,'' Fitzwater said.
   _The Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee approved a $279.7
billion military spending bill for next year containing $1.05
billion for drug efforts _ eight times the $132 million Bush had
requested.
   The package includes a transfer of $300 million in cash and
equipment to the Coast Guard, $118 million for existing Defense
Department drug-treatment and education programs, $60 million for
surveillance planes and ships and $40 million for the National Guard.
   _Top administration drug officials and a congressional staff
report said officials ought to focus on developing strategic
information on Colombian cocaine cartels, rather than on immediate
busts and asset seizures, to nail entire organizations.
   ``Long-term cases which produce continuing intelligence data that
can be used to dismantle whole organizations are favored over
buy-bust type cases,'' William Baker, the FBI's assistant director
for intelligence, told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
   To the cartels, Baker said, the arrests of low-level non-critical
cartel employees and the daily seizure of multihundred kilograms of
cocaine ``are merely the costs of doing business.''

<UNK>Investigator Discounts Arrestee as Skyjacker `D.B. Cooper'</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have rejected the theory that
John E. List, accused of killing his family in 1971, is the
mysterious skyjacker ``D.B. Cooper.''
   A man who bought a ticket in the name Dan Cooper parachuted from
a Boeing 727 over southwest Washington state on Thanksgiving eve 15
days after the killings in Westfield, N.J.
   ``Cooper'' commandeered the Northwest Airlines flight by
threatening to detonate a bomb, and took $200,000 ransom for the
passengers and most of the crew. He has never been located and his
body was never found.
   From the time of the hijacking, some investigators have
speculated that List was Cooper, because the men's descriptions are
similar and because of List's disappearance after the New Jersey
killings.
   The story surfaced anew after a man police said was List was
arrested June 1 in Richmond, Va.
   ``There's nothing to indicate to us to that he's D.B. Cooper,''
said Capt. Frank Marranca, head of the homicide squad at the Union
County prosecutor's office. The FBI has reached a similar
conclusion, he said.
   There are a ``couple of other facts that would tend to not put
him as D.B. Cooper,'' said Marranca, who refused to reveal the
evidence, saying it would be relevant to List's trial.
   Jon Eyer, FBI assistant agent in charge in Seattle, said there is
nothing at this point that conclusively points to List being Cooper
or not being Cooper.
   He said the FBI has been investigating ``a whole slew of leads
and circumstances'' in the case, but they're not focusing
necessarily on List and they never were. He's only one of many
possibilities, Eyer said.
   Marranca said investigation showed List had no paratroop
experience in service during World War II and the Korean War,
Marranca said.
   No date has been set for the trial, which could lay the issue to
rest once and for all if prosecutors prove List's whereabouts two
weeks after the killings.
   List's wife, three children and mother were found murdered in
their home in December 1971.
   A man who identified himself as Robert B. Clark was arrested in
Richmond and accused of being List following a tip by the viewer of
a crime recreation television program.

   A divided Senate voted Tuesday to confirm
Donald Gregg as ambassador to South Korea, dismissing claims that
his repeated denials of involvement in the Iran-Contra affair are
``absurd on their face.''
   The vote was 66 to 33. Forty-five Republicans and 21 Democrats
voted for the Gregg nomination while 33 Democrats voted against it.
   Gregg's GOP defenders contended his Democratic foes were using
the nominee in a desperate attempt to attempt revive the Iran-Contra
furor and attack President Bush, who nominated his close associate
for the job.
   But one Democrat, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said he, too, had
concluded Gregg was blameless and would support the nomination out
of ``conscience and conviction.''
   Robb discounted Gregg's links to the Iran-Cntra affair and
mounted a 45-minute, point-by-point defense.
   Shortly before the vote, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
of Maine said he had reached the opposite conclusion because ``the
explanations offered by him are so inconsistent with the known facts
that they cannot be believed.''
   Even if it was proved that Gregg told nothing but the truth, his
nomination should still be rejected because his testimony casts
serious doubt on his judgment, Mitchell said.
   Gregg, a 30-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency who
once was CIA station chief in Seoul, served in Bush's vice
presidential office as his chief foreign policy adviser.
   The Gregg nomination has been pending since early March. In two
sessions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gregg
denied, under oath, allegations he was ever involved in the secret
and illegal effort to resupply the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The sharply divided panel eventually voted 12-7 to recommend the
full Senate confirm the nomination.
   ``Mr. Gregg has clearly not been straight with us,'' said Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., as debate opened in the Senate. ``Few who
have reviewed the record have come away with any confidence in Mr.
Gregg's veracity.''
   Cranston told his colleagues: ``If we were to promote a man we
believed to have misled us under oath, we would invite contempt for
our inquiries; we would encourage frustration of our constitutional
obligations.''
   Cranston has led the attempt to sidetrack or defeat the Gregg
nomination in his position as chairman of the Asian affairs
subcommitee.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., scoffed at Gregg's explanation why
Bush's agenda for two separate meetings as vice president included
the subject of ``Contra Resupply.''
   Gregg testified they were typos and should have read ``Copter
Resupply,'' referring to an issue involving helicopters for the
armed forces in El Salvador.
   ``What does he take the Senate for and what do we take him for?''
Gore asked. ``Are we to seriously accept a bald-faced presentation
of that kind? It's absurd on its face.''
   ``To vote to confirm we have to believe this nominee did not lie
brazenly and repeatedly,'' Gore said. ``It's a little difficult to
swallow.''
   Gregg testified he never informed Bush about a warning he
received about the resupply operation until after he gave an
interview about it to reporters of The New York Times.''
   ``He would have us believe that his boss read about it in the
paper,'' Gore said. ``It appears that he may have been prepared to
preserve deniability for his boss and he was prepared to go to
extraordinary lengths to do so.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the senior GOP member on the
Foreign Relations Committee, called Gregg ``a man of integrity and
honesty'' and said his detractors see in him ``a good way to bash
George Bush.''
   ``I think it is fair to say that Mr. Gregg was masterful in
refuting the major allegations against him,'' Helms said.
   ``Let's get George Bush _ that's what this is all about _ get
George Bush, tear him down,'' Helms said.

<TEXT>
   Unseasonably cool air hovered over the nation's midsection
Tuesday, producing afternoon temperatures as much as 30 degrees
below normal in some areas and dumping up to 8 inches of snow in
Colorado.
   Summer continued in the Southwest, however, with temperatures
rising into the lower 90s.
   Scattered thunderstorms developed from the southern Appalachians
across the central Gulf Coast states to the Texas coast. Florida
also had scattered thunderstorms.
   Thunderstorms over the southern High Plains brought 2.78 inches
of rain to Canyon, Texas, flooding streets and stalling cars
throughout the city. Nickel-sized hail fell in Panhandle, Texas.
   Snow fell in much of the Denver area, with up to an inch in
northern and western sections. Up to 8 inches was reported in the
foothills west of Fort Collins, Colo., and Sidney, Neb., got a
dusting of snow.
   Afternoon temperatures were in the 30s over parts of southwest
Nebraska, northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming. Much of Kansas
had readings in the 40s. The Kansas City, Mo., area was around 50
degrees, about 30 degrees below normal for this time of the year.
   It was warmer west of the Rockies, with Grand Junction, Colo.,
reporting 64 degrees and Gunnison, Colo., 59 degrees.
   Temperatures reached the 70s across the Pacific Northwest and in
the mid to upper 90s over the desert Southwest and in southern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Denver and Cheyenne, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif., as well as Brownsville, Harlingen, Beeville and Kingsville,
Texas.
   The nation's low Tuesday was 13 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the middle and south Atlantic Coast across the
Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast states to the southern Plains; and
rain from Oklahoma across the middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys to
the southern Great Lakes.
   Highs were expected in the 50s and 60s from the central Rockies
across the Great Plains states and the upper Mississippi Valley to
the Great Lakes region; 80s and 90s from the middle and south
Atlantic coastal states across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast
states to most of Texas; 80s and 90s over the Pacific Northwest and
interior valleys of California; near 100 degrees in the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s elsewhere.

   Border officials monitoring entry into
Hungary suggested Tuesday that the flow of refugees to the West had
peaked, saying the number of East German visitors was usual for this
time of year.
   They sought to soft-pedal suggestions that a majority of the more
than 50,000 East Germans reported on vacation in Hungary could join
others who had formally requested to leave for a new life in the
West.
   Maj. Janos Hornyak of the border guards said 6,529 East Germans
had arrived between 6:30 a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   He said that 3,220 East Germans left for home over the same time
via Czechoslovakia, which is sandwiched between Hungary and East
Germany.
   Most entered from Czechoslovakia and the rest from Romania, he
said, adding the figures were normal for this time of year.
   Hungarian radio reported without sourcing later Tuesday that 750
East Germans arrived from Czechoslovakia during the afternoon and
336 left for home.
   Hungarian TV said that since the start of the exodus Monday, 103
East Gemans illegally crossed from Czechoslovakia into Hungary _
presumably to go west over the open borders.
   Only 210 East Germans registered overnight with authorities at a
refugee camp coordinating the exodus westward.
   Some East Germans arriving in Hungary over the last 24 hours were
presumably crossing into Austria on their own, but the low number of
new registrations also indicated that the stream westward was ebbing.
   Hungarian border officials said Tuesday that 16,000 East Germans
crossed into Hungary during the weekend, but said this was not an
unusually high number as Hungary is a popular vacation spot for
nationals of several Soviet bloc countries.
   They stressed that more East Germans _ 26,000 _ left on the
weekend than came to Hungary over the same time, cautioning against
thinking that each East German visitor was a would-be refugee.
   The exodus to West Germany began Sunday midnight after Hungary
defied a 1969 agreement with East Germany, its Warsaw Pact ally, and
opened its borders for thousands who turned their back on their
hard-line communist nation.
   Before that, more than 6,000 fled over relatively open stretches
into Austria after Hungary decided to start clearing its westernmost
border of barbed wire and other barriers in May.
   East Germany fiercely criticized the Hungarian move. It was the
first time a Warsaw Pact country helped citizens of an allied nation
flee to the West.
   The East Berlin leadership on Tuesday formally protested to
Hungary and asked it to stop the exodus.
   Accusing Budapest of direct interference in East Germany's
international affairs, the state ADN news agency said, Hungary was
``responsible for the current situation.''
   Other reports in the state media suggested Hungary was bought off
by West Germany, which grants all East Germans citizenship upon
request. Hungarian government and Communist Party dailies
emphatically denied it.
   Hungarian and East German officials met for weeks trying to agree
on what to do with the refugees, and Hungarian Foreign Minister
Gyula Horn said Sunday the borders were opened after the talks
failed.
   On Tuesday, Horn told Hungarian radio the East German remarks
were offensive.
   As part of major reforms that include free elections planned by
next June, the communist government is drafting laws giving
Hungarian citizens the right to emigrate freely.
   Austrian border officials also suggested that the refugee stream
was ebbing.
   They said more than 8,000 crossed into Austria on their way to
their final destination in the first 24 hours, but only an
additional 2,500 did so between Monday midnight and noon. An
additional 524 crossed during the afternoon, bringing the total to
slightly more than 11,000.
   That exceeded by about 4,000 the number of refugees who
registered to leave at seven holding camps.
   The busiest of the seven Austrian border crossings Tuesday was
Nickelsdorf, about 50 miles south of Vienna.
   Hungary's official MTI news agency said authorities planned to
close the refugee camps, but did not say when. All except one were
already out of operation Tuesday. At a facility in the Buda hills,
240 East Germans arrived overnight and left for Austria on six buses
at noon.
   Speculation arose that East Germany would bar further travel to
Hungary following Hungary's decision. But several new arrivals at
Zugliget camp told reporters they were allowed to leave their
homeland less than 24 hours earlier.
   But one young woman, who refused to give her name, said East
German border soldiers treated some of them roughly before letting
them cross into Czechoslovakia.
   ``They searched through everything,'' she said. ``Some of us had
to undress almost completely. But then we could continue on our
way.''
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath said it was not up to Hungary to
stop East Germans from entering and suggested, without specifically
saying so, that Hungary should not stop them from leaving.
   ``If East Germany allows its citizens to leave the country, we
certainly cannot restrict their movement,'' he told the Hungarian
communist daily Nepszabadsag.

front:

<NOTE>BUSH-SCHOOLCHILDREN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In an address televised to schools, President Bush told students
to refuse drugs and urged them to help others stay away from
narcotics.
   ``Saying `no' won't make you a nerd. It won't make you a loser.
In fact, it will make you more friends than drugs ever will,'' Bush
said.
   Bush added, ``I'm asking you to find someone who needs you. And
offer to help. I'll say it again: If you're not in trouble, help
someone who is.''
   Many students who watched Bush's speech wondered if anything the
president said would make a difference.
   ``I don't think what he said is going to stop it. It needs a lot
more to stop it,'' said 10-year old Amos Dunn, a student at an
inner-city Boston elementary school.

   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., proposed legislation to boost
anti-drug spending to $10.1 billion, $2.2 billion more than Bush's
program.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal
``throws money at the problem rather than providing a plan.''
Administration officials said they would recommend Bush veto the
Democratic plan.
   Democrats said they would raise the extra money for law
enforcement, education, and prevention and treatment programs
through across-the-board cuts in hundreds of federal programs.

   State and municipal officials told the Senate Judiciary Committee
that aid to state and local governments envisioned under Bush's drug
strategy would be a fraction of what already is being spent. Several
expressed dismay at contemplated cuts in existing programs to pay
for the new initiative.
   ``It is inconceivable that we would go out to fight a war with $8
billion to solve a problem that we conservatively estimate at $120
billion,'' said John Gustafson, president of the National
Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.

   Anton Lubowski, the only white to hold a
leadership post in the South-West Africa People's Organization
guerrilla movement, was assassinated Tuesday outside his home in
suburban Windhoek, police said.
   Lt. Kierie du Rand, a police spokesman, said Lubowksi was shot in
the head at about 8:50 p.m. by an assailant who drove away in a red
sedan. Du Rand said an all-out manhunt had been launched.
   Lubowski, 37, was an unofficial spokesman for SWAPO, the Namibian
independence movement that had waged a bush war against South
African rule of the territory since 1966.
   South Africa has agreed to grant independence, expected by early
next year, as part of a regional peace accord also calling for
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Lubowski was also a member of SWAPO's election directorate, which
is overseeing the movement's campaign for U.N.-supervised elections
scheduled for early November. SWAPO is favored to win most votes in
the election, but it needs a two-thirds majority to control the
drafting of a constitution.
   The assassination occurred just two days before the scheduled
homecoming of SWAPO president Sam Nujoma, who has been in exile for
30 years.
   A police officer at the scene said Lubowski was killed by several
shots fired at close range from a Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifle.
   AK-47s were used by SWAPO during the bush war, and could be
obtained through contacts either with the guerrilla movement or with
the security forces, which captured numerous weapons.
   A neighbor said the person who fired the gun got back into a car
carrying at least one other person, but there was no description of
the attackers.
   The South African-appointed administrator of Namibia, Louis
Pienaar, expressed shock at the killing and said the authorities
``will not allow circumstances of anarchy to develop in the run-up
to the election.''
   Pienaar said the assassination was part of a ``spiral of
violence'' that included the fatal stoning of a white police officer
over the weekend by a crowd of blacks.
   Lubowksi studied at Stellenbsch and Cape Town universities, two
of South Africa's best. At one point an officer in the South African
army, Lubowski, a lawyer, joined SWAPO's legal political wing in
1984.
   Although his law practice was in Windhoek, he represented many
anti-apartheid activists in trials in South Africa.
   He recently helped defend 14 blacks convicted of murdering a
black policeman in 1985. They were sentenced to hang under the
doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which held them responsible even
though only one contributed physically to the policeman's death.
   Last week, South Africa's Appeals Court granted the so-called
Upington 14 the right to appeal their death sentences.
   Lubowski was divorced. His two children live with his ex-wife in
South Africa.
   The Namibian-born Lubowski had received numerous death threats
since joining SWAPO, said Gwen McKinney, director of the Namibia
Information Office in Washington.
   She said Lubowski, who had installed an elaborate security system
in his house, died at the scene.

<HEAD>New Season Opens at Royal Opera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Opera House launched its new season
Tuesday night with a revival of Giuseppe Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' in
which U.S. tenor Jerry Hadley sang the role of the licentious Duke
of Mantua.
   The conductor was Sian Edwards, the first woman to conduct at
Covent Garden. She made her debut with the baton there in April 1988.
   The production was staged by Spanish director Nuria Espert.
   The season began 24 hours after Lord Sainsbury, chairman of the
opera house, issued an annual report saying 1988 was a year of
significant achievement, with higher income and attendances, but
predicting a deficit of between $1.5 million and $3.1 million this
year.
   Sainsbury complained the government subsidy, amounting to just
over two-thirds of income, had not kept pace with inflation.
   An early major event of the season is a new production by German
director Goetz Friedrich on Sept. 27 of ``The Valkyrie,'' the second
of Richard Wagner's four-part ``The Ring of the Nibelungen.'' U.S.
bass-baritone James Morris will lead the cast as Wotan.
   Friedrich was summoned in December to take charge of the rest of
the ``Ring'' cycle after differences with Soviet producer Yuri
Lyubimov about the staging of the first part, ``The Rhine Gold.''
   Lyubimov argued at length during rehearsals with the Royal
Opera's Dutch music director, Bernard Haitink, over presentation of
the work.
   The eventual production won the acclaim of most of the audiences
and every seat was sold for the six performances.
   But the backstage argument could not be resolved.
   Friedrich will be developing ``The Ring'' cycle he began in West
Berlin and later adapted for touring in Japan and the United States.
The Royal Opera has changed some scenery and costumnes.
   The third part of the cycle, ``Siegfried,'' will be produced next
year and the fourth part, ``The Twilight of the Gods,'' in 1991,
when the whole cycle will be performed.
   Eight other new productions are scheduled: ``Peter Grimes'' by
Benjamin Britten, ``Medea'' by Luigi Cherubini, ``Idomeneo'' by
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, ```Prince Igor'' by Alexsandr Borodin,
``Elektra'' by Richard Strauss, ``La Cenerentola'' and ``William
Tell'' by Gioacchino Rossini and ``The Cunning Little Vixen'' by
Leos Janacek.

   An American Airlines jetliner's nose gear
collapsed on landing at O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday,
sending the craft skidding off the runway, officials said.
   No one was injured in the crash-landing, according to early
reports, but airport police said one passenger was given
precautionary treatment for a pre-existing medical problem.
   The jetliner was American Airlines Flight 1271, which was bound
for Chicago from Rochester, N.Y., said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein. He said the plane was a
two-engine MD-80 and was carrying 115 passengers and crew members.
   ``The pilot reported hydraulic system problems as he was coming
in on approach,'' Edelstein said. ``He was asked if he wanted
emergency vehicles on standby, and he said `yes.'''
   Edelstein said the nose gear collapsed as the plane touched down
at 5:46 CDT. ``It went off the runway and kept on skidding,'' he
said.
   There was no fire in the crash landing, but the crew deployed the
emergency chutes so passengers could make a quick exit from the
crippled plane, authorities said.
   Officer Mal Gunther of the O'Hare police unit said the one
passenger requiring treatment suffered hyperventilation.
   The MD-80 is a Stage 3 jetliner which is essentially a DC-9
redesigned for noise reduction, Edelstein said.

<HEAD>New Creative Photography Museum Named For Ansel Adams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new museum named for the late photographer
Ansel Adams opens Sunday, and promises to become one of the world's
leading centers for creative photography, supporters said during a
preview Tuesday.
   ``If he were here right now, I think he would be absolutely
elated,'' said Ron Egherman, executive director of the Ansel Adams
Center.
   Adams, whose black-and-white landscapes influenced generations of
photographers and helped elevate the medium to the level of art,
died five years ago.
   ``He would be thrilled, not only at the fact that his long-term
dream of always supporting fine-arts photography was achieved, but
also to have his work shown in contrast to the work of other
artists,'' Egherman said.
   One of the $1 million museum's five galleries will be devoted to
Adams. The other galleries will exhibit works by local
photographers, other contemporary artists, traditional and
historical photographers and ``people who are challenging the
frontiers of what is photography, what is art,'' Egherman said.
   The museum has 6,000 square feet of exhibition space, additional
space for workshops and offices for publishing works by contemporary
photographers, and room for expansion. The Adams Center expects
75,000 to 100,000 visitors its first year, Egherman said.
   The museum is across the street from the Moscone Convention
Center, in an area that is expected to eventually include the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, a visual arts center, a theater and
a cinema arts complex.
   The Adams Center is run by The Friends of Photography, a
10,000-member group started 22 years ago by Adams and other top
photographers.
   The Friends' original museum was in Carmel, but the group,
seeking a larger space and hoping to attract more attention, decided
several years ago to move it to San Francisco, Adams' birthplace.
   Most of the cost of building the Adams Center came from member
donations. A black-tie fund raiser Friday will be attended by Adams'
widow, Virginia, historian-photographer Beaumont Newhall and other
leading photographers.
   Newhall, former curator of photography at New York's Museum of
Modern Art and a founding member of the Friends, said the Adams
Center should soon become a leading center for photography, along
with the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., and New York's
International Center of Photography.
   Newhall said the Adams Center also will add to the growing
acceptance of photography as an art form.
   ``There is a minority who won't accept photography as an art
form, but there's been a great acceptance by curators and the
public,'' he said. ``This center will only increase that perception.
It's a tremendous memorial to a man who meant so much to us, and a
great new center for photography.''

   The Bush administration plans to propose to
Congress that the United States next year accept 50,000 Soviet
refugees plus 6,500 more from Eastern Europe, a U.S. official and
sources in the American Jewish community said Tuesday.
   Worldwide, 125,000 refugees would be admitted, an increase of
slightly less than 8 percent from this year.
   The 50,000 Soviet refugees, at least half of whom are expected to
be Jews, are a fraction of the 250,000 Soviet citizens the State
Department estimated last week would apply for entry to the United
States in 1990.
   Of the 50,000, the sources said, 40,000 would have their
transportation and settlement costs paid by the United States. The
10,000 others would have to depend on private organizations, friends
and relatives.
   This year's combined quota for refugees from the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe is 50,000. The new plan would allocate 50,000 slots
to the Soviet Union and set up a separate category of 6,500 for
Eastern Europe.
   Last year, as emigration from the Soviet Union began to climb,
the combined quota for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was
15,000.
   Jewel S. Lafontant, the State Department's refugee affairs
coordinator, is scheduled to testify to a House Judiciary
subcommittee Wednesday about the administration proposal.
   An estimated 40,000 Soviet Jews are expected to leave the Soviet
Union this year. Currently there is a backlog of an estimated 30,000
to 40,000 Jews with exit permits for Israel who have not left the
Soviet Union or are in Vienna and Rome, seeking entry to the United
States.
   Most Soviet Jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in
Israel. All but a fraction, however, then apply for admission to the
United States once they have left their country.
   According to the Jewish sources, who demanded anonymity, the Bush
administration will also drastically revise its processing
procedures. Tentatively, refugees who apply before Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 1990 fiscal year, will be processed in Rome and
Vienna.
   Thereafter, applications will be handled by a beefed-up U.S.
Embassy staff in Moscow and by a new office to be set up outside
Washington.
   The U.S. official, who also asked not to be named, said that the
Oct. 1 cutoff date was very likely but that it might be set back a
few months.
   While the Soviets seeking admission remain in their country,
their applications would be considered both in Moscow and in the
Washington area office.
   Israel has expressed concern that Jewish refugees from the Soviet
Union were increasingly choosing to head for the United States once
out of their homeland, depriving the Jewish state of needed settlers.
   It was not clear whether the change in U.S. procedure would
increase the flow of refugees to Israel.
   The rising exodus from the Soviet Union, which results from U.S.
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, poses administrative and financial problems for the Bush
administration.
   Eager to reinforce the right of Soviet citizens to travel freely,
U.S. officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open.
But beyond the 50,000 slots allotted for the Soviet Union,
prospective Jewish emigres will be encouraged to apply for parole
status. This requires private support for the immigrants.
   Also, the sources said, in admitting 50,000 refugees from the
Soviet Union preference will be given to those with close relatives
here. But no applicant will be declared ineligble on the grounds he
has no relative here, the officials said.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who heads the House subcommittee on
immigration, said as hearings opened that the administration's
proposal provides financing for 84,000 of the 125,000 refugees
overall.
   ``Where do we get the money for the rest?'' he asked a panel of
private witnesses.
   Morrison also expressed concern about the backlog of emigres in
Rome and Vienna awaiting U.S. decisions on their eligibility to
enter the United States. He said the administration had wasted money
through this processing method and changes would have to be
considered.

   Thirty students were killed and another 25 injured
when a wall collapsed while the youths were watching a show outside
their middle school in China's coastal Fujian province, the official
Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday.
   The news agency said the disaster occurred Sunday evening at the
No. 1 Middle School in Liancheng County, where about 4,000 people
had gathered for activities marking the 75th anniversary of the
school.
   It said the 65-foot-long structure collapsed, crushing those
below, when people climbed on top of it for a better view of the
show.
   In China, middle school students are aged 12 to 18.
   Premier Li Peng sent a message of condolence to families of the
victims, Xinhua said.

   Jurors watched videos Tuesday showing the
opulent lifestyle of PTL founder Jim Bakker, including a
4,000-square-foot suite in a hotel at the PTL ministry's Heritage
USA theme park and retreat.
   The video tour was conducted by James Taggart, Bakker's former
interior decorator, who was sentenced to 17 years in prison and
fined $500,000 last week for tax evasion while at PTL. Taggart said
the suite could be divided into three smaller suites for the Bakkers
and their two children.
   The presidential suite in the Heritage Grand Hotel at Heritage
USA, outside Charlotte at Fort Mill, S.C., was used occasionally by
the Bakkers, who also had a five-level parsonage at nearby Lake
Wylie.
   Reporters could not see the video screen as Taggart described
gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures, antique beds and mirrored walls
in the bedroom. He said the suite included a 10-by-60-foot closet
for Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye.
   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.
Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance a lavish lifestyle.
   Taggart and his brother David were convicted of evading $525,000
in income taxes on money they received from PTL. Prosecutors have
indicated they might support a reduction in the Taggarts' sentences
in exchange for testimony against Bakker.
   Under cross-examination by defense lawyer Harold Bender, Taggart
testified that other celebrities also used the presidential suite,
but they had to be cleared through Bakker's office.
   A former PTL attorney, John Yorke, said he sent a memo to his law
firm boss, former Charlotte mayor Eddie Knox, citing concerns about
1983 wages earned by the Bakkers.
   ``Together, Jim and Tammy have a monthly income of more than
$30,000,'' he said. ``Jim has already received one bonus this year
totaling $390,000. He could possibly earn more than $1 million this
year.''
   Yorke testified that he warned Bakker about legal problems he saw
at PTL, including risking PTL's tax-exempt status because of high
salaries, nepotism and a lack of legal advice at PTL board meetings.
   Yorke also described Bakker's reaction to bad news. ``Jim didn't
like to hear bad news. On several occasions when Eddie (Knox) got
stern with him, he turned around and wouldn't look at him.''
   Miller asked how long Bakker would refuse to look at Knox, Yorke
said, ``Until he left.'' Yorke's firm was replaced as PTL attorneys
in 1986.
   Guy Forcucci, a certified public accountant who worked for PTL in
the early 1980s and prepared Bakker's individual income tax returns,
testified he had warned Bakker as early as 1982 about his high
salary.
   Bakker's 1982 tax return showed he earned $290,000, Forcucci
testified. He said he warned Bakker the following year, after the
PTL leader's salary rose to $461,000.
   PTL's tax-exempt status ultimately was revoked following Bakker's
resignation in March 1987.
   In other testimony, Thomas Trask, treasurer of the Assemblies of
God of Springfield, Mo., testified that Bakker had nearly $794,000
in the denomination's retirement account on May 6, 1987. Bakker is
barred from making further contributions because he has been
defrocked by the church.
   Michael Dixon, a Franklin, Tenn., music agent for the Bakkers'
daughter, Tammy Sue, testified he was paid more than $96,000 by PTL
to devise a marketing scheme for Tammy Sue's recordings. Testimony
showed Bakker purchased more than $600,000 worth of music equipment
for his home.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter lectured Bakker for not
reporting to his probation officer Monday for a weekly report on
medication he is taking. Bakker's lawyer, Harold Bender, went to the
probation office instead and apologized in court.
   Prosecutors continued their practice of this week of
interspersing testimony about the Bakker's lifestyle with testimony
from people who sent them money. Prosecutors contend that Bakker
took money sent by his followers _ called partners if they gave
$1,000 _ and didn't use it to construct hotel rooms he promised in
broadcasts and in mailings. Partners were told they could stay free
in a PTL hotel once a year.
   Sarah Combs of Spanishburg, W.Va., said she and her husband, a
disabled coal miner, lived on $400 a month. But they decided to use
$1,000 out of $19,000 her husband received for medical compensation
for black lung disease, caused by breathing coal dust, for a
partnership in the Heritage Grand Hotel.
   But she was never able to stay there, despite repeated attempts,
she said.
   ``Every time I called, I would talk to someone else and they
would give me a different reason why there wasn't any room,'' she
said.
   In testimony Monday, Taggart said Bakker joked about his finances
for expensive trips, telling those with him to ``thank the PTL
partners.''

   Gamblers and dreamers watched the bucks pile
up and the clock tick Tuesday while the jackpot for Wednesday
night's California lottery drawing crept closer to a North American
record.
   Customers lined up at liquor stores, truck stops and neighborhood
markets throughout the state and lotery officials jacked up their
estimate of the Lotto 6-49 jackpot to $53 million.
   That's still shy of the all-time California record of $61.98
million, which was set by the Lotto 6-49 game Oct. 29, 1988, with
the jackpot was split among three winning tickets.
   Pennsylvania claims the North American record payoff with a
$115.5 million jackpot in April 1989. The prize was split among 14
winning tickets.
   The Lotto 6-49 game sold exactly 1,064,388 tickets, at $1 each,
between 11 a.m. and noon Tuesday. ``And that's not even our busiest
time of the day, by any means,'' said Lottery spokeswoman Joanne
McNabb.
   By 3 p.m., sales were $7.4 million, Ms. McNabb said.
   Lotto officials and 7,900 retailers across the state braced for
the evening rush as Californians motored home from work.
   The jackpot in the twice-weekly game has gone unclaimed since
Aug. 26. Monday's sales reached $8.2 million, more than six times
the usual Monday sales _ but again short of the one-day record of
$31.5 million, set the day of the October 1988 drawing.
   Even with the odds of winning at one in 14 million, the chance
for instant megabucks attracted people who don't usually play the
game, and some out-of-staters.
   ``More people who normally don't play do play when the jackpot's
big,'' said Ms. McNabb, noting that regular players account for more
than half of ticket sales in non-rollover weeks.
   Ed Gentalen, an architect from Fullerton, Calif., filled out
tickets with two friends at Lee's Liquors in downtown Los Angeles.
   ``I hardly ever play this,'' he said as they worked on 30
tickets. ``But 50 million dollars is getting me into it.'' He
described his chances as ``about one in a zillion.''
   About 150 hopefuls jammed the Wills Fargo Country Store in Baker,
a town on Interstate 15 about 45 miles from the Nevada border.
   ``Oh yeah, everybody's going for that big dream,'' said manager
Steve Zwerner. ``It's packed. They're going down one aisle, back up
another aisle and across another,'' he said.
   Most who came to Wills Fargo, one of the biggest Lotto ticket
sellers in the state, were from Nevada, Zwerner said. On Tuesday,
they began waiting at 5 a.m., an hour before sales began.
   ``Many of them just came, bought their tickets and got back to
Vegas,'' he said.
   Lotto officials have extended sales by an hour nightly, to 11
p.m. Sales will end at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, exactly 13 minutes
before seven numbered balls will drop into a slot, determining the
winner or winners, if any.
   The winner or winners will enjoy their earnings in 20 annual
installments.

   A jury was chosen Tuesday in the
cocaine conspiracy trial of five Americans accused of helping
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas create one of the first
large-scale smuggling rings.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II scheduled opening arguments
for Wednesday morning.
   The panel was selected late Tuesday afternoon following two days
of questioning prospective jurors about what they of Lehder's trial,
which spanned nearly eight months in 1987 and 1988.
   The five charged are accused of working with Lehder and others
from 1974 through 1989 in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Three
of the men also face importation charges.
   Lehder, 40, who prosecutors said was an architect of the Medellin
cartel, was extradited from Colombia in 1987. He was convicted in
May 1988 of smuggling more than 20 tons of cocaine into the United
States during the late 1970s and early 1980s and sentenced to life
in prison without parole.
   The Medellin cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is
based, is considered the world's largest illegal cocaine operation
and is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States.
   Many of the best-known leaders of Colombian cocaine cartels were
indicted in this case, dubbed ``Son of Lehder'' by prosecutors, but
remain at large.
   On trial are Jack Carlton Reed, 58, who was convicted with Lehder
on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in prison; Thomas
Howard Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.; attorney and pilot
Barry Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale; Donald
Kenneth Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif., and Samuel Thomas Stewart, 53,
of Anaheim, Calif.
   Their indictment alledges a series of specific acts: prosecutors
say Reed often acted as an intermediary between Lehder and a corps
of Americans he had working as pilots and distributors; Kane, an
attorney and pilot, is accused of flying cocaine from Cartel kingpin
Pablo Escobar's ranches in Colombia to the United States in 1977.
   Herington is accused of hauling cocaine from Florida to
California in a rented Lear jet, Stewart is accused of helping
Lehder acquire an aircraft and of flying to Colombia to pick up
cocaine, and Lady is accused of delivering money to be used to build
an underground cocaine storage facility on the Nevada-Arizona border
and of leasing ranches in Mexico as cocaine waystations on flights
from Colombia to Arizona.
   Others indicted in the same case but not in custody for trial
include cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez
Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez. They are on the
list of the government's most-wanted Colombian drug kingpins and
have remained at large despite a crackdown on the traffickers in
Colombia.
   Also indicted but not in custody were are financier Robert Vesco,
who lives in Cuba, and Everette Bannister, an associate of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. U.S. officials have
unsuccessfully sought Bannister's extradition.
   Reed is charged with conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or
more of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
Herington is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute five
kilograms or more of cocaine.
   Kane, Lady and Stewart also face the conspiracy count and an
additional charge of conspiracy to import cocaine into the United
States.
   If convicted, they could get sentences ranging from 10 years to
life.

<HEAD>Army Chief Cautions Against Excess Force, Peres Seeks Cabinet Decision</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with army chief of staff cautioning
against violence by troops, details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The army chief of staff sent a letter to the
soldiers in the occupied territories cautioning against the use of
excess force when suppressing riots or arresting Palestinians, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the
left-leaning Labor Party, said he would demand a Cabinet decision on
Egypt's Middle East peace proposal if Palestinians accept the plan.
   The army gave excerpts from the letter from Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron
to the Itim news agency. The army spokesman said the letter was sent
in the last few days.
   Shomron warned soldiers not to use brutality or to take
unreasonable measures. He gave specific examples such as beating
prisoners in army custody or disrupting ambulances that are
evacuating wounded.
   ``Violence may not be used after a mission has concluded, for
example, or after a demonstration has been dispersed, or after a man
is already in our hands and there is no resistance,'' Shomron wrote.
``In any incident, the passage of ambulances and medical services
must not be prevented.''
   Israel radio said the Justice Ministry recommended that Shomron
send the letter after four soldiers were convicted of brutally
beating an Arab and contributing to his death.
   Shomron said soldiers may use force to disperse violent
demonstrations and to make arrests, ``according to army orders and
the law, from which there can be no deviations.''
   ``In all instances where force is used, one must be strict and
use reasonable force,'' he wrote.
   Meanwhile, officials of Peres' Labor Party intended to bring up
the Egyptian plan for discussion at a meeting Wednesday of the
12-member inner Cabinet, Israel's army radio reported.
   Such a move was likely to increase divisions in the coalition
government over Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan, which
calls for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip of
Palestinian representatives for talks with Israel.
   The 10-point plan proposed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
includes Israeli acceptance of the U.S.-backed concept of trading
land for peace. It also calls for allowing the 140,000 Arabs in
annexed east Jerusalem to vote.
   Those points are acceptable to Labor but not to Likud. The
Israeli proposal worked out by the two parties deliberately leaves
these issues open.
   Shamir, leader of the rightist Likud bloc, has refused to discuss
Mubarak's proposals.
   Peres, speaking on Israel army radio, said he supports most of
Mubarak's plan.
   Peres was asked about Shamir's refusal to discuss the proposals
and replied: ``If it becomes clear that a Palestinian delegation is
ready to come equipped with the 10 points as their position ... the
way to decide is a government meeting. Government discussions are
not somebody's monopoly. If we demand, there is going to be a
meeting.''
   In the occupied territories Tuesday, soldiers shot and wounded 12
Palestinians during clashes with stone-throwing youths, Arab
hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed one injury, saying soldiers shot a teen-ager
in the head when they were met with a hail of stones in the West
Bank village of Sabastiya. Hospital officials said the victim was in
serious condition.
   During the 21-month-old uprising, 567 Palestinians have been
killed in clashes with the army and Israeli civilians. Forty
Israelis also have been slain in the violence.
   The army meanwhile was reported planning a new system of
color-coded identity cards to increase control over Palestinians in
the West Bank. Officials of the military government refused to
confirm or deny the report.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot said the cards would have different
colors or markings to show from which areas residents came and
whether they were suspected of security offenss or crimes.

   An angry Gov. George Sinner took federal
officials on a tour of the Missouri River's largest reservoir
Tuesday, hoping to persuade them to limit the amount of water
released to aid navigation downstream.
   Lake Sakakawea, which pumps $40 million into the North Dakota
economy through tourism, is at historic lows after two
drought-ridden summers and skimpy snow runoff upstream, state and
federal officials say.
   Two planeloads of officials, including Sinner, an assistant Army
secretary and the commander of the Army Corps of Engineers Missouri
River division, toured the giant lake, which has fallen 20 feet
below its normal level for this time of year.
   A public forum was scheduled for early evening.
   The Corps, which has broad authority over water projects, has
been releasing water from Lake Sakakawea and other reservoirs to
keep the Missouri deep enough for boats and barges to navigate in
states downstream. Commercial river traffic is negligible in North
Dakota.
   ``I don't think anything has angered me as much as this
project,'' Sinner said earlier. ``I am literally at my wit's end,
and so are a lot of other people. We have become the fall guys for
the downstream states.''
   Sinner and South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson are pressing for a
change in Corps policy that would emphasize the recreational
benefits of the Missouri system over its navigation _ a change the
Corps says will be difficult to accomplish.
   ``Everybody that's impacted would have to become a party to
agreeing upon such a change,'' said Duane Sveum, chief of the Corps'
Reservoir control center in Omaha, Neb.
   Many businesses, including four big resorts, have grown up around
Lake Sakakawea, which is 178 miles long and has 1,300 miles of
recreational shoreline.
   But the receding lake has left less than half of the lake's 39
boat ramps in the water, and publicity about the situation has
scared away tourists, state officials say.
   The lake's elevation was measured Tuesday at 1,823 feet above sea
level. Corps statistics dating back to 1967 show an average
elevation of 1,843.1 feet at September's end, said Larry Murphy, an
engineer in the Corps' reservoir control center in Omaha, Neb.
   Murphy said the lake had 14.1 million acre-feet of stored water
Tuesday, compared to a record September low of 14.8 million
acre-feet recorded last year.
   Tracy Potter, assistant tourism director for the state Economic
Development Commission, said Lake Sakakawea's elevation needed to be
at 1,830 feet ``to keep everybody in the water and happy.''
   But Sveum said the lake was expected to drop as much as six
additional feet by February.
   A resort owner on the lake's southern Little Missouri arm, Mark
Slater, called on Sinner to declare the region a disaster area, even
though Sinner said that suggestion was impractical.
   Slater closed his own resort Aug. 15, six weeks earlier than
normal, at an estimated loss of $100,000 in revenue.
   ``Since we are selling the lake, it's hard to sell a lake when
you don't have any water,'' he said.

   Two people accused of
organizing a boat voyage of illegal emigrants bound for Puerto Rico
that killed at least 12 passengers were arrested on murder charges
Tuesday, the Dominican navy said.
   The navy said the two, whose identities were not disclosed,
charged their 70 passengers a total of $20,000 for the crossing.
   The 25-foot motorboat capsized in the Mona Passage on Sept. 5
soon after leaving Higuey on the Dominican Republic's east coast,
and the navy said 12 people were known dead, nine survivors were

   Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano,
erupted before dawn Tuesday, spewing lava and illuminating the sky
but causing no damage.
   Rescue authorities said Tuesday there was no immediate danger to
inhabited areas because the lava had not flowed below 8,500 feet,
about 2,400 feet down the peak of the famed mountain. Lava, however,
cut off a road used by guides to reach the upper slopes.
   ``It's spectacular, a lot of molten ash has poured out,'' said
Salvo Pennisi of the newspaper La Sicilia.
   Etna was shaken by tremors during the weekend and the eruption
began Monday in a crater near the top of the southeastern slope,
said Renato Cristofolini, an expert monitoring the volcanic activity.
   Mountain guides reported the lava flow appeared to have stopped
at midday Tuesday although the mountain continued to rumble and
white smoke poured from the crater.

   The National Security Council has taken
secret measures to stop violence in Medellin, and the government
released two suspected drug traffickers because of lack of evidence,
officials said today.
   Judge Sostenes Zabarain D'Arce of the Public Order Court in
Barranquilla said by telophone that he had no legal reasons for
keeping Bernardo Londono Quintero, 47, and Alberto Orlandez Gamboa,
37, in jail.
   ``There was nothing solid against them _ not in Colombia and not
from the United States,'' the judge said.
   Londono and Orlandez were among hundreds of people seized during
a massive anti-narcotics sweep that began last month. During the
weekend, Colombia's National Drugs Council said the two were being
held for extradition to the United States.
   However, the judge said one suspect was freed Aug. 31 and another
on Sept. 4. The reason for the discrepancy was unclear, and justice
ministry and president's office officials said they were unaware of
the releases.
   U.S. Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Monday there
was ``no evidence indicating U.S. criminal charges'' against Londono
and Orlandez.
   Meanwhile, the government's National Security Council took
undisclosed measures to stem violence in Medellin, home of the
cartels believed to supply most of the cocaine to the United States.
   The governor's office in Antioquia or state, of which Medellin is
the capital, said the council Monday night extended anti-terrorism
measures to the entire state. But a spokesman, who declined to be
named, said the measures were secret ``for obvious security
reasons.''
   ``We are in total anguish over events in Medellin,'' Helena
Herran de Montoya, the governor of Antioquia said before the meeting.
   Officials fear the crackdown launched against the cocaine cartels
by President Virgilio Barco three weeks ago is turning Medellin into
a war zone.
   Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez, a popular former mayor of Medellin, was
shot and killed Monday when five or six attackers opened fire as he
was driven to work.
   His driver also was killed and a bodyguard wounded. The killers
fled, police said.
   Pelaez was mayor from 1984 through 1986 and founded a local
movement called ``Love for Medellin,'' designed to rid the city of
drug traffickers.
   Near Medellin, attackers on Monday set fire to a farm owned by
the head of the government oil company. A similar attack Sunday
targeted the ranch of a government official who supports turning
over drug traffickers' property to the poor.
   ``The traffickers warned us: government officials,
industrialists, businessmen, journalists, their families and homes
would suffer the consequences of the government's drug war,'' said
Carlos Ossa Escobar, whose ranch was set on fire Sunday by hooded
assailants.
   ``But we have to stand by the president,'' he said in a
television interview.
   About 4,000 soldiers and police already patrol Medellin, where an
11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew has been in force for two weeks.
   Hundreds have been injured and more than 20 killed as terrorists
retaliate for the crackdown, launched on Aug. 18 when narcotics
gangs killed Sen. Luis Carlos Galan and the police chief of
Medellin. Galan was the leading presidential candidate and an avowed
anti-drug crusader.
   In Vienna, Austria, a U.S. drug enforcement officer hailed
Colombia for its offensive against the Medellin cartel. John C. Lawn
was speaking with colleagues from nearly 100 countries, gathered at
a United Nations conference on anti-drug measures.
   ``The worldwide epidemic of drugs is a war that cannot be won
independent of one another. It requires that we work together,''
Lawn told the conference today. ``The United States applauds the
recent actions taken by the government of Colombia.''
   In an opening speech Monday, Margaret J. Anstee, director general
of the U.N. Office in Vienna, said: ``If Colombia were to lose this
war, we should all be lost,'' she told the conference.''
   Colombia was to be represented at the meeting by a delegation
headed by Miguel A. Gomez Padilla, director general of national
police, but conference sources said the Colombian officials have
failed to show up.
   In Colombia, Justice Minister Monica de Greiff returned from
Washington on Sunday night after meetings with Bush Administration
officials. She met Monday with President Barco, her office said.
   Mrs. de Greiff, whose office handles extraditions, has been
threatened with death by cartel bosses and Monday was flanked by
bodyguards. She eluded journalists by entering and exiting the
ministry through back doors.
   In Atlanta, Eduardo Martinez Romero, the first reputed cartel
member extradited to the United States in more than two years,
pleaded innocent to money laundering charges.
   The government reportedly has signed the extradition orders for
three other alleged traffickers, who are in Colombian jails.
   In Washington, Chief U.S. Justice Department spokesman David
Runkel said the United States wants the extradition of Ana Rodriguez
de Tamayo, 37, who was indicted in Miami in 1983 on federal cocaine
charges.
   A government official said on condition of anonymity that de
Tamayo, Bernardo Londono Quintana and Alberto Orlando Gamboa would
be extradited.
   The three are not, however, in the top echelons of the drug
cartels. The top drug traffickers wanted in the United States remain
at large.

   The military said 66 soldiers died in
clashes with UNITA rebels in the last week, with most of the
fighting in central and south Angola.
   An armed forces statement, released Tuesday in Luanda, said
government forces killed 51 rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola _ who attacked the town of Mungo in
central Huambo province.
   It gave no exact date for last week's ``large-scale'' attack but
said eight soldiers were killed and 19 wounded.
   On Sept. 7, government troops also clashed with UNITA 19 miles
southwest of Umpulu in central Bie province, killing seven rebels
and capturing weapons and ammunition, the statement said.
   Military sources said recent rebel attacks were mainly
concentrated in central provinces and southern Huila and Cunene,
where the United Nations Development Program is operating an
economic recovery project.
   But the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that
government troops reinforced their positions in northern provinces
bordering Zaire over the past week.
   The Western-backed rebels have fought to force the
Cuban-supported government to share power since shortly after Angola
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<TEXT>
   Authorities canceled the union contract of
3,000 mineworkers left without jobs after Mexico's largest copper
company went into bankruptcy last month, the government newspaper El
National said Tuesday.
   The former employees of the Cananea Mining Co., 30 miles south of
the Arizona border, will be eligible for severance pay under
national labor laws, the federal labor arbitration board decreed.
That will amount to one-sixth of what they would have received under
liquidation terms of their labor contract.
   Soldiers forced workers from the mine on Aug. 20 after Cananea _
90 percent government-owned _ declared bankruptcy during contract
negotiations.
   Mineworkers appealed the bankruptcy to the arbitration board.
   Cananea is considered the birthplace of trade unionism in Mexico.
The army crushed a labor movement at the mine in 1906. Four years
later, miners rose to the leadership of the Mexican Revolution.
   The bankruptcy administrator, Financiera Nacional Azucarera,
announced the board's decision in a news release, El National said.
   About 1,000 non-union workers will be eligible for severance pay
at the same rate as union members, the administrator said.
   On Monday, President Salinas de Gortari's pledged in a speech to
the Mexican Labor Federation that workers will be allowed to become
part-owners of the mine and mill, which account for 45 percent of
Mexico's copper output.
   He also promised that the mine will not be sold to foreign
investors.
   The government has been trying to sell the copper company as part
of its plan to return nationalized industries to the private sector.
   The mine is expected to be ready to reopen within two months,
when bankruptcy administrators settle accounts, authorities say.
   Local union leaders fear hundreds of members will be refused
employment and will lose rights they established in their contract,
now void.

   The government on Tuesday beefed up
Colombia's embattled cocaine regions with hundreds of security
forces and said it might appoint military advisers to help mayors of
cities convulsed by violence.
   Also Tuesday, the former mayor of Medellin, Pablo Pelaez
Gonzalez, was buried after a tearful funeral and Mass at City Hall.
Pelaez, 45, was gunned down Monday by gangs believed backed by the
drug cartels.
   Gen. Oscar Botero Estrepo, the minister of defense, said 450
police and hundreds of soldiers were sent to Antioquia state, where
the Medellin drug cartel has waged a war against the government for
its anti-drug crackdown.
   ``The army is paying great attention to the area, especially
Medellin,'' the minister told reporters Tuesday evening.
   More than 4,000 security forces from the army and police have
been patrolling the region since President Virgilio Barco three
weeks ago began confiscating the properties of drug traffickers and
arresting members of the violent cartels.
   Botero said the government is studying measures to send military
advisers to cities terrorized by daily bombings, shootings and arson.
   A judge said Tuesday two suspected drug traffickers the
government earlier said might be extradited to the United States
were released because there was no evidence they were involved in
drug trafficking.
   Judge Sostenes Zabarain D'Arce of the Public Order Court in
Barranquilla, on Colombia's Caribbean coast, said by phone he had no
further reason to hold Bernardo Londono Quintero, 47, or Alberto
Orlandez Gamboa, 37.
   ``There was nothing solid against them _ not in Colombia and not
from the United States,'' the judge said.
   Over the weekend Colombia's National Drugs Council said the two
were being held for extradition to the United States, seemingly to
follow Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was flown last week to Atlanta
to face trial in the United States in connection with drug
money-laundering charges.
   However, the magistrate said he released Orlandez on Aug. 31 and
Londono on Sept. 4.
   The reason for the discrepancy was unclear, and Justice Ministry
and president's office officials said they were unaware of the
releases, which came to light after a Bogota newspaper article
Tuesday.
   Zabarain D'Arce said local authorities failed to press charges
against Londono or Orlandez after the eight-day holding period
permitted in Colombia under special anti-drug emergency measures
decreed last month by Barco.
   U.S. Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Monday there
was ``no evidence indicating U.S. criminal charges'' against the two.
   Still in custody and possibly facing U.S. extradition, according
to the government, was Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 37, indicted on
federal drug charges in 1983 in Florida.
   The governor's office in Antioquia state, of which Medellin is
the capital, said Tuesday the National Security Council, meeting
behind closed doors Monday night, had extended anti-terrorism
measures.
   But a spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the measures
were secret. Medellin and surrounding suburbs are under an 11 p.m.-5
a.m. curfew, with army and police patrols able to enter buildings
and search people at will.
   Meanwhile, more than 400 mourners crammed Medellin's City Hall on
Tuesday to view the flag-draped coffin of Gonzalez, an anti-drug
crusader assassinated on the streets of the cocaine-producing center.
   His assassination came amid an almost daily series of bombings,
shootings and arson by drug traffickers since Barco announced an
unprecedented crackdown on drugs Aug. 18.
   At the funeral, the crowds watched as Pelaez's widow and daughter
placed a cross on the body before the casket _ draped in a green and
white Antioquia state flag _ was closed.
   A military helicopter and armed soldiers in trucks followed the
funeral procession to the burial. Mourners waving white
handkerchiefs lined the streets to the Campos de Paz cemetery.
   Pelaez, mayor of Medellin from 1984-86, had formed a civic group
that urged tough action on drugs and crime in the northwestern city
of 2 million, the headquarters of a cocaine cartel believed
responsible for much of the cocaine entering the United States.

   President Bush planted a kiss on the cheek of
the first Cuban-American congresswoman Tuesday night and said her
recent election is just another sign that Hispanic Americans ``have
made it into the mainstream.''
   ``I am so proud of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her victory down there
in Florida,'' Bush told nearly 1,000 people who filled a hotel
ballroom for the National Hispanic Heritage Presidential Tribute.
   He said the new Republican congresswoman from Miami, elected Aug.
29 to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Claude Pepper,
``is going to be a tiger. She is going to be a force to be reckoned
with on Capitol Hill, and boy, do we need her up there for good
common sense.''
   Bush added that he views her election ``as just one more
indication of the fact that Hispanic Americans have made it into the
mainstream, and that more and more are choosing the Republican
Party.''
   Her campaign was run by Bush's son, Jeb, whose Mexican-American
wife, Columba, was also honored at the dinner.
   Bush said Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who
emceed the event, ``is driving the Democrat Party right up a wall
the way he is reaching out and bringing people in, opening doors
that have been regrettably closed.
   ``What he's trying to do ... is build it on mainstream values,
and I want all Hispanic Americans to know that they have a home in
the Republican Party,'' said the president.
   Bush himself was credited with helping create during his own days
as GOP chairman in the early 1970s the Republican National Hispanic
Assembly.

<HEAD>Sheriff Says Overcrowding Not Cause of ``Jail Disease''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Overcrowding at the Harris County jail is not to
blame for a mysterious, flu-like bacterial infection that has killed
two inmates and sickened at least 35, the sheriff testified Tuesday.
   Medical experts have said the illnesses have ``not been caused by
overcrowding in the jail,'' Ssheriff Johnny sKlevenhagen told U.S.
District Judge James DeAnda in opposing a lawsuit attempting to free
as many as 500 misdemeanor prisoners.
   The jail, designed for 4,200 inmates, currently holds 8,300.
Tuesday's hearing was on a motion by attorney James Oitzinger, who
represents inmates in a continuing lawsuit against crowding at the
jail.
   Oitzinger sought the mass release on grounds that crowding may
have contributed to the outbreak of infections by the pneumococcus
bacteria. He also asked the judge to isolate those at risk of
contracting the infection.
   Jail officials say they have yet to identify a common source for
the bacteria.
   Two doctors from the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta toured the jail Monday with other health officials, but have
yet to comment on their findings.
   Late last week, the bacterial infection killed inmates Ricky
LaBreck, 30, and Rene Antonio Fuentes, 21. Both had previously had
their spleens removed for reasons unrelated to the outbreak, and
doctors said that left them more susceptible to the infection.
   Eighteen more inmates since have been admitted to Ben Taub
Hospital, and the pneumococcus bacteria has been found in five of
them, hospital spokeswoman Nora Shire said Tuesday.
   The others have various flu-like symptoms that may be early signs
of the infection, she said. They also may be sick with the flu or
some other type of mild infection.
   In addition 20 to 30 were being evaluated at the jail infirmary
for flu-like symptoms, said Mark Canfield, chief of epidemiology
with the Harris County Health Department.
   ``We're taking blood to test for various types of viruses for
weakening the immune symptoms,'' Canfield said at an afternoon news
conference. He said there is little data on a vaccine for
pneuococcal disease, but officials are looking into the availability
and use of the vaccine.
   Klevenhagen said medical staff members at the jail were
continuing to screen about 3,200 inmates who said their medical
histories include ailments, like immune system problems, that make
them more susceptible to the infection.
   Although no specific measures were ordered by health authorities,
jail officials voluntarily canceled religious services, recreational
activities and classes Monday.

<HEAD>Judge Decreases Awards to French Oyster Growers From 1978 Oil Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A retired federal judge has decreased the amount
of damages recommended for French oyster growers who lost shellfish
in the 1978 oil spill from the supertanker Amoco Cadiz, attorneys
said Tuesday.
   The adjustment in damages by former U.S. District Court Judge
Frank McGarr may hasten a final judgement in the case and pave the
way for appeals, said New York attorney Barry Kingham, who
represents the oyster growers and other plaintiffs along France's
Brittany coast.
   Denver attorney Frank Cicero, who represents Amoco Corp., the
defendant, said McGarr's action would cut about $11 million, plus
interest, from the total recommended damages, which he now estimated
at $100 million.
   Cicero said McGarr, at Amoco's request, re-examined the testimony
of a shellfish expert and determined that the expert failed to
include include the fact that the French government had already
awarded substantial compensation to the two groups of oystermen
affected by the oil spill.
   McGarr then reduced the possible damages against Amoco by the
amount already paid by the French.
   ``Basically, he's gone back to his original damage estimate,''
Kingham said in a telephone interview. ``He's adjusted it several
times since first delivering it in 1988.''
   McGarr has served as ``special master'' in the case since his
retirement in 1984, shortly after he ruled that Amoco was liable.
His recommendations on damages are being passed on to U.S. District
Judge Charles Norgle, who is expected to rule on the amount of
damages some time before the end of the year.
   ``We intend to appeal all of the damages, including those to the
oyster growers,'' said Kingham, who also represents some 100 French
towns, two counties, hotel keepers and fishermen affected by the oil
spill.
   The Amoco Cadiz struck rocks two miles off the Britanny coast on
March 16, 1978. The huge tanker had lost the use of its rudder and
was under tow through the English Channel by a German-owned tug when
the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds.
   The resulting 68 million gallon oil slick was 18 miles wide and
80 miles long. It fouled 100 miles of Brittany beaches with tar,
killing thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures.
   By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound was 11 million gallons.

<HEAD>CBS' Rather Says His White House Access Was Affected After Bush Flap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather says his access to the
White House for news was affected by his famous, combative interview
with President Bush when Bush was the Republican candidate for
President.
   He also said he wasn't sure if the access of other CBS News
staffers had been affected by the incident.
   Rather's comments Monday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live''
didn't make clear how he felt his relations with the Bush White
House had been affected since the headline-making interview.
   The White House has no comment on Rather's remarks, a spokesman
said Tuesday. At CBS, the anchorman was reported busy and
unavailable for comment.
   Rather interviewed Bush without incident several times after
their verbal clash that aired live on Jan. 25 last year on the ``CBS
Evening News.'' But he also was turned down once in requesting an
interview a month after the incident.
   The anchorman was asked by a caller if the flap had affected his
access to the White House for news.
   ``Does it affect my personal access to the White House for news?
The answer is yes,'' Rather said. ``Does it affect CBS News overall
in their access to the White House? I think that is not yet clear.''
   He added that he hoped there had been no affect on access by
other CBS News staffers.
   King asked him if he'd attend a White House state dinner if he
were invited to one.
   ``Well, I haven't been invited,'' Rather replied. ``I'm not in
the habit of turning down invitations I don't have, but the more
important thing is whether you have access to news.''

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network, which went after the big three
TV networks in 1980 with round-the-clock news, is preparing a
frontal assault with an hour-long newscast premiering next month.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth announced Tuesday the newscast will
be shown from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, possibly with CNN anchor Bernard
Shaw. But Haworth said, ``We have no decision on talent yet.''
   The program would be twice the length of the evening news on NBC,
ABC and CBS.
   CNN's newscasts are carried live in each time zone, meaning the
program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast. The new show
will begin Oct., 16, he said.
   Haworth said the new program would be designed to ``go
head-to-head with the networks,'' which broadcast a half-hour of
news at 6:30 p.m. _ or 7 p.m. in some markets.
   ``Seventy percent of the people who watch the evening news watch
the 6:30 p.m. segment,'' Haworth said.
   CNN now runs its continuous news format in the 6-6:30 time period
and shows the entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30
p.m. EDT.
   Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine
Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co-anchor
the new evening news program was premature.
   ``We won't know anything about that until she actually joins
us,'' he said. ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When
she comes up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start
figuring what anchor role she'll be playing with us.''
   CNN started in June 1980. It has sports, commentary, talk and
specialty shows, but the bulk of its 24-hour schedule is news.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Pete Geren, a former Senate
aide, narrowly won a special election Tuesday for the seat given up
by ex-House Speaker Jim Wright, toppled by an ethics investigation
after 34 years in office.
   With all precincts reporting, Geren had 40,210 votes, or 51
percent, to 38,590, or 49 percent, for Republican Dr. Bob Lanier, a
television medical commentator.
   Geren, a 37-year-old former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, will
serve the remainder of Wright's term, which expires next year.
   Republicans had seen the election as a chance to capture the 12th
District, a longtime Democratic stronghold covering most of Fort
Worth and Tarrant County.
   But Lanier, who was in his first run for office, had acknowledged
his race was an ``upstream swim'' because the district is heavily
Democratic and because Geren raised nearly twice as much money.
   Lanier, 44, a pediatric allergist and immunologist, is featured
on ``60-Second Housecall,'' a television spot syndicated to local
news broadcasts in more than 40 television markets.
   Geren worked for Bentsen from 1983 to 1985, and lost a 1986 race
in the 6th District to Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican.
   The campaign stirred little interest. Tarrant County Election
Administrator Robert Parten had predicted 20 percent to 25 percent
of the district's 287,000 registered voters would vote.
   Wright resigned in June to avoid facing allegations he repeatedly
violated congressional ethics rules. He remains popular in the
district.
   An eight-candidate special election Aug. 12 drew only a fifth of
the district's voters. Lanier won 39 percent of the vote to 32
percent for Geren, making a runoff necessary because neither
received a majority.
   Geren and Lanier have emphasized their endorsements and differing
backgrounds.
   Geren was endorsed by Wright and Bentsen, and cited his
experience as a legislative aide.
   Lanier received endorsements from President Bush and former
Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry. He said he was in better touch with
his constituents' concerns than his opponent.
   Both candidates oppose abortion but would not criminalize it;
want better health care funding for the elderly; and support strong
measures against illegal drugs.
   Geren supports sending U.S. troops to Colombia to fight drug
dealers, opposes restrictions on owning semiautomatic weapons and
signed a pledge to vote against any new taxes.
   Lanier said he would finance the war on drugs by selling special
bonds, advocates limiting House members to 12 years in office and
emphasizes his interest in social problems.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Says Another Student Kidnapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights organization said Tuesday
that another student has been kidnapped, the 10th such disappearance
in nearly two months.
   The Mutual Support Group, comprising relatives of missing people,
said in a statement that Eduardo Antonio Lopez Palencia, 24, a
student of chemistry and pharmacology from San Carlos University,
was kidnapped Sunday.
   Palencia's girlfriend contacted them to report the abduction, the
statement said.
   Five other students are missing and presumed kidnapped. Three
students and one professor kidnapped in recent weeks were found dead
on Sunday. They had been shot repeatedly.
   The Association of University Students at San Carlos blamed the
government for the recent violence.
   But the government has said it does not know who is behind the
attacks, which began July 19 with an explosion that destroyed
transmitters belonging to a major television network.
   Neither leftist guerrillas who have been fighting for power for
four decades or rightist death squads notorious for hunting down
suspected leftists have claimed responsibility for the slayings or
the 28 bombings.
   The bomb blasts have killed two people and wounded more than 25.
   President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo said Tuesday he will raise the
issue at the United Nations. He travels to New York later this month
to address the U.N. General Assembly.
   ``We are the object of aggression to break the continuity of the
democratic process,'' Cerezo told reporters.
   He blamed ``extremists'' but did not elaborate on which groups or
who might be involved.
   The Mutual Support Group said there were about 800 political
murders in Guatemala last year.
   In July, Amnesty International said the military and police keep
operating death, torture and abduction squads.
   The London-based human rights organization said it has reports of
222 people who have disappeared since Cerezo came to power in 1986
after 20 years of military rule.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Tuesday
warned that America was in danger of losing out in international
competition unless the country did something about its inadequate
savings rate and American businesses stopped chasing after quick
profits.
   Brady's comments represented the opening salvo in what is
expected to be a major new intiative on the part of the Bush
administration to boost America's competitive standing in the world.
   ``Traditionally, the whole American workforce _ from the
boardrooms to the factory floors _ shared a pride in their work
unequaled in the world,'' Brady said. ``However, in recent years we
have neglected our traditional strengths and have seen the other
nations move forward to challenge our position in the world
economy.''
   In remarks to 100 of the country's top business executives
gathered for dinner in the Treasury Department's ornate Cash Room,
Brady decried what he saw as an emphasis on short-term gains and a
loss of commitment to plan for the future.
   ``We've been willing to mortgage our future, to sacrifice quality
and to cut corners in the pursuit of the immediate payoff,'' Brady
said. ``It worries me when I see many of the best minds in America
concentrating on financial engineering rather than laying plans for
sound corporate strategies for the future.''
   Brady told the business leaders that the president considered the
problem one of his top priorities but he conceded in answer to a
question that the administration had not yet resolved the question
of how to offer tax breaks to increase savings without worsening the
government's budget deficit.
   He said the president hoped to have concrete proposals to offer
in the area of boosting savings when he presents his next budget to
Congress in January.
   ``If you set goals and have the backing of the president then you
can do some things that are pretty amazing,'' Brady said, making a
pitch to the business leaders to support the administration's effort.
   ``We must work together to find new ways to encourage Americans
to take the long-term view in their economic thinking as we work to
preserve America's economic leadership and our standard of living,''
he said.
   Brady's remarks were to a dinner meeting of the American Business
Conference, composed of the chief executive officers of 100 of the
fastest growing companies in the nation.
   Earlier in the year, the group produced its own study which
singled out a decline in the personal savings rate as the biggest
economic problem facing the United States and the chief cause of its
huge trade deficits.
   In his speech, Brady said that the administration was considering
ways to boost the personal savings rate as a way of increasing the
pool of funds from which businesses could borrow to make long-term
investment.
   ``If we provided for more of our domestic investment needs with
our savings, we'd have to import less capital from abroad, thus
improving our trade balance,'' Brady said.
   While Brady did not spell out what options were being considered,
other Treasury officials have said the administration is examining
the possibility of broadening the use of tax-deferred individual
retirement accounts. The 1986 tax law sharply curbed IRA tax
benefits for workers who made more than $40,000 a year and were
covered by a company retirement plan.
   Brady said the administration would be looking at a number of
options ``that give people the incentive to save, instead of to
consume.''
   Brady said the administration was also considering proposing the
removal of the current double taxation on dividends earned by a
company's stockholders. Brady such a change would lower the cost of
capital for American businesses and end the bias of the tax system
toward debt financing by corporations.
   At present, companies pay dividends to shareholders out of
after-tax profits and shareholders are also taxed on the dividends
as well. In the speech, Brady did not suggest how the government
would make up the lost revenue from eliminating this double
taxation, an amount estimated to be as much as $40 billion a year.
   Brady also put in a plug for the administration's proposal to
permanently reduce the capital gains tax, which he said would
provide an important incentive for companies to make long-term
investments, and he praised the administration-congressional accord
on cutting the budget deficit to $100 billion in the upcoming fiscal
year.
   He said all of these efforts would be needed to increase
America's competitiveness.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor glided into court
Tuesday wearing a leopard-patterned dress, her eighth husband at her
side, for a second day of jury selection in her trial for alleging
slapping a cop.
   ``I feel wonderful, dahlink,'' she told reporters covering her
misdemeanor criminal trial.
   But the audience was far smaller than on opening day.
   Miss Gabor, who appeared in ``Moulin Rouge'' and ``Picture Mommy
Dead,'' drew a crowd of only about 20 when she arrived.
   She was mobbed by about 100 reporters at the courthouse Monday
when jury selection began. Only six reporters were allowed inside,
leaving the rest to chase interviews with fans and bystanders.
   Miss Gabor's leopard-patterned dress was another Donna Karan
creation, as was Monday's black outfit.
   ``Leopard is coming back in,'' she said.
   She was accompanied Monday by her hairdresser, daughter and
eighth husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, Germany's Duke of
Saxony. The duke returned Tuesday, but the hairdresser did not.
   Defense attorney William Graysen ended his screening of potential
jurors after a day and a half, asking them if they believe older
people should be treated differently than younger people when
arrested and whether insubordination or profanity should be
considered.
   Graysen said he expected to finish his case early next week. ``Oh
my goodness, I can't make the Pat Sajak show now,'' Miss Gabor
blurted.
   Miss Gabor was asked how deep in her closet she would have to dig
if there were a long trial. ``I have enough clothes for at least a
year,'' she said.
   Prosecutor Elden Fox groused that his closet only held two weeks'
worth of suits. ``If this case runs two weeks I may run out of
suits, but Miss Gabor may not run out of dresses. Will that
influence you?'' he asked prospective jurors.
   At that point, Municipal Court Judge Charles G. Rubin told
ordered prospective jurors to ignore the adversaries' clothing.
   A reporter asked if Miss Gabor had been offered a plea bargain
involving her performing community service and Graysen said it would
be inappropriate to comment. But Miss Gabor said: ``How can I be
punished? I didn't do nothin'.''
   Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin had imposed a gag order on the
case, attempting to silence the outspoken Miss Gabor and her
supporters.
   She was arrested June 14 after an officer stopped her for having
expired registration on her $215,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche
convertible. She drove off as the officer was checking for other
infractions and then allegedly slapped him when he stopped her again
two blocks later.
   Miss Gabor maintains she was verbally and physically abused by
the officer who she contends has a history of harassing celebrities.
   Miss Gabor pleaded innocent July 12 to charges of misdemeanor
battery on a police officer, disobeying a police officer's orders,
driving with an expired license, having an open bottle of liquor in
her car and having an expired car registration.
   The judge's first question to the prospective jurors Monday
focused on their familiarity with an obscene directive Miss Gabor
claims the officer told her and which she allegedly took as an order
to leave the scene.
   If convicted, she faces a maximum jail term of two years and a
$4,000 fine.
   It wasn't Miss Gabor's first run-in with law enforcement.
   In January, authorities said, she spouted profanities when she
was taken off an airliner in Atlanta because her two dogs were loose
in the plane. A similar incident occurred in 1968 when she illegally
took a dog with her to Spain.
   The Hungarian-born actress Gabor is secretive about her age, but
court documents indicated she was born June 6, 1923, making her 66.
She was a Miss Hungary and her first marriage was to Burhan Belge,
the Turkish ambassador to Hungary.

   Thousands of East Germans crowded
refugee camps Tuesday to begin building new lives in the West after
crossing the border from Hungary. Officials said the emigre flood
could exceed 15,000.
   About 11,000 had arrived in West Germany by Tuesday night,
Bavarian border officials said.
   Communist East Germany issued a strong, formal protest to
Hungary's reform-minded government for permitting the exodus and
demanded the movement be halted. Both East Germany and Hungary are
Warsaw Pact nations.
   Most of the new East German emigres are skilled young workers and
their families, fed up with conditions in their hard-line homeland.
Many went straight to relatives already living in West Germany.
Others were being temporarily put up at refugee camps.
   East Germans who had camped outside the West German Embassy in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, also hoping to go West, gave up after
promises they would not be punished. Some had been there for weeks.
   Officials in Hungary said thousands more East Germans were
arriving in that communist country, which opened its doors to the
West at midnight Sunday when about 60,000 East German vacationers
were in Hungary.
   The officials suggested that the flow of refugees to the West had
peaked, saying the number of East German visitors was usual for this
time of year.
   Hungarian officials sought to soft-pedal suggestions that most of
the more than 50,000 East Germans reported on vacation in Hungary
could join others who had formally requested to leave for a new life
in the West.
   They said only 210 East Germans registered overnight with
authorities at a refugee camp in Hungary coordinating the exodus
westward.
   Hungary attracts tens of thousands of East German vacationers
each year. Traditionally it has been relatively easy for most East
Germans to get permission to go there, but far harder to get
approval for visiting the West.
   Residents in the border city of Passau greeted new arrivals with
cheers, hugs and offers of jobs and shelter. Tent camps and a
reception area were set up for the emigres.
   ``This reception is really amazing,'' said Ute Kindl, a refugee.
``I'm really speechless over the warmness and kindness here.''
   A large banner outside the center bore the words ``Herzlich
Willkommen'' (Heartfelt Greetings). Red and silver helium balloons
with the same message bobbed in the welcoming crowd. Bulletin boards
listed jobs and apartments.
   One East German man, a 33-year-old who only identified himself as
Dietrich, said he had no idea where he wanted to settle. ``But it
will work out.''
   Like many of the young emigres, Dietrich said he was fed up with
the communist government and economic conditions back home.
   Labor Minister Gebhard Glueck in the West German state of Bavaria
predicted that the total number of East Germans seizing advantage of
the chance to emigrate ``could top 15,000.''
   East Germany's state ADN news agency released a government
statement calling for ``immediate rescinding'' of Hungary's decision
to ``unilaterally suspend'' Hungarian-East German agreements on
border controls.
   It said the protest was sent to the Foreign Ministry in Budapest.
   Romania and Czechoslovakia, both Warsaw Pact states, accused West
Germany on Tuesday of trying to lure East Germans to the West, but
offered only guarded criticism of their ally, Hungary.
   The exodus began after Hungary defied a 1969 agreement with East
Germany and opened its borders for thousands of East Germans to
settle in the West.
   It comes at a time of dramatic change in the East bloc. Poland
has installed its first government in four decades not led by
communists, and Hungary is implementing political reforms.
   The East Germans, arriving in private cars, buses and trains,
were exhausted but jubilant over Hungary's move.
   ``We'll never be able to repay them for this,'' said Heinz
Schmidt, who came from Jena, East Germany.
   The arrivals filled five temporary camps near the Austrian border
in Bavaria. Officials were seeking more shelter areas in military
barracks.
   At a news conference in Passau, chief government spokesman Hans
Klein criticized East Germany for calling the exodus `illegal'' and
a ``provocation organized at high levels.''
   ``It's stone-age verbiage that they have reacted with. If there
is a provocation it's a provocation for freedom,'' Klein said.
   Klein said 8,000 job offers for the refugees were received in
Passau alone.
   In Prague, more than half of about 400 East Germans gave up their
vigil at the West German Embassy, leaving after East German
authorities promised them they will not be punished if they returned
home.
   Maj. Janos Hornyak of the Hungarian border guards told The
Associated Press 6,529 East Germans arrived in Hungary between 6:30
a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. He said 3,220 East Germans left
for home over the same time via Czechoslovakia, which lies between
Hungary and East Germany.
   He said most entered from Czechoslovakia. The rest _ presumably
vacationers on the Bulgarian or Romanian Black Sea coast _ came from
Romania, he said. He said the figures were normal for this time of
year.
   The Soviet Union sent a hard-line Politburo member, Yegor
Ligachev, to East Berlin. ADN did not state the purpose of the trip,
but it was presumed Ligachev and East German officials would discuss
Hungary's role in the refugee affair.

   State Sen. John Daniels soundly defeated
former City Administrator John Stefano Jr. in the Democratic mayoral
primary Tuesday, making it all but certain he would become the
city's first black mayor.
   With all 30 wards reporting, Daniels had 16,018 votes, or 59
percent, to 11,082, or 41 percent, for DeStefano, who had been
endorsed by both the Democratic Party and retiring Democratic Mayor
Biagio DiLieto.
   ``Well, my friends, we did it!'' Daniels, 53, told supporters in
his victory speech, setting off a long round of cheers. ``I accept
this nomination with pride as an African-American ...''
   DeStefano, 34, called Daniels around 8:30 p.m. to concede defeat,
and urged supporters to support him in the general election Nov. 7.
   In the Republican primary, Alderwoman Robie Pooley, 48, defeated
Tobin Hitt, 28, an attorney and political newcomer. Pooley had 1,131
votes and Hitt 709.
   Because Democrats outnumber Republicans 10-to-1, the Democratic
primary winner is all but assured of victory in November. New Haven,
which is home to Yale University, has not had a Republican mayor in
36 years.
   Election officials said 53 percent of the city's 50,963
registered Democrats voted in the primary, the highest turnout since
a 1979 primary.
   DeStefano and Daniels sought to keep the issue of race out of the
campaign, and both sought multi-ethnic support. Blacks represent
about 35 percent and Hispanics about 12 percent of the city's
population of 127,000.

   Tropical Storm Hugo would soon strengthen into a
hurricane as it churned across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean,
forecasters said Tuesday, and Gabrielle whipped up heavy swells as
it moved away from Nova Scotia.
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane season,
had winds of 65 mph with stronger gusts in squalls, and forecasters
said conditions were right for it to grow stronger.
   ``It still looks impressive on the satellite imagery, meaning it
has continued to strengthen some,'' forecaster Max Mayfield of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said, adding that
Hugo could be up to 74 mph hurricane-strength winds in a day or two.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was near latitude 12.9 north and
longitude 39.0 west, or about 930 miles west-southwest of the
westernmost Cape Verde islands. It was headed west at about 20 mph
and was on a path that could take it to the Caribbean in about five
days, forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm Gabrielle's winds were down to 40 mph, but still
causing swells as high as 16 feet along the south coast of Nova
Scotia and parts of New England, forecasters said.
   Gabrielle was expected to weaken as it accelerated to the
northeast over northern Atlantic waters.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was near latitude 41.7
north, longitude 55.0 west, or about 345 miles south southwest of
Cape Race, Newfoundland. It was drifting east-northeast at about 10
mph.

<HEAD>Maine Indians Recall Tribal Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIAN ISLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Penobscot Indian tribe
voted to remove tribal Gov. Francis Mitchell on Tuesday in an
unprecedented recall election.
   The vote was 241-206, according to a tribe official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. A date for an election to fill the vacancy
would be set within 60 days by the tribal council, the official said.
   Mitchell and Lt. Gov. Philip Guimond, one of Mitchell's harshest
critics, have said they would run in the next election.
   The recall climaxed a months-old power struggle between Mitchell
and the 12-member tribal council over past and future strategies for
investing the Penobscots' share of the $81.5-million Indian
land-claims settlement of 1980.
   A majority of tribal members signed a petition in July demanding
Mitchell's removal.
   The petition includes allegations that Mitchell has failed to
comply with directives from the tribal council, spent tribal funds
and filled certain positions without authorization, intimidated and
harassed employees, and taken actions that jeopardized a business
owned by the tribe.
   Mitchell has said some people dislike his policies of fiscal
austerity, and that he has inherited about $7 million dollars of
debt and an operating deficit that now exceeds $1 million, which he
cites as evidence of past mismanagement.
   Other tribal leaders maintain that there was an operating surplus
when Mitchell took over and that outside audits of tribal finances
have turned up no evidence of any wrongdoing.

   More than one-third of the record $673 million in
fines and penalties being paid by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to
resolve federal securities law violations will be used in the
government's war on drugs.
   Attempting to boost President Bush's new $7.9 billion drug
package, the Justice Department decided to allocate the lion's share
of Drexel's criminal penalty to a fund that will be overseen by drug
czar William J. Bennett.
   Drexel pleaded guilty Monday to six felonies and began paying
$650 million plus interest and civil insider trading penalties,
closing a major chapter in the 3-year-old Wall Street corruption
crackdown.
   The New York investment firm immediately wrote certified checks
to three agencies and a bank that will manage a fund earmarked for
civil damages claims against Drexel.

   Three federal agencies are denouncing an
environmental group's campaign against the use of pesticides on
food, saying it pressures grocers to make regulatory decisions
better left to the government.
   The effort by the National Toxics Campaign ``appears to attempt
to put the onus for pesticide regulation inappropriately on the U.S.
grocery industry,'' said a joint statement by the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the
Agriculture Department.
   The Boston-based environmental group on Monday announced
agreement with a small number of grocery chains to sign a pledge
designed to reduce pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables.
   However, the federal agencies said the government seeks ``to
balance the benefits and risks of pesticides,'' and accused the
environmentalists of ignoring the fact that pesticides rid food
products of diseases that could pose serious health concerns.

   The investigations into the companies where problems were found
are continuing, and the FDA is reviewing the operations of 20 more

own in sampling tests.

   Wildlife on federal preserves is being harmed
by human activities ranging from military dogfight practice to
waterskiers, congressional investigators reported today.
   Interior Department managers know that secondary uses of refuges
are ``causing direct harm to wildlife,'' General Accounting Office
investigators concluded.
   But they bow to ``intense'' local pressure for more recreation
facilities, or are forced by law to share ownership of the land with
other government agencies or private interests such as those with
drilling rights, the report said.
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, reported on the refuges at
the request of Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the House
Government Operations environment subcommittee and Rep. Gerry E.
Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries

   Kevin McClain was dirty, sullen, withdrawn, on
drugs and about to be fired when he broke into a police car to steal
guns. The judge gave him a choice: five years in a cell or a few
months in ``boot camp.''
   McClain chose regimented days of classes, drills, humiliation and
abuse.
   ``He went in strictly as a little old teen-age wild boy. He came
out as a disciplined young man,'' said his grandfather, George Ottis
Hinton.
   ``All he studies now is work,'' said his grandmother, Lestereen
Hinton. ``And he's always hugging on us and telling us, `I love
you.'''
   ``I feel like I'm alive now,'' said McClain, of Shreveport, one
of 618 men and women sent to the shock incarceration program at Hunt
Correctional Center since it opened 2{ years ago, and one of 296
graduates.
   Eleven states have such programs aimed at behavior modification
instead of just punishment and a dozen are considering them.
President Bush proposed boot camps as part of his anti-drug plan.
The U.S. Justice Department next year will issue the first national
review of shock incarceration, said Doris McKenzie, a Louisiana
State University researcher working on the study.
   The report will cover seven of the 11 states: Georgia and
Oklahoma, which have the nation's two oldest prison boot camps, both
opened in late 1983; New York and Texas, which focus on drug users
and sellers; Louisiana, Florida and South Carolina. Alabama,
Mississippi, Arizona and Michigan also have programs, but a study of
all 11 would have been too expensive, said McKenzie.
   The seven were chosen for differences in the inmates accepted;
whether they are assigned by judges or corrections officials;
whether they may drop out; if counseling is a major part of the
program; how much supervision inmates get on parole; and how many
hours a day the program lasts.
   Louisiana will issue a report on its program next month, but
officials say they are encouraged by graduates like the 20-year-old
McClain.
   ``Compared to regular parole, where there's 70 to 80 percent
failure, it's doing real well,'' said Shreveport parole agent Louis
Stacks.
   The program, known officially as the Intensive Motivational
Program of Alternative Correctional Treatment, involves intensive
follow-up: at least four meetings a week with the parole officer,
curfew checks, full-time school or work, community service and
random drug and alcohol tests.
   Even where IMPACT appears only to increase parole agents' work,
those in charge say it's worth continuing. ``It has its problems.
But if the problems are ironed out, as I guess the department is
trying to do, eventually it might be a very successful program,''
said supervisor Sherman Butler.
   State officials say shock incarceration also saves money. They
estimate that McClain's training and parole supervision cost about
$3,400, compared to an average cost of $9,100 a year for inmates in
regular prison.
   And the number of people who make it through parole is
encouraging, said Corrections Department spokeswoman Martha
Jumonville.
   More than half of those who entered boot camp either dropped out
or were kicked out. Of 283 men and 13 women who made it through in
the program's first 17 months, 70 were sent back to prison for
violating parole. That 23.6 percent recidivism rate compares to 29
percent for inmates paroled after serving one-third or more of their
sentences, and a 36 percent rate for those released early because of
credit earned for good behavior in prison.
   Most of the IMPACT parolees were caught drinking, using drugs or
violating curfew, rather than committing new crimes _ the reason
most other parolees are returned to prison. However, many of the 296
IMPACT parolees had been out only a few months _ much too short a
time to say whether they would make it.
   ``By and large, we find we don't have any problem for the first
month or two,'' said Kenneth Temple, one of two parole officers who
deal with IMPACT cases in New Orleans. ``It's like babies _ they're
really cute for the first few months. ... The real proof of the
pudding is in four, five or six months.''
   Some fail even after making it through the period of heavy
supervision that is designed to help IMPACT parolees adjust to the
outside world.
   Dennis Daniels, for example, had graduated to regular parole
before he was arrested on charges of burglary and drug possession.
He escaped from jail and was caught in Salt Lake City.
   Stacks said Daniels fell apart after he lost his job at a funeral
home in cutbacks attributed to the state's failing economy. ``But
you know, counting the time he was in IMPACT, that was two years he
wasn't committing any new crimes. ... All this going downhill, it
took maybe a week, two weeks.''
   McClain said he was using methedrine, LSD, Valium and booze when
he was arrested. He stole money for drugs and because it was what
his friends did. He bathed _ reluctantly _ once a week. ``I just
didn't care. I felt very low.''
   Now he's not only working full time at County Market, where he
was a part-time janitor before his arrest, but he's won a promotion.
   ``He's outgoing, talks to people, gets along with people real
well. He does a great job. Respects his superiors. He gets here 30
minutes before work,'' said Gary Creel, store director at the
supermarket.
   McClain said he hadn't expected to be offered an apprenticeship
in the meat department, but knows why he deserved it. ``I'd run to
get stuff, run here, run there. The rest of the maintenance guys
were just walking and moping along.
   ``I was just so full of energy from the IMPACT, it hasn't worn
off.''

   A half-century ago, federal officials
made their first pitch to add to the National Park system the bright
red buildings of this abandoned copper mill camp, the country's
largest ghost town.
   Several decades and proposals later, the idea is alive again.
   Appraisers have finished poking through 40 or so structures built
in 1906 for Kennecott Mines Co., and a contract will be awarded soon
to put a cost on removing any asbestos and industrial chemicals left
behind, said Dick Martin, superintendent of Wrangell St. Elias
National Park and Preserve, which surrounds the frontier mining town
and its adjacent glacier.
   The deal would include about 3,000 acres plus buildings;
Kennecott Copper Corp. has to donate the subsurface rights, Martin
said on a recent tour of the decaying yet sound 14-story
concentration mill and leeching plant.
   ``The figures go anywhere from zero to $4-or-5 million dollars.
But those are shots at the moon. Until an appraisal is done and a
cost of dealing with hazardous materials is known, no one is doing
much of anything.''
   The National Park Service hopes to know the costs by October or
November, he said. ``We'll pass that along to headquarters either
with a recommendation for acquisition or that it's beyond our
abilities or financial constraints.''
   The first proposal to fold the privately owned historic mining
town into the national park system was made in 1938, Martin said.
``It came up again in the '40s, and I believe it was discussed again
in the '50s. There were various proposals, like using the tramways
for ski areas and the dormitories for hotels, but nothing has
happened.
   ``I guess I'm a little more optimistic that something will be
done soon because of the appraisals.''
   Kennecott Mines Co. took its name from Kennicott Glacier in 1906.
But the company, which still operates in Utah, misspelled the name.
   Its 800 workers may be gone, but many of their books and papers
still lie on desks and most of the machinery remains that they used
to crush and extract ore from one of the richest copper deposits
ever known.
   From 1911 to 1935, the Kennecott deposit, about 235 miles east of
Anchorage, produced 4.6 million tons of ore that was refined into
591,535 tons of copper and 9 million ounces of silver worth some
$300 million.
   The discovery of vast copper deposits in Chile and economic
dislocations brought by the Great Depression killed Kennecott even
though millions of tons of high-grade ore may still lie within
Bonanza Ridge, which rises several thousand feet behind the
processing facilities.
   But it's history that makes the site so valuable, Martin said.
``There's always going to be some great value here for the public,
even if some of these buildings fall down. The more that are
standing the better, clearly. But there always will be a great deal
of value because of the people who lived here, the scenic value and
what they did here.''
   With help from volunteers, he said, it might be possible to make
the area safe for visitors to roam outside the buildings, but it
would be ``simply beyond our ability'' to pay for restoring all the
buildings to safe condition. ``We may fix up one of the buildings
for visitor contact or interpretation.''
   Only a few tourists now walk or ski the trails leading to mines
with names like Bonanza, Mother Lode and Jumbo. People either fly to
the 4,000-foot gravel airstrip at McCarthy, five miles down a rutted
road, or they drive scenic Edgerton Highway to its terminus at the
Kennicott River, then pull themselves hand-over-hand on a cable tram
that separates the road from the wilderness.
   At 13.2 million acres, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and
Preserve is the nation's largest national park. It abounds in
wildlife _ Dall sheep, buffalo, caribou, moose, wolves, brown and
black bear, among others. It also includes nine of the 16 highest
mountains in the United States. Mount Wrangell is an active volcano
with steam and the odor of sulfur wafting near its summit.
   Miners still extract gold and silver from more than 900 active
claims within the park, which is six times the size of Yellowstone
but, because of its remoteness, has fewer visitors in a year than
Yellowstone on a summer weekend.
   More than a million acres within the park are privately owned.
Several of the buildings and the Kennicott Glacier Lodge would not
be part of the ghost town buyout, Martin said.
   ``If it's acquired, we would like to work with other landowners
on public access and architectural designs and types,'' he said.
``That's not to get public access across properties, but to set up
some definitions of what would be open and what would be
off-limits.''

   Given TV's penchant for docudramatizing
everything but the making of a docudrama, it was inevitable that the
fatal crash of a Delta Air Lines jumbo jet in l985 would become a
``fact-based'' TV movie.
   Strange thing, though. There's a superior example of the breed
tonight in ``Fire and Rain,'' the USA Network's made-for-cable
version of that stormy-day tragedy as the big jet approached the
Dallas airport. The crash killed 136 people on the jet and a
motorist on the ground.
   A fair number of docudramas tend to be excessively dramatic, full
of screams, distortions on behalf of dramatic ``truth,'' hokey
dialogue, loud, hype-the-story music, and even bad acting.
   But the two-hour ``Fire and Rain'' is pretty much the opposite, a
thoughtful, surprisingly restrained drama by Gary Sherman that
covers a lot in two hours with only a few clinkers and with a
generally solid cast.
   Sensitively directed by Jerry Jameson and filmed in Dallas, its
emphasis is not so much on the whys of the crash as its aftermath _
the accident's traumatic effects on survivors, the families of the
dead and injured, and even two volunteer emergency medical workers _
well-played here by Charles Haid and Dean Jones _ who do what they
can to help after the tragedy.
   Guilt, compassion, anger, anguish and helplessness _ the whole
emotional range is nicely stitched together, with some scenes that
linger in the memory, like Jones near tears as he quietly puts a
mud-spattered dead child into a black rubber body bag, one of many
such bags lying on rain-damp concrete outside an airport hangar.
   During the film's two hours, a cliche occasionally escapes. And
it did not seem a wise idea to bring Angie Dickinson, David
Hasselhoff and pop singer Patti Labelle to the proceedings,
Dickinson in a medium-size role and the other two in small ones.
They add naught to the night.
   True, the movie is billed _ somewhat erroneously _ as having an
``all-star'' cast. But ``Fire and Rain,'' a good show, would have
been even better had those in charge simply cast good actors in all
parts, as was the case in NBC's ``Roe Vs. Wade'' last season.
   But it's a minor gripe. The majority of players here are good,
particularly Susan Ruttan as a mother of four kids, a housewife
whose husband is killed in the crash.
   The docudrama will be followed tonight by a half-hour discussion,
led by former ABC anchor Steve Bell, on coping with the traumas that
result from large-scale tragedies such as the Delta crash.
   One of the three guests on the followup show, Robert M. Katz, has
a firsthand perspective. He survived the crash, along with his wife,
Debbie. He suffered minor injuries, but she was seriously injured,
hospitalized for five months, and still suffers from the injuries of
1985.
   Their story _ they have four children and live in Coral Springs,
Fla. _ wasn't told as part of ``Fire and Rain.'' Katz wasn't asked
what he thought of the movie during taping of the followup program.
   However, in an interview afterward, he said he was surprised that
the film ``wasn't as sensationalized as some of the other movies
I've seen about some of the other plane crashes and disasters ... in
this case, it was almost an understatement.''
   Katz, a stockbroker, said he hadn't closely paid attention to the
movie when he saw the cassette of it that USA Network had sent him
for viewing prior to its cable premiere tonight. But parts of the
film weren't accurate, he said, emphasizing that he wasn't knocking
the movie.
   He cited a scene just before the Delta jumbo jet crashes, one
that showed passengers ``yelling, screaming and crying. I didn't see
that. There actually was a really deadly silence. The whole flight,
in my memory, was a pretty eerie affair.''

   A punchline can help the bottom line, says a
new kind of consultant who counsels executives and office staffers
on how to lighten up the work place.
   Some companies in the 1980s have turned to humor consultants to
help their workers relax, get along better and produce more. Less
tension means lower insurance and health care costs and less
absenteeism, these consultants argue.
   Humor ``makes the job more enjoyable, and in effect if most of us
work because we absolutely have to work, we're in rough shape,''
said Warren B. Griffin, professor of industrial psychology at
Monmouth College.
   Griffin said he has stressed the importance of appreciating the
funny during corporate consulting he has done over the years. He
uses role playing to help employees understand the ``value of a
joke.''
   However, it is ``not so much telling a joke Milton Berle-style,
but pointing out the ridiculousness of something that happens in the
process of what you're doing,'' he said. ``That's basically not too
hard to find.''
   A number of humor consultants interviewed agreed that the goal is
for employees to take themselves less seriously while staying
serious about their jobs.
   ``The beginning of humor is a willingness to acknowledge the
self,'' said Edward C. Ryterband, a former professional stand-up
comic-turned-consultant. He is a partner in Landy-Ryterband &amp;
Associates of Shrewsbury, N.J.
   The number of humor consultants is difficult to estimate. Dr.
Steve Allen Jr., a Horseheads, N.Y., physician who spends about 25
percent of his time speaking to companies and organizations on
humor, puts the number at about a dozen.
   Companies searching for ways to propagate the corporate harmony
of Japan are ``encouraging humor as a powerful coping mechanism and
as a corporate strategy,'' said Allen, son of the comedian Steve
Allen.
   In broader terms, the trend is part of a ``cultural wind blowing
that people are interested in looking at their lifestyle,'' said
Joel Goodman, who calls himself a ``humor educator.''
   Goodman says he has addressed more than 200,000 people worldwide
at companies, conventions and seminars through his Humor Project,
based in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
   He said his corporate clients have included IBM, Raytheon Co. and
Monsanto Corp.
   Allen said he teaches participants to juggle scarves both as a
``3-year-old thing'' to do and as a model for laughing at oneself,
celebrating a skill and developing a positive attitude.
   The consultants interviewed said they knew of little hard data
that proved their work had a tangible effect.
   Goodman cited the 600 to 700 letters a week he receives asking
for information or praising his work. Allen says research in Israel
has shown a link between comedy and better performance on creativity
tests.
   Others point to physiological studies on how laughter may produce
endorphins, biologically created pain-killers in the brain.
   Susan Little, an accounting manager at U S West Communications in
Seattle, said Goodman's presentation helped lift morale at the
company a year after the 1984 break-up of AT&amp;T, when stress was
mounting in the telecommunications world.
   ``Anything we could do for our managers to help reduce that
stress so they could be more more productive was what we were
looking for,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Novel Finding Favor Among General Audience</HEAD>

   When it was published in 1986, Frank Peretti's
novel about spiritual battles was a sleeper even on Christian
bookstore shelves. ``This Present Darkness'' now is so popular that
general-trade book stores are ordering it by the thousands.
   Peretti's sequel, ``Piercing The Darkness'' had 400,000 pre-print
orders before its release last month, far more advance interest than
better-known Christian authors like Chuck Swindoll and James Dobson
receive.
   A breezy writing style, lots of dialogue and battles between
golden-haired, winged sword-wielding angels and slimy,
sulfur-breathing, taloned demons make ``This Present Darkness'' a
gripping read.
   Written from a Christian viewpoint, the battle for human souls
takes place against the backdrop of the attempted takeover of a
small college town by occult forces.
   The book sold 4,200 copies in its first year of release. Then
someone sent a copy to Christian singer Amy Grant, who enjoys
unparalleled popularity among non-Christians in the pop music genre.
   At her sold-out concerts, Grant told audiences the book's message
of the power of prayer had a profound influence on her. Sales began
to take off.
   By this month, ``This Present Dakness'' had sold 625,000 copies
and was in its 20th printing. It has been the No. 1-selling
paperback in Bookstore Journal, the trade publication of the
3,000-member Christian Bookstores of America, for 10 of the last 12
months, coming in second the other two months.
   When ``Piercing The Darkness'' was released Aug. 11, a blocklong
line of customers waited outside a store in Nashville, Tenn.
Zondervan Corp.'s 93 Family Book Stores sold their initial order of
2,000 copies in advance.
   The word about the first book still is spreading to general-trade
bookstores. At The Tattered Cover in Denver, religious and
philosophy book buyer Matt Cowles said the store has been selling 15
to 20 copies a month. The store stocks about 125,000 titles and is
among the largest independent bookstores in the country.
   ``It certainly caught us off guard,'' Cowles said. ``We kept
thinking it was going to slow down. But it's done very well for us,
and I'd say it appeals to the general market.''
   Retail book chains B. Dalton and Waldenbooks have ordered several
thousand copies of ``This Present Darkness,'' Crossway Books
publicist Kathy Jacobs said. Crossway, which published both books,
is a division of Good News Publishers in Westchester, Ill.
   Ed Morrow, president of the American Booksellers Association and
a shop owner in Manchester Center, Vt., said the question of how a
Christian book makes the transition to general trade sales often is
discussed.
   ``The Christian book market is so large, the books often just
don't sell in a general-trade store,'' Morrow said. ``There is some
transference, but a lot of times it's not visible because we don't
know the titles.''
   With 800,000 titles in print and 50,000 new titles a month,
keeping track would be a formidable task. Morrow had not heard of
``This Present Darkness.''
   Jan Dennis, editor in chief at Crossway, said he thinks Peretti
struck a chord among Christian fundamentalists whose beliefs clash
with such New Age ideas as channeling and spirit guides.
   ``He has written a book for the so-called Moral Majority. They
can hold this up and say, `This is how I see the world,''' Dennis
said. ``It operates out of a traditional Christian mythos, and that
makes it appealing to the traditional Christian reader.
   ``There are 35 or 40 million people in this country who are
really upset with the way things are. For once, their side is not
beaten down. They win,'' Dennis said.
   As a writer, Peretti has been compared to horror master Stephen
King, and his works with the fictional Christian tales of C.S. Lewis.
   Peretti said he's never read King. He said he thinks among
Christian readers, his books meet a spiritual need. The first book
has been translated into eight languages.
   ``I have gotten some feedback from non-believers, some of whom
have been enamored by the New Age or occultism,'' he said. ``Some
have abandoned that direction and realized it is a danger better
avoided.''
   Peretti appreciates Grant's support.
   ``I had quite a boost from her, but I hesitate to praise any one
person too much. I have a real strong conviction that this is more
of the Lord's doing than any particular individual,'' he said from
his Seattle-area home.
   Negotiations are under way for movie rights to ``This Present
Darkness,'' with Howard Kazanjian, producer of ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark.'' Completion of such a project is at least four years away,
Peretti said.

<HEAD>Questions Brew Over Scripture Titles and Time _ A.D. or C.E.?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Old Testament'' may be that to most
Christians, but it is certainly not that to Jews whose forebears
produced it.
   The secondary rating implied in the Christian designation is one
of the inter-religious scars handed down through the centuries, but
it and other linguistic sore spots are being examined for the
possibility of better names.
   ``It's a much discussed subject,'' said Phyllis Trible, a Bible
scholar at New York's Union Theological Seminary. ``When Christians
say Old Testament, that implies it's out-of-date, inferior. That
offends Jews.
   ``The church is searching for some alternative.''
   Several are being explored, and some increasingly are being used.
For example, ``Hebrew Bible'' is becoming popular in academic
circles, though that is not what Jews call it.
   Early in Christian history, the church gave the designation Old
Testament to the Scriptures preceding Jesus, a Jew. Writings about
him, also by Jews, were called the New Testament.
   Christians accept both compilations as inspired by God. Jews
accept only the older Scriptures, what they themselves call the
``Tanek,'' an acronym for the Torah (Law), Nebiim (Prophets) and
Kethubim (Writings).
   Finding ``proper language'' for Christians to use in referring to
Judaism generally is an age-old problem, the Catholic Messenger,
diocesan weekly of Davenport, Iowa, said in an editorial.
   ``The traditional `old' and `new' testament usage implies that
the Jewish scriptures are not only old in terms of time but
outmoded; no longer relevant except as a `precursor' of the
revelation of Jesus Christ,'' the paper said.
   Rabbi Burton Visotzky of the Jewish Theological Seminary of
America, said the use of Old Testament is ``not going to blow us out
of the water,'' but it is ``bad etiquette, inappropriate.''
   ``We don't like it,'' he added. ``We don't think it's the Old
Testament. We think it's our Bible. But things are changing, little
by little. A very large number of Christians now call it the Hebrew
Bible.''
   In interviews, he and Ms. Trible said that the change so far is
largely in the academic environment, but that it also is spreading
to congregations and modifying their usage.
   ``It's moving out among the people,'' Ms. Trible said,
attributing the reassessment to closer Jewish-Christian
relationships and understanding resulting from dialogues.
   However, biblical designations are not the only touchy linguistic
zone. Another is the Western world's dating of events B.C. (Before
Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini _ Year of Our Lord).
   ``This Christian designation of time is something involving all
society as well as religion,'' Ms. Trible said. ``We call it
Christian chauvinism. In an increasingly pluralistic world,
chauvinism is unacceptable.''
   The A.D.-B.C. issue lately has badgered the Biblical Archeology
Review, a Washington-based bimonthly whose letters columns have been
packed with arguments over continuing that usage or substituting
C.E. (Current Era) and B.C.E. (Before Current Era).
   ``We get complaints if we do it one way and complaints if we do
it the other,'' said editor Hershel Shanks. ``We're not
denominational, Jewish or Christian, and we've decided to allow our
authors to choose whichever designation they prefer.''
   He said most now choose the B.C.E. and C.E. designations as
``religiously neutral.''
   Visotzky said many scholarly religious journals, such as the
Journal of Biblical Literature and Harvard Theological Review, now
use C.E. and B.C.E.
   ``It's a sign of the increased influence of ecumenism,'' he said.
``People have become sensitive through dialogue to both the Jewish
and Christian roles.''
   Ms. Trible pointed out that the term Old Testament is never used
in the Bible itself. New Testament passages refer to the earlier
Scriptures as ``the law and the prophets.''
   However, references by the prophet Jeremiah and by Jesus to God
making a ``new covenant'' with people prompted church designations
of Old and New Testaments.
   Various substitutes have been considered for Old Testament, but
Ms. Trible noted drawbacks to each.
   Calling it ``Jewish Bible'' would be inadequate since Christians
consider it part of their Bible. The use of Tanek, the Jewish
acronym, is hampered by Christian unfamiliarity with it.
   Bible scholar James Sanders of the Claremont (Calif.) School of
Theology advocates ``First Testament'' and ``Second Testament.'' But
using ``First'' would imply the second, which is not accepted by
Jews.
   As for Hebrew Bible, Ms. Trible noted it is unclear whether
Hebrew refers to language or people. If people, that would exclude
most Christians, who also claim the book, and if langauge, then it
is not quite accurate, since bits are not in Hebrew, but Aramaic.
   ``There is a problem with all of it,'' she said.
   But Hebrew Bible seems the increasingly chosen solution among
scholars. Visotzky said the book is overwhelmingly in Hebrew, except
minor instances.
   As for the New Testament, Visotzky said, Jews ``intriguingly''
have no objections to that title. ``They even use it.''

   Students in Roman Catholic schools achieve
higher levels of reading proficiency than their counterparts in
public schools, says a report based on test scores.
   The National Catholic Educational Association compared scores of
a random sampling of Catholic students in grades 3, 7 and 11 with
National Assessment of Educational Progress scores of public school
students in those grades.
   Average reading ability of Catholic students was 5.8 percent
better than public school students in grade 3, 9.9 percent better in
grade 7, and 7.9 percent better in grade 11, the report said.
   Sister Catherine T. McNamee, president of National Catholic
Educational Association, said the findings were similar to those of
a study made two years ago.
   ``Catholic school students excel in reading ability at a time
when literacy has emerged as a pressing national problem and
business and government leaders look to the country's schools for a
remedy,'' she said.

   Silver suggested in a letter to Bush that the president

   In an unusual assignment, United Methodist
Bishop Felton E. May of Harrisburg, Pa., has been chosen to lead a
special denominational effort to strengthen the nation's ``spiritual
and social fabric.''
   He is to be based in Washington for the year-long effort, working
against trends seen by the leaders of the 9 million-member
denomiantion as defiling American life, particularly drugs and
violence.
   Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, president of the
denomination's Council of Bishops, said the church's special step
cannot ``solve these massive issues'' but ``we believe that we can
make a difference.''
   He said the church's bishops believe the country is facing
``massive deterioration of the moral and spiritual fabric of our
society,'' reflected in soaring drug traffic and violent crime.
   He called May's assignment ``a sign and witness of our belief
that God has something better in mind for the quality of our life
together in our world.''
   May, who is to take over his special role Jan. 1, promised a
``multipronged campaign,'' adding: ``The church must be well-armed
for this campaign against substance abuse and violence.''

<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 9{ months as prime minister,
Benazir Bhutto sees herself as a crusader to save Pakistan from the
clutches of drugs, ethnic violence and rancorous politics.
   ``I see things in terms of knights in shining armor trying to
root out evil,'' Ms. Bhutto said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``That may be a sort of simplistic way to put it, but I am an
optimist. I have great dreams for my country and I want to achieve
them.''
   But she acknowledged her vision might be a bit fanciful.
   ``I think I am too much of an idealist.''
   Educated at Harvard and England's Oxford University, the
36-year-old Ms. Bhutto is the first woman to lead a Moslem nation
and as she spoke she had a scarf called a ``dupatta'' draped over
her shoulder. When in public she wears the scarf over her head _ the
custom of Moslem women _ as a concession to Pakistan's religious
right wing, a powerful minority that opposes female rule.
   Ms. Bhutto and her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party govern a
restless nation of 107 million people burdened by poverty,
illiteracy and civil war across the border in Afghanistan.
   She said death threats after her government declared war on the
heroin trade and drug barons have forced her to think of her safety,
something she has resisted since assuming office Dec. 2.
   ``I don't believe in a life that is crowded with security,'' she
said. ``I think it's kind of nice to be able to slip away, ... after
having worked hard for a few days to be able to go for a half an
hour walk.
   ``I just consider it important for a person in public life to try
and maintain a sense of normalacy _ to have their feet on the
ground.''
   As for the drug war, she said, ``We are really now just going
after the big people, but it's a much bigger problem. It's just
proliferated all over the country like a cancer.''
   Western countries estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin
arriving in the United States and Europe comes from Pakistan. Drug
addiction in Pakistan has soared from near zero in 1979 to an
estimated 1 million addicts in 1989.
   Ms. Bhutto is also doing battle with an opposition made up of
Islamic fundamentalists, conservatives and loyalists of the late
president, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and his military government.
   Zia overthrew her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in
a 1977 coup and had him hanged two years later for his alleged
complicity in a murder plot.
   Zia, many of his top generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L.
Raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, clearing the
way for Pakistan's first free elections in more than a decade and
resulting in Mrs. Bhutto's election Nov. 16.
   Ms. Bhutto says the most serious threat to her government is
ethnic. Hundreds of Pakistanis have died and thousands have been
injured since 1986 in violence in her southern home province of
Sindh in fighting among militant secessionists, Indian Moslem
immigrants and internal migrants from poorer provinces.
   ``During General Zia's time ethnic groups became very strong,''
she said. ``They set up armed camps and they trained their people,
so it's a situation of almost a mini-kind of a guerrilla war. It's
not a guerrilla war against the government, but it's almost a state
of anarchy and a rebellion against authority.''
   Ms. Bhutto claims that her right-wing political opposition, the
nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, has had a hand in the Sindh
violence.
   She also has implicated neighboring India in the Sindh troubles.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they became
independent from Britain in 1947 and they routinely accuse each
other of fueling their internal problems.
   To the west, Ms. Bhutto inherited Pakistan's sponsorship of
Moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government of
Afghanistan.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees huddle in camps dotting
Pakistan's western frontier.
   ``Pakistan can't afford to keep the refugees,'' she said, ``but
are the refugees going to go back without political stability?
   ``So far we have not seen any message or any method that would
enable the emergence of an independent Afghanistan or the return of
the Afghan refugees. Those remain our goals.''
   She also said her political opposition is doomed because of its
links to the Zia era, when Pakistan was under martial law and
political parties were barred from elections.
   ``Pakistan just can't afford a return to the decade of
repression,'' she said. ``All those who are patriots in the
different sectors of life, whether it is civilian or military,
recognize that. Therefore, I see no imminent threat to democracy in
Pakistan.''
   But she added that law and order cannot survive without economic
development in a country where the average yearly wage is under $400.
   ``First you've got to try and create a system, create a rule of
law which gives security and, side by side, you've got to have
economic improvement and opportunitiees so people can (give) better
meaning (to) their lives,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's military retreat from
Cambodia should hasten the decline in Soviet influence in Indochina
and possibly open the door to the West for the first time since
1975, diplomats in Phnom Penh say.
   Vietnam's promised pullout of its last 26,000 soldiers by Sept.
26 will meet part of the price the non-communist world has long
demanded for normal ties with Indochina _ Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   The Vietnamese pullout will not meet two key Western demands:
that the withdrawal be internationally monitored and that it be part
of an overall political settlement of the conflict among Cambodian
factions.
   Diplomats said they expect to see gradual increases in private
and lower-level official contacts and commercial dealings that
Vietnam and Cambodia desperately seek with the West.
   All around Phnom Penh are signs that Cambodians are looking to a
future with the West.
   English has become the most popular foreign language, and an
entire block is lined with bamboo huts housing English-language
schools _ signs that many Cambodians foresee a return of the
Americans who roamed their streets during the Indochina War.
   Vietnam and Cambodia committed themselves to increased ties with
the non-communist world a few years ago when, amid economic crises,
they embarked on reforms requiring Western trade, investment and
aid. They had relied on largely ineffective East bloc aid only
because the West gave them no other choice, said the diplomats, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``Everyone that wants to come to do business here, they are all
welcome,'' Vice Prime Minister Kong Sam-Ol said in an interview.
   In Cambodia, the opening to the West also is a political
necessity.
   ``When we speak about the future of this country, we have to
understand one thing: that Prime Minister Hun Sen and his people
must change the government to a more capitalistic one because that
is the only way to be accepted by the international community,''
said a frank East bloc diplomat.
   Phnom Penh has been much less committed than the Vietnamese
government in Hanoi to socialist doctrine and Cambodia could rapidly
move into the Western camp if Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former
leader who now heads an anti-government faction, returned to a
position of authority in a political settlement.
   ``The Vietnamese are probably fearful that the West would, with
its guilty conscience, put everything into Cambodia but still
isolate Vietnam,'' said a Western aid official.
   The strategic value of Vietnam and Cambodia has declined for the
Soviet Union as it recently improved relations with China and no
longer needs ways to balance its influence in Asia. But the
diplomats said Cambodia also has become too expensive for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Kremlin.
   At the same time, they added, Vietnam and Cambodia realized that
their national security required more balanced relations with the
superpowers and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the
area's non-communist grouping.
   Vietnam has been Moscow's closest ally in Asia since communist
forces defeated U.S.-backed Indochinese governments in 1975. With
the prime exception of the United States, most Western nations
recognized the new government in Hanoi, but they imposed economic
blockades after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and
installed a pro-Vietnamese Communist government.
   Cambodia has been cut off from the West since the Communist Khmer
Rouge defeated the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in 1975 and
slaughtered citizens by the hundreds of thousands. Vietnam's
invasion drove the Khmer Rouge to the jungles, from which they still
wage a guerrilla war with other anti-government factions.
   In 1987, official Cambodian media said the Soviet Union was
giving the country $62.5 million in economic aid for five projects
for the period 1986-90. A Soviet official said in 1986 that Moscow
was giving $12.3 billion to $13.9 billion to Vietnam for the same
period.
   Moscow's most prominent military presence in Indochina is at
Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, the former U.S. base that is now considered
the largest overseas Soviet naval base. But Vietnam said last year
it may allow other countries to use the base.
   An East bloc diplomat said the Soviets have withdrawn 60 percent
of their personnel from Cambodia in the past year, leaving about
1,000. He said many of those who left were technical experts who
worked ``without any result'' and the Soviets decided the resources
``could be better used to resolve their own problems.''
   For similar reasons, Moscow also will slash economic aid to
Vietnam. It reportedly also has been unhappy with Hanoi's slow
retreat from Cambodia.
   ``The Soviets are not very popular,'' said a Western ambassador
in Hanoi. ``They don't mix well with the population. They failed
completely to get their confidence. Many foreigners ... have married
Vietnamese girls, (but that) is unthinkable for a Russian.''
   Cambodia and Vietnam were not happy with the Soviets' limited
commitment to their development and what they saw as unfair terms of
aid and trade.
   Diplomats said some countries including Thailand and Australia
may recognize the Cambodian government after the Vietnamese leave if
it holds open elections and holds off the guerrillas.
   Australia was one of the first countries to mediate the Cambodian
issue and has given much aid to Cambodia through the United Nations
and non-governmental organizations.
   Good relations with Phnom Penh are crucial to neighboring
Thailand's security. The government there has said it hopes to see
Indochina change from ``battlefields to marketplaces.''

<HEAD>Group Urges Boycott of Freddy Krueger Doll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious group that has sponsored boycotts of
TV programs it considers offensive has picked a new target: a doll
modeled after the ghoulish movie character Freddy Krueger.
   The American Family Association, which once claimed cartoon
character Mighty Mouse appeared to have snorted cocaine in a TV
show, said Monday the Krueger doll was ``the product of a sick
mind.''
   The Tupelo, Miss.-based group also urged a boycott of stores that
stock the doll and a boycott of all other toys made by Matchbox Toys
(USA) Ltd.
   The talking doll is based on the fiend from the ``Nightmare on
Elm Street'' movies. Matchbox announced last week the doll would be
available for Halloween sales.
   The doll has a string that, when pulled, causes it to spout such
phrases as ``Pleasant dreams,'' ``Watch out, Freddy's back,'' or the
character's trademark diabolical laugh.
   ``This doll is the product of a sick mind. The fact that a major
toy manufacturer would promote this doll is tragic,'' said the Rev.
Donald E. Wildmon, executive director of the group and a United
Methodist minister.
   The American Family Association, formerly known as the National
Federation for Decency, has advocated numerous boycotts in the past.
   Earlier this year it protested Pepsico Inc.'s use of rock star
Madonna in television commercials for Pepsi-Cola because of her
performance in a separate video for her song ``Like a Prayer'' that
showed a burning cross and other images that offended some
Christians.
   Pepsi in April withdrew its TV commercial featuring Madonna,
saying consumers were confusing the music video with its ad, which
contained no religious imagery.
   American Family Association also has urged boycotts of companies
that advertise on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' program, which the
group considers offensive.
   Last year, CBS cut 3{ seconds from an episode of ``Mighty Mouse''
after Wildmon said the scene gave the impression that the cartoon
hero was snorting cocaine. CBS said he was sniffing flowers.
   Allen Wildmon, associate director of the group and Donald
Wildmon's brother, said the group is asking supporters to contact
their local stores and encourage them to refuse to carry the Freddy
Krueger doll.
   ``We hope to keep this doll from being marketed,'' he said.
   The American Family Association Journal claims a circulation of
about 380,000, including nearly 180,000 churches and pastors.
   Freddy Krueger, the main character in the five ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' horror films, takes revenge on residents of a town by
murdering teenagers. The latest sequel, ``A Nightmare on Elm Street
5: The Dream Child,'' was released this summer.
   The film character, who has long blade-like fingernails, has
developed a cult following and has generated an estimated $300
million in domestic and foreign box office receipts and
videocassette sales.
   A spokeswoman for Matchbox Toys said no one at the company was
immediately available to comment on American Family Associaton's
charges. Matchbox, a maker of small, toy cars, also markets a
talking Pee-wee Herman doll.

<HEAD>Quaker Seeks Food Industry Health Claim Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co., embroiled in an oat bran
dispute with Texas officials, wants industrywide guidelines that
would allow food companies to advertise product health claims
without prior government approval.
   Health benefit claims on packages and in advertising would have
to be substantiated scientifically, said Luther C. McKinney, the top
legal officer for Chicago-based Quaker.
   The claims could be reviewed ``on a case-by-case basis'' by the
federal Food and Drug Administration, he said Monday.
   McKinney's proposal came during an address to the Food and Drug
Law Institute Seminar, in which he also critcized the Texas lawsuit
over Quaker's oatmeal advertising.
   ``The Texas state attorney general does not want us to
communicate health messages to the citizens of his state,'' said
McKinney.
   A spokesman for the Texas attorney general who was familiar with
the lawsuit could not be reached for comment Monday evening.
   Last Thursday, Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox alleged in a
lawsuit filed in Austin that Quaker ads claiming its oatmeal can
reduce cholesterol and, in turn, lessen the risk of heart attack are
``replete with exaggerations, half-truths and misinformation.''
   ``Let me state unequivocally that we dispute his allegations. Our
advertising for our oat products is truthful and is supported by
valid, reliable scientific evidence,'' said McKinney.
   McKinney said the lawsuit ``does a disservice to consumers
because it would prevent us from articulating a very important
reason why consumers should eat oats.''
   He conceded that oat bran health claims were ``very important''
to the sales of oatmeal and other oat cereals ``if we're going to
compete in this very tough environment.''
   In addition, McKinney accused competitor Kellogg Co. of
``marketing by inference'' because the Battle Creek, Mich., cereal
maker has said it will not make health claims _ only health messages
_ about its new high fiber cereal, Heartwise.
   The dispute over Heartwise involves its use of psyllium, a grain
from India that is high in soluble fiber. Soluble fiber has been
linked to reduced blood cholesterol levels.
   Psyllium is about 80 percent soluble fiber compared to oat bran's
10 percent.
   General Mills Inc. also is promoting a cereal containing
psyllium, called Benefit. Its ads for the product make outright
claims about cholesterol reduction.
   But critics say psyllium, an ingedient in some laxatives, should
be considered a drug and not included in food products without FDA
approval.
   ``I can understand Mr. McKinney's concern here, in that pysllium
is a natural grain that has ten times the soluble fiber as oat bran
_ and that's the issue,'' Joseph M. Stewart, a Kellogg senior vice
president, said in a telephone interview.
   McKinney reserved most of his criticism for Mattox, however,
saying ``those supporting a ban on public health claims for food are
essentially advocating consumer ignorance.''
   Noting that more than 60 million people in the United States have
cholesterol levels above the recommended level, McKinney asked,
``Where should they get such information? From a library? From a
health magazine? That's an elitist solution to the problem, if you
ask me.''
   In one ad Quaker states that ``in recent clinical studies, where
oats were a daily part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, total
serum cholesterol levels dropped an average almost 10 percent. Other
medical studies show such a drop could reduce your risk of heart
attack by nearly 20 percent.''
   But Texas claims Quaker's own tests showed that only a 3 percent
reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a
low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. And that reduction is applicable only
to women who eat 25 percent more oatmeal than Quaker recommends as a
regular serving.
   Quaker maintains its ads have been backed up by scientific
studies and cleared, after an investigation, by the Federal Trade
Commission.
   Following complaints about Quaker's ads from a Washington-based
consumer rights group, the FTC investigated for a year and
``concluded that our ads were not misleading,'' said McKinney.

<HEAD>More Than $200 Million in Drexel Penalties To Fund Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one-third of the record $673 million in
fines and penalties being paid by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to
resolve federal securities law violations will be used in the
government's war on drugs.
   Attempting to boost President Bush's new $7.9 billion drug
package, the Justice Department decided to allocate the lion's share
of Drexel's criminal penalty to a fund that will be overseen by drug
czar William J. Bennett.
   Drexel pleaded guilty Monday to six felonies and began paying
$650 million plus interest and civil insider trading penalties,
closing a major chapter in the 3-year-old Wall Street corruption
crackdown.
   The New York investment firm immediately wrote certified checks
to three government agencies and a bank that will manage a fund
earmarked for civil damages claims against Drexel.
   A check for $78 million _ the fine against Drexel calculated
under federal law _ was sent to the U.S. Postal Service and will be
used in part for white-collar criminal probes by that agency, U.S.
Attorney Benito Romano said.
   The remaining $222,196,770.97 criminal penalty was sent to the
U.S. Marshals Service asset forfeiture fund, which Romano said comes
under Bennett's discretion starting Oct. 1.
   The fund currently is used for prison construction and other
immediate law enforcement needs. Next month, it switches exclusively
to the war on drugs.
   ``Clearly the Department of Justice wanted to see the Drexel
criminal fine help fund the law enforcement efforts including the
war on narcotics,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Cohen, who
heads the office's securities fraud unit.
   Government officials said the fund now has about $250 million and
will nearly double thanks to the Drexel penalty.
   The total fines and penalties against Drexel amounted to
$673,237,260.28. All but $150 million of that was paid Monday.
   Drexel's long-awaited plea followed months of legal wrangling
over charges based largely on information from Ivan Boesky, the
imprisoned stock speculator whose revelations about systematic
lawbreaking have stunned the financial world since his arrest nearly
three years ago.
   ``This terminates our investigation of Drexel as an entity,''
Romano said at a news conference. ``Obviously their cooperation will
lead us in other directions. Wherever those leads take us, we will
go.''
   Drexel attorney Thomas F. Curnin entered the guilty plea before
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood in Manhattan federal court.
   The plea had been expected since Drexel and the government
reached an agreement on the charges in January but was delayed by
challenges brought by Michael Milken, Drexel's former chief junk
bond trader, who was indicted separately in March.
   The plea triggered enactment of a separate settlement between
Drexel and the Securities and Exchange Commission reached in April
that places Drexel under unprecedented government supervision for
three years and revamps its management.
   ``While it is for us a highly sobering event, we are determined
to make Drexel a model of how a securities firm ought to conduct its
business in the '90s and to focus new energies and resources on the
opportunities which lie ahead of us,'' Drexel said in a statement.
   Drexel pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud and two
counts of mail fraud and agreed to pay the fines and penalties for
illegal stock transactions involving the firm and Milken, Boesky and
the defunct Princeton-Newport Partners LP.
   Boesky has given the government information for several
securities fraud prosecutions, including the conviction of five
Princeton-Newport officials and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg
earlier this year and the fraud and racketeering indictment of
Milken, his brother Lowell and Newberg.
   Drexel before had never publicly admitted to the crimes and
Joseph told employees earlier this year the firm agreed to plead
guilty because it feared a racketeering indictment that could have
forced Drexel out of business.
   Romano said the government was satisfied with the plea.
   ``So long as it's not understood as undermining this admission of
guilty, then whatever they say to their employees ... is entirely up
to them,'' he said.
   Under the agreemement, Drexel paid $300 million in criminal fines
and penalties, plus 8.55 percent interest, and set aside $200
million of a total of $350 million in the civil fund. The remaining
$150 million is to be paid over the next three years.
   Drexel also paid $15.15 million plus interest to the SEC for
penalties under the federal Insider Trading Sanctions Act.

<HEAD>New Pan Am Shuttle Ads Tweak Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp.'s new advertising campaign for its
Northeast shuttle service tweaks the owner of its competitor, real
estate tycoon Donald Trump.
   ``On which shuttle will you find the world's most famous investor
in real estate, hotels and transportation?'' the ads ask. They
feature a drawing of the investor, Milburne Pennybags, the
top-hatted, mustachioed character from the Monopoly board game.
   The ads are a gentle swipe at the flamboyant Trump, head of the
rival Trump Shuttle, who also owns the Plaza Hotel, several casinos
in Atlantic City, N.J., and other assets.
   ``This is the second phase of the Pan Am Shuttle `Corporate Jet'
advertising, and it's more aggressive, given the heated-up shuttle
wars,'' Pan Am Shuttle President Harris Herman said in a statement.
``The Monopoly character is a lighthearted portrayal of the
successful business people who are our target market.''
   Pan Am launched its ``Corporate Jet'' ads last last February, in
anticipation of Trump's debut as a competitor. In June, Trump bought
the Eastern Airlines shuttle from Texas Air Corp. for $365 million.
   Both shuttles, which operate hourly flights linking New York to
Boston and Washington, cater mainly to business travelers. One-way
shuttle fares are $99 during peak hours.
   Trump claims his share of the lucrative shuttle market has
doubled since he took over from around 25 percent in early June to
about 50 percent currently. But Pan Am says its shuttle's share, at
around 75 percent when Trump started up, is now holding at roughly
60 percent.
   In the intensifying battle for customers, Pan Am recently
introduced business clubs with computer terminals, facsimile
machines and other equipment for all its shuttle passengers in New
York and Washington.
   Trump Shuttle, meanwhile, said Sunday it plans to give its
weekday passengers $25 American Express Co. gift certificates for
use in restaurants as part of a two-week promotion.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to the lowest level in several
months.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.64 percent, down from 7.88 percent
last week.
   Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills, also at an
average discount rate of 7.64 percent, down from 7.87 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.54
percent Nov. 7, and six-month bills averaged 7.35 percent July 31.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.9 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,806.90 and 8.06 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,613.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.27
percent last week, down from 8.32 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Contradicting Harard Report, Study Says Return on Junk Bonds Good</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new University of Pennsylvania study paints
a fairly optimistic picture for investors in junk bonds,
contradicting a Harvard University report released in April.
   Marshall E. Blume, who conducted the study along with Donald B.
Keim for Penn's Wharton School of Business, acknowledged that from
1977 to 1988 many junk bonds defaulted, the basis of the Harvard
study's conclusions, but he said Monday they still provided adequate
compensation for investors.
   The Harvard study, conducted by Paul Asquith, now a professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Business,
studied all junk bonds issued in 1977 and 1978. It found that by
Nov. 1, 1988, more than 34 percent of these high-risk, high-yield
bonds defaulted.
   Blume called the Harvard report a catalyst for conducting the
Penn study on the same bonds, which is scheduled for release
Tuesday, but he said he and Keim were not directly challenging
Asquith's findings.
   He said the way researchers approached the investments may have
resulted in the different conclusions on the safety of junk bonds,
which have a rating below investment grade and often are used to
finance corporate takeovers.
   Blume said the Penn study ``states the Harvard study did not
really look at the relevant variables.''
   Blume said he concentrated on the rates of return to investors
rather than the default rate.
   According to Blume, the yield on the junk bonds, which averaged
8.51 percent a year during the period studied, was higher than that
of several other types of investments considered much safer, such as
triple A-rated corporate bonds, which yielded 8.43 percent, and
intermediate-term Treasury issues, which yielded 7.6 percent.
   ``If a bond defaults, that doesn't necessarily mean you lose your
shirt,'' Blume said.
   Exchanged bonds were counted in Asquith's study as defaulted
bonds, Blume said. In some cases, the company may have become a
better credit risk and offered to exchange its junk bonds for
investment-grade bonds to eliminate restrictions often contained in
junk bonds, Blume said.
   However, Blume said, the exchange factor may have affected
Asquith's findings by only 3 percent or 4 percent.
   Asquith was unable to be reached for comment late Monday
afternoon. His office was closed and directory assistance did not
have a listing for him in Boston or Cambridge, Mass.

<HEAD>Big Three Carmakers Meeting With Oil Giants Over New Fuels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers and major oil companies
say they have held meetings on development of fuels that will
satisfy President Bush's clean-air proposal.
   The first meeting was held in July and focused on developing
fuels that could keep the performance characteristics of gasoline
while eliminating much of the air pollution caused by
gasoline-powered engines.
   However, representatives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp., along with the American Petroleum Institute,
denied a report in Monday's Automotive News that they had decided to
try to torpedo efforts to require that methanol be used as the fuel
of the future.
   The weekly journal also said the Big Three had signed commitments
to use less-polluting gasoline rather than methanol. But company
officials said no commitments have been signed.
   ``The Automotive News conclusion is dead wrong,'' said Ford
spokeswoman Beryl Goldsweig. GM and Chrysler also disputed the claim
Monday.
   However, the companies didn't dispute the report in the trade
journal that their officials had met with oil company officials to
talk about future fuels.
   This summer, Bush unveiled a clean air plan that, beginning in
1995, would phase in cars that burn ``clean'' fuels such as methanol
in Connecticut and the cities of Los Angeles, Houston, New York,
Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego and Chicago, where air
pollution problems are severe.
   Researchers for the Big Three, the oil and gas industry and
others have been busy in recent years working on cleaner-burning
fuels and reformulating gasoline.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler each has methanol fuel programs under way.
GM was a co-sponsor this spring of a methanol-powered vehicle rally
in which the automaker donated a dozen Chevrolet Corsicas for
modification by colleges and universities. The cars then were driven
from Detroit to Washington, via Canada and New England.
   Also this summer, Atlantic Richfield Co. began selling in
Southern California a new formula of a gasoline for use in older
cars that burn leaded fuel. The new gasoline, Arco has said, causes
less pollution.
   Another meeting of the automakers and oil company executives
tentatively is set for January, Automotive News said. By that time,
other oil companies were expected to join in the effort to steer
research toward revamped gasoline.
   Ideally, a new kind of gasoline would maintain the performance
characteristics of today's fuel while significantly cutting tailpipe
emissions.
   Elimination of methanol-fuel research programs could save
automakers millions of dollars in research and development and rule
out some potentially heavy competition for oil refiners.
   Methanol is distinctly different than gasoline and presents
automakers with a new set of design and engineering challenges.
   While methanol is cheaper than gasoline, more of it is needed to
provide the same power as gasoline, making fuel economy of methanol
lower than gasoline's. Also, unlike gasoline, methanol conducts
electricity, which could require extensive redesign of fuel
injection systems, and it is corrosive, which would require new
materials for the entire fuel delivery system.
   Producing methanol, which is derived from coal or natural gas,
also could prove costly for refiners concentrating on gasoline.
   In addition to developing cars that can run on methanol,
experiments are going on at each of the Big Three to develop a
vehicle that could run on a variety of fuels, such as methanol,
gasoline and ethanol, which is made from corn.

<HEAD>Toronto Bank Settles `Free-Riding' Case With SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and a
Toronto bank have settled charges that it violated federal banking
regulations in an alleged stock-buying scheme that cheated more than
100 brokerages.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed
Monday not to violate federal banking and securities laws governing
the extension of credit. The bank also agreed to cooperate with the
government's investigation of the case.
   The SEC last month accused Toronto-Dominion of illegally
extending credit to a group of investors known as Graycliff
International SA to buy millions of dollars worth of securities
without having enough money to pay for them.
   According to the civil suit filed Aug. 2 in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan, the bank allegedly allowed the investors to sell the
stock on the same day at a profit to cover their cost in a scheme
known as ``free-riding.''
   ``This is a very significant case from our point of view,'' said
Martin Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regional administrator in New
York.
   ``It sends an important message to the banking and stock
brokerage industry that the SEC is not going to stand for this type
of activity,'' he said. ``People have to pay for stock when they buy
it.''
   Kuperberg said officials knew of no other cases in which the SEC
had charged a bank involved in a free-riding case but that investors
had been charged in the past.
   He said there was no estimate of how much money the bank made
from the accounts set up by the Graycliff investors.
   Toronto-Dominion officials did not return a telephone call
seeking comment. The bank said in a statement at the time of the
suit that it had been cooperating with the SEC for several months
and was ``an innocent bystander'' to the investigation.
   The SEC charged investors Jury Matt Hansen and Fergus M. Sloan
Jr., and their New York brokerage firm, Fermat Associates, with
fraud in connection with the illegal stock-selling practice. The
bank was not charged with fraud.
   According to the suit, the investors through Graycliff opened an
account at the New York branch of Toronto-Dominion, which often
covered the investors' checks overnight when the funds in the
account were insufficient.
   The investors then allegedly opened about 250 accounts at more
than 100 brokerage using 76 phony names. The SEC claims that the
defendants used the accounts to buy and sell securities on the same
day beginning in December 1984.
   Tornoto-Dominion cleared both the buy and sell side of the stock
transactions, according to the SEC.
   The SEC suit claims the men made more than $1 million through the
scheme but left debts of $1.5 million at four brokerage houses at
which they had steep losses: Steinberg &amp; Lyman, Universal Securities
of America Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Dominick &amp; Dominick.
   The SEC said it found no losses at any other brokerages.
   Under its settlement, Toronto-Dominion also agreed to set up a
securities compliance committee to review the bank's credit policies
and implement a training program in the area.

<HEAD>Report: Mall Developer to Offer $1 Billion-Plus for Bloomingdale's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crown American Corp., the nation's fifth-largest
shopping mall developer, is considering a bid of more than $1
billion for the Bloomingdale's department store chain, a published
report said today.
   Frank J. Pasquerilla, Crown American's chairman and chief
executive, said that the company would make the bid ``if the
operating numbers we are asking for hold up,'' The New York Times
reported.
   Bloomingdale's parent, Toronto-based Campeau Corp., said Friday
it was putting the famous retailer on the block to help ease its
problems in making debt payments.
   Crown American's bid would be made in conjunction with Hess's
Inc., its 76-unit department store chain in the East.
   Campeau's board of directors is scheduled to meet formally today
to consider the proposal from Campeau management to sell New
York-based Bloomingdale's.
   Pasquerilla said he had contaced First Boston Corp., the
investment house, to obtain operating data on Bloomingdale's. He
said he was concerned primarily with the cash flow generated by the
upscale chain. He said any bid would not involve junk bonds, ``which
we don't like.''
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest operator of women's specialty
stores, also is said to be interested acquiring Bloomingdale's, the
Times reported.
   Maus Freres, the Swiss family that owns P.A. Bergner Co., the
Milwaukee retail chain, and Carson Pirie Scott Inc., the Chicago
department store company, also has expressed interest in
Bloomingdale's.
   In addition, Marvin S. Traub, Bloomingdale's chairman, has said
he will try to lead an investor group to buy the chain.
   Crown American owns 33 shopping malls, 19 hotels and other
properties.

<HEAD>Pilot Leaders Confident of Rank-and-File Support for UAL Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the United Airlines pilots union say
they are confident members will divert at least $200 million from a
retirement fund to buy stock in UAL Corp. as part of a $6.75 billion
buyout of the airline's parent company.
   ``Knowing these pilots as I do and knowing the history of this
thing, I think you're going to be oversubscribed in spades,'' said
James Damron, a spokesman for the United chapter of the Air Line
Pilots Association.
   Whether to commit retirement funds to the plan is a personal
choice each of the approximately 6,300 United pilots ALPA represents
will be asked to make, Damron said Monday.
   But rank-and-file approval would not be needed for the new
seven-year pilots contract that is also part of the
employee-management buyout plan, a contract that includes lower pay,
longer hours, shorter vacations and reduced medical benefits.
   ALPA outlined the proposed pilots contract in a 35-page document
mailed or distributed to members of the United chapter on Monday.
   Meanwhile, representatives of California investor Marvin Davis
began an examination of UAL's books to determine whether the Los
Angeles billionaire should raise his competing $6.19 billion offer
for the Chicago-based company.
   United's pilots are spearheading a buyout bid that also includes
UAL management, led by Chairman Stephen Wolf, and British Airways
PLC. Under the proposal, employees would own 75 percent of UAL,
British Airways would own 15 percent and management would own 10
percent.
   United's pilots have been seeking an ownership role in the
nation's second-largest airline since 1987, when union members
contributed $14 million to fund a study of an employee stock
ownership program, Damron said.
   The new pilots contract, replacing one that expired in April
1988, would be a seven-year pact with a no-strike clause.
   About two-thirds of United's pilots _ the senior pilots who
receive higher wages under the so-called A scale _ would have their
pay cut 10 percent.
   The more recently hired B-scale pilots, who earn only 55 percent
as much, would have their pay raised to 70 percent of the A scale
and gain higher pay for flying larger aircraft. They would then take
10 percent cuts as well.
   Pilots would have to work 85 hours a month instead of 80 as
currently required, but they wouldn't be paid for four of the
additional five hours.
   Some pilots would also have their medical benefits reduced via an
increased deductible. The mailing contained no details on the
cutback in vacation time.
   Damron said the pilots would like all of United's employees to
participate in the bid. But the Machinists, the airline's largest
unionized group with 25,000 workers, have expressed skepticism about
the proposed buyout, citing the enormous debt that would be incurred.
   United's 12,700 flight attendants are considering joining the
pilots and were to hear management's proposal today, said Pat
Friend, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants.
   Asked if the attendants would accept concessions similar to those
the pilot leaders agreed to, she said: ``As far as I know, the
flight attendants are not willing to give up anything. We haven't
for two years.''
   The flight attendants have been without a contract since November
1987.
   Davis and UAL signed a confidentiality agreement Friday giving
Davis access to the company's financial records in exchange for his
promise not to attempt a hostile takeover of the company for one
year.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Investor Interested In Share Of Stroh's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company controlled by a Milwaukee investor is
interested in obtaining a share of Stroh Brewery Co., which holds
the No. 3 ranking among U.S. brewers but has seen its standing erode.
   Christiana Companies Inc., of San Diego, has had discussions with
Stroh for about six weeks, said Sheldon Lubar, who heads Lubar &amp;
Co., a Milwaukee venture capital firm that owns a controlling stake
in Christiana.
   ``That's all it is, discussions,'' Lubar said Monday.
   Lubar, a former director of the Pabst Brewing Co., said
Christiana considered Stroh ``a worthwhile opportunity.''
   ``We are knowledgeable in the industry,'' he said. ``We have had
extensive conversations on the subject. I really can't say anymore.''
   Christiana, primarily a real estate company, has broadened its
holdings in recent months. In July, it bought a controlling interest
in Prideco Inc., a Houston-based supplier to the oil and gas
industry.
   John Collopy, president of the Milwaukee investment firm of
Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc., said he guessed that if
Christiana were successful, it would run Stroh primarily for cash.
   ``I don't think their intent in getting involved there was to
turn it around,'' Collopy said.
   Lacey Logan, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Stroh, said she
could not confirm whether Stroh had talked with Christiana.
   ``Any negotiations are confidential,'' Ms. Logan said. ``But we
are continuing our search for a minority investment.''
   Stroh has seen its market share drop to 10.7 percent in 1988 from
13 percent in 1983. The company earlier this month cut 300 jobs.
   Stroh announced this year that it was seeking a minority partner
to broaden its scope in the international beer market.
   Among those initially expressing interest was Bond Corp. Holdings
Ltd., a Perth, Australia, company that owns the G. Heileman Brewing
Co.
   More recently, Stroh reportedly has discussed deals with domestic
bidders, including Lubar, the Adolph Coors Brewing Co., and S&amp;P Co.,
owner of Pabst.
   Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter, said Monday
that Stroh rejected a $500 million bid in August from some of its
top management.
   Some analysts trace Stroh's current woes to its 1982 purchase of
Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.
   ``The continued decline in the Schlitz brand, combined with the
large amount of overhead (Stroh) bought _ I'm sure that is having a
deleterious effect on (Stroh's) bottom line,'' Collopy said.

   A study will begin this week into whether United
Auto Workers union members at a General Motors Corp. plant west of
Detroit have an unusually high brain cancer rate, the union and the
company say.
   The investigation will focus on employee exposure to chemicals at
the plant, which makes car and truck transmissions, GM and UAW
officials said Monday. The study will focus on GM's Hydra-Matic
plant in Ypsilanti, where about 7,300 hourly workers are employed.
   The study will be part of an ongoing investigation by Harvard
University into hazards caused by machine cutting fluids. Earlier
studies in the United States and Europe have linked the fluids to
increased risks of stomach, intestinal and lung cancers, but not
brain cancer.
   The company and the union said the study was prompted by concern
among employees about instances of brain cancer. It isn't known how
many Hydra-Matic workers have had the disease.
   Preliminary results are expected in about six months.

   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said it is discussing
the sale of part of its CIT Group financial services unit to
Japanese banking giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., but the New York
company refused to comment on overseas reports that a deal had been
struck for sale of the entire division.
   Nikkei Telecom, a Japanese financial newswire, and the Japanese
financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported Monday that
Dai-Ichi agreed to buy the CIT subsidiary for $1.5 billion. Both
reports said an announcement would come in a few days.
   The purchase would be the largest purchase of a U.S. company by a
Japanese bank, according to Nihon Keizai Shinbun. It also would be
the first significant U.S. purchase by Dai-Ichi, the world's largest
bank.
   CIT provides loans and leases to medium-sized businesses from
offices nationwide.
   In a terse statement issued a half hour before the stock market
closed Monday, Manufacturers Hanover confirmed ``serious
discussions'' with Dai-Ichi but referred to the proposal as a
``joint ownership of its wholly owned subsidiary, The CIT Group.''
   Manufactuers' stock closed up $2.87{ to $42.50 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   John Meyers, a Manufacturers Hanover spokesman, said the bank
would have no further comment on the form the deal might take. ``I
think the statement pretty much speaks for itself,'' he said.
   Dai-Ichi spokesman Yasutoshi Tonegawa said the two sides were
negotiating ``the possibility of capital participation'' in the CIT
group, but he said it was premature to say whether the result would
be a Dai-Ichi buyout or joint ownership.
   Banking analysts said such a deal would come as no surprise.
   ``The bank has indicated that it is in the throes of a
recapitalization plan that could amount to $1.5 to $2 billion, and
as part of that it could sell some of its assets,'' said James J.
McDermott Jr. of Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York.
   He said there had been speculation the company might increase its
reserves against Third World debt to an average 50 percent from the
current average 32 percent, and therefore need more capital.
   As of June 30, Manufacturers Hanover total loan-loss reserves was
$2.06 billion, down from $2.53 billion a year earlier.
   Manufacturers, the nation's seventh-largest banking company with
assets of $70 billion, purchased CIT from RCA Corp. in 1984 for $1.5
billion. CIT's assets totaled $9.3 billion at the end of last year
and earnings of $120.3 million.
   Dai-Ichi has assets of about $370 billion.

<HEAD>Intel's New Chip Solves Elusive Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of cramming more transistors onto
computer chips to make them to work faster, Intel Corp. has solved
the elusive problem of how to get the chips to carry out two tasks
at once at super-fast speeds.
   Intel today is showing off its 32-bit i960CA microprocessor, the
first commercial chip to employ ``super-scalar'' technology.
   The chip, which is smaller than a dime, packs 600,000 transistors
and is capable of carrying out up to 66 million instructions per
second. The i486 introduced last spring has twice as many
transistors but is less than half as fast as the i960CA.
   Super-scalar design allows a chip to execute more than one
instruction for each tick of its internal clock.
   ``Imagine a car wash that can run two lanes through at a time
instead of one,'' said Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter in Palo Alto. ``The car wash with two
lanes can obviously get more cars through in the same time.''
   Intel's speed rating for the i960CA chip is derived from taking
the chip's clock speed _ 33 million cycles per second _ and doubling
it.
   Many other chipmakers are working on super-scalar designs, said
Slater, who expects to see several of those products next year and
many more in 1991. Japanese chipmakers, though, are much more
focused on inexpensive processors for consumer products and not
putting as much effort in the high-end chips, such as super-scalar
technology, Slater said.
   ``This chip may or may not sell in large numbers over the next
year or two,'' Slater said. ``The high volume, high performance
markets have been elusive. I don't think there will be millions of
units sold in the next couple of years. But the super-scalar
technology will ultimately be high volume.''
   Millard H. Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco, said the i960 shows that ``we're going into a new era''
of microprocessors.
   ``Computers have been doing multitasking and multiprocessing and
we're going in that direction right down to the chip itelf,'' Phelps
said. ``That's quite a departure.''
   Intel, the company that invented the microprocessor, says the
i960CA is the fastest 32-bit chip yet. But the chip, which is
expected to be priced at about $300, isn't compatible with MS-DOS or
other software commonly used in desktop computers and isn't expected
to have an immediate impact on that market.
   Instead, the chip is aimed at laser printers, robot controllers,
telephone switching systems and automobiles of the future. The auto
industry, which is largely using 8-bit chips, is slowly moving into
faster 16-bit chips and may be several years away from using the
super-fast 32-bit chips to control brakes and engines.
   The i960 design has been endorsed by a group of avionics systems
suppliers and could have a significant impact in that field, said
Thomas A. Thornhill of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``That's a pretty strong endorsement for the architecture,''
Thornhill said.
   ``What I think is interesting beyond the product itself,''
Thornhill said, ``is that some of the design techniques used to
achieve the super-scalar architecture may be applicable to Intel's
other chips and may show up in other products, like the i860 and
future versions of the 486. In the past Intel has tended to do some
of its design work in modular form, so it can be applied or altered
for other chips.''
   Intel's i860 chip, introduced earlier this year, also is capable
of doing certain types of operations two at a time, but doesn't
employ the super-scalar design. The i860, a 64-bit microprocessor
with more than 1 million transistors, is capable of performing up to
80 million calculations per second. The $750 chip is designed for
high-end workstations and is more math-intensive than the i960CA.

   The 1990 Nissan Stanza sedan will cost $749, or
about 6 percent, less than the 1989 version of the car, the Japanese
automaker says.
   Robert Thomas, vice president and general manager of the Nissan
Division of Nissan Motor Corp., said Monday manufacturing
improvements and design changes enabled the automaker to cut the
base price of the Stanza XE to $11,450.
   A stronger dollar also is making imported cars more affordable as
domestic makers boost the prices on their 1990 cars. The Big Three
U.S. automakers have announced average price increases between 3.8
percent and 5 percent, with the prices of a few 1990 models less
than those for 1989s.
   The Stanza also will be offered as a GXE _ an upgraded version _
at a base price of $14,775.

   Dow Chemical Co. and United Technologies
Corp. today announced a joint venture to make plastics for the
aerospace, defense and automotive industries.
   Terms of the agreement were withheld. The companies said in a
joint statement the venture will focus on making materials for
United Technologies' Sikorsky Aircraft division.
   The new company, Dow-United Technologies Composite Products, will
employ about 500 people at its headquarters in Stratford, Conn., and
others at existing Dow facilities in Midland and the Sikorsky plant
in Tallassee, Ala.
   The companies said worldwide sales for advanced composite parts
were about $1 billion last year and would double by 1993. They
projected first-year sales of the new company of about $75 million,
growing to $600 million by the late 1990s.
   Final papers are to be signed in December with manufacturing to
begin shortly after that, the companies said.

<HEAD>Internal Investigation Reveals `Massive Fraud' At MiniScribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal report released by MiniScribe
Corp. says former senior managers of the computer disk-drive maker
have ``perpetrated a massive fraud'' on the company over the past
three years.
   The report released Monday by MiniScribe, a manufacturer of
computer disk drives, paints a picture of a company run amok under
the direction of then Chief Executive Officer Q.T. Wiles, once known
as the Dr. Fix It of the high-tech industry.
   MiniScribe stock closed Monday at $2.06\ per share in
over-the-counter trading, down 18} cents from Friday and down from
its 1988 high of nearly $14 per share.
   ``It appears that MiniScribe's senior management perpetrated a
massive fraud on the company, its directors, its outside auditors
and the investing public,'' said the report written by an internal
evaluation committee.
   ``This fraud was all the more alarming in that it required the
active participation of many company personnel, and was apparently
common knowledge among a great many other employees.''
   Under pressure from investor lawsuits, MiniScribe initiated the
in-house investigation last March into possible misconduct under the
Wiles administration. A copy of the 1,500-page report that emerged
was given Monday to the enforcement division of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Regulators there will determine if legal action is warranted and
the U.S. Justice Department could become involved if criminal
prosecution is pursued.
   According to the report, MiniScribe was so poorly managed at the
time that senior officials, including Wiles, fabricated company
financial statements with tactics that included shipping bricks and
scrap parts disguised as computer disk drives to confuse auditors.
   Wiles ran the company from April 1985 until his resignation in
February 1989. His entire management team also has departed.
   Wiles, 70, had led MiniScribe through a remarkable turnabout from
April 1985 through 1988. Using $20 million from the venture capital
firm of San Francisco-based Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Wiles brought the
company back from the verge of bankruptcy.
   By injecting MiniScribe with the $20 million and ruthlessly
slashing costs, Wiles boosted sales from $113.9 million in 1985 to a
now-disputed $603 million in 1988.
   MiniScribe reported a $14.6 million loss for the fourth quarter
of 1988. It was shortly thereafter that Wiles stepped down and
essentially disappeared.
   In May, MiniScribe announced that its financial reports for 1986,
1987 and the first three quarters of 1988 were not reliable. On
Monday, the compoany said its restated financial results will show
that the company has a negative net worth.
   Richard C. Rifenburgh, the new chief executive officer, said
Monday, ``It is now up to the company to move forward to solve the
remaining problems.
   ``At the same time, we must ensure that MiniScribe reaps the
benefits of the hard work and the dedication that employees have
exhibited during these difficult times.''
   Despite an anticipated $500 million in sales this year,
MiniScribe will likely post large losses, Rifenburgh said.

<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. announced Tuesday, as expected,
that Joseph J. Collins would head its cable division, which will be
called the Time Warner Cable Group and is the nation's second
largest cable system operator.
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. had said when they
announced plans to merge last March that Collins, the chairman and
chief executive of Time's 82 percent-owned American Television and
Communications Corp., would head their combined cable operations.
   Collins will retain his posts at the Stamford, Conn.-based ATC as
well as become chairman and president of Time Warner Cable Group.
   Reporting to Collins will be James H. Doolittle, ATC's president
and chief operating officer; James L. Gray, president and chief
executive of Warner Cable; Richard Aurelio, president of the group's
New York City cable operations; and Tommy J. Harris, the Time Inc.
controller who has been named vice president of finance for the
cable group.
   ATC provides cable TV service to 4.3 million homes in 33 states;
Warner Cable serves about 1.7 million customers in 22 states. The
combined operation is second only to Telecommunications Inc., based
in Denver and serving nearly 10 million cable customers.
   The newly-named Time Warner owns about 59 percent of Warner's
stock following completion of Time's tender offer in July of $70 a
share for about half of Warner's stock. It intends to acquire the
remainder of Warner's shares later this year in exchange for an
as-yet undisclosed package that may include cash, stock and other
securities.

<HEAD>Defendants Seek to Have Verdict Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six defendants convicted of unlawful
securities trading in the Princeton-Newport Partners LP case have
asked a federal judge to overturn the verdict on the grounds that
the trading was legal.
   In a memorandum filed Monday with U.S. District Judge Robert L.
Carter, attorneys for the defendants also argued that the
racketeering statute they were convicted under is
``unconstitutionally vague.''
   Five former partners in the defunct investment firm and a former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader were convicted July 31 on 63 of
64 counts in the first securities racketeering case ever. The jury
required the defendants to forfeit $3.8 million in assets.
   Prosecutors recently filed a separate memorandum with Carter
seeking to force the defendants to forfeit $19.2 million, the full
amount possible under the racketeering law. Carter has indicated he
is inclined to overrule the jury.
   Two of the counts were charged under the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which carries stiff prison
terms and a requirement to forfeit profits from the alleged
wrongdoing plus interest and salaries during the period.
   The defendants in the case are are former Princeton-Newport
officials James Sutton Regan, Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles Zarzecki,
Paul A. Berkman and Steven B. Smotrich, and former Drexel trader
Bruce Lee Newberg..
   The case overlaps the government's 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment of former Drexel financier Michael Milken.
Much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at Milken's
trial, scheduled to begin in March 1990.
   Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in
Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., went out of business
after the indictment was brought last August. Neither
Princeton-Newport nor Drexel were charged in the case.
   The defendants were convicted of various conspiracy,
racketeering, mail, wire and securities fraud charges. The
government alleged they arranged to sell securities at a loss and
then repurchase them later in a scheme to generate bogus tax losses.
   In their memo, the Princeton-Newport lawyers argued that the
trades were legal under Internal Revenue Service guidelines and
other cases allowed similar trades.
   They also said the racketeering statute was vague, citing a
recent Superme Court case in which four justices invited a
constitutional challenge to the law on the grounds of vagueness.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Lack Of Frost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a lack
of frost overnight in the Midwest and forecasts for better crop
weather next week.
   Trading activity was quiet and cautious ahead of this afternoon's
Agriculture Department crop report, which was expected to contain
lower corn and soybean harvest estimates than the agency projected
in August.
   Overnight temperatures in the Corn Belt dropped into the upper
30s in parts of Iowa and Minnesota but fears of a frost were not
realized.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued late
Monday predicted warmer, drier weather for the Midwest next week,
which should spell relief for farmers weary of recent rains.
   ``That's just what they need for the crops,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.91{ a bushel; corn
was { cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.38 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1\ cents lower with September at $1.37{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with September at $6.05{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .53 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in October at 72.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.15 cent to .55 cent higher with September at 82.65 cents a pound;
hog futures were .22 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at
38.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .32 cent
higher with February at 46.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled narrowly mixed on Monday.

<TEXT>
   WPP Group PLC, the British-based advertising and
marketing services giant, said Tuesday it has agreed to buy Seiniger
Advertising Inc., a Los Angeles-based agency that specializes in
marketing movies.
   The deal calls for an initial payment of $10 million in cash and
stock and additional payments of up to another $20 million in cash
and stock based on the agency's financial performance over the next
four years.
   Seiniger was launched in 1974 and has marketed over 650 movies,
including campaigns for the movies ``Bull Durham,'' ``Indiana Jones
and The Last Crusade,'' ``Jaws'' and ``The Untouchables.''
   The announcement said senior management of Seiniger Advertising,
including founder and president Tony Seiniger and executive vice
presidents Michael Kaiser and William Manger, have signed long-term
service contracts.
   The London-based WPP said the acquisition will strengthen its
presence in the fast-growing field of entertainment marketing, which
it said amounted to $1.4 billion in the United States last year and
is growing at a 20 percent annual rate.
   WPP already owns JWT Entertainment Group, which markets motion
pictures, entertainment videos and television programming from
headquarters in Los Angeles and New York.
   WPP is the second-largest advertising and marketing services
holding company in the world behind Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., also
based in London.
   Its holdings include the advertising companies J. Walter Thompson
and Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide; the public relations firm Hill and
Knowlton and an assortment of market research, marketing services,
design and specialty advertising firms.

   Tandy Corporation said today it has
signed a letter of intent to purchase the Victor and Micronic
computer subsidiaries of Datatronic AB of Sweden.
   Sales of Victor and Micronic products exceeded $200 million in
1988, placing Victor among the top personal computer companies in
Europe, Tandy said.
   Tandy will acquire the rights to the Victor and Micronic names
for microcomputers and hand-held computers in the transaction, which
is being made for an undisclosed price. Tandy expects to fund the
acquisition using internal funds and existing borrowing arrangements.
   Victor sells desktop and laptop computers through a network of
2,700 dealers and distributors in Europe. Its primary markets are
medium-size businesses and educational customers, said Philip M.
Bradtmiller, director of investor relations for Tandy.
   He said Victor's market channels will complement Tandy's European
sales through InterTan stores, which supply individual and small
business customers the way its Radio Shack subsidiary does in the
United States.
   Tandy Chairman John V. Roach said Tandy's GRiD division will be
augmented by Micronic's resources in the hand-held computer and
field automation business.
   Bradtmiller said the acquisition will help Tandy prepare for the
changes in Europe brought on by the common market agreement to begin
in 1992.
   The transaction is subject shareholder and regulator approval.

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network today said it is considering an
evening newscast to compete directly with the big three TV networks.
   The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or
6:30 p.m. EDT ``to go head-to-head with the networks,'' and CNN
anchorman Bernard Shaw could have a role on the program, CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But he said CNN officials haven't made a final determination of
whether a frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather would be a good idea.
   ``There are a number of changes we're talking about, and that's
one of the changes,'' he said.
   The proposal calls for a half-hour, stand-alone newscast, unlike
CNN's virtually 24-hour, all-news format, in which the news is
continuously updated.
   CNN currently runs news in the 6-6:30 period and shows the
entertainment news program ``Show Biz Today'' at 6:30 p.m., when
NBC, ABC and CBS air the first of their evening news feeds, or
transmissions to affiliate stations. The networks also produce an
updated feed at 7 p.m.
   Haworth said speculation that Catherine Crier would be co-anchor
of the program was premature. The Texas judge was hired Monday as a
newscaster.
   ``She's on the bench until the end of September. When she comes
up with us, and starts doing some training, we'll start figuring
what anchor role she'll be playing with us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. claimed a victory today in
a legal fight with three competitors in the cookie business,
announcing that the companies have agreed to pay P&amp;G $125 million
for violating its patent on crisp and chewy cookies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Frito-Lay Inc. have agreed to pay P&amp;G a total of $125 million, which
will be reflected as part of P&amp;G's first-quarter earnings for fiscal
1988-89.
   The three companies agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S.
District Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where P&amp;G had
filed its lawsuits, the company announced today.
   The Cincinnati-based P&amp;G markets its crisp and chewy cookies
under the name Duncan Hines. The company filed separate lawsuits
against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay in June 1984. The lawsuits
were consolidated for court handling and had been scheduled to go to
trial Oct. 2.
   The settlement averts the need for trial and allows the companies
to avoid trial costs.
   The agreement states that P&amp;G's patent is valid and enforceable.
The agreement prevents the three companies from infringing P&amp;G's
patent in the future, P&amp;G officials said.
   P&amp;G spokesman Donald Tassone refused today to say how much each
of the three companies would be paying P&amp;G individually. He said the
settlement agreement requires that the companies not divulge its
terms publicly.
   P&amp;G introduced its ready-to-eat, crisp and chewy cookies in 1983.
Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of
cookie, P&amp;G said. Keebler is a subsidiary of United Biscuits PLC of
Britain, Nabisco is part of RJR Nabisco Inc. and Frito-Lay is owned
by PepsiCo Inc.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after P&amp;G sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell cookies that P&amp;G
regards as violating its patent, he said.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''

9.4-percent stake in the advertising and communications giant.
   Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said from his Milwaukee,
Wisc., office that the company welcomed the shareholding.
   ``They have a knack for spotting value in the service field more
so than many other people,'' Fromstein said.
   ``It doesn't surprise me that they've taken the stake,''
Fromstein said. ``If they took a bigger share, it wouldn't make me
uncomfortable. I'm certain it's a friendly investment.''
   Blue Arrow shares were unchanged at 108 pence, or $1.67, by
midafternoon on London's Stock Exchange.
   A number of recent events have depressed Blue Arrow's share
price. In April, Blue Arrow's former chairman, Tony Berry, was
ousted and replaced by Mitchell Fromstein, the head of employment
services concern Manpower Inc. which Blue Arrow acquired in 1987 in
a $1.34 billion takeover bid.
   The takeover of the Milwaukee-based employment agency tripled
Blue Arrow's size and had created an uneasy alliance between the two
companies' chairmen.
   Blue Arrow shares have lagged on disappointing earnings growth
and news of a government investigation into events surrounding a
controversial $39 million loan which Blue Arrow made last December
to a company controlled by British property developer and yachtsman
Peter de Savary.

<HEAD>Test of ATM Cards to Buy Stamps a Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can buy gas and groceries with your
automated teller card these days, so why not stamps?
   The Postal Service decided to test that question at five offices,
and officials say the program has been a smash so far.
   Using Interlink systems provided by First Interstate Bank, three
Santa Ana post offices and two in Irvine have been accepting the
cards for about two months.
   The system works like this: The customer hands his ATM card to a
postal clerk, who passes the magnetic strip through a reader that
records the customer's name and account number. The customer enters
his secret code and the amount of purchase into a hand-held keyboard.
   ``We are very happy with it,'' said Florinda Bailey, manager of
commercial accounts at the Postal Service's Santa Ana division,
which encompasses most of Orange County and parts of Los Angeles
County.
   The average ATM card purchase is $33.69, up from $27.04 worth of
stamps when the program began and before a promotional program, Ms.
Bailey told The Orange County Register.
   Each system costs about $800, a price expected to drop if the
Postal Service goes ahead with the systems around the nation. The
trial program runs for another 10 months.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Retreat On Lack Of Frost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices fell moderately
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by a lack of
overnight frost in the Midwest and forecasts for improved crop
weather next week.
   Oat and wheat futures also retreated.
   Temperatures dropped into the upper 30s Monday night in parts of
Iowa and Minnesota, not cold enough to damage the maturing crops.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued late
Monday predicted warmer, drier weather for the Midwest next week,
``and that's just what the crops need,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department issued a new crop
report revising downward its August estimates for 1989 U.S. corn and
soybean production.
   The USDA projected the corn crop at 7.32 billion bushels,
compared with its August estimate of 7.35 billion and last year's
harvest of 4.92 billion.
   The agency pegged 1989 soybean production at 1.89 billion
bushels, compared with last month's estimate of 1.91 billion and
last year's harvest of 1.54 billion.
   The soybean number was near expectations and should have little
market impact; the corn estimate was slightly higher than expected
and could prompt some selling of corn futures on Wednesday.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 2\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.93 a bushel; corn was
2{ cents to 4 cents lower with September at $2.36 a bushel; oats
were 1} cents to 4 cents lower with September at $1.36{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 6\ cents lower with September at $6.03 a
bushel.

   Energy futures prices headed lower in lackluster
trading Tuesday, reflecting continued concerns about overproduction
among some OPEC member nations.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell
6 cents to $19.70 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract had risen 1 cent
on Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery lost 0.18 cent at
56.89 cents a gallon, after falling 0.02 cent Monday.
   October heating oil, which slipped 0.73 cent the previous
session, ended down 0.64 cent at 55.37 cents a gallon.
   James Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc. in New York,
attributed Tuesday's market downturn to internal market influences
and continued concerned that several members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries were exceeding cartel quotas.
   For instance, he quoted reports that Iran and Iraq were pumping
higher levels of crude oil after recently upgrading production
equipment.
   However, Steel said, strong domestic demand was keeping crude
prices from falling even further than they have in recent days.

<HEAD>Profit Declines in 3rd-Qtr Due to Charge for Failed Time Bid</HEAD>

   Paramount Communications Inc. said Tuesday its
third-quarter profit tumbled 20.1 percent as a hefty charge stemming
from its failed bid for Time Inc. more than offset a strong showing
in entertainment.
   The overall results fell largely within expectations although
some analysts said they were disappointed that Paramount's
publishing operations posted only a modest improvement from a year
ago.
   Paramount, which changed its name from Gulf &amp; Western Inc. in
June, said it earned $96.3 million, or 80 cents per share, for the
three months ended July 31, compared with $120.5 million, or $1 a
share, a year earlier.
   The earnings results reflected a $48.3 million after-tax charge
for costs incurred in Paramount's failed bid for Time. Time, which
had already agreed to merge with Warner Communications Inc.,
rejected the offer from Paramount.
   Analysts said Paramount's charge had been widely anticipated, and
focused on the company's operating income from continuing
operations, which rose 17.3 percent to $145.3 million from $123.9
million.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 19.6 percent to $950.6 million from
$795.1 million a year earlier.
   The revenue figures exclude revenue from The Associates, the
financial services company which Paramount has agreed to sell to
Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion in a deal expected to be completed
by Oct. 31. The company failed to provide revenue figures for The
Associates although its results were included in the earnings
figures.
   ``The results were fairly good, despite some weak spots in
publishing,'' said Andrew Wallach, who follows the entertainment
company stocks for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Jack Kelly, who follows diversified companies for the investment
firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., agreed with that assessment, saying
``Publishing was disappointing but entertainment was above
expectations.''
   Paramount said it had record third-quarter operating income from
its entertainment operations as revenue rose substantially at its
motion picture, television and theater operations.
   Wallach said operating income in entertainment rose 48.7 percent
to $57.5 million while revenue rose 23.6 percent to $506.5 million.
   The strong results from motion picture operations reflected the
performances of movies such as ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,
``Pet Sematary'' and ``Major League'' in U.S. markets and ``The
Accused'' and ``Naked Gun'' in foreign markets.
   The company said television operations reflected the success of
``The Arsenio Hall Show'' and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
that results from its theater operations were up, partly because of
attendance increases generated by a larger number of successful
motion picture releases.
   The Madison Square Garden unit had a loss of unspecified
magnitude, however, due to the closing of the facility for
renovations this summer.
   An increase in results from publishing reflected gains in
educational publishing that more than offset declines in consumer
publishing and professional information operations, the company said.
   Wallach said publishing revenue rose 15.2 percent to $444.1
million, while operating income rose 4.2 percent to $103.9 million.
   He said the Paramount consumer books segment is weak because
``they don't have a hit right now.'' Kelly said orders for old
titles were also sluggish.
   Wallach said the professional information operations, which
consist mainly of a tax information service, generated flat revenue
and increased costs.
   Kelly said the tax service's performance ``may trigger the sale
of the unit over the next few months.''
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Paramount said its
earned $231.1 million, or $1.93 a share, down 4 percent from $240.7
million, or $2 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 14.2 percent to $2.42 billion from $2.12
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Steel Giants Plan to Expand Joint Venture with $450 Million Facility</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of Inland Steel Industries Inc. and
Nippon Steel Corp. on Tuesday announced plans to spend $450 million
to build two steel-coating lines at their nearly completed
joint-venture plant in Indiana.
   The lines, called I-N Kote, should strengthen Inland's position
as a supplier to the appliance and auto industries, primary markets
for corrosion-resistant coated steel products, said Frank Luerssen,
chairman and chief executive of the company, at a news conference.
   The move will ``measurably strengthen our joint commitment to
meet the needs for differentiated steel products in the American
market,'' Luerssen said. ``We now see customers lining up to get
their share of the materials.''
   The two production lines will have an annual capacity of 900
finished tons and will be constructed next to a nearly completed New
Carlisle, Ind., plant, where Inland and Nippon are finishing work on
a continuous cold-rolling mill called I-N Tek.
   I-N Tek and Inland Steel's Indiana Harbor Works in East Chicago,
Ind., will provide all the sheet steel for I-N Kote.
   The $900 million complex being built at New Carlisle, Ind., by
Chicago-based Inland and Tokyo-based Nippon is believed to represent
the largest spending program so far for an American-Japanese joint
venture in the United States.
   It will bring 400 new jobs to the South Bend, Ind., area.
   The new coating lines will take the cold-rolled steel produced at
the plant and coat it, using an electrogalvanizing process or a
hot-dip line.
   Automakers use galvanized steel's higher-grade sheets on exposed
car panels and hot-dipped sheets for such things as panels for light
truck beds.
   Inland, the sixth-largest steel company in the nation, supplies
the three major U.S. carmakers _ Ford, Chrysler and General Motors _
and major Japanese auto manufacturers, including Honda, Nissan and
Toyota.
   Nippon is the largest steel maker in the world, exporting about 8
million tons.
   Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon, said the venture with Inland
represented a joint commitment to Japanese carmakers who have built
U.S. plants and to American companies with a demand for the
materials.
   Saito said the new plant will be entirely operational in 1991,
with I-N Tek beginning operations next year.
   Such ventures, he said, work to ease tensions about the trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
   ``I am confident that this undertaking will play a major symbolic
role as a constructive attempt to resolve issues between the two
economies through mutual understanding and cooperation,'' Saito said
in a prepared statement.
   Nippon and Inland will contribute $150 million each to I-N Kote,
with the rest sponsored by debt-financing. Inland is assuming 60
percent of the construction costs for I-N Tek, also a joint venture.
   Inland this year has experienced three consecutive quarterly
declines, blamed partly on seasonal softness in orders, but Luerssen
predicted a small gain for the company's fourth quarter.

<HEAD>`Rambo' Producer in Joint Venture to Distribute Films for TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carolco Pictures Inc. took a big step Tuesday
into the fast-growing foreign market for TV programming, announcing
a joint venture to buy, sell and lease television distribution
rights for movies in markets outside the United States and Canada.
   Carolco, known for producing such action pictures as the
``Rambo'' movies, will team with Paravision International SA, a
subsidiary of L'Oreal SA, in the enterprise. The joint venture will
be called Carolco Paravision Television International V.O.F., with
offices in New York and London.
   Paravision controls TV and video rights for a library of 3,500
feature films, and will give the joint venture selections from that
huge library as well as the services of its worldwide facilities and
employees.
   Carolco International NV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Carolco
Pictures, will contribute all foreign TV rights currently owned by
Carolco and its affiliates, and also all future foreign TV rights
Carolco acquires and foreign TV rights to its own films.
   ``The foreign television marketplace is the fastest-growing
sector of the entertainment industry,'' Carolco co-chairman Mario
Kassar said.
   ``The combination of Carolco's product, the foreign television
expertise of Paravision's management and the opportunities to
acquire additional foreign rights, will establish the partnership as
one of the dominant players in this important market.''
   Carolco has been in turmoil in recent months. Andrew Vajna, who
co-founded the company with Kassar, has been negotiating for several
months to sell his 36 percent share in the company to Kassar.
   And Carolco's stock price has fallen about 10 percent since the
murder last month in Beverly Hills of the chairman of Live
Entertainment Inc. Carolco owns a 49 percent share in Live, a video
company which Carolco had said was expected to contribute
substantially to the Carolco's earnings.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee searched Tuesday
for ways to scale back catastrophic-illness protection for retirees
in a last-ditch effort to prevent repeal of the program, which has
drawn the ire of many older Americans.
   ``There was a recognition that there certainly is the possibility
of repeal,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the panel,
said after a closed-door session with members. ``There is no
question in my mind that we are going to face an amendment on the
(Senate) floor to repeal catastrophic.''
   There apparently is even stronger sentiment in the House for
repeal _ a fact made clear Tuesday to the Bush administration.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush is ``feeling the heat'' from complaining retirees but is not
sure that repeal is the best way to fix the program. The
administration prefers to work on changing the taxes that finance
catastrophic care, Fitzwater said.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who, along with
other GOP leaders, met with Bush, said he has noted ``a dramatic
shift'' in the administration's willingness to amend the program.
   ``We recognize the impact on the elderly,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
recognize their concern. We're working with Congress ..., searching
for a way to mitigate the financial problems and save the program.''
   To stave off repeal, Bentsen said, the committee is now
attempting to strip away all but basic elements of the program to
reduce costs to the minimum. This could lead to elimination of most
benefits for prescription drugs and for skilled nursing care, the
chairman said.
   Catastrophic illness coverage was enacted with fanfare last year
to protect Medicare beneficiaries from financial ruin brought on by
the cost of serious illness. Everyone eligible for Medicare is
required to pay into the program.
   The additional coverage is under heavy attack from two groups of
retirees: some who are covered by private and employer-financed
insurance and don't need catastrophic-care coverage, and some who
are higher-income Americans having to pay for protection for those
at the bottom of the economic scale.
   Responding to those protests, the House Ways and Means Committee
already has voted to reduce benefits and the two taxes that finance
the program.
   About two-thirds of the costs are paid by retirees whose incomes
are high enough that they pay more than $150 a year in federal
income taxes. They must pay a surtax _ up to $800 _ of 15 percent of
their income taxes. About 40 percent of all retirees are liable for
the surtax this year.
   The remainder of the program is financed by a flat $4 monthly
premium paid by all but the poorest of the 33 million people
eligible for Medicare.
   The Finance Committee agreed informally last week that the surtax
would be cut significantly, that the flat monthly premium would not
be changed and that beneficiaries would have to pay a bigger share
of expenses for drugs and doctors' bills before reimbursement under
the catastrophic-care program begins.
   Tuesday's committee session indicated, however, that that
apparently was not enough to mollify those who want repeal.
   As a result, Bentsen said, ``what we are trying to do is
structure a bill with essential parts ... that gets it back to a
more-catastrophic bill instead of the long-term benefits, ... which
seem to be exploding costs.''
   When catastrophic-illness protection was enacted last year, it
was predicted to cost about $31 billion over five years. The latest
forecasts put that figure at $45 billion or more. Skilled-nursing
benefits and prescription drugs are major factors in the escalation.
   Bentsen and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a member
of the committee, complained that the administration's concern
appears to be based mainly on budget considerations _ not on how
catastrophic-illness coverage or its repeal would affect older
Americans.
   The program is based on an insurance concept, so taxes to finance
it are being collected at a faster rate than benefits are being
paid. As a result, repeal would deprive the treasury of $4 billion
to $7 billion this year and worsen the federal deficit by that
amount.
   Unless the budget law is waived, repeal of the program would
require Congress to raise taxes to make up for the revenue loss.
Otherwise, repeal would trigger across-the-board cuts in most
federal programs.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard Unveils Low-Cost Workstation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO Alto, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced a
low-cost workstation Tuesday, the first computer product unveiled
since it acquired its former rival, Apollo Computer Inc.
   The electronics company, which bought Apollo last April for $476
million, announced the Apollo Series 2500, its lowest cost
workstation. Priced at $3,990, it's also one of the cheapest in the
field.
   The workstation uses a 68030 microprocessor from Motorola Inc.
and comes with 4 megabytes of internal memory and a monochrome
display monitor. But unlike more advanced workstations, it's not
capable of displaying color graphics.
   David Perozek, general manager of H-P's Apollo Systems division,
said the Apollo Series 2500 had been planned before the
Hewlett-Packard purchase and proved the two companies were working
well together.
   But analysts said Hewlett-Packard is not assured of holding on to
its lead in workstations, or powerful desktop computers, unless it
creates bold products that can compete with industry leaders such as
Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View.
   The 2500 runs software developed for Apollo's line of
workstations, which use a version of the Unix operating system known
as Domain. H-P uses its own version of Unix. The two companies said
they plan to offer software that will work with both computer lines,
but that they will not be available for two to three years.
   Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services, a Palo
Alto consulting firm, said Hewlett-Packard had to unveil a low-cost
product to be competitive with Sun. He also said the current
workstation price war will make it hard for companies to get enough
profits from their products.
   ``You can't afford to sell those things at that price,'' said
Merrin. ``The bigger companies will be able to take a hit for awhile
and the smaller ones will not. Dropping prices like that is crazy,
but competitively you've got to be there,'' Merrin said.
   H-P's Apollo division also announced on Tuesday graphics software
and hardware products for use with top-of-the line Apollo
workstations. With prices ranging from $20,000 to $35,000, the
desktop visualization system allows engineers to see clear
representations of their designs simulated on a computer screen.

   Berkshire Hathaway Inc. stock, already at
Everest-like heights, gained another $275 a share on Tuesday to
close at $8,575 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Investors are flocking to Berkshire Hathaway because of the
stock-picking reputation of the holding company's chairman, Warren
Buffett, who is sometimes called the ``oracle of Omaha'' for his
success in choosing solid companies with good long-term prospects.
   The stock is up 80 percent since last Nov. 29, when it began
trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $4,750 a share. Before
that it had been listed over-the-counter.
   Most companies split their stock when it gets too high so that
round lots of 100 shares remain affordable to small investors. But
people familar with Buffett say he likes the special image that the
high price gives to Berkshire Hathaway.
   ``No plans to do anything,'' J. Verne McKenzie, the chief
financial officer, said in a five-word interview Tuesday when asked
whether the company was considering a split.
   The New York Stock Exchange changed its rules last year in a way
that permits Berkshire Hathaway stock to be traded in round lots of
10 shares instead of the usual 100. Extra commission is charged on
smaller, odd lots, but many investors nonetheless buy a single share.
   Berkshire Hathaway's high stock price is the result of having
relatively few shares outstanding. For example, if Exxon Corp. had
as few shares as Berkshire Hathaway, its price per share would be
$14,000 instead of about $45.
   The price of Bershire Hathaway shares is so large, many
newspapers have trouble squeezing the full price of Berkshire
Hathaway into their listings. At The Associated Press, a computer
program that processes stock prices had to be modified Tuesday when
it was discovered that the share price exceeded the program's
previous per-share ceiling of $8,192.
   Berkshire Hathaway has holdings in companies ranging from
Coca-Cola Co. to Gillette Co., Salomon Inc., Capital Cities-ABC
Inc., insurance companies, a candy maker and an encyclopedia
publisher. Buffett's family holding of 45 percent of Berkshire
Hathaway's stock makes him a billionaire.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was narrowly mixed Tuesday, marking
time as traders awaited a batch of economic reports to be issued
later in the week.
   Gold prices also were mixed.
   Traders were reluctant to make significant adjustments to their
positions in advance of the reports due out of Washington on
Thursday and Friday, analysts said.
   The government will issue its August retail sales figures on
Thursday, and on Friday, reports on the July trade deficit and
August producer prices and industrial production will be released.
   The reports are expected to give some indication of how the
economy is faring, and consequently, clues on whether the Federal
Reserve will adjust its policy on interest rates. Dollar traders are
hoping the Fed will tighten credit, which moves interest rates
higher and is bullish for the U.S. currency.
   Analysts said the market was most concerned about the producer
price report, which will indicate whether inflation is accelerating.
If inflation is strengthening, the Fed would be expected to nudge
interest rates upward.
   In overseas trading, there were unconfirmed rumors that the Bank
of Japan intervened in Asian trading. No other central banks were
sighted in the markets during the day.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5470 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5450 late Monday.
In later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.5485 from $1.5460.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.9865 West German marks, unchanged; 1.7140 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7135; 6.6920 Swiss francs, up from 6.6910;
1,422.125 Italian lire, down from 1,425.875; and 1.8725 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.18715.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.9880 West German marks, up from 1.9875; 1.7160
Swiss francs, up from 1.7150; 6.6950 French francs, down from
6.6970; 2.2330 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2425; 1,421.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,424.75; and 1.1892 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1873.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.04 yen to close at 146.73 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 147.08 yen, and in New York, the dollar edged up to
146.905 yen from 146.70 late Monday.
   In New York gold trading, Republic National Bank quoted a late
bid of $385.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up 40 cents from late
Monday, and on the Commodity Exchange, gold edged up 30 cents to
close at $359.50.
   In earlier London trading, gold was unchanged at a late bid of
$358.75 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid of $358.55 compared
with Friday's $360.00. Markets were closed Monday afternoon in
Zurich for a holiday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.03 an ounce to close at a bid of
$359.93.
   Silver bullion prices rose in New York after holding steady in
London. On the Commodity Exchange, silver rose 1.8 cents to close at
$5.069 a troy ounce, and in London, the metal was unchanged at a
late bid of $5.08 a troy ounce.

   The stock market managed its second gain in the
past six sessions on Tuesday as trading picked up slightly from
Monday's snail-like pace.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.85 to 2,707.26
after losing 5.13 points in the previous session.
   With no major influences on the market, stock prices fluctuated
in a narrow range except for an early surge that briefly carried the
Dow Jones industrials up about 14 points.
   Stock prices had fallen in four of the five sessions preceding
Tuesday's rise amid continuing concern about the outlook for
interest rates and the economy.
   Since Labor Day the Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 45
points. The market is looking for direction and may get some at the
end of this week, when the government issues a slew of reports on
the economy, including the trade deficit, inflation and factory
output.
   Traders attributed the brief morning rise Tuesday to a rally in
Chicago that pushed stock index futures to a premium. That
encouraged arbitragers to sell the futures and buy the underlying
stocks.
   ``In these quieter periods the indexes have had more intra-day
impact,'' said Austin George, head of equity trading at T. Rowe
Price Associates in Baltimore.
   ``It surely seems more like the middle of August than the middle
of September,'' George said.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
824 up, 632 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.14 million
shares, up from 126.02 million in the previous session, which had
been the slowest day since July 3.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.15 million shares.
   Datapoint led the list of actively traded NYSE issues, falling {
to 5] on 2.7 million shares. New York investor Asher Edelman, the
chairman, said he raised his stake to more than 40 percent by buying
3 million shares Monday and Tuesday. Martin S. Ackerman, a
shareholder who is trying to kick Edelman off the board, said he
would challenge the legality of the purchases.
   Among other actively traded NYSE stocks, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph rose { to 40{, Warner Communications was unchanged at 64[,
McDonald's was up | at 29|, Exxon was up } at 45], and Unocal was up
2| at 57}.
   Semiconductor stocks rose strongly, with Texas Instruments up ~
to 41[, Motorola up 1[ to 56|, Advanced Micro Devices up [ to 8{ and
National Semiconductor up ] to 7|.
   MiniScribe, the most actively traded over-the-counter stock, lost
another } to 1 5-16 a share. The maker of computer data-storage
devices said previous senior management perpetrated a fraud on
investors by reporting exaggerated growth.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $11.32 billion, or 0.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.58 to 193.88.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.25 to 399.24, and S&amp;P's

   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Tumble On Dimming Chances For Quota Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices plunged Tuesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange on indications the United States will not support a
return to international export quotas that would raise coffee prices.
   On other markets, sugar futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans
were lower; energy futures weakened; precious metals advanced; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   All New York coffee futures except the contract for September
delivery plunged the permitted daily limit of 6 cents a pound. The
limitless September contract tumbled 6.68 cents to 81.48 cents a
pound, a 2{-week low.
   Analysts said prices plummeted amid panicked selling prompted by
a report that the Bush administration will reject Colombia's plea
for U.S. support in pushing for a resumption of export quotas among
producer members of the International Coffee Organization.
   The 74-nation cartel suspended the quotas in July amid discord
caused in part by U.S. demands for controls on sales of coffee at
cut-rate prices to Soviet-bloc nations that are not ICO members. The
United States is the organization's largest consumer member.
   Coffee prices had strengthened in the past two weeks on
speculation that the Bush administration would take a more
conciliatory stance in ICO talks as part of its war on drugs.
   A return to export quotas would lead to higher coffee prices and
help the economy of Colombia, which needs money to battle cocaine
cartels. Colombian President Virgilio Barco sent a letter to
President Bush lask week, saying the sharp drop in coffee prices
since July 3 was having ``devastating consequences'' on the
Colombian economy and urging Bush to support a return to the coffee
quota system.
   State Department officials would not confirm Tuesday's report
that Bush will reject Barco's plea.
   But in a related development, Sen. Richard Lugar, who sits on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters the United States
will not waver in its opposition to the existing International
Coffee Agreement.
   Sugar futures prices soared in New York after the United States
announced it had raised its 1989 sugar import quota by 860,000
metric tons to 1.99 million and had extended the import quota period
by nine months to Sept. 30, 1990.
   Sugar futures rose .37 cent to .54 cent with October at 13.95
cents a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of
Trade, pressured by a lack of overnight frost in the Midwest and
forecasts for improved crop weather next week. Oat and wheat futures
also retreated.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department issued a new crop
report revising downward its August estimates for 1989 U.S. corn and
soybean production and raising its wheat-crop estimate.
   The USDA projected the corn crop at 7.32 billion bushels compared
with its August estimate of 7.35 billion and last year's harvest of
4.92 billion.
   The agency pegged 1989 soybean production at 1.89 billion bushels
compared with last month's estimate of 1.91 billion and last year's
harvest of 1.54 billion.
   The USDA projected total 1989 U.S. wheat production at 2.06
billion bushels compared to last month's estimate of 2.04 billion
and last year's 1.81 billion.
   Analysts termed the soybean number neutral but said the
higher-than-expected corn and wheat estimates could cause futures
prices to drop Wednesday.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
September at $3.93 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with
September at $2.36{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 3{ cents lower
with September at $1.36{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents
lower with September at $6.02 a bushel.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 7 cents
lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange with October at $19.70 a
barrel; heating oil was .64 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
October at 55.37 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .03 cent
to .28 cent lower with October at 56.89 cents a gallon.
   In precious-metals trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
settled 20 cents to 30 cents lower with October at $361.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 1 cents to 1.8 cents lower with September at
$5.069 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .02 cent
to .55 cent higher with October at 72.22 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .35 cent to .75 cent higher with September at 82.62
cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .45 cent higher with
October at 39.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to
.47 cents higher with February at 46.57 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Oil Company Says Wyoming Court Reversed $412 Million Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has reversed a lower
court ruling that would have forced an Occidental Petroleum Corp.
subsidiary to pay more than $412 million in a dispute over the
purchase of natural gas, Occidental said Tuesday.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1986 district
court ruling under which Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, a
subsidiary of Occidental's Midcon Corp., would have owed the $412
million to Colorado Interstate Gas Co., a unit of Coastal Corp.,
Occidental said.
   An appeals court panel unanimously reversed the lower court's
ruling that Natural had breached a contract to buy gas from Colorado
Interstate and had attempted to monopolize the market for the
long-distance transportation of natural gas produced in Wyoming.
   The circuit court let stand a ruling under which Natural was
found liable for about $8 million, Occidental said.
   The court also rejected Colorado Interstate's claim that Natural
had attempted to create a monopoly for the Trailblazer Pipeline
system, a group of three pipelines that transport gas out of Wyoming.
   Coastal said in a statement it would appeal the reversal of the
lower court's ruling.

<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee
proposed Tuesday that deductible Individual Retirement Accounts be
offered all taxpayers as a substitute for reducing the tax on
capital gains.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, whose committee is expected to write
a tax bill later this month, said his plan also would allow
penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs to buy a first home or finance a
college education.
   Bentsen, who has been a consistent supporter of a capital-gains
tax cut, said the federal deficit is too big to allow both such a
reduction, which President Bush has recommended, and expanded IRAs.
   ``We must make a choice (of which will do more to encourage
saving) and I am convinced that my IRA deserves priority,'' Bentsen
told a news conference. ``Cutting capital gains (taxes) is an
investment incentive for a few but the problem is broader than that.
With the IRA, we'd have the participation of a broad spectrum of
Middle America.''
   Bentsen made his proposal public an hour before the House Ways
and Means Committee resumed consideration of a capital-gains
reduction. He said it had been warmly received by the Senate
Democratic Caucus and by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
   A Bush-backed capital-gains cut has a one-vote majority on the
House panel, but Democratic leaders have postponed consideration
several times in an effort to turn around at least one of the six
Democrats who favor the reduction.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of Ways and Means, found
little support among fellow Democrats for his latest attempt at a
capital-gains compromise, although several Republicans seemed
willing to accept it. The proposal would protect capital gains
against inflation and provide a special break for long-term holders
of assets.
   The panel put off further consideration until Wednesday.
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock and other
assets, are taxed at the same rate as other income, ranging up to 33
percent. The compromise bill that Bush backs, sponsored chiefly by
Reps. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., and Bill Archer, R-Texas, would cut the top
rate to 19.6 percent for 2{ years. The top rate then would rise to
28 percent. Investors would be protected against having to pay taxes
on profits generated by inflation.
   There is general agreement that the proposal would increase tax
collections for a year by encouraging investors to sell long-held
assets. After that, Democrats say, it would cut tax collections.
Bush insists it would raise money in the long run.
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Jenkins
capital-gains cut would cost about $5 billion in lost revenue in
1994, while Bentsen's IRA plan would cost $4 billion.
   ``IRA affects average folks,'' Bentsen said. ``It helps address
three of the primary concerns of middle-income Americans,
lower-income Americans: buying that first home, financing a college
education and providing for one's retirement.''
   Under his proposal, a person could contribute up to $2,000 a year
to an IRA and avoid current taxation on half the sum. The
contribution and the interest earned would not be taxed until the
money was withdrawn for retirement, tuition or making the down
payment on a first home.
   Since passage of the 1986 tax overhaul, fully deductible IRAs
have been available only to workers not covered by a company pension
and to single people earning less than $25,000 and couples under
$40,000.
   In 1986, when deductible IRAs were available to all workers,
nearly $38 billion was contributed to such accounts. Almost 15
percent of all taxpayers claimed an IRA deduction. Those figures
have dropped significantly since that time.
   When deductible IRAs were scaled back, they were criticized as
rewarding people who would save anyway, and as encouraging the
transfer of savings from taxable accounts into IRAs.
   However, Bentsen said a new study commissioned by Merrill Lynch
Consumer Markets disputes those points. That study concluded that 80
percent of IRA contributions were new savings.

<HEAD>Computer Maker Sues AT&amp;T</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A maker of computers for government and
industry said Tuesday it had filed a fraud and breach-of-contract
suit against American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., alleging that AT&amp;T
knowingly supplied it with defective computer chips.
   The suit was filed Monday in Los Angeles federal court.
Microprojects Corp. also accuses AT&amp;T of conspiracy and attempt to
monopolize business by supplying the faulty parts to competitors.
   The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages in excess of $20 million,
which would be tripled under antitrust law if the monopoly
allegations are successful, plus $50 million in punitive damages.
   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Marylou Ambrus declined comment, saying the
company's lawyers had not seen the lawsuit.
   Marina del Rey-based Microproject and AT&amp;T agreed in 1986 to
develop Microproject's Unicorn B computer series, using AT&amp;T's Unix
operating system and the WE32100 Unix Microsystem Chip Set from AT&amp;T
as the computer's basic processor, according to Microproject lawyer
Allan Gabriel.
   Microproject began distributing the computers worldwide in 1987.
   The lawsuit alleges that AT&amp;T knew the chip set was defective. It
says AT&amp;T discontinued using that version in its own 3B2 Unix-based
computer line, which competes directly with the Unicorn systems, but
continued to sell the defective chip sets to outside parties.

<HEAD>Datapoint Stock Most Active on New York Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Datapoint Corp. stock was the most actively
traded Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 50 cents a
share to $5.37{ as the company's chairman said he and his associates
bought 3 million shares in two days.
   Chairman Asher B. Edelman said the shares purchased Monday and
Tuesday give him and his associates slightly more than 4 million
shares or more than 40 percent of the computermaker's stock, a Dow
Jones &amp; Co. news wire reported.
   More than 2.6 million shares of Datapoint stock changed hands
Tuesday.
   The move comes days after shareholder Martin S. Ackerman launched
a bid to oust Edelman, a New York investor, as Datapoint's board
chairman and install his own slate of directors.
   Ackerman said he will challenge Edelman's stock purchase with
proxies, the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. Ackerman
also said he and his associates plan to proceed with their bid to
remove Edelman and his board.
   ``I'm certainly not going away and we intend to file suit in
Delaware soon,'' Ackerman said. The company is incorporated in that
state. ``We clearly intend to challenge the purchase of the share
with proxies. We clearly think it's illegal to disenfranchise
shareholders from their vote by buying shares at above-market
value.''
   Edelman was out of the country Tuesday and not immediately
available for further comment, said Ross Laughead, vice president
and general counsel for San Antonio-based Datapoint.
   Laughead said the company would not comment on Ackerman's
stockholder solicitation until Datapoint files documents pertaining
to it with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   When he initiated the ouster attempt, Ackerman, a New York
attorney who says he revives troubled companies, cited stock
declines and losses exceeding $126 million since Edelman took over
the company in 1985.
   The question should be put to the stockholders within 60 days, he
said.
   Datapoint has about $330 million in annual sales and employs
2,600 people.

   Economic policies of the United States, the
leading member of the International Monetary Fund, were repeatedly
critized and sometimes praised in the fund's annual report Tuesday.
   The 22 banker-diplomats on the Executive Board singled out the
twin trade and budget deficits and the federal tax system for
``concern,'' one of the sharpest words the fund uses.
   ``Concern'' was also expressed, but less often, about policies of
West Germany, Britain and Italy. Japan was urged to speed some
changes.
   The fund uses contributions from its members to help out
countries in economic trouble, usually requiring changes in economic
policy in exchange for its loans. It makes regular appraisals of its
leading members but publishes only a short summary. The U.S.
government has the biggest voting strength in the fund, 19.14
percent.
   The report said brisk economic expansion in the United States
last year contributed to economic growth in the rest of the world.
But it noted ``concerns'' about inflation because the United States
was using its resources so close to capacity.
   Many U.S. experts have had the same worries but have been
reassured by the small size of recent increases in the major price
indexes.
   The report noted previous cuts in the federal deficit but added:
``Concern was expressed that further substantial reductions would
not be forthcoming soon.'' It said, ``The board emphasized the
importance of decisive action to reduce the fiscal deficit.''
   The federal tax system was criticized as discouraging private
saving and distorting investment. The heavy excess of U.S. imports
over exports was called a major source of vulnerability, and
``concern'' was mentioned again because pressures remain strong to
protect American business against foreign competition through trade
barriers.
   The board praised the Federal Reserve for making credit easily
available in response to the stock market crash of 1987, but said
rising interest rates caused ``concern.'' However, U.S. interest
rates have been falling since April, when the fund's fiscal year
ended.
   The word ``concern'' did not appear in the appraisal of Japan,
though it said the Japanese have much to do to speed up improvements
in land management, farming and the distribution system. The
directors said Japan should let in more foreign goods, especially
farm products.
   But they praised Japanese tax reform and what they called the
skillful monetary policy, sound financial policies and the continued
outlook for growth without inflation.
   In West Germany the board said it was ``concerned'' about high
unemployment, the large surplus of exports over imports and the
decision to raise taxes in 1989.
   ``Action on deregulation has been slow and disincentives in some
critical sectors continue to hamper economic activity,'' the report
said without elaboration.
   For Britain, ``concern'' was expressed that ``demand had grown
too rapidly and had begun to show up in higher inflation'' and a
larger trade deficit.
   For Italy, the board said it was ``concerned'' that ``slippages
in controlling public expenditure had set back'' efforts to control
inflation and stabilize interest and exchange rates.
   The report did not go into the issue that is expected to
preoccupy the fund for the next three month: the scheduled increase
in the member contributions, now the equivalent of $118.8 billion.
   Some U.S. officials have said they are yet to be convinced that
the increase is needed. Managing Director Michel Camdessus wants the
total doubled. Others want smaller increases.

<HEAD>Nutri-System Sues Former Employee and Weight Watchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nutri-System Inc. filed a lawsuit Tuesday
accusing a former vice president of stealing a $30 million marketing
plan when she went to work for a competitor, Weight Watchers
International.
   The suit asks Montgomery County Common Pleas Court to bar Weight
Watchers from competing with Nutri-System, based in Willow Grove, in
the weight-loss market.
   The suit also asks the court to order Weight Watchers, which is
based in Jericho, N.Y., to pay Nutri-System all profits derived from
the information provided by Jean Bakken.
   Bakken was promoted to the new position of vice president for
competitive marketing on Aug. 18 and resigned Sept. 5 to work in a
similar position for Weight Watchers, according to the suit.
   Weight Watchers also tried to lure other Nutri-System management
personnel, the suit says.
   At Nutri-System, Bakken was working on an 18-month marketing plan
and participated in meetings with Don McCulloch and Al DiMarco,
senior officers and owners of the company, involving confidential
informtion, the suit says.
   When company officials searched Bakken's office after her
resignation, they found that ``virtually all of the company's
documents, including confidential and proprietary materials
previously supplied to or requested by Bakken, were missing,''
according to the suit.
   The company charges that ``she is unlawfully using or unlawfully
intends to use such information for the benefit of Weight Watchers.''
   The suit, saying Bakken abused the confidential nature of her
relationship with Nutri-System, asks the court to bar her from
working for Weight Watchers.
   No one answered the phone Tuesday afternoon at the Pittsburgh
offices of H.J. Heinz Co., the parent company of Weight Watchers. A
phone number for Bakken could not be located.
   ``When a $5.2 billion company like Heinz obtains valuable,
proprietary information from a $433 million company, it is not only
unlawful and unethical, but could also cause Nutri-System
irreparable harm,'' McCulloch said in a news release.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Says It Won Cookie Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
reached a $125 million agreement with three competitors whom the
company had charged with violating its patent for crisp and chewy
cookies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Frito-Lay Inc. agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S. District
Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where Procter &amp; Gamble
filed its lawsuits.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble markets the cookies under the
name Duncan Hines.
   The company filed lawsuits against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay
in June 1984. The settlement averted a trial that was scheduled to
begin Oct. 2.
   The agreement states that Procter &amp; Gamble's patent is valid and
enforceable and it prohibits the three companies from infringing the
patent, Procter &amp; Gamble said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman Donald Tassone refused to say how much
each of the three companies would pay Procter &amp; Gamble. He said the
settlement requires that the companies not divulge its terms
publicly.
   Frito-Lay, based in Plano, Texas, said it would pay less than $20
million as its share of the settlement. Frito-Lay described the
settlement as a ``prudent business decision that allowed the company
to avoid a complex, lengthy and costly trial.''
   Frito-Lay, which is owned by Pepsico Inc., said the settlement
would be paid by insurance and would have no effect on the company's
finances.
   Comment from Keebler, which is a subsidiary of United Biscuits
PLC of Britain, and Nabisco, part of RJR Nabisco Inc., was not
immediately available.
   Procter &amp; Gamble introduced its cookies in 1983. Keebler, Nabisco
and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of cookie, Procter &amp;
Gamble said.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after Procter &amp; Gamble sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell
cookies that Procter &amp; Gamble regards as violating its patent, he
said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the gain from the settlement would be
reflected in its first-quarter earnings.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Posts Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. on
Tuesday posted a $21.9 million loss for the quarter ended Aug. 27.
However, the Santa Clara company said it is still ``on target'' for
a return to profitability in the current quarter.
   The computer chip maker said the loss in the quarter, which is
the first quarter in its fiscal year 1990, represented a significant
improvement over the $98.3 million loss in the fourth quarter of its
fiscal 1989, which included a $45.1 million restructuring charge.
   The company said the most recent loss compares with a loss of
$30.5 million for the same period last year.
   First quarter revenue was $397.6 million, a decrease of 10.6
percent from $449.9 million during the same period a year ago.
   Charles Sporck, National Semiconductor's president, said the
company has slowed production, eliminated surplus inventory and
closed older manufacturing plants in an effort to return to
profitability.
   ``I am particularly encouraged by our continued improved
performance during a quarter which saw flat semiconductor business
conditions, along with pricing pressure, in certain areas,'' Sporck
said.
