<HEAD>Despite Reagan's Remarks, Sony Chairman Says Won't Interfere With
Movies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sony Corp., the new owner of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., says it won't interfere with filmmaking there
despite former President Reagan's remark that Japanese ownership
might return ``decency'' to Hollywood.
   Sony Chairman Akio Morita, in Atlanta on Friday to address a
business group, said he would not want to interfere with the film
industry's creative minds by dictating values to movie producers.
   ``Encouraging creativity is the most important thing management
can do,'' Morita said in response to a reporter's question.
   During a visit to Japan last month, Reagan said he was glad Sony
had acquired Columbia for $3.4 billion. The former movie actor said
he didn't like many of the current films coming out of Hollywood.
   ``I just have the feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some
outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the
pictures that are being made,'' Reagan said.

   President Bush wants to know who leaked word
of his pending summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, and White House aides have standing orders to report all
contact with journalists, The Washington Post reported in Saturday
editions.
   Bush was ``fit to be tied'' over the leaked report of the
summit, which appeared in the Post 12 hours before its scheduled
simultaneous announcement in Washington and Moscow, the newspaper
reported, citing unidentified administration sources.
   The president has ordered a ``full scale witch hunt,'' in the

   An Air Force lieutenant colonel
assigned to the National Security Agency and his wife, an NSA
psychologist, were arrested on drug-dealing charges Friday when
police raided their suburban Washington home.
   The couple's son and daughter were also charged after police
seized $780,000 worth of illegal drugs, $70,000 in cash, two
machine guns, an assault rifle, various shotguns, a motorcycle and
a car from the Crofton home, said Joseph Bisesi, a spokesman for
the Anne Arundel County Police.
   Russell James Hibler, 43, and Suzanne McCabe Hibler, 43, were
charged with possession of the drugs with intent to distribute.
   Russell Hibler, an Air Force lieutenant colonel, is a
psychologist assigned to the National Security Agency and his wife
is a civilian research psychologist with the NSA, an agency
spokeswoman confirmed.
   The son, James Todd Hibler, 21, was charged with possession with
intent to distribute cocaine, hashish, and marijuana and unlawful
possession of automatic weapons, Bisesi said. The daughter, Jessica
Lynn Hibler, 19, also was charged with possession with intent to
distribute, Bisesi said.
   The elder Hiblers were released on personal recognizance at a
hearing before a District Court commissioner in Annapolis.
   Their son, who also was charged with unlawful possession of
automatic weapons, was ordered held at the Anne Arundel County
Detention Center in Millersville on $600,000 bond. Their daughter's
bail was set at $155,000.
   In the raid shortly after midnight, police found found seven
pounds of cocaine, 4{ pounds of hashish and between 50 and 60
pounds of marijuana, Bisesi said. He said agents burst in upon
Jessica Hibler counting $27,000 in cash in the basement and found
as much as $10,000 in bills stuffed in pants pockets around the
house.
   The raid caps a two-month investigation, Bisesi said. No
undercover buys were involved in the probe, which mostly entailed
surveillance of the family, he said.
   Sgt. David E. Pressley, a supervisor for the countywide
narcotics section, said investigators had information on the
alleged operation dating to 1987.
   The son had been the target of the investigation, and detectives
were surprised to find how open the drug activities were inside the
house, Bisesi said.
   ``There is no way the parents couldn't have known what was going
on,'' a detective said.
   Neighbors said they were surprised to hear of the raid.
   ``They are such a quiet family,'' said one neighbor who
requested anonymity. ``Some kids went in and out of the house, and
they worked out front on their cars occasionally. Nothing seemed
unusual.''
   The highly secret NSA, the nation's largest intelligence agency,
has a work force of more than 60,000 employees and a budget of over
$10 billion. It is primarily responsible for eavesdropping on
communications around the world, coding U.S. communications and
trying to crack the codes of foreign governments.
   County police said military authorities also entered into the
investigation because of the elder Hiblers' positions with NSA. The
agency spokeswoman, who would not discuss the nature of the
couple's duties, said their job status was ``up in the air'' until
more information on the drug case is in hand.

<HEAD>Oil Drilling Vessel Carrying 97 Capsizes in Typhoon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with six survivors found clinging

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-owned oil drilling ship with 97
people aboard capsized early Saturday after a typhoon swept through
the Gulf of Thailand with 100 mph winds.
   Barry Lane, spokesman of the Los Angeles-based Unocal oil
company, said six survivors had been rescued in heavy seas about
270 miles south of Bangkok but that they were Thai fishermen, not
crew from the capsized Seacrest drilling vessel.
   No survivors of the Seacrest had been found by late Saturday
morning, Lane said from Los Angeles. He said a company helicopter
that rushed to the site found the upside-down hull of the 351-foot
ship still visible in the water.
   The Unocal helicopter dropped an inflatable liferaft to the
group of six fishermen who were clinging to debris in the water but
the copter was forced to return to another drilling platform to
refuel, Lane said.
   Lane said the fishermen were picked up by the first boat that
arrived at the site at 10:40 a.m. (10:40 p.m. Friday EST). He said
the fishermen were clinging to their overturned fishing boat.
   Lane said rescue efforts were hampered by 6-foot waves and 15
mpg winds.
   Carol Scott, also a spokesman for Unocal, said in Bangkok that
the small overturned vessel, with the fisherman latching on to it,
was first sighted at 8.15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. EST Friday) by a company
helicopter.
   Lane said ships and aircraft had been searching for the
Seacrest, a Panamanian-registered vessel, following a severe
typhoon that lashed the area with 100-mph winds and 35-foot waves.
   Unocal officials said the crew included 67 Thai nationals and 30
workers from other countries. Lane said the Seacrest is owned by a
Unocal subsidiary and operated by Great Eastern Drilling and
Engineering Co. of Singapore.
   Lane said of the 97 on board, 77 are Great Eastern employees,
one is a Unocal worker and 19 are from various other oilfield
companies.
   Ms. Scott said a Thai navy aircraft had earlier reported seeing
a liferaft in the vicinity but it contained no survivors.
   She said that at about 8.20 a.m. a Unocal helicopter spotted the
stricken Seacrest about 5 miles northwest of the Platong oil
processing platform.
   The Unocal subsidiary, Unocal Thailand Ltd., has aircraft and
ships searching the area and they were joined by units of the Thai
navy and air force.
   Lane said a drilling rig mounted in the center of the ship,
which reached 60 feet high, was stacked with drilling equipment and
there was concern the ship might have been too top-heavy to weather
such a fierce storm.
   He said the Seacrest had been operating in the Platong natural
gas field and the crew was preparing to run casing into a recently
drilled gas well. The vessel drills for both oil and gas.
   Officials said Unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12
hours after the storm struck Thursday.
   ``We have mobilized every available resource to aid in our
search for the ship,'' Unocal chairman Richard J. Stegemeier said
earlier.
   The typhoon developed suddenly and the crew of the Seacrest had
relatively short notice, Lane said.
   ``This actually was a small storm, a squall, and it escalated
very quickly into a tropical storm, and then a typhoon.''
   Stegemeier said other Unocal facilities in the gulf suffered
only minor damage and there were no reported injuries. Unocal had
more than 1,100 workers offshore on 46 platforms and 18 vessels at
the time the storm struck.
   Unocal operates five natural gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand
that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of natural gas
daily. Company officials said the Seacrest first went into service
in 1978.

<HEAD>Computer Failure Snarls Air Traffic Around Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEESBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of air travelers were delayed for
hours at airports in Washington and other areas Friday when the
region's main air traffic computer failed and its backup broke down
about half an hour later.
   Airplanes en route to Washington were held on the ground at
airports from New York to North Carolina to Detroit when the
breakdown occurred during a peak time of the airline's busiest days
of the week, Federal Aviation Administration officials said.
   ``There have been computer glitches but nothing of this
magnitude,'' FAA spokesman Hugh O'Neill said. ``There were a lot of
planes that were diverted around the system.''
   The main computer, located at the Washington Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Leesburg, supervises flights within a
200,000-square-mile region, O'Neill said. The computers feed flight
information to controllers' radar screens.
   Nearly 30 minutes after the computer broke down, the backup
computer also failed but was later restored to intermittent
operation, O'Neill said. Both computers resumed operation at 6:50
p.m., he said.
   Numerous flights scheduled to land at or depart from Washington
National, Washington Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington
International airports were directed to bypass the Washington area
entirely.
   The Leesburg center, one of about 20 in the country, controls
the region from New York to South Carolina and between the Atlantic
Ocean to the Ohio River. In 1986, the more than 300 controllers
there directed 2.2 million flights.
   The cause of the computer failures was not immediately known,
O'Neill said.
   In 1987, a similar glitch launced an investigation across the
entire FAA system. In that incident, the 15-year-old main computer,
an IBM 9020, broke down but a backup was working within 35 seconds,
FAA officials said.
   A new, high-speed computer system was then dedicated at the
Leesburg center two years ago in a move officials said would reduce
air travel delays and ease pressures on controllers.
   The new IBM host computer was described as 10 times as fast and
capable of handling four to five times as many airplanes as the one
being replaced.
   But despite the problems at the Leesburg Center, a source at
National Airport told The Washington Post that flights operating on
visual flight regulations were able to depart, while those
requiring instrument flight clearances were delayed.

</TEXT>
<NOTE>1979</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Nov. 4 _ Iranian militants seize the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
take 66 U.S. citizens hostage. They demand the United States return
the deposed Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who is being
treated in a New York hospital for the cancer that would kill him.
The United States refuses.
   Nov. 9 _ The United Nations Security Council calls on the
militants to release the hostages ``without delay.''
   Nov. 10 _ President Carter orders the Justice Department to
deport Iranians who do not comply with their student visa
requirements. Two days later, Carter halts oil imports from Iran.
   Nov. 14 _ Iranian assets in the United States, worth $8 billion,
are frozen on Carter's orders.
   Nov. 19 _ Two black Marines and a woman secretary are released
under an order from revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini to free women and blacks. Ten more Americans are released
the next day, leaving 53 behind.
   Nov. 21 _ Hundreds of thousands of Iranians mass on Islamic holy
day outside the U.S. Embassy chanting, ``Death to Carter!''
Blindfolded hostages are paraded in front of the masses and U.S.
flags are burned. Khomeini threatens to try the hostages as
criminals. He calls the showdown ``a war between Moslems and
pagans.''
   Dec. 12 _ The United States expels 183 Iranian diplomats.
   Dec. 15 _ The shah flies to exile in Panama. The International
Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, orders Iran to free all
the hostages.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1980</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 13 _ The U.N. Security Council votes in favor of economic
sanctions against Iran but the Soviet Union vetoes the resolution.
   Jan. 29 _ It is disclosed six Americans who had evaded the
embassy takeover in November are spirited out of Iran through the
Canadian Embassy.
   March 23 _ The shah leaves Panama for Egypt and later has his
spleen removed.
   April 7 _ The United States breaks diplomatic relations with
Iran and expels 35 remaining diplomats.
   April 25 _ A U.S. military force flies to a remote Iranian
desert in hopes of rescuing the hostages, but the attempt is
aborted when three helicopters fail. Eight U.S. soldiers are killed
when a helicopter collides with a transport plane. The bodies are
later displayed by Iranians. The militants scatter the hostages to
head off any more rescue tries. Cyrus Vance resigns as secretary of
state three days later.
   May 24 _ The world court calls for release of the hostages and
says Iran should compensate the United States for the embassy
seizure.
   July 10 _ Hostage Richard Queen, suffering from multiple
sclerosis, is released, leaving 52 behind.
   July 27 _ The shah dies in a Cairo hospital. Iran radio calls
him ``the bloodsucker of the century.''
   Sept. 12 _ Khomeini lists four conditions for the hostages'
release, and omits a previous demand for a U.S. apology. The
conditions are: return of the late shah's wealth, cancellation of
U.S. claims against Iran, unfreezing of Iranian assets in the
United States and guarantees of no U.S. interference in Iran.
   Sept. 22 _ War breaks out between Iran and Iraq.
   Nov. 4 _ A year after the hostages are taken, Iranians
demonstrate outside the embassy and Ronald Reagan is elected
president.

   A state representative's son armed with a
gun and threatening suicide holed up in the legislator's home
Thursday night and kept police at bay for four hours before he was
subdued, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported although about five shots were fired
by the gunman, 21-year-old Chris Corkery, said police Chief Wesley
Blanchard.
   He ``was going through severe emotional problems (and) was
threatening to take his own life with a shotgun,'' said Blanchard.
   Corkery, the son of Rep. Neil A. Corkery, had been treated for
alcohol abuse in the past, said Blanchard, who did not know when.
   He said Corkery was drinking when police arrived at
approximately 5 p.m., but did not drink throughout the evening.
Blanchard did not know what precipitated the incident.
   Corkery had been asleep in the house when police set off a stun
grenade and rushed him at about 8:45 p.m., Blanchard said. He said
two officers subdued the gunman and another went for the 12-gauge
shotgun lying across Corkery's body.
   When police were first called to the house, Corkery's younger
brother, Michael, and mother, Maureen, also were in the house, said
Blanchard.
   Eventually the family left the house, joined by the state
representative, who is a school administrator in Providence, and
went to a neighbor's home, he said.
   Four police negotiators took turns talking with Corkery while a
tactical team was stationed in the neighborhood, Blanchard said.
   ``There were times when we thought we lost his attention,'' he
said. ``There were times when the shotgun was being held at the
head or neck.''
   Corkery was taken to the police station and will be examined by
mental health officials, Blanchard said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Xavier Suarez is cruising toward election for
a new four-year term Tuesday, but he's keeping a worried eye on two
hotly contested races that could leave the city commission without
a black at a tense time for community relations.
   Campaigning has been dominated by heritage and skin color, a
recent pattern in Miami.
   ``The panorama is one in which if things don't go well for the
black candidates, we will end up without any black on the
commission,'' Suarez said. ``That is a concern for me. It shouldn't
lead to worse representation, but with a fairly large black
population, it's very symbolic.''
   The non-partisan, at-large elections come as Miami's black
community, stung when U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings was
convicted two weeks ago in Senate impeachment proceedings, is
watching jury selection in the trial of Miami police Officer
William Lozano, charged with manslaughter in a January shooting of
a black that touched off race riots.
   Suarez, elected in 1985 as Miami's first Cuban-born mayor, was
re-elected in 1987 and a change in city law has made this election
for a four-year term. His only opponent is former city commissioner
Armando Lacasa, also Cuban-born.
   Lacasa, 53, conceded when he announced his candidacy that he had
little chance against Suarez, but said he was running to show
Suarez that not everyone is happy with him.
   There are six candidates each for the two city commission races
up for election this year. Unless a candidate wins more than 50
percent Tuesday, the top two vote-getters in each commission race
will runoff one week later.
   Suarez, 40, a Harvard-educated lawyer, won his first two mayoral
elections in runoffs, but his popularity has soared as he has
emerged as a magnetic politician with the ability to appeal to all
three of Miami's main ethnic groups.
   City voters are approximately 50 percent Hispanic, 30 percent
black and 20 percent ``Anglo.''
   An Anglo and a Cuban hold the two seats not up for election.
   Seeking re-election is Miller Dawkins, the lone elected black on
the commission, while Cuban-born Rosario Kennedy, who resigned last
summer for an unsuccessful run at Congress, leads a field seeking
her old job.
   Suarez is backing Dawkins and Ms. Kennedy with a slogan of
``Keep Miami's Magic: One Big Neighborhood.''
   Ironically, Suarez's sharpest critics are Cuban, Dawkins' are in
the black community, and Dawkins' chief foe Joe Carollo's critics
are fellow Cubans.
   Lacasa charged Suarez with ``a major blow to the exile
community'' when he gave Ms. Kennedy's vacated seat on an interim
basis to a black.
   Suarez called Lacasa's accusations ``ethnic politics of the
worst kind.''
   Carollo, a 34-year-old former police officer who served
previously on the commission for eight years, is known for fiery,
anti-Communist crusading.
   ``He's a concern. He takes things very personally,'' Suarez
said. ``Carollo would not be a good thing for the city.''
   Some influential Hispanics are backing Dawkins, 64, a community
college administrator, saying he's important for harmony.
   ``We the Cubans, when we arrived, fought for representation
because we were the minority,'' said Luis Sabines of the Latin
Chamber of Commerce. ``Now the blacks are the minority and I think
they should be represented. Fair is fair.''
   Carollo has called Dawkins the worse commissioner in Miami
history and ``a political terrorist'' for such Dawkins comments as
warning he might ``get the brothers out there and burn it down''
when commissioners were discussing locating an anti-AIDS clinic in
a black neighborhood.
   Some blacks were upset when Dawkins engineered a $500,000 loan
from a fund for an inner-city swimming pool to a Little Havana
theater project.
   Also opposing Dawkins are Clarence Patterson, a former city
official; former assistant police chief Alfredo Bared, and
businessmen Willy Chavez and J.L. Correa.
   Challenging Ms. Kennedy are businessman Manolo Reyes, black
community activist Carole Ann Taylor, political newcomer Kevin
Marshall, and Miriam Alonso, disqualified two years ago for
elections-rules violations, and Liberty City shopkeeper Prentice
Rasheed, best known for gaining exoneration on manslaughter charges
after his homemade booby trap killed a burglar.

<TEXT>
   Maine voters face two nuclear ballot
questions Tuesday, one on waste disposal and the other a
referendum-forced proposal calling for a ban on continued testing
of unarmed cruise missiles over Maine.
   The Navy called a news conference Thursday in Portland to
reiterate its position that cruise missile testing is safe, but
spokesmen denied they were campaigning against the Maine ballot
proposal.
   While passage would not bind the Navy to stop tests, a ``yes''
vote could have an impact on the nuclear arms race, says the
Coalition for the Cruise Missile Referendum.
   Supporters also say passage would help prompt political action
to halt the missiles.
   Gerald Miller, technical director of the Navy's cruise missile
project, said Thursday that all the tests have been conducted
without injury. He acknowledged that if the Maine question passes,
similar movements could crop up in southern and western states
where the cruise missiles are flown.
   Maine is one of five states where dummy Tomahawk missiles are
flown in Navy test missions. In the Maine tests, the missiles are
launched from submarines off the coast and fly to the western part
of the state.
   The coalition's Eric Johnson said the tests advance a system
that is unnecessary because the United States already has a nuclear
arsenal that could wipe out its adversaries many times over.
   Johnson also calls the $11 billion weapon a waste of taxpayers'
money and says its development seriously impedes nuclear
arms-reduction initiatives.
   The Navy's Robert Holsapple, noting that 75 percent of the
appropriations for the program already have been made, stressed
last week that 3,300 of the 4,030 missiles envisioned in the
program will carry conventional arms.
   He defends Tomahawks as a balance against the relatively strong
conventional forces of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations.
Deploying cruise missiles on 200 surface ships and submarines also
would complicate Soviet targeting, he said.
   The Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee is working against voter
ratification of a waste-disposal contract that would allow Maine to
dump low-level waste at a Nevada site for three years. They say it
would do nothing to establish a permanent site to help Maine comply
with federal requirements that it take responsibility for its own
low-level waste, he said.
   Gov. John R. McKernan is urging passage of what he says is a
necessary contingency in the event the South Carolina dump now
accepting Maine's waste decides to close its doors to the state.
   Passage also would give generators _ principally the Maine
Yankee atomic plant, which produces 83 percent of the state's waste
by volume _ more time to build long-term storage sites, according
to advocates of passage.

<HEAD>Prison Guards Change Garb To Pinstripes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stripes are returning to the North Dakota
Penitentiary, but not for the prisoners.
   Rather, the state prison's guards will be issued new uniforms
with pinstripes to replace the current green, military-style garb.
   ``The green was just plain ugly. I hate green,'' said Warden Tom
Powers, who decided to get rid of the old uniforms.
   The new uniforms are part of Powers' philosophy that
correctional officers are more than guards these days. Powers, who
took charge of the prison a year ago, likes to think of his
employees as ``correctional counselors.''
   The old uniforms, standard issue for more than a decade,
featured forest green slacks and a light green shirt that had
contrasting forest green epaulets, military creases, military-style
flap pockets and a police-type sleeve patch.
   The new outfit has none of that. Medium gray polyester slacks
will be worn with either the white-and-gray pinstriped shirt or a
blue-and-white oxford striped shirt.
   Powers said the officers picked those combinations.
   He decided to ditch the old outfit because of his experiment the
last several months with casual uniforms on officers in the
privileged housing units _ a medium-security unit and the State
Prison Farm.
   He found that the officers in those units liked the new uniforms
and they had the desired effect of making the officers more
approachable to the inmates.

   Polly Ketron didn't want friends and
relatives to worry about arrangements for her funeral so she is
taking care of them herself.
   The service is scheduled for Saturday. Two days later, Mrs.
Ketron will celebrate her 76th birthday.
   ``I'm planning on having a good crowd,'' she said. ``At my age,
I have a lot of friends.''
   Nothing really special is planned for the funeral, except that
she will be sitting close to the front of the chapel.
   ``I'm not going to get in the casket or anything,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ketron, who has no children and no surviving brothers and
sisters, said she didn't want friends and other relatives worrying
about her funeral.
   ``I wanted it so that whenever I die, they can take me out for a
graveside service,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ketron's husband, Andrew Ketron, died seven years ago.
   She mulled the idea of a ``prearranged funeral,'' as she calls
it, before approaching the funeral home and friends with her plan.
She noted that the funeral home prefers to call the service ``a
memorial.''
   Rye Fleenor, a friend of Mrs. Ketron's and a spokesman for the
funeral home, said he thought her request was a joke when they
discussed it in his office recently.
   Several days later, however, Mrs. Ketron called to confirm some
of the details and Fleenor realized she was deadly serious.
   She had wanted Fleenor, a retired minister, to preach, but he
told her it was his day off.
   The Rev. Hubert Overlay, also a retired minister, will
officiate. Overlay said he has no objections to Mrs. Ketron's idea.
   ``It's rather odd for someone to want this, but when you think
it over, it's not too bad,'' he said. ``She wants to hear what's
being said about her.''
   He doesn't think Mrs. Ketron's presence at the service will
distract him.
   ``She's a mighty fine person,'' he said.
   Mrs. Ketron is not the first person to have her funeral before
she died. In fact, it's getting to be kind of a tradition in this
mountain region of northeast Tennessee.
   Paul C. Blevins of nearby Shady Valley held his funeral in 1976
in his front yard, attracting hundreds of people. He died in 1987
at the age of 76 and was buried in a casket that he built.

<HEAD>Doctors: Victim Could Make Full Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female jogger who was raped and left for dead
in a brutal Central Park attack has made a ``remarkable recovery''
and could be capable of fully regaining her faculties, a doctor
said Thursday.
   ``We are hopeful but not certain of a 100 percent recovery,''
said the doctor familiar with her case who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The woman, now 29, has been at Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford,
Conn., where she is undergoing intensive mental and physical
therapy and rehabilitation.
   The New York Times reported in its Friday editions that the
doctor found the woman has regained a ``zest for life that is
impossible to quench.''
   He said she still has no recollection of the attack, and
declined to speculate if she ever will. However, the doctor told
the Times that she has been given the full details of the crime and
has a complete understanding of what happened to her.
   A medical report on her was prepared and made available Thursday
to lawyers defending youths charged in the April 19 attack.
   The woman, an investment broker at Salomon Brothers, was on her
nightly run in Central Park when she was jumped by a gang of youths.
   At least one of the youths who participated in the attack said
he thought she was dead when they left her.
   She was found bloodied, severely beaten and barely breathing in
a puddle of mud about three hours after the attack.
   Police investigating the case said they thought she would die
when she was taken to Metropolitan Hospital, where doctors said she
had lost nearly 80 percent of her body's blood. They also said that
head blows inflicted by a brick and a metal bar had damaged her
brain.
   But now, the doctor said she has made a startling recovery and
that she has begun regaining physical and mental skills which
doctors at first thought she may never regain. The source did not
elaborate.
   Doctors have said the woman would be physically capable of
appearing as a prosecution witness when the six youths indicted in
connection with the attack go on trial.

<HEAD>After Years of Close Ties with Libya, Malta Turning West</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The decision to hold next month's superpower summit
off the coast of Malta might have been unthinkable in Washington a
few years ago when the Mediterranean island was under fire for its
close ties with nearby Libya.
   But ever since the Socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16
years in power, Malta has loosened ties with Col. Moammar Gadhafi
and moved closer to the United States and Western Europe.
   Diplomats say the island's improved ties with Washington, its
central location in the Mediterranean and its official policy of
neutrality and non-alignment apparently played a role in the
decision to hold the Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit by President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Maltese waters.
   ``This would have been virtually inconceivable three years
ago,'' a Western diplomat in Valletta, the Maltese capital, said
Thursday.
   Malta still has extensive trade and commercial ties with its
southern neighbor Libya, but political and military relations have
been downgraded.
   ``There is this impression, formed abroad, that we were too
closely aligned with the Libyans,'' Prime Minister Edward Fenech
Adami said shortly after his Nationalist Party swept to victory in
May 1986. ``This will not happen under the new government.
   ``Libya has helped us a lot in the past and we shall maintain
our friendly relations,'' he added. ``But Maltese policies will no
longer be identified with Libyan policies. Malta should not align
itself, particularly in a military way, with Libya.''
   One of Fenech Adami's first official acts was to scrap part of a
1984 friendship treaty with Libya calling for exchange of military
and security information. It was under this pact that Malta gave
advance warning to Libya of the U.S. air raids on Tripoli and
Benghazi in April 1986.
   Maltese air traffic controllers told their Libyan counterparts
that warplanes were approaching, but Libya apparently didn't act on
the information and was surprised by the bombing raids, which
President Reagan said were intended to punish Tripoli for its
alleged support of international terrorism.
   Fenech Adami's government says it is no longer honoring the
security-sharing agreement with Libya and the clause is expected to
be formally dropped when the friendship treaty comes up for
renegotiation this month.
   In another sign of the island's rapprochement with the West,
Fenech Adami also scratched a clause from the preamble of a 1981
treaty with the Soviet Union that said Malta would consult with
Moscow in case of a threat to peace.
   ``The previous administration felt more comfortable with Eastern
Europe,'' said the Western diplomat in Malta, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``The present adminstration sees itself as Western
European in outlook.''
   Malta's tilt to Libya began after independence from Britain in
1964, when a British NATO base closed, fulfilling then-Prime
Minister Dom Mintoff's desires for an independent and non-aligned
state that would be a fortress of peace in the central
Mediterranean.
   Mintoff developed close relations with Tripoli and wooed the
Soviet Union and North Korea.
   Libyan investment and oil helped Malta survive economically
after it shut down NATO headquarters in 1971 and again in 1979,
when the last of British military installations was closed.
   Today, Fenech Adami is seeking full membership in the European
Economic Community and has liberalized tax laws in an effort to
lure foreign investment.
   But Libyan economic influence in Malta remains strong, a factor
that continues to irritate the United States.
   The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Malta, Peter Sommer, said last
month that U.S.-Maltese relations have shown ``marked improvement''
in the past two years but warned that continued friendly ties with
Libya could hinder American investment in the island.
   During a trip to Rome in 1987, Fenech Adami was asked about the
American view that it is best to isolate Gadhafi in all fields.
   ``Of course that position is appreciated by my goverment,'' he
said, ``but you can't ignore geography. ... We are only 140
kilometers (87 miles) from Libya.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the flight of
East Germans via West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw or
through Hungary since its border with Austria was opened to them in
September:
   Sept. 10 _ Hungary announced that all East Germans in Hungary
seeking to go to the West could cross into Austria without exit
visas from their government. More than 12,000 did so in the first
two days.
   Sept. 11 _ East Germany said its Warsaw Pact ally ``under the
guise of humanitarianism is engaging in organized smuggling of
humans,'' and accused West Germany of luring the refugees.
   Sept. 13 _ East Germans visiting Czechoslovakia and Poland
flocked to the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw seeking
passage to the West.
   Sept. 21 _ The government in East Berlin outlawed the fledgling
pro-democracy group New Forum, accusing it of ``anti-state
policies.''
   Sept. 25 _ The number of East Germans who had entered Austria
from Hungary surpassed 20,000.
   Sept. 30 _ West Germany announced that East Germany had agreed
to let the refuge-seekers at its Prague embassy emigrate. East
Germany classified them as ``expelled.''
   Oct. 1 _ Nearly 7,000 East Germans began arriving in West
Germany on trains from Prague and Warsaw.
   Oct. 2 _ Hundreds more East Germans went to the Prague and
Warsaw embassies seeking to join the exodus. In Leipzig, 20,000
East Germans who stayed home held a pro-democracy march.
   Oct. 3 _ East Berlin announced restrictions on travel to
Czechoslovakia, the only country East Germans could visit without a
visa, but agreed to another mass evacuation from Prague and Warsaw.
   Oct. 5 _ Trains carried thousands of East Germans through their
homeland to West Germany. East German police used force to prevent
crowds from jumping onto the locked trains.
   Oct. 6 _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, in
East Berlin for East Germany's 40th anniversary, urged the people
to ``be patient.'' Police fought protesters in Dresden and
Magdeburg, and Western tourists were barred from East Berlin.
   Oct. 7 _ Police attacked thousands who protested in Leipzig,
Dresden and East Berlin.
   Oct. 8 _ Hundreds of people were arrested in continuing
demonstrations.
   Oct. 9 _ Up to 70,000 marched in Leipzig to demand reform and,
for the first time, police did not interefere. Communist Party
sources said later the order not to use force was issued by Egon
Krenz, chief of internal security.
   Oct. 16 _ Activists angered by Communist Party chief Erich
Honecker's hard line held the largest demonstrations in East German
history. About 120,000 marched in Leipzig alone.
   Oct. 18 _ Krenz replaced Honecker and promised a national
dialogue, but appeared to want only limited reform.
   Oct. 31 _ After two weeks of rapid change, in which controls on
the media and free expression were eased, the Krenz government said
restrictions on travel to Czechoslovakia were being lifted.
   Nov. 1 _ Reflecting continuing discontent with conditions at
home, East Germans once again flooded into Czechoslovak to the West
German Embassy in Prague. The number of East Germans who had fled
in less than two months neared 70,000.

<HEAD>Rabbi's Office Bugged, Possibly For Food Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief rabbi's office has been bugged, and
aides theorize the cuplrits may be food manufacturers trying to
learn the secrets of gaining rabbinic approval for their products.
   Eitan Eisman, director of Chief Sephardi Rabbi Mordechai
Eliahu's office, said Thursday he ordered an inquiry after he
noticed that comments made at private meetings suddenly showed up
in newspapers.
   A wiretap and other evidence of eavesdropping were found, he
said.
   Eisman told Israel army radio that aides suspected ``elements
outside the rabbinate'' _ the likely culprits being manufacturers
seeking crucial kosher stamps showing that their products meet
Jewish dietary laws.
   ``We have been holding a lot of discussions about food,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of interested parties who would like to
know what is being said.''
   Israel Television showed one wireless microphone hidden inisde
an office file in a room where discussions on the stamps were held.
   Israeli news reports suggested the bugging could be tied to the
traditional rivarly between Israel's Sephardi community of Middle
Eastern Jews and the country's Ashkenazi Jews, of European origin.
But both groups denied that.
   Interviewed on Israel television Thursday, Rabbi Eliahu pointed
out that religious law forbids eavesdropping, and Chief Ashkenazi
Rabbi Avraham Shapira said he had no idea who bugged the office.
   ``All I know is that they always say no one listens to the
Rabbis,'' he said. ``Suddenly we see that they do listen.''

<TEXT>
   A man authorities say was involved
in the smuggling of a record 21.4 tons of cocaine seized near Los
Angeles was charged on Thursday with drug trafficking and weapons
violations, news reports said.
   At least 50 federal police officers stormed a motel Wednesday in
downtown Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, and
arrested Rafael Munoz Talavera. Authorities say he led a ring that
smuggled 60 tons of cocaine into the United States the past year,
including the record amount found Sept. 28.
   The Federal Attorney General's office charged him with
trafficking, exporting, buying and selling cocaine and illegal
weapons possession, the government news agency Notimex said.
   Four lawyers for Munoz Talavera obtained a court order barring
his transfer elsewhere from Ciudad Juarez, Notimex said. Several
suspects accused as major drugrunners were transferred in recent
months from other cities, particularly in the border area, to
prisons with greater security in Mexico City.
   Under interrogation, Munoz Talavera said Colombian drug barons
paid him $100,000 for each drug shipment he received and stored,
Notimex quoted Carlos Manuel Salas, regional coordinator of the
attorney general's office anti-narcotics campaign, as saying.
   Salas quoted Munoz Talavera as telling authorities the drugs
were flown from Colombia in small planes that landed on clandestine
air strips in Valle de Juarez and Villa Ahumada.
   Munoz Talavera at times stored tons of cocaine in several Ciudad
Juarez houses, Salas reported.
   He said authorities seized about 60 pieces of property belonging
to Munoz Talavera in Ciudad Juarez, other parts of Chihuahua state,
and in Quintana Roo, in the southeast, and Guerrero, on the Pacific
coast. The Excelsior news service quoted Salas as saying the
properties were worth more than $10 million.
   The Ciudad Juarez property included a popular restaurant taken
over by officials this week.
   The judge in charge of the case has 72 hours after receiving the
case to decide whether to indict Munoz Talavera. He then has a year
in which to decide on Munoz Talavera's guilt or innocence and on a
sentence if his verdict is guilty.
   U.S. authorities said the confiscation in a Los Angeles
warehouse was the world's largest cocaine seizure.
   Officials also raided six warehouses in El Paso believed to have
been a staging area for the cocaine traffic.
   Six men were arrested in the United States in connection with
the case and all pleaded innocent to drug charges. One identified
Munoz Talavera as the mastermind of the smuggling operation,
authorities said.
   Federal police said Munoz had been hiding out in the motel for
three days.

<HEAD>U.S.Court Upholds Abortion Funding Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government can halt federal funds for
family planning programs that include abortion-related services, a
federal appeals court has ruled.
   In an opinion made public Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Manhattan upheld a lower court ruling allowing the
funding cuts.
   A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988
prohibits the use of Title X funds for programs that assist a woman
in obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.
   The rule also prohibits funding for activities that ``encourage,
promote or advocate abortion.''
   Title X funds are the largest source of federal funding for
family planning services, the opinion said.
   The panel ruled that the restrictions do not violate the freedom
of speech of health care providers and that the limits on
counseling services do not violate the rights of pregnant women.
   The plaintiffs, who include private and public agencies, will
probably ask for an injunction against enforcement of the
regulations pending a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, said
Suzanne Lynn, chief of the Civil Rights Bureau for the state
Attorney General's office, who represented the State of New York in
appealing the regulations.
   ``The regulations make it impossible to give quality counseling
to pregnant women,'' said Lynn.
   ``This is a frightening decision in terms of the rights of women
to obtain abortions and the rights of health care providers and
women to speak about things related to medical care,'' agreed
Rachael Pine, lawyer for the Reproductive Freedom Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   The Health and Human Services regulation was also appealed in
Colorado and in Massachusetts. In both states, a lower court issued
an injunction against the regulations pending appeals, Pine said.
   Those appealing the regulation in New York included the State of
New York, New York City, The New York City Health and Hospitals
Corp., Planned Parenthood of NYC, Planned Parenthood of
Westchester-Rockland and Health Services of Hudson County, N.J.

   Art imitated life and the art of politics when
Mayor Raymond Flynn made a cameo performance playing himself on
``Cheers,'' the situation comedy set in a tavern in Boston's Beacon
Hill section.
   On a program that aired Thursday, Flynn, plaque in hand and a
television news crew in tow, strode into the bar festooned with
balloons and jammed with people celebrating the watering hole's
100th anniversary.
   The crowd on the show includes a barbershop quartet that sings
too much, a doctor going into labor and a 106-year-old man who
pinches young women.
   The mayor, who in real life instituted a pothole hot line,
listens patiently as someone complains about potholes and promises
to look into them. But when he discovers the postman on the show is
the man who writes him weekly missives suggesting how to run the
city, he has the postman arrested.

   ``We're a group of actors on daytime television who feel
compelled to speak out in defense of our constitutional right to
privacy and reproductive choice, which includes the right to choose
whether or not to terminate a pregnancy,'' Reed said.
   She said many in the group plan to attend a rally in Washington,
D.C., on Nov. 12.
   Reed said she did not fear a backlash from viewers because ``we
know from all the polls that the majority of Americans feels this

   The Duchess of York attended a high school
group's rehearsal of Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar'' as she began a
five-day tour of Texas at the invitation of Houston opera sponsors.
   Sarah Ferguson's host is Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp.,
a Houston energy firm. Wyatt's wife Lynn, vice chairman of the
Houston Grand Opera, invited the British royal family to
participate in a salute to 300 years of British opera.
   ``Fergie,'' as she is known to those who follow the royal
family, is pregnant with her second child by Britain's Prince
Andrew. But the Duke of York was unable to accompany her during the
trip, the British Embassy said Thursday.
   ``He doesn't have to go everywhere with her,'' embassy spokesman
Francis Cornish said. ``Fortunately, the royal family is in pretty
high demand. In many cases, it makes a lot more sense to split up
rather than go hand-in-hand around the continents of the world.''
   The duchess attended the student rehearsal at the Houston High
School for the Performing and Visual Arts and met faculty and
students.
   Today, after ceremonies at Houston City Hall with Mayor Kathy
Whitmire, the duchess was to visit the Johnson Space Center and
meet with controllers at Mission Control.
   The highlight of the trip are the operas _ ``Mikado'' on tonight
and ``New Year'' on Sunday night _ performed at the new Wortham
Theater Center.

   George Burns is 93, but not too old to play God
for a fourth time.
   He hopes to begin filming ``Oh, God! Book IV'' as soon as he
finds a script he likes, but meanwhile he's been promoting a new
show-biz memoir, ``All My Best Friends,'' and a new comedy video,
``George Burns: His Wit and Wisdom.''
   Daily chores are made more difficult by arthritis, astigmatism
and hearing loss, and he had a bypass operation at age 79, but
Burns says he is looking toward the future.
   He has so many projects ahead of him that he ``can't afford to
die.''
   One of them is a two-week appearance at the London Palladium in
January 1996, when the comedian will celebrate his 100th birthday.
   ``I don't think I'm going to die for a long time because I'm too
busy,'' Burns told USA Weekend in its Nov. 3-5 issue.

   This little town can't get any respect.
   The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has consistently
misspelled the name of the borough of 5,800 people as
``Swoyerville,'' and the error has stayed in the department
computer for two years.
   Last winter the mispelling showed up on a traffic sign at the
corner of Wyoming Avenue and Welles Street. It was corrected, but
lately residents have been discovering that their drivers' licenses
and car registration certificates also carry the error.
   The mistake is understandable, since at some times in its
history the borough was called Swoyerville, after a colliery owner
whose last name was Swoyer.
   But at least one resident is really annoyed.
   Jonathan Spohrer said he has been driving around for three
months with an expired drivers' license because he refuses to apply
for a new license as long as the Transportation Department
misspells the town's name.
   ``I'm a perfectionist. Just to look at it (the misspelling)
really bothers me,'' said Spohrer, a 29-year-old lawyer.
   Douglas Tobin, director of the Bureau of Driver Licensing, said
the department's computer was programmed a few years ago to spell
the names of towns and cities. The name was programmed into the
computer incorrectly, and the computer won't recognize any spelling
other than ``Swoyerville.''
   Department officials have been unable to change the spelling on
Spohrer's license renewal card, though he said he asked for a
correction three times.
   Tobin said that the department will reprogram the computer as
soon as possible, though he was not sure how long it would take.

   A pig that's a cat's meow can attend a
contest for cultivated kitties _ despite some grunting and groaning.
   The Westchester Cat Show didn't want to admit Cornelius, a
miniature Oriental pig, to the Nov. 10 show. But Pat and Andy
Stevenson, whose hairless cat Alienne qualified for the
competition, raised a stink.
   The case was referred to the International Cat Association,
which gave the nod to the pig.
   Cornelius, who is 4 months old, and Alienne, just under a year,
eat together, sleep together and play together, and the Stevensons
said they feared the kitten would be scared and lonely without
Cornelius in her corner.
   The International Cat Association ruled that Cornelius and
Alienne could be kept together in a special area before the
judging. But when Alienne goes to strut her stuff, Cornelius must
remain in the wings, so the other cats don't become agitated, the
group ruled.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Call for Special Prosecutor is Political</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says House
Democrats are bringing partisan politics into the investigation of
federal housing scandals by forcing him to take the first step
toward naming a special prosecutor.
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee formally asked
Thornburgh on Thursday to appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and other
officials linked to allegations of wrongdoing at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration.
   Under federal law, Thornburgh must tell Congress within 30 days
whether he finds grounds to open a preliminary investigation.
   Thornburgh said he would ``report to Congress as provided for in
that legislation.''
   But he charged the letter making the request and the two
congressmen leading the push, Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and
Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., thrust ``partisan politics into this
matter, which has until now been handled in a non-partisan,
professional way by the Congress, HUD and this department.''
   ``Even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations
have been completed,'' Thornburgh said.
   Nineteen of the 20 Democratic members of the House Judiciary
Committee signed the letter making the formal request for a
prosecutor.
   They said evidence gathered by a House subcommittee probing the
HUD scandals ``raises a serious possibility of criminal conduct.''
They cited possible perjury and conspiracy to defraud the
government by Pierce or other former top housing officials.
   ``I believe that crimes were committed at HUD,'' said Morrison.
``We don't know whether Secretary Pierce was responsible for that
criminal conduct, but we do know that without a special prosecutor
we will never find out.''
   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he was confident the
Justice Department would deny the request after reviewing
transcripts of the House investigation.
   Perito said the committee's proceedings ``contain not one shred
of evidence to form a basis that crimes have been committed or that
Mr. Pierce was involved in commission of any crime.''
   Under the independent counsel law, a majority of the members of
either party on the committee can trigger the first-step review by
the attorney general.
   If Thornburgh opens a preliminary investigation, he has 90 days
to conduct it and decide whether to ask a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to appoint a special prosecutor,
formally known as an independent counsel.
   The request came as the House Government Operations subcommittee
that has been investigating allegations of fraud,
influence-peddling and mismanagement was ending its probe, stymied
by the refusal of Pierce and three other former top officials to
testify.
   Schumer said in announcing the request, ``Sam Pierce, entrusted
with programs for the poor and powerless, instead gave those
programs to the very rich and the best politically connected.''
   ``There is ample evidence of wrongdoing at HUD, but there is
stonewalling at the top,'' he said. ``The only way to get to the
bottom of the mess at HUD is through the appointment of an
independent counsel.''
   Pierce testified voluntarily last May before the Government
Operations subcommittee on housing and employment. But when
subpoenaed for further appearances this fall, Pierce invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to
testify.
   Three other former top HUD officials, including Pierce's two
former top executive assistants, Deborah Gore Dean and Lance
Wilson, have also refused to testify.
   To support their contention that there may have been a
conspiracy to defraud the government, the congressmen said evidence
suggests grants were dispensed ``on the basis of favoritism and
without regard to the requirements of federal law.''
   On the perjury allegation, the congressmen cited Pierce's May 25
testimony that ``I did not have hands on'' the administration of
federal housing laws, and apparent contradictions by other
witnesses.

   Lawmakers are optimistic President Bush will
accept a $305 billion defense bill that cuts $1.1 billion from the
Strategic Defense Initiative and provides one less B-2 stealth
bomber in fiscal 1990.
   ``Apart from SDI, on the whole it's (the bill) one which we find
acceptable,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said shortly after
congressional negotiators adopted the legislation Thursday.
   The bill still must be approved by the full House and Senate,
and critics were outspoken about a defense blueprint that provides
all but $150 million Bush sought for land-based nuclear missiles
and restores some funds for conventional weapons the president
sought to kill.
   ``Where a weapon is built and by whom has become more important
than how much it costs, is it needed and whether it contributes to
our national security,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky., a
member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``We're buying too many big-ticket items with no hard choices,''
said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, another member of the panel.
   The object of their anger was the conferees' decision to provide
money for the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the aircraft that takes
off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, and the Navy's
F-14D Tomcat jet fighter.
   The tilt-rotor Osprey, which Bush sought to cancel, will receive
$255 million in research and development money but no procurement
funds.
   ``This decision will save hundreds of jobs for Philadelphians,''
Rep. Tom Foglietta, D-Pa., a member of the House Armed Services
panel, said in expressing his support for the bill.
   The negotiators also agreed to buy 18 F-14Ds in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1 but none in fiscal 1991. The legislation also
requires the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., of New York, to ``sign up
for termination,'' according to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The debate over the cancellation of the F-14D was the most
contentious of the nearly eight weeks of debate over the two widely
divergent House and Senate defense bills, lawmakers said.
   Warner said that in his 20 years of defense conferences, ``I've
never seen such forceful, if not ruthless, lobbying by some
groups.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was ``generally pleased''
with the bill because it provides for ``a strong national defense
and the basic principles of the president's defense budget
recommendations.''
   In a Pentagon statement, Cheney noted the bill ``recognizes that
we can't afford lower-priority defense programs, such as the V-22
aircraft production and, after fiscal year 1990, F-14D aircraft
production.''
   But Cheney expressed some disappointment with the cut in SDI,
saying, ``I would have preferred a higher level of funding for
SDI.''
   The bill provides $3.79 billion for the anti-missile shield,
popularly known as Star Wars _ $3.57 billion in Pentagon money and
$220 million in Department of Energy dollars.
   That represents about $200 million less than the amount
earmarked in fiscal 1989 and the first decrease in funds since
former President Reagan proposed the program six years ago.
   The Star Wars total falls between the $2.8 billion approved by
the House and the $4.3 billion adopted by the Senate.
   Nunn said the cut in Star Wars spending reflected the
diminishing congressional support for a program the Bush
administration has been unable to define.
   The bill also includes:
   _About $1.1 billion for the rail-based MX multiple-warhead
missile and the truck-based Midgetman single-warhead, about $150
million less than Bush had requested for the two nuclear weapons.
Cheney had favored financing only the MX, but Bush opted for both.
   _Funds for two B-2 stealth bombers in fiscal 1990, one less than
the Bush administration proposed, and money for components for five
in fiscal 1991. The bat-winged aircraft has come under
congressional criticism for its expensive price tag of $530 million
apiece.

<HEAD>Congress, Bush Near Budget Deal as White House Drops Capital Gains
Cut</HEAD>

   President Bush's offer to halt his drive for a
capital gains tax cut this year could end a bitter congressional
deadlock over must-pass fiscal legislation, a minimum wage bill and
other measures.
   Bush and Senate Republicans offered Thursday to stop trying to
add the capital gains provision to debt-limit legislation that must
be approved by next week.
   ``I deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered the
economic policy debate,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``Now,
the stalemate must be broken.''
   Democratic House and Senate leaders said they liked much of the
president's proposal and indicated a deal breaking the legislative
logjam might come soon.
   ``We are heartened by the statement made by the president today,
including his apparent decision to terminate his effort with regard
to capital gains,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters.
   ``My view is we're very, very close,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   But while extending an olive branch on capital gains _ one of
his top legislative priorities _ the president left a threat
dangling over Congress.
   He promised that if lawmakers failed to send him legislation
cutting at least $14 billion from the deficit _ and containing no
unrelated provisions _ he would leave $16.1 billion in cuts in most
federal programs, made under the Gramm-Rudman law, in effect all
year.
   ``Clearly this approach would not be a first choice for any of
us,'' Bush said. ``It is, however, a necessary discipline in the
absence of more satisfactory action.''
   The president's threat to leave the Gramm-Rudman cuts in effect
sparked hot retorts from Democrats, who said the slashes would
devastate education, environment, anti-drug and other programs Bush
has said are his priorities.
   ``Make no mistake about it, when you ... agree that these
across-the-board cuts are going to take place, it is really a
coward's approach to deficit reduction,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   The president's insistence on a deficit-reduction measure minus
unrelated issues was an effort to strip a number of
Democratic-backed programs from the House version of the bill.
These proposals include an expensive broadening of federal child
care efforts.
   Bush said he would continue seeking a capital gains reduction
this year. But by offering to keep the proposal off the debt-limit
and deficit-reduction bills, he essentially abandoned his best
chance for success.
   For weeks, Republicans have been trying to find a way to ensure
passage of their proposal to cut the tax on capital gains, which
are profits from sales of property, stocks and other holdings.
   Because they are short of the 60 votes they need for passage
under special Senate procedures, GOP lawmakers have tried attaching
the proposal to several bills that have better prospects for
passage.
   These include a deficit-reduction measure, legislation extending
the government's borrowing limit, and a bill providing aid to
Poland and Hungary. The result has been to delay action on all of
these measures.
   Thursday, another bill was derailed: a bipartisan package
raising the minimum wage for the first time since 1981.
   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, refused to let the chamber debate
the measure unless he was permitted to offer amendments reducing
the capital gains tax, and repealing both the new Medicare program
for the seriously ill and a business tax law.
   Symms' action provoked a volley from angry Democrats who accused
him of blocking a bill to help the poor in an attempt to help the
wealthy.
   ``I've seen a Republican Party that day in day out stands up and
fights for the rich of this country and is totally indifferent to
the problems of those who earn far less,'' said Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. `` How cruel can you be.''
   Unless the government's $2.8 trillion borrowing limit is
extended next week, it will face an unprecedented default. That
would boost federal borrowing costs and, according to some
economists, wreak havoc on the world's financial markets.

<HEAD>Defense Department Official Criticizes Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Defense Department official said Thursday
that Nicaragua was one of several places in the world where the
Soviet Union's conduct belied the spirit of political reform it has
professed at home.
   ``We are still awaiting a Soviet policy toward regional conflict
that fully complements its new thinking,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, the
department's undersecretary of defense of policy.
   Wolfowitz, in remarks made at Fifth General Chautauqua
Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations at the University of
Pittsburgh, delivered sharper criticism of Soviet policy than
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd has in recent speeches.
   The Pentagon official joined a senior Soviet Community Party
official in a discussion of the two nation's roles in trouble spots
around the world.
   Wolfovitz said that while the Soviet Union had halted its own
shipments to the Sandinista regime, Eastern Bloc and Cuban aid
continues to flow to Managua. He complained that Moscow had failed
to exert its influence to curtail those third-party shipments.
   Nikolai V. Shishlin, a senior staff member of the Central
Committee of the Community Party, argued, however, that the United
States could have a greater influence in stemming those arms
shipments if it were to ease its political and economic embargo in
Cuba.
   Shishlin also criticized Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega for
abandoning his regime's 19-month cease-fire with the Contras.
   ``My own personal opinion is that (Ortega's) decision is an
emotional one and the political consequences will be negative,'' he
said through a translator. ``At the same time, I would like to
believe that this decision can be reversed.''
   At the same time, however, Shishlin said Ortega's decision
should be viewed as a response to excessive pressure on the
Sandinista government by the United States.
   ``The exchange of statements doesn't speak highly of either
(President) Bush or Ortega,'' he said.
   Ortega announced the suspension of the cease-fire earlier this
week, contending that it was necessary in order to respond to
increasing Contra attacks within Nicaragua.
   Wolfowitz also criticized Soviet policy toward Afghanistan.
   While praising Foreign Minister Eduard A. Schvardnadze's recent
mea culpa for the Soviet invasion of that country, Wolfowitz said
Moscow continued to send billions of dollars in military aid to its
client regime in Kabul.
   This ``pattern of behavior,'' he said, ``is all the more ironic
at a time when the Soviet Union is facing up to the need to bring
greater openness and democracy into the political process at home
with a boldness that has captures the world's imagination.''
   Responding to the criticism, Shishlin alluded to American
assistance to the resistance there in asking, ``Whose missiles are
striking Kabul ... killing women and children?''
   Fielding a question from the audience, Wolfowitz sternly
resisted the suggestion that U.S. policies in countries such as
Nicaragua, South Korea, Panama and Vietnam were the moral
equivalents of Soviet actions criticized by the United States.
   ``We certainly admit to shortcomings, but nothing compared to
Afghanistan,'' he said. law.
   Despite the disagreements, which appeared to fly in the face of
a recent warming of U.S. policy toward the Soviets, the overall
tone of the morning session continued the spirit of hope that has
suffused four days of talks in Pittsburgh.
   ``The world really is changing and we're working to take
advantage of it,'' Wolfowitz said near the end of the discussion.
   Referring to next month's shipboard summit, Shishlin said, ``The
meeting of Bush and Gorbachev will allow them to kill the Cold War,
to stop it. ... The end of the Cold War will allow (the two
countries) to play a different role, perhaps a smaller role, but a
more creative role.''

<HEAD>Advocates for Elderly Seek Tighter Controls on Medigap Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the elderly say tighter
government regulation of ``medigap'' rates is needed to keep
insurance companies from unjustly boosting the premiums paid by
millions of older Americans.
   About 70 percent of the nation's 33 million Medicare
beneficiaries have medigap policies, with premiums averaging $800
in 989, to supplement government health care benefits.
   Prices shot up across the country last year, even though
Medicare took on more of the health care burden, and costs are
headed still higher in 1990, according to a report released
Thursday by a subcommittee of the House Select Committee on Aging.
   ``Shockingly, despite the new Medicare coverage, the states
reported increases in policy costs of up to 133 percent,'' the
subcommittee on health and long-term care reported. ``Every state
reported increases in the cost of at least some of the Medigap
policies sold there.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Edward Roybal, D-Calif., said the
increases in many cases were unwarranted but many older Americans
dare not switch medigap plans because long waiting periods often
precede the start of coverage for people with medical conditions.
   ``They are virtually trapped in one policy and at the mercy of
the companies who market those policies,'' Roybal said. He called
for tighter government regulation of medigap rate increases, citing
subcommittee findings that insurance companies in most states are
allowed to charge what they wish.
   ``Even public utilities must show just cause for rate hikes,''
Roybal said. ``Why shouldn't insurance companies be held
accountable for their rate increases?''
   Linda Jenckes, a vice president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, told the subcommittee that Medigap price
changes over the last year reflect increases in both the cost and
volume of claims for benefits. She estimated the average Medigap
premium rose 10 percent to 12 percent this year.
   Prices are likely to rise another 7 percent to 12 percent in
1990 due to rising health costs, but the increases are expected to
average 20 percent to 25 percent if Congress repeals the
catastrophic program, she said.
   John Gilmore, an independent health insurance agent in Naples,
Fla., told the subcommittee that some companies may use the
anticipated repeal or reduction of Medicare's new catastrophic
health-care benefits as an excuse for price gouging next year.
   ``I worry about those seniors with chronic illnesses who will be
forced to keep their present coverage no matter what the cost,''
said Gilmore, joining the call for tighter regulation of medigap
rates.
   James Firman, president of the United Seniors Health
Cooperative, said insurers are taking advantage of a ``climate of
fear and confusion'' to reap big profits on medigap policies.
   ``They are unfairly capitalizing on the fact that it is very
difficult and expensive for seniors to switch from one plan to
another,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analysts Surprised at Growth in Vietnam's Rice Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is shocking the global rice trade with
a 13-fold boost in exports over last year, a feat that could spell
eventual competition for U.S. producers, says an Agriculture
Department economist.
   Vietnam exported only 97,000 tons of rice in 1988, said Sara
Schwartz of the department's Economic Research Service. But
Vietnamese shipments this year are expected to total 1.3 million
tons, and 1990 exports are forecast at 1 million tons.
   The exports are low-quality rice bought by Third World
countries, including the Ivory Coast and Guinea in Africa, and
India and the Philippines.
   Vietnam's prices are below those of Thailand, which expects to
export about six million tons this year and accounts for about 40
percent of the world rice trade. The Vietnamese shipments would
make up about 9 percent of global exports.
   Schwartz said in a telephone interview Thursday, ``We really
don't know'' what has brought on the huge surge in Vietnam's rice
exports of where it is getting the surplus rice for sale overseas.
   Available data shows there has been a decline in rice
consumption in Vietnam, but there a lot of murkiness about the
actual conditions, she said.
   ``We haven't seen any news reports that there's been any
shortages (in Vietnam), but our data is so tenuous that we're
really not sure,'' Schwartz said. ``We really know very little.''
   The United States is one of the major rice exporters and is
expected to ship 2.8 million tons in calendar 1989, the most since
the 1981 record of 3 million tons. Exports are expected to decline
to around 2.5 million tons in 1990, reducing the U.S. global market
share to about 18 percent.
   Although Schwartz said it remains to be seen whether Vietnam
maintains its export momentum, its move into the export market
eventually could have some impact on U.S. rice shipments.
   ``But we don't know,'' she said. ``Right now, they are in the
low-quality markets and we're not. We don't sell a lot of rice to
their customers. If they would improve their quality by quite a
bit, they would impact on our markets. But they're not there at all
yet.''
   An analysis written by Schwartz noted this year's brisk U.S.
exports have been boosted by rising world demand and competitive
U.S. prices. Larger shipments to Latin America also are important.
   ``Mexico alone may purchase 180,000 tons of U.S. rice by the end
of the year, and continued exports to Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela
are expected,'' the report said. ``Steady demand by the (European
Economic Community) and Middle Eastern countries is also keeping
U.S. exports strong.''
   In her analysis, Schwartz said Vietnam was a net exporter of
rice before 1964 but shifted during the war. She counted both North
and South Vietnam in computing historical production and export
statistics.
   After 1964, Vietnam became a net rice importer, importing as
much as one million tons a year at the height of the war. Between
1981 and 1988, imports averaged 230,000 tons a year, and exports
averaged 85,000 tons.
   Schwartz said recent policy changes ``may more fully explain the
recent gains in production and availability of rice on the
international market.''
   Agricultural reform in China led to phenomenal growth in farm
production, and if Vietnam repeats the pattern, it could be become
a major force in the world's rice markets, she said.
   A recent paper presented by Vietnamese officials described how
land and all privately owned capital assets were redistributed
after the war ended in 1975. Crop decisions and marketing were
centrally planned. Production dropped.
   Attempts were made beginning in 1981 to overhaul the system, and
in 1988 individuals and families were allowed to lease land for 10
to 20 years. Other reforms began last year, including permission
for Vietnamese farmers to market their own grain instead of selling
it to the government.
   ``It may be too soon to attribute Vietnam's recent production
and export gains solely to the 1988 policy reforms,'' Schwartz
said. ``They could be due instead to a short-term consumption
decline. However, if the reforms have led to production increases,
the country's 1989 export performance may be more than a short-term
phenomenon.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds `Attitudinal Improvement' With Drug Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that puts anti-drug ads on television
and in newspapers says the spots are helping cut marijuana and
cocaine use in areas where they saturate the media.
   The Media-Advertising Partnership for a Drug-Free America said
Thursday that a survey indicated marijuana use among adults
declined 33 percent and cocaine use was down 15 percent in
communities where the advertisements were broadcast and printed in
newspapers.
   President Bush, speaking at a White House ceremony where the
survey results were released, said the organization ``demonstrates
the best in the American spirit of service to others.''
   ``You have the power to change America's mind about drugs,''
Bush told the gathering of representatives from the advertising
companies, production firms and media outlets that are involved in
the project.
   Seventy-five firms nationwide have produced 56 TV commercials,
50 radio spots and 106 print ads for the campaign since it was
launched in March 1987.
   Media organizations have contributed $310 million in time and
space to show the ads, the group said.
   Among the ads is one showing an egg frying in hot grease, with
the tag line, ``This is your brain on drugs.''
   Negative attitudes toward drugs were increased in places where
such ads were used, according to an attitude and user survey headed
by the New York-based Gordon S. Black Corp. About 7,000 people were
questioned for the survey.
   ``Attitudinal improvement was much greater in those communities
where exposure to the ads was the greatest,'' Black said in a news
release.
   However, youths ages 13 to 17 still showed only ``modest
improvement'' in attitudes toward drugs, the survey found.
   Among other findings, the study showed marijuana use among
adults dropped 12 percent from 1987 to 1988 in areas with high
saturation of the ads, and 33 percent from 1988 to 1989.
   Bush lauded the group's efforts. ``You've shown that the private
sector can do what legislation alone can never do _ change
attitudes,'' he said.
   Some anti-drug activists questioned the study's findings.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said in an interview Thursday that she was wary of a poll financed
by the same group that produced the ads.
   ``I hope this is right,'' she said of the survey results. ``I
would be surer that it was right if the people doing the research
had nothing to do with the people doing the advertising.
   ``This isn't all bad, but I would worry about thinking this was
the solution to the drug problem,'' she said.

<HEAD>FBI: Indictment Shows High-Level Mafia, Colombia Drug Link</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sicilian Mafia has joined Colombia's top drug
ring to ship cocaine into Europe and the northeastern United
States, FBI officials said Thursday in announcing a trafficking
indictment here.
   Twelve people in Miami, New York, Detroit and Colombia were
indicted in the case, including John Galatalo, 44, the alleged
middleman between the two smuggling groups, said FBI officials.
   ``This is the first real hard evidence of this nexus and close
relationship between Colombian cocaine trafficking and Sicilian
Mafia members,'' said Timothy McNally, assistant special agent in
charge of the FBI in Miami.
   The indictment accuses the defendants of shipping 30-kilogram
loads of cocaine by automobile and train from Miami to New York and
Philadelphia between 1985 and 1987. Then in late 1987, Galatalo
allegedly arranged a 600-kilogram shipment to be routed through
Aruba to the Mediterranean for distributon by the Sicilian Mafia in
Italy.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said the ring was buying its cocaine
from defendant Angel Leon Sanchez, 39, a member of the Barranquilla
cartel, which is directly connected to Colombia's Medellin cartel.
   ``They opened a corridor from Medellin to Southern Euorope,''
Miller said.
   Sanchez is believed to in Colombia, and the FBI will request his
extradition.
   Three of the defendants, including one in Miami and two in New
York, are currently in custody and several others are expected to
turn themselves in to authorities in the next two days.
   Galatalo of Miami was out on bond on a June indictment now
superceded by the charges a federal grand jury handed up Wednesday.
He is expected to appear Friday at an initial hearing in the new
case.
   He could face between 10 years and life in prison if convicted
of running a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Another defendant, Angelo Fontana, 36, of Miami was also free on
bond in the earlier case and was expected to surrender.
   The FBI praised Italian police for their cooperation in the
two-year investigation, and said while the 34-count indictment was
unlikely to make a major dent in the cocaine supply, it had hit
high-level traffickers.
   ``We're interested in major defendants, major organizational
players who put together this conspiracy and the shipments,''
McNally said. ``In this indictment we think we have it.''
   The indictment says the Italian-born Galatolo arranged for the
importation of cocaine from Colombia to Miami, then traveled
extensively to New York, Aruba and Milan to make arrangements for
shipments to the Northeast and Europe.
   Others named in the indictment are Waldino Jesus Aponte Ramero,
41; Luis Mejia, 31; Mariella Liggo, 49 and Luis Miguel, 41, all of
Miami; Carrell Williams, 43 of Detroit; Anthony Corinella and his
wife Giovanna Corinella, 40, of Sands Point, N.Y.; Victor Castro,
31, who is in federal prison on another conviction, and Jorge
Linares, 31, of Lauderdale Lakes.

   Ten years after Iranian radicals seized the
U.S. embassy in Tehran, subjecting American diplomats to outrageous
horrors, the world has taken several positive spins.
   Superpower relations are improved. Summits are an annual event.
There is a treaty on the books banning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles. Negotiators are working on another to sharply reduce U.S.
and Soviet stockpiles of long-range rockets.
   But terrorism has not receded as a threat to mankind. President
Carter's patient probing eventually brought the Americans home from
Tehran, but only after 444 miserable days in captivity.
   President Reagan's stern threat of ``swift and effective
retribution'' did not prevent the bombing of the U.S. embassy in
Beirut in April 1983, killing 17 Americans, or the slaughter of 241
Marines and sailors near the city's airport less than six months
later.
   Reagan White House operatives Robert McFarlane, John Poindexter
and Oliver North sought to barter arms for Iranian moderation _ and
the release of American hostages in Lebanon _ but they failed, as
well.
   The U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 may have
quieted Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi down a bit, but the attack did
not put terrorism back in its box.
   Just this week:
   Iranian radicals made plans for a rally of hatred outside the
former U.S. embassy on Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of its
seizure.
   Iran approved a law Wednesday giving it the power to arrest
Americans anywhere and put them on trial.
   Gunmen in Beirut the same day killed a Saudi diplomat and
wounded his driver. Hours later, Islamic Holy War, a pro-Iranian
group, took responsibility for the assault.
   Over the last 10 years there have been signs of progress.
   Airport security is tighter. Libya's plan to build a chemical
weapons plant was exposed by then-Secretary of State George P.
Shultz. The West German government was forced to admit West German
firms had been helping the Libyans.
   President Bush proposed in September eliminating most U.S. and
Soviet chemical weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze went him one better and urged getting rid of all of
them.
   The idea is to set a standard for 40 nations meeting in Geneva
to ban the production of chemical weapons and as a result deny
their use to terrorists.
   The U.S. and Soviet proposals are a start in seeking a solution.
But some experts doubt that a completely reliable way of stopping
all production everywhere can be devised.
   In a new book, ``Final Warning: Averting Disaster in the New Age
of Terrorism,'' analyst Robert Kupperman and reporter Jeff Kamen
offer the gloomy suggestion that the United States and its allies
are about to enter an era of terrorist attacks deadlier than ever
before.
   The main reason is more sophisticated technology. Another,
ironically, is the fact that democracies play by rules that
sometimes protect terrorists.
   A case in point from the book:
   Three years ago, Yu Kikumura, described as a member of the
Japanese Red Army, a small global terror gang, was arrested at
Schipol Airport in Amsterdam with a bomb concealed in a can of
breakfast food in his luggage.
   At trial, though, a Dutch judge ruled the search of Kikumura's
luggage was illegal. The case was dismissed and Kikumura was
deported to Japan.
   Last year, he was driving on the New Jersey turnpike when a
state trooper found three bombs hidden in his car. In a
confidential message at the trial last February, the U.S. attorney
said Kikumura's goal was ``mass slaughter'' of Americans in
retaliation for the raids on Libya.
   He was convicted, but his lawyers said they would appeal on the
grounds the trooper conducted an illegal search.
   ``Final Warning'' stands as a message as well as a book title.
   While Kupperman and Kamen conclude that terrorists have
accomplished few of their goals to date, the ability of a small
number of hard-core, trained and highly motivated agents to exploit
the openness of free societies poses an awesome challenge.
   ``The world will soon pay a high price for more than 20 years of
collective cowardice and indecision by democracies that failed to
take terrorism seriously, and for a concomitant period of callous,
Machiavellian use of terror by hostile governments,'' the authors
warn.
   ``Those hostile regimes correctly defined terror as a
cost-effective and plausibly deniable method of waging war, which
carries little, if any, risk to their lands.
   ``Nations that have employed terrorist groups as surrogates,
including Syria, Iran and Libya, have only lately been called to
account _ and with insignificant consequences.''

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Reinstate Oliver North's Pension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House must decide whether to go along with
a Senate vote to reinstate Oliver North's $23,000 annual pension,
revoked after he was sentenced for illegally shredding documents in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Let the vendetta end,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whose
bill to restore North's pension was approved by the Senate late
Thursday on a 78-17 vote. ``Ollie North has been punished enough.''
   But despite that plea, the debate over whether to give North
back his retirement pay dredged up bitter partisan feelings
stemming from President Reagan's efforts _ with North in a key role
_ to evade congressional restrictions and fund the Contra war in
Nicaragua.
   ``We are asked to bend the law for someone who broke the law,''
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``North's defense was that he was
just following orders. But we settled that issue at Nuremberg,'' a
reference to trials of Nazis involved in World War II atrocities.
   The issue now goes to the House, where similar legislation has
been introduced but not yet acted on.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
he would vote to put North in jail if he could. But he dropped his
opposition to the retirement-pay measure after Helms modified it to
apply not just to North, but to any military officer who may later
be convicted of shredding documents.
   ``Even a felon deserves equal treatment under the law,'' Biden
said. ``I might want Ollie North protecting me in a foxhole, but I
wouldn't want Ollie North teaching my son or daughter ethics.''
   Senators ignored warnings from colleagues like Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., who said the move would set a bad precedent and invite
future congressional tampering with criminal cases.
   ``We should not on this floor change that sentence anymore than
we should for Zsa Zsa Gabor,'' Simon argued.
   North, a Marine lieutenant colonel, lost his retirement pay
after he was sentenced July 5 to 1,200 hours of community service
and a $150,000 fine on three felony counts. He is appealing the
convictions.
   One of the counts, shredding government documents, stipulates
that anyone convicted ``forfeit his office'' with the U.S.
government.
   The General Accounting Office, which adjudicates federal pay
issues, ruled North's status as a retired military officer came
under that provision of the law and that forfeiting his office
meant he no longer qualified for retirement pay. The case marked
the first time the 15-year-old law had been applied to revoke
someone's pension.
   Technically, military retirement pay is not a pension based on
past service but a reduced salary for an officer who continues to
hold a commission and remains subject to recall to active duty.
   Helms offered the change as an amendment to a spending bill in
August, but the matter was laid aside and sent to the Senate
Judiciary Committee for further study. In a report this week, the
panel split along partisan lines on whether North's retirement
should be reinstated.
   Biden and six of his Democratic colleagues contended Congress
should take no action, but rather leave it up to the Navy and the
courts to decide.
   But the committee's six minority Republicans dissented, saying
the law that led to revocation of North's retirement pay was not
intended to have such an effect. A special relief bill for North
would remedy ambiguities in the law in his case, they argued.
   The issue has taken on political symbolism far beyond its dollar
value. North is reportedly earning $25,000 _ more than a year's
pension _ for each speech he gives on the lecture circuit. But some
conservatives view North as a hero who bore the brunt of blame for
President Reagan during the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``This is a pension he fought and shed his blood for,'' Helms
said, rattling off a list of medals North won in Vietnam. ``This
has been an unfair, unwarranted hardship on Col. North and his
family ... Ollie, this one's for you.''
   Senators voting against the measure were: Adams, D-Wash.; Byrd,
D-W.Va.; DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Dodd, D-Conn.; Durenberger, R-Minn.;
Glenn, D-Ohio; Harkin, D-Iowa; Hatfield, R-Ore.; Jeffords, R-Vt.;
Kerrey, D-Neb.; Kerry, D-Mass.; Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Leahy, D-Vt.;
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Sarbanes, D-Md.; Sasser, D-Tenn.; and Simon,
D-Ill.
   Not voting were Bingaman, D-N.M.; Bradley, D-N.J.; Daschle,
D-S.D.; Fowler, D-Ga.; and Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.

<HEAD>Scientists Expect Solar Activity to Disrupt Manmade Communications</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The next two to three years will see record or
near-record levels of the solar activity that disrupts radio
communications and satellite operations, a scientist predicts.
   ``We are approaching the peak of the sunspot cycle,'' said Joe
H. Allen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He
predicted the sunspots will peak next February, followed by solar
flares that will reach their maximum one or two years later and
magnetic storms at a high a few years afterward.
   The sun is about three years into its 11-year cycle of activity
and, Allen said, the February prediction comes from analysis of the
previous 21 solar cycles.
   Already this year, the sun's activities have been at levels not
reached since the late 1950s when the first satellites were put in
orbit.
   The activities began in March when a flare 36 times the size of
Earth _ possibly the largest ever recorded _ shot out from the sun.
   ``In March, some low-altitude satellites went tumbling in orbit,
some stationary satellites lost some of their communications
ability,'' said Allen in an interview. NOAA's own GOES 6 weather
satellite lost one of its communications channels in August.
   Allen said August solar activity rivaled that of 1972, a
landmark high. ``The September event was larger,'' he added, ``and
the October one was so much larger that it made us forget
September.''
   Solar flares affect the technical systems that support modern
society by disorienting satellites in orbit, halting high-frequency
radio communications and increasing the radiation level at
altitudes flown by the Concorde supersonic airplanes.
   ``The operational life of some satellites undoubtedly has been
reduced by recent solar activity,'' Allen said. That occurs because
satellites become disoriented and use up irreplaceable on-board
fuel to get back into proper operating attitudes.

<HEAD>Bush to Stay on Ship During US-Soviet Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to spend only a brief
time on the island of Malta before moving to a Navy ship in the
Mediterranean for next month's summit with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Sketchy details of Bush's plans were released by the White House
on Thursday along with a denial of any concern about his security
on Malta. The island once had close ties with Libyan Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, who is accused by the United States as being a sponsor of
terrorism.
   ``There are always security problems but we believe that they
can be managed and that the president's visit there will be secure
and safe,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said Bush will fly to Malta on Dec. 1 and meet briefly with
the nation's leaders. Then the president will be whisked to a Navy
guided-missile cruiser offshore for the remainder of his stay.
   Bush is to meet with Gorbachev on Dec. 2 and 3 and return to
Washington at the conclusion of the talks.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet on U.S. and Soviet ships on
alternate days.
   Some members of Bush's entourage, including the White House
press corps that covers the president, will be housed in Malta. A
pool of reporters is to be taken by helicopter or launch out to the
ships to cover the superpower meetings.
   Fitzwater said it was the United States that suggested Malta as
the staging area.
   Malta, an independent republic consisting of five islands, lies
58 miles south of Sicily, 220 miles north of Libya and 180 miles
east of Tunisia.
   Once a close ally of Libya, Malta has loosened political and
military relations but still has strong trade and commercial ties
and provides easy travel access to Libyans.
   The summit was a topic of discussion Thursday when Bush met in
the Oval Office with Imre Pozsgay, minister of state in Hungary and
a leading candidate in presidential elections this month.
   Speaking with reporters later, Pozsgay said the superpower talks
would further detente and strengthen perestroika, the process of
economic reform, in the Soviet Union.
   ``All central European nations can only profit from it,''
Pozsgay said.
   ``And, naturally, it would be very beneficial and advantageous
to Hungary if there is cooperation between the two superpowers,''
he said.

<HEAD>Cabinet Members Just Like the White House Puppies, Bennett Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of President Bush's Cabinet are often
like the White House puppies, ``dampening each other's coats'' in a
bid for his attention, jokes national drug control director William
J. Bennett.
   Bennett, acknowledging that sometimes he's ``too damn quotable
for my own good,'' drew a roar of laughter Thursday from the White
House audience of more than 100 prominent media leaders. Later, top
spokesmen for various Cabinet members responded the same way.
   Addressing the media leaders who came to the White House to
learn the results of a survey on the impact of anti-drug abuse ads
they had run, Bennett began by praising Bush's support for the war
against drugs.
   Then he recounted a day when he and Bush ``were leaving a
Cabinet meeting, he looked out the window and there was Millie and
the puppies, and he said, `You know, sometimes it's easy to get
distracted when you should be thinking about Cabinet affairs, and
once in a while my mind wanders and I see Millie and the puppies
and then I get back to work.'
   ``I said, `Well, that's sort of like the Cabinet anyway, Mr.
President, all those puppies pawing on each other, stepping on each
other's heads all trying to get your attention,''' Bennett said as
the audience burst out laughing.
   ``It's probably somewhat reminiscent of the Cabinet doing other
things to each other which I won't repeat here _ dampening each
other's coats, shall we say? But everybody trying to get the
attention of mama,'' he said.
   Bush decided not to include Bennett in his Cabinet even though
Congress created Bennett's position _ director of the Office of
National Drug Control Strategy _ as a Cabinet-level office.
   Bennett has maintained he doesn't mind being excluded from the
Cabinet, where he served earlier as President Reagan's education
secretary, as long as he has the president's support.
   All the top spokesmen for Cabinet members contacted Thursday
evening responded with laughter when told of Bennett's remark.
Cabinet members were out of town or had left their offices for the
day by the time their reaction was sought.
   ``It's a good line,'' said David Runkel, spokesman for Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   Bob Marx, spokesman for Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner,
conceded when asked for a response, ``We're not going to be able to
play. He's not around to ask. Sounds like fun though.''
   Steve Goldstein, spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan,
controlled his chuckles to come up with a more serious response,
saying, ``Manuel Lujan has known George Bush for 20 years, and if
he needs to reach the president, all he has to do is call.''
   Bennett's deputy chief of staff, David Tell, said, ``What's the
big deal? It's just a joke,'' but sounded relieved to learn the
administration spokesmen had responded with laughter.
   Bennett is known for his occasionally sharp-edged humor and
cutting comments, and they have gotten him in trouble in the past.
   During an education summit in September in Charlottesville, Va.,
Bennett moderated a closed session with a number of governors and
later publicly summed up what had been discussed.
   ``There was pap _ standard Democratic pap,'' Bennett said.
``There was standard Republican pap, and there was stuff that
rhymes with pap on both sides too.''
   Two days later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bennett had been rebuked by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.

<HEAD>Voters Decide Ballpark, AIDS, ``Domestic Partners'' Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Will San Francisco voters reward their
World Series losers with a downtown ballpark? Will they approve a
measure that grants the same benefits to ``domestic partners'' that
married couples get?
   Tune in Nov. 7 and find out as sex, sports and bias dominate
ballots across northern California.
   Some of the other ballot measures include repeal of an ordinance
that bans discrimination against people with AIDS in the East Bay
community of Concord, and a vote by residents of tiny Bolinas,
north of San Francisco, over whether to install signs directing
drivers to their town.
   Coming on the heels of a devastating earthquake and a World
Series that pitted cross-bay rivals Oakland and San Francisco, the
elections have generated large contributions, controversy and
national interest.
   But some political analysts believe the quake's devastation may
dim voter enthusiasm.
   In San Francisco, Measure S would allow unmarried and homosexual
couples working for the city to formally establish their
relationships as ``domestic partners,'' complete with funeral and
sick leave benefits.
   Proposition P would provide for the construction of a
48,000-seat ballpark in the city's China Basin district, replacing
chilly, windswept Candlestick Park. Giants owner Bob Lurie has
threatened to move the team if the measure fails. San Jose and
Sacramento are mentioned as possible new locales.
   ``If it loses, it shows that San Franciscans don't have faith in
themselves and their future,'' said Gerald Newfarmer, executive
director of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
   Opponents of the stadium say it will result in gridlock and is
an unnecessary expense.
   Some opponents of Measure S, which Mayor Art Agnos backs, claim
the legislation is vague and could prove too costly for a city
already financially strapped.
   The Rev. Charles McIlhenny of the First Orthodox Presbyterian
Church in San Francisco said he sees no need for the ``special
legislation for homosexuals'' and argues there's been no evidence
of discrimination.
   The measure is ``only for live-in lovers, gay or straight,'' he
said. It provides some of the same benefits as marriage, McIlhenny
said, without the attending responsibilities.
   Agnos had lobbied strongly for the stadium, but after the Oct.
17 earthquake he suspended his campaign. The $115 million ballpark,
which would be built and financed by a private developer, would
require $2 million in annual city investment over the next 10 years.
   Despite Agnos' post-quake reluctance to push for the new
stadium, the disaster may have actually rallied some voters to the
idea.
   A newspaper poll Wednesday showed 49 percent of the voters
opposed to the ballpark, with 40 percent in favor and 11 percent
undecided. But the last pre-quake poll had shown the measure
trailing by 21 percent. And that was also before the rival
Athletics swept the Giants 4-0 in the World Series.
   In Scottsdale, Ariz., meanwhile, voters will decide the fate of
a new baseball complex for the Giants, who train in that Phoenix
suburb each spring. Giants officials say they will move when their
contract expires in 1991 unless the new facility is built.
   In Concord, a large voter turnout was expected for a vote to
repeal an ordinance banning discrimination in housing, employment
and other areas against AIDS victims.
   The ordinance was approved by the City Council, then placed on
the ballot after protests by outraged residents who collected
10,000 signatures.
   The election marks the first time that an AIDS
anti-discrimination issue has gone to a public vote.
   Here are some of the other issues facing voters:
   _In Fremont, northeast of San Jose, attorney James L. Fallon is
running for one of two council seats as the city's first openly
homosexual candidate. ``Sometimes one does not run to win,
sometimes one runs to make a point, and the point I'm trying to
make is to stimulate the debate on homosexuality in general and
homosexuals in government,'' Fallon said.
   _In Union City, north of Fremont, voters will select one of two
measures regulating construction on 5,000 acres of scenic hills and
canyons now zoned for agriculture and open space. Voters in nearby
Hayward also will decide how much construction to allow on scenic
hillsides.
   _In Bolinas, 15 miles north of the city in Marin County, the big
question is whether to put up a highway sign; previous markers have
been torn down as quickly as they have been posted.

<HEAD>Even Slight Increase in Exercise Can Prolong Life, Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short daily walk can go a long way toward
prolonging your life, according to researchers whose study finds
that even moderate exercise can help the most hard-core couch
potatoes.
   ``The positive aspect of the work ... is that it doesn't take a
lot of exercise to make the kinds of changes that over the long run
will save us years,'' said George Lesmes, director of the Center
for Exercise Science and Cardiovascular Research at Northeastern
Illinois University.
   Fitness gurus also welcomed the study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Hallelujah! They're finally making some sense out of this
thing,'' said exercise video star Richard Simmons in a telephone
interview from Los Angeles. ``If you exercise, if you take care of
your body, it's the best thing in the world. You do live longer.''
   The study by researchers at the Institute for Aerobics Research
in Dallas indicated that if all the unfit people surveyed had
become fit, the death rates might have dropped by 9 percent in men
and 15.3 percent in women.
   And it doesn't take much to get into some semblance of fitness,
said Steven N. Blair, an epidemiologist and co-author of the study.
   ``The most sedentary, the most unfit can get a lot of benefit if
they just can move up the scale a ways'' to a level of moderate
fitness, Blair said. ``They don't have to become marathon runners.''
   Thirty to 45 minutes of brisk walking each day ``will produce
the moderate levels (of fitness) that are associated with much
lower death rates,'' he said.
   He added that fewer than 10 percent of adult Americans exercise
at levels recommended by the surgeon general.
   The researchers studied 10,224 men and 3,120 women for an
average of more than eight years. Of those, 240 men and 43 women
died during the study. It was a far larger study than previous ones
of which the authors are aware, they said.
   The subjects were first tested on a treadmill to determine their
fitness level and then tested for blood-cholesterol levels, blood
pressure and other general health factors.
   They also were questioned about factors in their lifestyles that
might affect longevity, such as smoking, as well as family history
of heart disease.
   Even when all other data were considered, the more active groups
had lower death rates, the authors said.
   Among men who were the least fit, the death rate was 64 per
10,000 person-years compared with 16.6 deaths among the most fit
group. A person-year equals the number of people studied multiplied
by the number of years they were followed.
   Among women, deaths dropped from 39.5 per 10,000 person-years to
8.5 per 10,000.
   Heart-disease death rates among men fell from 24.6 among the
least fit to 3.1 for those in the two most fit groups. For women,
heart-disease death rates dropped from 7.4 to 0.8.
   Death rates from cancer among men fell from 20.3 to 4.7, and
among women dropped from 16.3 to 1.0.
   Researchers said that there were few deaths for the specific
causes in women, so those results should be interpreted cautiously.
   ``We find that most of the reduction in this all-cause mortality
was due to lower rates in cardiovascular disease death and cancer
death in the men and women,'' Blair said. ``So it seems that higher
levels of fitness are more likely to protect against those two
causes (of death).''
   The study also suggested that increased fitness may help
compensate for other factors that might shorten life, Blair said.
For example, people in the study who had high blood pressure but
were highly fit lived longer than people with low blood pressure
who were inactive.

   An American Roman Catholic nun who had
received threatening letters disappeared Thursday from the garden
of a retreat house, a church official said.
   Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio of Guatemala City said in
a telephone interview that Sister Diana Ortiz, 31, of the Ursuline
order had gone into the garden of the Belene Sisters Retreat House,
a former convent in Antigua, and ``she did not return at lunch
time.''
   In Washington, the State Department said a nun was missing but
could not confirm her identity.
   The archbishop said the nun probably had been watched and then
was kidnapped from the courtyard without anyone noticing. She had
been attending classes at the house, he said.
   She had been threatened several times while teaching
kindergarten for more than a year in San Miguel Acatan, in
Huehuetenango province, 225 miles northwest of Guatemala City, he
said.
   Ortiz, a native of Grants, N.M., had taught school in Owensboro
and Hawesville, Ky., before going to Guatemala two years ago.
   National police in Antigua, 28 miles west of Guatemala City,
would not comment on the case. The national police office in
Guatemala City said it had no information.
   In Louisville, Ky., The Courier-Journal quoted Sister Mary
Elizabeth Dallard, who worked with Ortiz, as saying Ortiz had
received at least seven letters since January warning her to leave
the country.
   After an incident in Guatemala City in mid-July, she did leave
for a time, said the sister, of the Mount St. Joseph Ursuline
Sisters of Maple Mount, Ky.
   ``A man she didn't know called her by name, took her arm and
sort of forced her to walk with him while he talked,'' The
Courier-Journal quoted Dallard as saying. ``He knew where she
worked and told her to leave.''
   A stronger threat came on Oct. 12, about a month after she
returned to Guatemala, Dallard said.
   ``Violent words, such as `decapitated,' `assassinated' and
`rape,' were cut out of the paper and pasted on a paper,'' she
said. The paper was put under the door of her room at a convent in
Guatemala City.
   Ortiz had asked her to keep the letters in case they were ever
needed as evidence, Dallard said. She returned to Kentucky because
her father died and planned to return to Guatemala on Saturday.
   The archbishop said Sister Patricia Denny, 54, of the Maryknoll
order, left the country in mid-October after receiving repeated
death threats.
   She lived in Mixco, a town near the capital.
   The archbishop, who led a peace march of 15,000 children on
Saturday, said he would ask the government to try to locate Sister
Ortiz.
   A new wave of the assassinations and disappearances that claimed
tens of thousands of lives in the late 1970s and early 1980s began
in mid-July. A leading Christian Democratic politician, a prominent
banker and students have been among its victims.
   The extreme right, with traditional links to the military, is
being blamed by some observers for the most of the violence.

<HEAD>Chrysler Agrees on Program to Reduce Trauma Disorders Among Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chrysler Corp. agrees to pay $45,350 in
fines and work toward reducing medical disorders that result from
repetitive motions performed by workers at its assembly plants, the
Labor Department says.
   The agreement among Chrysler, the United Auto Workers union and
the Labor Department was announced Thursday.
   The medical problems at issue are called cumulative trauma
disorders. Though going by various names, they all originate in
constantly repeated motions.
   Perhaps the best known is carpal tunnel syndrome, wrist pain
found among people who must use typewriter keyboards.
   Another is ``white finger,'' common among operators of pneumatic
drills, caused by vibration.
   ``Ergonomic hazards pose a particular threat in auto assembly
operations because of the nature of much of the work. The Chrysler
agreement is another important step in the agency's continuing
commitment to cut the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders,''
said Gerard F. Scannell, assistant secretary of labor and head of
the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   The agreement is modeled on an earlier agreement with Iowa Beef
Processors _ a company in another industry where tasks are broken
down into small segments performed over and over, like on an auto
assembly line.
   Under the Chrysler agreement, the company has agreed to pay
$43,000 to settle 13 allegations of workplace violations related to
cumulative trauma disorders at its Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant.
The safety agency had proposed a fine of $65,000.
   Another $2,350 will be paid to settle other allegations for
which the agency proposed fines of $13,000.
   Under the agreement, Chrysler will hire an expert within 90 days
to study the Belvidere plant and help develop counter-measures
against cumulative trauma disorders. The study is to be completed
within two years and reported to the agency.
   The company ``will implement to the extent feasible the various
controls necessary,'' according to the department's announcement.
   The Belvidere plant will report periodically to the four other
plants, and Chrysler agreed to use its ``best efforts'' to apply
the Belvidere controls at those installation _ an assembly plant in
Newark, Del., the Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio and two plants in St.
Louis. If separate hazards are identified at those plants, Chrysler
has agreed to address those within three years.
   Chrysler also agreed not to discriminate against employees
requesting medical treatment for a diagnosed cumulative trauma
disorder.
   Measures that can be employed to prevent repetitive motion
disorders can include, among other things, assignment of workers to
do several task instead of just one, rotation of workers among
several jobs, redesign of job tasks and special tools.
   There was no indication of why the five plants were chosen and
not others.
   UAW Local 1268 at Belvidere is also a party to the agreement.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Continues Ban on Fetal Tissue Research With Federal

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan says he agrees federal funds should not be used for
research using fetal tissue from intentional abortions.
   Sullivan, acting on the recommendation of his chief health
official, informed the National Institutes of Health on Thursday
that the 20-month ban on such research by federal scientists or
with federal grants will be extended indefinitely.
   While acknowledging potential health benefits from such
research, Sullivan said he could not ignore the moral and ethical
considerations.
   ``It is clear that research involving use of fetal tissue from
induced abortions for human transplantation could potentially
produce health benefits, and I do not in any way discount the
importance of this fact,'' Sullivan said in a statement issued by
his office.
   ``But this is an issue which requires careful consideration not
only of the potential benefits and hazard of such research, but
also profound consideration of those moral and ethical elements
which must never be divorced from the highest purpose of medical
research,'' he said.
   ``It is my conclusion that in the specific area of
transplantation to humans involving fetal tissue from induced
abortions, it is not appropriate that federal support be provided.''
   James Mason, assistant secretary for health at HHS, told
reporters Wednesday that he intended to continue the ban, imposed
by his predecessor last year, because he believes such
experimentation would lead to more abortions.
   Mason called federally supported fetal tissue research
``unacceptable public policy'' and said it would unfairly trade off
the rights of fetuses with those of patients suffering from
diseases that could possibly be treated by fetal tissue transplants.
   Medical experts, ethicists and some lawmakers reacted strongly
to Mason's decision, saying it would hamper research into promising
treatments for Parkinson's disease and other as yet incurable
conditions.
   The ban applies to research using tissue from fetuses
intentionally aborted. It does not affect privately funded research
using this tissue and would still allow federally funded research
using fetal tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions.

   A spreading complacency about the AIDS
epidemic threatens to undermine efforts to fight the disease that
is expected to grow tenfold by the turn of the century, a World
Health Organization official warns.
   Jonathan M. Mann, director of WHO's Global Programme on AIDS,
said the number of AIDS cases worldwide is expected to grow from
the currently estimated 600,000 to 6 million during the next decade.
   The number infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS but
often lies dormant for years before symptoms appear, is estimated
at between 6 million and 8 million worldwide and is projected to
double or triple during the 1990s, he told the National Commission
on AIDS.
   He said a successful foundation for fighting the epidemic has
been built around strategies to slow the spread of the virus and
the development of treatment therapies.
   However, he cautioned, ``dangerous complacency about AIDS is
spreading.''
   ``If complacency, indifference or denial lead to relaxation of
current efforts or to a decrease in future commitment to AIDS, we
will falter and fall further and further behind the pace of the
worldwide epidemic,'' he said.
   Mann called for increased financial and political commitments by
the United States to the Global Programme on AIDS, which helps
countries set up national AIDS education and prevention programs.
   The U.S. contribution to the WHO program was $25.5 million in
1989, about 30 percent of the program's budget, he said. Mann said
he anticipated the U.S. contribution would be $21 million in 1990,
funding 20 percent of the budget.
   He said the United States could help most by increasing its
direct financial support of AIDS programs in other countries, but
he did not suggest how much.
   Mann's testimony began a two-day meeting of the commission that
was established last year to advise the president and Congress on
AIDS issues. His estimate of 6 million AIDS cases by the year 2000
is approximately the same as the agency's projection issued in May.

<HEAD>Investigators, Flight 103 Victims' Relatives Going to Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators and relatives of
people killed in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing are going to West
Germany to look into new allegations of prior warnings that
terrorists targeted the flight for attack.
   A presidential commission also will look into the charges made
in court documents by Pan American World Airways, said Sens. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., both members of
the commission on aviation security.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., at a news conference Thursday with
the senators and victims' relatives, said members of her staff will
travel to Bonn and Frankfurt with relatives of some of the 270
people killed in the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   She said staff members would meet with German officials, Federal
Aviation Administration security personnel in Europe and airport
security officers in Frankfurt where the flight originated.
   The flight, crowded with Americans returning to the United
States for the Christmas holidays, went from Frankfurt to London,
where passengers switched to another plane for the final leg to New
York.
   Bert Ammerman, spokesman for victims' families, said the
government showed ``negligent disregard for airport and airline
security and terrorism and a lax response'' to the bombing.
   The seven-member commission on air terrorism will look into Pan
Am's allegations that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad warned
U.S. authorities of a possible attack 36 hours before the crash,
said Lautenberg and D'Amato.
   They said the commission also will investigate Pan Am's
contention that West Germany's investigative agency reported
``suspicious activities'' at the Frankfurt airport baggage loading
area within 90 minutes of the flight's departure.
   The commission, which includes members of Congress and others,
was formed to look into the bombing.
   Lautenberg said he had no information to verify or disprove the
new allegations. The airline, facing $300 million in lawsuits over
the bombing, wants a court order for documents and interviews at
the CIA and other U.S. agencies, along with any information the
government may have about warnings before the flight.
   A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Wednesday
the department ``never received any specific and credible threat
against Pan Am 103.'' British and U.S. authorities have, however,
acknowledged general threats against U.S. carriers at the time.
   West German authorities said they issued a general warning about
possible terrorist attacks the month before the bombing, but denied
there were late warnings about the specific flight.
   Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., whose brother Tom died in the
bombing, said relatives were shocked by the Pan Am claims.
   ``Needless to say, these reports are appalling,'' Ammerman said.
``If they are true, then we could be witnessing the uncovering of
one of the gravest scandals ever to hit our intelligence and
security communities.
   ``If they are not true,'' he said, ``then they would represent a
cynical and reprehensible attempt by Pan Am to avoid culpability
for this horrendous tragedy.''
   Ammerman said that with both the government and the airline,
there has been ``too much fiddling going on, while the families of
the victims burn in our anguish and outrage.''
   Investigators have determined the plane was downed by plastic
explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player in the luggage
compartment. The probe is focusing on terrorist groups operating in
the Middle East and Europe, but investigators have not determined
who put it there.

   As many as 1,000 Armenian protesters blocked
the entrance to the Shrine Auditorium on Thursday night, preventing
the performance of the Red Army Choir from the Soviet Union.
   Between 500 and 1,000 protesters began blocking the entrance
beginning shortly after 6 p.m. and tied up blocked streets
surrounding the auditorium, police said.
   ``We're trying to bring to public attention that the Red Army,
instead of protecting its citizens, is firing on people,'' said
Berdj Karapetian, a spokesman for the Armenia National Committee.
   A few protesters chained themselves to the auditorium's doors,
said policeman Jim Farris. Some carried signs lettered in Armenian
script and shouted slogans decrying the Red Army troupe's visit.
   Police reported shouting matches between demonstrators and
people trying to enter the auditorium for the show. No one was
injured.
   The performance of the 200-member musical troupe composed of
members of the Soviet army was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. but did
not start, Sgt. Jesse James said.
   Delayed for hours, the show finally went ahead before a reduced
audience late Thursday night, KNBC-TV reported.
   Police in riot gear patrolled the area, but no arrests were
reported.
   James described the situation as tense.
   The Los Angeles area is home to hundreds of thousands of people
of Armenian descent. Many have been angered by Soviet policies,
ranging from territorial disputes between the neighboring regions
of Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Soviet response to last year's
massive earthquake, which devastated Soviet Armenia.
   The Red Army Choir, also called the Red Army Song and Dance
Ensemble, has been touring U.S. cities for the first time as part
of a goodwill visit encouraging the policy of openness, or
glasnost, promoted by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Its 31-city
tour began in New York on Sept. 12.

<TEXT>
   United Airlines 232. Northwest Airlines
255. Pan Am 103. These unfortunate flight numbers exist no longer,
pulled by airline officials leery of reminding their passengers of
bad news.
   United Airlines still has early afternoon flights from Denver to
Chicago but neither one is Flight 232, the number given to a DC-10
that made a crash landing in Sioux City last summer. And Northwest
Airlines doesn't operate a Flight 255 in the wake of a crash two
years ago.
   ``There's no set policy,'' said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons
in a telephone interview from Minneapolis. Before Flight 255, he
said, ``We hadn't had a crash in 23 years, so it's difficult to
have a policy. We elected to retire that number in this case.''
   Flight 255 crashed just after takeoff at the Detroit airport
Aug. 16, 1987, killing 156 passengers. One child survived.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said her company pulled the
number after the July 19 crash landing of Flight 232, which killed
112 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``There were some indications that customers didn't want to be
reminded about Flight 232,'' Ms. Dornacker said from company
headquarters in Chicago.
   Pan Am changed the number of Flight 103 after a bomb destroyed
the plane on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground. The flight, from Frankfurt,
West Germany, is now Flight 11, airline spokeswoman Elizabeth
Manners said from New York.
   United also changed the designation of its flight from Honolulu
to Auckland, New Zealand, and on to Sydney, Australia. On Feb. 24,
a large piece of the skin tore off of Flight 811, creating a hole
in the Boeing 747 through which nine passengers were sucked to
their deaths.
   The new flight number is 817.
   The designation of flight numbers, Ms. Dornacker said, is
basically up to the airline, although federal regulations require
airlines to keep distinctively different numbers any time two
carriers serve the same market at about the same time. This is to
avoid confusion in communications between pilots and air traffic
controllers.
   While some airlines retire flight numbers for flights that
resulted in crashes, they have no qualms about using numbers
involved in other airlines' accidents. United has a Flight 255 and
Northwest has a Flight 232.
   ``Our Flight 255 serves a completely different market, from
Miami to Denver to Sacramento, Calif.,'' Ms. Dornacker said.

   Police defused a bomb left outside the
national police chief's home four days before general elections,
and no one was injured, authorities said.
   No one claimed responsibility for bomb, but police said Thursday
they suspected a leftist group, the Revolutionary Popular Struggle.
   Police rushed to the home of police chief Yannis Antonopoulos in
the Athens suburb of Ilioupolis Wednesday night after an
unidentified caller told a newspaper that a bomb was set to go off
at midnight.
   Authorities said they defused the bomb without incident.
   The Revolutionary Popular Struggle wants to force Greece out of
NATO, dismantle U.S. military bases in Greece and launch a leftist
revolution.
   On Sept. 26, parliament deputy Pavlos Bakoyannis, son-in-law of
New Democracy party leader Constantine Mitsotakis, was
assassinated. The killing was claimed by another leftist group
called November 17.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee has passed a
bill providing a temporary stay of deportations of Salvadorans and
Nicaraguans who are in this country illegally after fleeing
conflict in their home countries.
   The measure won committee approval, 11-3, Thursday and now goes

   The House last week approved a similar bill that also would
provide a three-year stay of deportations of Chinese in the United
States after fleeing the crackdown this summer against student
democracy demonstrations.
   That measure was sent to a subcommittee for further study.
   The bill approved by the full panel contains no provision for
staying deportations of Chinese.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., sponsor of the bill, said it was
needed to provide safe haven for citizens of the two Central
American nations who have not gained refugee status and to enable
them to work in this country.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who had been fighting the measure for
more than two months, relented on Thursday but said he remained an

<NOTE>Witnesses Say Silver Cloud of Glasnost Has a Dark Lining</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Witnesses have told Congress that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's new policies have not ended political repression and
human rights abuses in the Soviet Union.
   All of the witnesses who appeared Thursday before a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee acknowledged that significant and
unanticipated human rights advances have taken place under the
leadership of the Soviet president.
   But all said the new freedoms of glasnost have been incomplete
and halting.
   ``It's a case of two steps forward, one step back, and every
day's newspaper is evidence of that,'' said Holly Burkhalter,
Washington director of Helsinki Watch, the observer group that
monitors human rights developments in the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah and the subcommittee's chairman,
outlined the more positive developments in the Soviet Union,
including the expansion of legitimate private enterprise, broadened
religious rights, a more independent press, greater freedom of
expression, a less oppressive KGB, psychiatric reforms and a
dramatic increase in emigration.
   But Owens and the witnesses said the silver cloud has a dark
lining.
   ``Paradoxically, glasnost has sometimes led to increased human
rights abuses, as the authorities have countered with new types of
repression, including the killing of peaceful demonstrators,'' Ms.
Burkhalter said.
   She said that while 600 or so longtime political prisoners have
been released since 1987, at least 100 ``prisoners of conscience''
remain imprisoned.
   Soviet authorities have increased short-term detentions, holding
as many as 150 people a month for up to 15 days, she said.
   And although the Gorbachev government has taken important steps
to curb the use of psychiatry to control political dissenters,
about 50 people continue to be held in psychiatric institutions for
political reasons, she said.

   The main writers' group in Vietnam has
backed the Communist Party's leadership in literary affairs,
official Radio Hanoi said in a report available today.
   The support came in a resolution adopted at the end of the
Vietnam Writers' Association's congress in Hanoi from Oct. 28 to
Nov. 1, the radio said Thursday. A text was available today in
Bangkok.
   The resolution said the group ``expressed profound confidence in
the party leadership over literature.''
   Since reformer Nguyen Van Linh became party chief in late 1986,
the party had eased control over many aspects of society, and
writers and intellectuals had become significantly more outspoken.
   More recently, however, the party has retreated somewhat from
its reform policies.
   At least two literary magazines have been shut down, and the
editors of the two most important newspapers in Ho Chi Minh City
are being changed, the Far Eastern Economic Review weekly recently
reported.

   A panel of the National Academy of Sciences
warned today against proceeding with oil exploration off the
California and Florida coasts, saying there is not enough reliable
technical information on potential damage to the environment.
   The scientific panel also was critical of past environmental
studies of the lease sites by the Interior Department, saying that
in some cases potentially adverse economic and social problems from
oil development were ignored.
   At each of the three sites, the panel said it found inadequate
and unreliable technical and scientific data to warrant going ahead
with lease sales.
   The conclusions were presented to a presidential task force that
is reviewing whether to issue oil and gas exploratory leases for
the three offshore sites. The task force is scheduled to make a
recommendation to the White House by the end of the year.
   The sites off northern and southern California and in the Gulf
of Mexico near the Florida Everglades are among the most
controversial government leases sought by the oil industry because
of strong opposition from environmentalists and residents in nearby
coastal areas.
   Last February, President Bush put a hold on issuing the leases
and directed a special task force headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan to examine the environmental concerns. He also
directed the Academy's National Research Council to examine the
technical and scientific issues involved and make a report to the
task force.
   In its report, the scientific panel concluded that the available
technical and scientific data from each of the three lease sites
``is currently inadequate for decisions (to be made) about
development and production'' of oil and gas resources.
   The panel, which included experts in marine science,
oceanography and environmental science, did not specifically
recommend against future development of the three sites, but
concluded no such decision should be made without further studies.
   The leases involve potential oil and gas drilling on 1.1 million
acres of ocean off Southern California, another 6.7 million acres
off Northern California, and 14 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico
near the Florida Everglades.
   Environmentalists have long argued that the three areas should
be closed to oil drilling because a spill could cause serious harm
to sensitive ecosystems nearby. Residents along nearby coastal
areas also have strongly opposed the leases, saying oil development
could harm the scenery and affect tourism.
   Among the findings of the scientific panel were these:
   _ An oil spill in the Florida lease site likely would result in
oil reaching the Florida coastline within hours and polluting some
of the state's beaches.
   _ More information is needed to assess the effect of oil
development on corals, seagrasses and other elements of the coastal
ecosystems near the Florida site. Although better information is
available at the two California sites, further studies on potential
ecosystem damage is needed there as well.
   _ Data from Interior Department studies on the effect of oil
development on nearby communities was found to be unreliable and
``not adequate to making a leasing decision.'' The panel said in
some cases information was out of date and at other times
``significant ... social and economic impacts (to communities) have
been ignored.''
   In Florida the threats posed by oil development to tourism
``have not even been studied,'' said the panel, while in Southern
California the question of community impact also has yet to be
fully addressed.
   In examining the impact of oil development at the sites for each
of three categories _ ecology, physical oceanography and
socioeconomics _ the panel said it found shortcomings in one or
more categories at each of the three sites.

   The Giant Dipper will roll again.
   The wooden roller coaster many recall when thinking of this
seaside resort will reopen this weekend to raise money for quake
victims.
   ``We want to help people have a little bit of fun after all
that's happened here,'' said Ann T. Parker, publicity manager for
Santa Cruz Seaside Co., which operates the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.
``And at the same time we want to raise money for people who really
need it.''
   Visitors to the boardwalk between noon and 5 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday will be able to ride the Giant Dipper and other attractions
as often as they want for $5, said Parker. Proceeds go to the Santa
Cruz County Red Cross and Salvation Army.
   ``Compared to what happened in downtown, we really fared very
well,'' she said. ``All the rides, except for three kiddie rides
that suffered minor damage, are perfectly fine.''
   Parker was in the company's mustard-yellow complex facing the
Pacific Ocean when the 7.1-magnitude quake struck Oct. 17, tossing
equipment to the floor and chasing terrified workers outside.
   After determining no one was hurt, she ran down the boardwalk to
check the Giant Dipper, a towering, twisting white-framed coaster,
circa 1924, that's listed on the National Register of Historic
Places.
   The second thing she checked was another landmark, the carousel,
built for $18,000 in 1911 by woodcarver Charles I.D. Looff.
   ``I've had a lot of calls from all over the country from people
who were wondering if the roller coaster was still here,'' said
Parker. ``Well, it is and I'm going to be one of the first to ride
it this weekend.''
   More than 35 million people have ridden the classic twister,
which features speeds up to 55 mph.
   Although not the fastest or most thrilling, the Giant Dipper is
a favorite of coaster fans nationwide, she said.
   More than 20 rides weathered the quake, and engineers and
mechanics have declared all but three safe, but the complex's
indoor miniature golf course was damaged. The quake shattered the
building's two-story glass panes and ripped the structure's sides,
sending plaster and wood flying.
   Arcade machines and merchandise and equipment inside shops and
restaurants were destroyed. The quake opened cracks in the concrete
covering the original wooden boardwalk built in 1907.
   And the outdoor concrete bandstand, where Miss California was
crowned in 1924, was destroyed when its concrete pillars pushed up
through the platform.
   ``It's a good thing the quake didn't happen the Sunday before,''
Ms. Parker said. ``We had about 10,000 people out here for the
Brussels Sprouts Festival and the Platters were playing up on that
stage.''
   Because the park is only open weekends during the winter, it was
closed when the quake hit.
   The boardwalk, which has some 2.5 million visitors annually, was
abandoned one recent weekday, except for workers making final
mechanical checks on the Giant Dipper's yellow cars and slapping
plaster into cracks.
   Shops displaying bikinis and T-shirts and eateries advertising
pizza and hotdogs were closed. The only thing moving indoors was a
taffy machine at Marini's Fine Candy, pulling and twisting white
goop for saltwater taffy.

   Buck Helm, the burly longshoreman who
survived 90 hours in the rubble of the quake-flattened Nimitz
Freeway, has been spending much of his time in the hospital
listening to Mozart, his former wife says.
   Helm, in serious but stable condition, is on a respirator and
remains unable to talk or write, Lorene Helm told a news conference
Thursday night.
   ``We talk with our eyes, with our hands, and the love we feel
for each other,'' said Ms. Helm, who was joined by their daughter
Desiree, 12, and sons Jeffery, 16, and Marc, 22.
   ``He knows we're there. He knows we're pulling for him.''
   The 5-foot-10, 220-pound Helm, affectionately dubbed ``Lucky
Buck'' by some local radio stations, was pulled from the wreckage
of Interstate 880 nearly four days after the 7.1-magnitude temblor
that shook northern California on Oct. 17.
   In recent days, Ms. Helm said, he ``has acknowledged'' hearing
the contents of cards and letters from around the world that his
family has been reading to him.
   Ms. Helm read a card sent by a retarded Oakland youth.
   ``I am so thankful God saved your life. That makes you special
like me,'' the youth wrote.
   Children also have sent money from their allowances. Other
unsolicited donations consisted of $5 bills in envelopes with no
return addresses. The family did not say how much money has been
sent in.
   The 57-year-old Helm, who worked at the Port of Oakland and
drove to the family home in Weaverville, Calif., on weekends, was
transferred Thursday from Highland General Hospital to Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center in Oakland.
   He was was moved because he is a member of a health maintenance
organization, not because his condition was unstable, Ms. Helm said.
   Helm was driving his silver Chevrolet Sprint when the quake hit
at 5:04 p.m., collapsing a 1\-mile section of the top deck of I-880
and killing 41 people.
   Ms. Helm said ``no one can say at this point'' what Helm's
prospects are for a full recovery. She wouldn't comment when asked
to characterize Helm's state of mind or whether he understands his
condition.
   The family also said it has hired San Francisco lawyer Bill
Choulos. He said he is looking into insurance matters, possible
state compensation for Helm's injuries and proposed movie deals.
   Choulos said more than 50 movie producers have offered
``substantial'' amounts of money for the story rights to Helm's
rescue. He said the family has not seriously considered any offer.
   The lawyer also said the family will set up a charitable
foundation to ``show their expressions of thankfulness for his life
and help some of the victims'' of the I-880 collapse and future
quakes.

<HEAD>Late Entrant in Presidential Race Holds Lead in Poll</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular television entertainer
who jumped into the presidential race just two days ago has quickly
emerged as front-runner with nearly 30 percent of the vote,
according to a new poll.
   Silvio Santos, a conservative, declared himself a candidate for
the Nov. 15 election on the ticket of the small Brazilian
Municipalist Party. He is a former street vendor who has strong
support among the poor, even though he is now a millionaire
businessman.
   A poll by the Gallup Institute, which was published Thursday by
the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo, gave Santos 29 percent of the
vote, a wide lead.
   The newspaper said support for center-right candidate Fernando
Collor de Mello, who had led the polls for six months, had plunged
from 29.3 percent to 18.6 percent among those questioned.
   The nationwide poll was conducted between Oct. 26 and Wednesday,
with people interviewed at random in the street and their homes.
The margin of error was 3 percent.
   Some 82 million Brazilians are to choose a successor to
President Jose Sarney for a five-year term, the first popular vote
for president since 1960. If no candidate wins a majority Nov. 15,
the two top vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in
December.
   Santos' entrance into the race was criticized by left- and
right-wing candidates, who agreed Sarney was behind the maneuver.
Sarney by law cannot run for re-election.
   Santos' candidacy still faces legal challenges before it can be
registered with the Supreme Electoral Court.
   Accusations have been made that Santos, a TV entertainer who
owns more than 30 businesses, paid off former Municipalist Party
candidate Armando Correa to resign.
   The court must also decide if Santos violated a law that
requires corporate directors to step down from their positions
three months before declaring their candidacy.
   Santos, who runs the SBT television network, the nation's second
largest, says he is a shareholder and not a director in the
company, and thus exempt from the law.
   Collor de Mello, whose base of support is with the rural poor,
was hardest hit by Santos' candidacy, but other major candidates
saw their support fall as well, according to the poll.
   Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the socialist Workers' Party,
came in third with the support of 10.6 percent of those questioned,
down from 12.4 percent in the last poll.
   Left-wing populist Leonel Brizola, a former governor, was
fourth, receiving 9.9 percent, a drop of 2.8 percent.
   Mario Covas, of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was fifth
with 8 percent support, down slightly from 8.2 percent in last
week's poll.
   Eight percent of those questioned were unsure who they would
vote for, and 5.6 percent said they would cast blank ballots.
   Gallup conducted a simultaneous poll that excluded Santos from
the presidential contenders.
   Without Santos in the race, 27.5 percent of those questioned
favored Collor de Mello, followed by da Silva at 13.8 percent,
Brizola with 12.7 percent and Covas at 10.6 percent.

<HEAD>FBI: Indictment Shows High-Level Mafia, Colombia Drug Link</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The indictment of 12 people in the United States
and Colombia offers the first clear indication of cooperation
between the Sicilian Mafia and Colombia's Medellin cartel, federal
officials said.
   John Galatalo, 44, the alleged middleman between the two
smuggling groups, was among the dozen indicted in Miami, New York,
Detroit and Colombia, according to federal officials.
   ``This is the first real hard evidence of this nexus and close
relationship between Colombian cocaine trafficking and Sicilian
Mafia members,'' Timothy McNally, assistant special agent in charge
of the FBI in Miami, said Thursday.
   The 12 are accused of shipping 30-kilogram loads of cocaine by
automobile and train from Miami to Philadelphia and New York
between 1985 and 1987. In late 1987, Galatalo allegedly arranged
for a 600-kilogram shipment to be routed through Aruba to the
Mediterranean for distributon by the Sicilian Mafia in Italy.
   Miami FBI spokesman Paul Miller said the ring purchased its
cocaine from defendant Angel Leon Sanchez, 39, a member of the
Barranquilla cartel, which is directly connected to Colombia's
Medellin cartel.
   ``They opened a corridor from Medellin to southern Europe,''
Miller said.
   Sanchez is believed to be in Colombia, and the FBI will request
his extradition.
   Three of the defendants, one in Miami and two in New York, are
in custody and several others are expected to turn themselves in
today and tomorrow.
   Galatalo of Miami was out on bond on a June indictment now
superseded by the charges a federal grand jury handed up Wednesday.
He was expected at a hearing in the new case today.
   Galatalo could face 10 years to life in prison if convicted of
running a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Another defendant, Angelo Fontana, 36, of Miami also was free on
bond in the earlier case. Authorities said they expected his
surrender.
   The FBI praised Italian police for their cooperation in the
two-year investigation, and added that while the 34-count
indictment was unlikely to significantly reduce the cocaine supply,
it had hit high-level traffickers.
   ``We're interested in major defendants, major organizational
players who put together this conspiracy and the shipments,''
McNally said. ``In this indictment we think we have it.''
   The indictment says the Italian-born Galatalo arranged for
Colombian cocaine to be imported to Miami, then traveled to New
York, Aruba and Milan to make arrangements for shipments to the
Northeast and Europe.
   Others named in the indictment are Waldino Jesus Aponte Ramero,
41; Luis Mejia, 31; Mariella Liggo, 49, and Luis Miguel, 41, all of
Miami; Carrell Williams, 43 of Detroit; Anthony Corinella and his
wife Giovanna Corinella, 40, of Sands Point, N.Y.; Victor Castro,
31, who is in federal prison on another conviction, and Jorge
Linares, 31, of Lauderdale Lakes.

   Police Chief Richard Sproules resigned
and entered a drug program after being charged with stealing
cocaine and admitting that he had been using the drug daily for
five years.
   Mayor Carl Pitaro said he accepted the resignation of Sproules,
45, after receiving a letter from the former police chief Wednesday.
   Pitaro said he would consult with the city's legal department to
determine whether to pursue disciplinary action.
   Sproules' attorney, Bruce Edmands, said the 25-year police
veteran and former narcotics officer checked into a four-week
inpatient drug treatment program.
   Sproules was freed on his own recognizance after pleading
innocent Oct. 24 to drug charges. He was suspended from the force
with pay pending outcome of the case.
   Court documents indicate money handled by Sproules in drug cases
was missing, but Edmands denied that Sproules had mishandled any of
the money.
   Sproules was police chief two years in this city of 95,000, 23
miles south of Boston.

<HEAD>Scientist Reveals First Depiction of ``Oldest'' Dinosaur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oldest dinosaur may have been shorter than
former basketball star Wilt Chamberlain and lighter than football
star William ``Refrigerator'' Perry.
   It was puny for a dinosaur. It scampered along on the toes of
its rear feet but had ``large claws on its forelimbs, used to grasp
prey,'' said University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno.
   More importantly, Sereno and other scientists said Thursday they
believe the first drawing of the ancient Herrerasaurus may reveal
important clues into the evolution of dinosaurs.
   ``Before, only a few bones of Herrerasaurus were known,'' said
Sereno. ``Now, we have everything.
   ``Basically we have the first relatively complete idea of what
the primitive form of the dinosaur looks like. This will help us in
trying to figure out the pathways of evolution that proceeded over
the course of many millions of years after that.''
   Scientists welcomed Sereno's work, presented Thursday in Austin,
Texas, at meetings of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists.
   ``I think it's extremely important to know what the thing looks
like in detail,'' said Nicholas Hotton, curator of fossils,
amphibians and reptiles at the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History. ``If you've got that kind of information, you can
tell which way evolution is going.''
   Sereno said the artist's reconstruction of the dinosaur _ named
after an Argentine goat herder _ was based largely on the recent
discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in South
America.
   Working with South American colleagues Alfredo Monetta and Jose
Bonaparte, Sereno discovered the fossils in the foothills of the
Andes.
   ``There is definitely a certain amount of good fortune in these
things,'' said Sereno, who last month won a $500,000 Packard
Foundation Award that will allow him to continue work on the
Herrerasaurus and other research projects, including a study of
ancient birds.
   The Herrerasaurus, which scampered the Earth some 230 million
years ago, was Earth's first true dinosaur. ``Basically, you go
back further and you get dinosaur-type things but not a dinosaur,''
he said.
   Herrerasaurus weighed a mere 300 pounds and stood between 6 feet
and 8 feet tall, Sereno said. The Chicago Bears' Perry weighs in at
325 pounds, while Chamberlain stands 7 feet, 1 inch high.
   Like all other dinosaurs, Herrerasaurus roamed the earth for
only a few million years before becoming extinct. Scientists aren't
sure what doomed the tiny first dinosaur, Sereno said.
   With the new representation of the animal, ``We finally have
some idea of the path of history,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander, a lawyer and
civil rights advocate who achieved many firsts as a black woman,
has died of pneumonia at age 91.
   Mrs. Alexander, the first black woman to practice law in
Pennsylvania, died Wednesday at Cathedral Village in Philadelphia,
where she had lived since 1983.
   ``She exemplified what one can achieve through hard work,
dedication and commitment to excellence,'' said Constance E.
Clayton, superintendent of schools in Philadelphia. ``With her
passing, Philadelphia and indeed the nation, is experiencing the
loss of a brillant, gifted woman, one that I will miss but never
forget.''
   Mrs. Alexander was the first black woman to earn a doctorate at
the University of Pennsylvania _ and the first nationwide to earn a
doctorate in economics. She was the first black woman to graduate
from Penn's Law School, and then the first admitted to legal
practice in Pennsylvania.
   Working for many years in practice with her husband, Raymond
Pace Alexander, she was an ardent advocate for her clients, many of
whom were women and children in domestic-relations cases.
   Throughout the 1930s, Mrs. Alexander and her husband initiated
legal fights that began to open up restaurants, hotels and movie
theaters to blacks in Philadelphia.
   ``She was a brillant woman, a pioneer, a person whom not only
the black community will miss but the law community and Americans
as a whole, because she led so many fights and it's going to be
difficult to replace her,'' said Common Pleas Court Judge Eugene H.
Clarke Jr..
   She was national secretary of the Urban League for 25 years. For
17 years, until 1967, she served on the Philadelphia Commission on
Human Relations. She held national and local offices with Americans
for Democratic Action and the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Along with her husband, she was one of the founders of the
National Bar Association, an organization of black lawyers.
   Born Jan. 2, 1898, in Philadelphia, her father was Aaron
Mossell, who was the first black graduate of Penn Law School. Her
uncle was the painter Henry O. Tanner. In 1986, the Philadelphia
Bar Association named its public service center in honor of the
Alexanders.
   Her husband died in November 1974.

   Hundreds of Armenians protesting Soviet
policies in their homeland blocked the entrance to an auditorium
and delayed a performance by the Red Army Choir on its first tour
of the United States.
   Police said 500 to 1,000 protesters blocked the entrance to the
Shrine Auditorium and streets surrounding the hall shortly after 6
p.m. Thursday. Some chained themselves to the doors.
   Shouting matches between protesters and ticketholders flared at
times, but here were no reports of violence or injuries, police
Officer Jim Farris said, and no arrests were reported.
   The show, set to start at 8 p.m., went on before a reduced
audience late Thursday night, KNBC-TV reported.
   Shrine Auditorium officials could not be reached by telephone
after the show, so the exact number of the reduced crowd who
attended the delayed show was not immediately available.
   ``We're trying to bring to public attention that the Red Army,
instead of protecting its citizens, is firing on people,'' said
Berdj Karapetian, a spokesman for the Armenia National Committee.
   ``They are killing our people there,'' Armenian immigrant Edward
Bagdassarian said through an interpreter. ``A few hours of being
kept from enjoying the show is nothing compared to millions of
people not having food.''
   The Los Angeles area is home to hundreds of thousands of
Armenians. Many are angered by Moscow's intervention in a vicious
territorial dispute between the neighboring Soviet republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan, and by Soviet response to the earthquake
that killed 25,000 in Armenia last year.
   Soviet troops have been stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh, focus of
the territorial dispute, for the past year. In some cases, soldiers
have killed and injured civilians. Also, Azerbaijanis have
blockaded railroads, leaving Armenia critically short of basic
supplies and halting earthquake reconstruction work.
   The Red Army Choir, part of the 200-member Alexandrov Red Army
Song &amp; Dance Ensemble, is composed of Soviet army members. It has
been touring U.S. cities for the first time under the policy of
glasnost, or openness, promoted by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The choir's 31-city tour began in New York on Sept. 12; it is
booked into the Shrine through Sunday, but Garenyet Yegparian,
another protester, said no further protests were planned.
   ``We got a partial victory tonight,'' Yegparian said. ``Moscow
is very image conscious. We are not out to end people's fun, but we
don't like cultural affairs to be used as political impetus.''

   A state representative's son holed up with
a 12-guage shotgun in his father's home for nearly four hours
before police set off a stun grenade and subdued him.
   Chris Corkery, 21, ``was going through severe emotional problems
(and) was threatening to take his own life with a shotgun,'' said
Police Chief Wesley Blanchard.
   Corkery's mother, Maureen, and younger brother, Michael, also
were in the split-level home when police first arrived there about
5 p.m. Thursday, said Blanchard. He did not know what precipitated
the incident.
   Corkery, son of Rep. Neil A. Corkery, randomly fired about five
shots, two before police arrived, but nobody was injured, Blanchard
said.
   Corkery had been treated for alcohol abuse in the past, said
Blanchard. He said Corkery was drinking when police arrived but did
not drink afterward.
   The mother and younger brother tried to calm Corkery, Blanchard
said. Eventually, they left the house and four police negotiators
took turns talking with Corkery.
   ``There were times when we thought we lost his attention,'' said
Blanchard. ``There were times when the shotgun was being held at
the head or neck.''
   Eventually Corkery fell asleep, and about 30 minutes later
police set off the stun grenade, similar to a large firecracker,
and rushed him, Blanchard said. He said two officers seized Corkery
and another went for the shotgun lying across his body.
   Corkery was taken to the police station and was to be examined
by mental health officials.

<HEAD>Freighter Refloated After Three Days on Shoal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Yugoslavian freighter that carved a 500-foot
swath through a delicate coral shoal Monday off the Florida Keys
has been refloated without any leaking or pollution, the Coast
Guard said.
   Tugboats pulled the 475-foot Mavro Vetranic free on a rising
tide at 9:04 p.m. Thursday, Coast Guard spokesman Steve Sapp said.
He did not know how many tugboats were involved.
   The freighter ran aground on the sandy, coral-studded shoal
while carrying a cargo of granular fertilizer phosphate from Tampa
to Hamburg, West Germany.
   State officials estimate the grounding caused tens of millions
of dollars damage to the reef, in the Dry Tortugas islands about 60
miles west of Key West.
   The tugboats pulled the ship free after emergency crews spent
two days pumping 390 tons of fuel oil off the vessel onto a barge
alongside, Sapp said. The 14,300-ton phosphate cargo was left
aboard.
   Salvors raced to complete the maneuver ahead of an expected turn
in the weather today. Authorities said the expected winds and high
seas could have ruptured the ship, threatening severe damage to the
coral reef.
   Once the ship was free, Sapp said, it was moved to safe
anchorage in deeper water where the hull was surveyed for possible
damage.
   ``There was no leaking or pollution of any kind,'' he said.
   Also on Thursday, Coast Guard Capt. Henry D. Jacoby flew to Key
West to convene a fact-finding Board of Inquiry to determine the
cause of the grounding.
   Representatives of the U.S. attorney's office earlier boarded
the Mavro Vetranic as part of a federal investigation, while the
state planned to file its own lawsuit for reef damage in a state
court today.
   ``There is no conflict between us both filing,'' said Joe
Bizarro, spokesman for the state attorney general's office. ``There
seems to be overlapping jurisdiction.''

   The dollar was steady today in quiet European
trading against most major foreign currencies.
   Gold prices were higher following after Thursday's surprise
rally that ended in New York with the precious metal $6 higher.
   With Tokyo markets closed for a national holiday, dealers said
European foreign exchange trading had come to a near standstill
ahead of this afternoon's release of U.S. unemployment figures for
September.
   ``Nothing has happened since yesterday, and I can't imagine that
much will move until the figures,'' said one dealer at a European
bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, markets were closed for Culture Day. In London, the
yen was quoted at $143.40, down 0.35 yen from Thursday's Tokyo
close.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8420 West German marks, down from 1.8485
   _1.6170 Swiss francs, up from 1.6140
   _6.2495 French francs, down from 6.2670
   _2.0792 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0860
   _1,352.75 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00
   _1.1730 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1725
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5705 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5660 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $379.15 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $375.25. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379 compared with $375 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.67 to close at a bid $378.71.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.24 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.17.

   It took three ambulances to transport a
worker badly injured in an explosion at an aluminum plant to a
hospital, police said.
   The first ambulance carrying Edward Mann, 46, from the Alumax
Mill Products Inc. plant overheated. Mann was transferred to a
second ambulance, which ran out of gas at an intersection and was
broadsided by another vehicle.
   Mann, who suffered critical burns in the explosion Thursday, was
not injured in the crash, police investigator Tom Bednarik said. He
was transferred to a third ambulance, which took him safely to
Morris Community Hospital.
   The explosion of molten metal at the aluminum rolling plant 60
miles southwest of Chicago slightly injured five other people,
hospital officials said.

   A Navy admiral says he stands by his
conclusion that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig was the most likely
person to have sabotaged the battleship Iowa, even as his report
comes under attack on Capitol Hill.
   ``It's not a popular conclusion to come to. Certainly the
Hartwig family is doing all it can to defend the family name and
their son,'' Rear Adm. Richard Milligan said in an interview
Thursday.
   Hartwig's family has said they do not believe the sailor could
have taken his own life _ and those of 46 colleagues _ in the fiery
April 19 blast aboard the World War II-era battleship.
   Hartwig told his parents in a letter written Jan. 25 that a
water pipe on the USS Iowa blew open from the force of a blast of a
16-inch gun on turret 2 the previous day, The Washington Times
reported in today's editions. That is the same turret that exploded
April 19.
   The Times said it obtained the letter from Hartwig's sister,
Kathy Kubicina of Cleveland. She was quoted as saying it was not
included in the correspondence she turned over to Naval
Investigative Service agents.
   Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman, was quoted in the Times as
saying, ``There have been no inappropriate firing events on board
the Iowa.'' He said the rupture of pipes was not significant to the
April explosion.
   The Daily Press of Newport News, Va., reported Thursday that one
sailor killed in the blast, Jack E. Thompson Jr., had told family
members there had been an accident involving a firing of one of the
turret's guns in February.
   At the Pentagon, Navy spokesman Rear Adm. Brent Baker said:
``There was no accident back in February. It's not true.''
   Several members of Congress from Ohio, Hartwig's home state,
have been outspokenly critical of the Navy's report.
   And Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of a House Armed
Services subcommittee that is reviewing the matter, has said he
``seriously questioned'' the admiral's conclusion that the blast
probably was a willful act of sabotage.
   The Senate and House Armed Services Committees plan to hold
hearings, while Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting
Office, has already begun an inquiry.
   ``I welcome those (investigations), I have no fear of them,''
the admiral said.
   The 30-year Navy veteran, who is now acting as the service's
chief budget official, said he thinks ``the ultimate conclusion is
going to be that they are going to support my investigation.''
   Milligan issued the Navy's technical and criminal study on Sept.
7.
   At that time, Navy officials acknowledged that their evidence
was circumstantial given the fact that all the witnesses, including
Hartwig, died in the explosion.
   Even though the report said it could not pinpoint the exact
cause of the blast, it said the explosion was ``most probably'' an
intentional act and that Hartwig was ``the most likely person with
the access, knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish'' it by
inserting some type of detonator between the bags of gunpowder in
one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   The admiral said the Navy, at the suggestion of the FBI, has
conducted additional tests on the material found inside the
battleship's 16-inch gun.
   Milligan said that while he could not give the outcome because
the report is being studied by his superiors, he is familiar with
the findings.
   ``I am not aware of anything that would cause me to change my
report after 3{ months,'' he said. ``We will come up with ...
nothing that will change the findings of fact, opinions or
recommendations that I had before.''
   Mavroules cited an FBI report that said its laboratory
investigation on the matter was inconclusive and its technicians
could not find evidence of the unspecified ``foreign material'' in
the gun barrel that the Navy said it found.
   ``I have evidence. My report says I have evidence,'' Milligan
said of such criticism.
   He argued that his investigation must be looked at in its
entirety, including more than 20,000 technical tests done on
gunpowder, multiple recreations of the explosion, and the hundreds
of interviews with the ship's crew and their acquaintances.
   Milligan said that while he found problems on the ship regarding
the training of the crew, the use of unauthorized gunpowder and
powder loads and other technical issues, ``those deficiencies did
not cause the accident.''
   In the report, the Navy said it found Hartwig to be a ``loner''
who had few friends and who was upset about the breakup of a
friendship with another sailor.
   Milligan said that when Hartwig's sister wrote the Navy
complaining that her brother had taken out an insurance policy
naming another sailor as the sole beneficiary, a criminal probe by
the Naval Investigative Service had to be opened.
   ``I'm convinced the NIS did a very professional investigation,''
he said.
   The admiral, asked about the fact that some have questioned why
the Navy came up with different conclusions than the FBI did in its
laboratory studies, said the Navy ``tested much more extensively
than the FBI, time-wise, equipment-wise.''

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode remained hospitalized
today after complaining of a rapid heartbeat for the third time in
the last two weeks.
   ``We believe it is an innocent type of heart irregularity which
can be seen in individuals with normal hearts,'' his physician,
Edward S. Cooper, said late Thursday. ``The mayor is fine. He's
doing just fine.''
   The 51-year-old Goode, who has been mayor since 1983, entered
University of Pennsylvania Hospital about 2 a.m. Thursday after
suffering an irregular heartbeat that lasted about a minute or two
about midnight Wednesday, Cooper said.
   A third incident of rapid heartbeat occurred for 30 seconds
about 5 a.m. Thursday, while Goode was hospitalized.
   Goode was out of bed Thursday reading newspapers, watching
television, and talking with to city officials on the telephone.
   Cooper said the mayor was expected to stay in the hospital until
Saturday.
   ``We are using this time in the hospital for further heart
monitoring in the event that the episode recurs, and also we will
be obtaining other miscellaneous studies in order to detect the
underlying triggering process,'' Cooper said.
   Goode was taken to the hospital Oct. 20 after complaining of
head and neck pain. His heart rate and blood pressure were high
when he arrived at the emergency room, and he underwent tests.
   Doctors performed a cardiac catheterization, which they termed
the definitive test of Goode's heart and cardiac arteries. Dr.
Arthur Whereat said tests showed the mayor had a ``perfectly normal
heart.''
   Goode was discharged from the hospital the next day. Whereat
attributed his symptoms to sinus problems.
   Doctors also said that simple stress from overwork might be to
blame.
   ``I can't say whether his 16-hour days are beginning to take a
toll,'' Cooper said. ``That certainly is a possibility ... As we
all get older, maybe we can't take it. Maybe we have to be
satisfied with a 10- to 12-hour day.''

   Radical students calling for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government battled riot police
today with firebombs and rocks in clashes in at least eight cities.
   Hundreds of students armed with clubs and firebombs briefly
disrupted rush hour traffic in central Seoul in the early evening,
storming out of sidestreets to attack riot police units. Protesters
set fire to a police bus, but troopers hurling tear gas grenades
quickly dispersed the students.
   Police said they had no figures on arrests or injuries.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Drive out the Yankees!,'' the
protesters chanted.
   The radicals are calling for the overthrow of Roh, reunification
with North Korea and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based
in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Riot police arrested and beat several dozen students in the
clashes in Seoul. Some pedestrians, choking and crying from tear
gas, yelled insults at troops, and scuffles ensued.
   Authorities, fearing major protests in Seoul, fielded 21,000
riot police, officials said. Troopers in green combat fatigues and
black-visored helmets guarded government buildings, the U.S.
Embassy and other possible targets.
   Police also reported violent protests in the provincial cities
of Chongju, Kwangju, Chonju, Mokpo, Sunchon, Naju and Yosu. Most
clashes broke out when riot police stopped columns of students as
they tried to march off their campuses into the streets.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated about 5,000
students took part in the clashes in the provincial cities. There
was no estimate on how many students were involved in the protests
in Seoul, but several thousand took part in peaceful campus
protests before the clashes.
   Radical students had called for major demonstrations in Seoul
and other cities to mark the 60th anniversary of a student uprising
against Japanese rule and to try to revive their flagging movement.
   Student leaders said the protests marked the start of a new
campaign to try to unseat the Roh government. But the radicals are
not regarded as a major threat to the government.

   Coal strikes spread in the Arctic mining region,
with 18,000 workers staying off their jobs to demand better living
and working conditions, labor leaders said today.
   But strike leaders in the nation's No. 1 coal-producing region,
the Donetsk Basin in the Ukraine, decided to keep working until
their demands are considered by Soviet lawmakers, a strike
committee member said on condition of anonymity.
   In the Arctic's Vorkuta region, about 18,000 workers at 12 of 13
mines were on strike, strike committee member Sergei Nosovoy said.
   About 100 miles away in Inta, about 10,000 miners were voting
whether to join the walkout, strike organizer Yaroslav Chaban said
in a telephone interview.
   Soviet officials warn that a drop in coal production could force
the rationing of heating and light as the long, severe Russian
winter begins.
   Miners in Vorkuta and Donetsk are demanding that the government
deliver the benefits that were promised during a wave of strikes
last summer. The promised benefits included improved living and
working conditions, more economic autonomy for the mining regions
and official recognition of strike committees.
   ``Strikers say that while members of the government report the
fulfillment of some of the points of the resolution, things remain
unchanged in the mining areas,'' the official news agency Tass said
Thursday.
   At the Komsomolskaya mine in Vorkuta, miners were still working
but were preventing coal from being shipped outside Vorkuta, the
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said Thursday.
   ``We do not expect any special privileges, nor are we depriving
other regions of food, goods or money,'' the miners said in a
statement quoted by the newspaper. ``All we are asking is that the
government, the Coal Ministry and the union leadership should keep
their word.''
   In a separate article, the newspaper painted a stark,
sympathetic picture of a miner's lot in the Soviet Arctic, noting
``many do not see daylight for months.''
   ``The miner's lunchbox contains some bread, a wedge of cheese
and some sausage named `dog's delight.' The mines are cold, dark,
very humid and filled with coal dust,'' the paper said. ``Unlike
most of the countries that set a 15- or 10-year limit for working
underground, retirement age for miners has been fixed at 50.''
   A regional court in Vorkuta has ruled that the miners' walkout
is unlawful, but authorities have not tried to make people return
to their jobs by force. The miners say they will appeal the court's
decision in the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   The legislature passed a law last month legalizing strikes in
some industries but banning them in such crucial sectors as energy,
defense and transport.

   Authorities investigating the crushed
pro-democracy movement have begun questioning Beijing University
students on campus about their activities at the time of the
protests, university sources said today.
   In Hong Kong, an independent newspaper reported that Chinese
authorities have complied a new wanted list of dissidents. It
reportedly includes Chai Ling, a key figure in the protests, as
well as other students and intellectuals.
   At Beijing University, students were told at several officially
sponsored rallies this week that they should cooperate with
investigators who would come to question them, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An official of the university's Foreign Affairs Office today
denied that any such rallies had taken place or that investigators
had come onto campus.
   Beijing University students were at the forefront of the mass
protests that were crushed when the Chinese army shot through
crowds of unarmed demonstrators in the capital, leaving hundreds
and possibly thousands dead.
   Thousands more were arrested, including Beijing University
freshman Wang Dan, one of the driving forces behind the students'
occupation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Beijing University is considered China's most prestigious and
politically active school.
   The crackdown on the protest movement has increased tension on
campus this year. Some upperclassmen did not return after summer
break, apparently either because they were arrested or feared they
would be.
   There also are no freshmen on campus this year. The entering
class was slashed from 2,100 to 800, then shipped off for a year of
army training and political indoctrination at a military academy
southwest of Beijing.
   Classes at the university, originally scheduled to begin Aug.
29, were delayed until Oct. 14 to avoid unrest on Oct. 1, or
National Day, which marks the 40th anniversary of Communist China,
students said.
   Hao Bin, the Communist Party vice secretary at the university,
summoned students in groups to hourlong rallies this week at the
campus' 2,000-seat auditorium, the university sources said.
   He told them to cooperate with investigators and urged them to
confess if they had done any significant ``bad things,'' said one
university source.
   Hao, a hard-liner believed to have served as a political officer
with the People's Liberation Army, was quoted as telling students
there were several types of people who must turn themselves in.
   They included leaders of student organizations involved in the
protests and those who attacked soldiers, spread rumors to
foreigners or divulged secrets, the source said.
   One student was questioned about a contribution of more than
$2,500 to the student movement from workers at a government
ministry, another source at the university said.
   In Hong Kong, the independent Chinese-language Ming Pao
newspaper printed a copy of what it described as an official list
of seven wanted dissidents put out last month by the Ministry of
Public Security.
   Such a document suggests that the dissidents were still at large.
   Among the three most prominent student leaders of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations, Chai is the only one whose fate has remained
since the crackdown began.
   One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to the West. The third was Wang,
the freshman who was captured by Chinese authorities in Beijing.
   Chai, a 23-year-old native of Shandong province who was a
graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Beijing Normal
University, assumed the title of commander of the Headquarters to
Defend Tiananmen Square before the crackdown.
   Soon after the military assault, she went into hiding and
recorded an emotional account of the military onslaught. It was
smuggled out of China and broadcast in Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Pioneer Anchorwoman, TV Commentator Dies At 96</HEAD>

   Dorothy Fuldheim, a news commentator and
interviewer who led the way for women in broadcast journalism and
remained on television past age 90, died today at the age of 96.
   She died at Mount Sinai Medical Center of complications from a
stroke, said hospital spokeswoman Mary Beth Schotzinger.
   Ms. Fuldheim began her television career when she was 54 years
old in 1947 as the news anchorwoman for WEWS-TV. She had nearly 37
unbroken years with the station, more years on the air than anyone
in TV history, WEWS said.
   Prior to her television career, Ms. Fuldheim was the first woman
news commentator on the ABC radio network.
   WEWS eventually replaced Ms. Fuldeim as news anchor, but gave
her a commentary segment on the nightly news until her retirement
five years ago. Earlier in her career, she had her own interview
show, which took her to Ireland, Japan, France and other countries.
   For radio or television, she interviewed Albert Einstein, Adolf
Hitler and all U.S. presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald
Reagan, the station said.
   She once said Einstein was her most memorable interview.
   ``I was so awed,'' she said. ``It confirmed for me my belief
that man has just begun to develop a brain.''
   As an interviewer, she said she tried to get to the essence of
the person.
   ``My purpose is not to elicit some smart-aleck answer, but to
evoke a man's personality,'' she said. ``People don't respect
antagonism, they respect reasonableness.''
   Her outspoken views sometimes created controversy. After four
Kent State University students were killed by National Guard troops
during an anti-war protest in 1970, she gave a tearful on-air
commentary calling the killings murder.
   ``Would you believe we got hundreds of letters piled this high
from people disagreeing with me?'' she recalled later. ``They were
saying more should have been killed.'' She said she offered to
resign but the station kept her.
   But she didn't always take the liberal side. She once ordered
onetime radical Jerry Rubin to leave the set of an interview after
he called policemen ``pigs.''
   Ms. Fulheim was forced into retirement by a stroke in July 1984.
A judge then appointed family friend Samuel Miller guardian, and he
put her in a nursing home, despite her persistent requests to
return to her Shaker Heights condominium.
   Born in Passaic, N.J., she grew up in Milwaukee. She outlived
two husbands and a daughter, Dorothy Fuldheim Urman, said Miller's
wife, Maria.

<HEAD>Sanctions Cost 500,000 Jobs And Billions Of Dollars, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign sanctions imposed on
South Africa have cost the country 500,000 jobs and billions of
dollars since 1985, a leading economist says.
   The study released Thursday by Chris van Wyk, chief executive of
the Bankorp banking group, also said foreign investment and trade
bans have hurt blacks the most.
   ``The harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them,'' he
said, adding that 80 percent of new job-seekers are black.
   ``A continuation of existing trade and financial sanctions
throughout the 1990s would render a million more black people
jobless and 2 million more financially destitute,'' said van Wyk,
whose study was described by financial writers as the most
definitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctions.
   The study said sanctions and the pullout of foreign investment
since 1985 cost $16 billion in foreign exchange, resulting in
production losses of about $32 billion and total spending loss of
about $45 billion, based on the average value of the country's
currency, the rand, during that period.
   Sanctions have impaired South Africa's ability to reach its full
export potential and had ``radicalized many young blacks to the
left and many white voters to the right,'' Van Wyk said. ``The
moderate center has been weakened, making a political settlement
much more difficult.''
   Despite the sanctions, South Africa's economy still is
considered the strongest and most diversified on the continent.
   Van Wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to what
South Africa would have experienced had the price of gold, its
major export, averaged $200 an ounce instead of $400 over the past
five years.
   Interest rates and inflation have been higher, the rand weaker,
wages lower, and growth, employment and spending levels much lower
than they would have been without sanctions, he said.
   There were some ``positive spinoffs'' from sanctions, he said.
``Economic considerations began to assume their rightful place in
government decision-making, along with ... commitment to concepts
such as tax reform and privatization.''
   Since 1985, several hundred foreign companies have pulled out of
South Africa, generally citing either financial concerns or
pressure from anti-apartheid groups.
   In the same period, most Western countries have imposed some
type of trade sanctions on South Africa, affecting exports of major
products such as coal and steel even though some new markets have
been found in the Far East.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Hollywood friends of Bette Davis gathered
at a movie studio to reminisce about the actress and pay tribute to
what Angela Lansbury called her ``astonishing legacy'' of films.
   More than 500 people attended the memorial service on a Warner
Bros. sound stage. Miss Davis was associated with Warner Bros. for
18 years, though she often feuded with founder Jack Warner.
   Miss Davis would fight for the roles she wanted in a time when
actresses usually behaved _ since studio chiefs considered them
replaceable if they didn't, actor James Woods said.
   ``Bette Davis put herself on the line when she just didn't have
to,'' in standing up for women's rights, Woods said.
   Miss Davis died of cancer Oct. 6 in Paris at age 81.
   ``Thank God she worked as hard as she did in her prime,'' said
Lansbury, star of the television series ``Murder She Wrote.''
   ``She has bequeathed to us all an astonishing legacy ... bravura
acting of the first order.''
   Woods, who worked with Miss Davis in the film ``The
Disappearance of Amy,'' said his viewing of her 1940s melodrama
``Now, Voyager'' inspired him in his own career.
   ``Miss Davis wrote poetry on the screen like Yeats might
write,'' he said.
   President Bush, in a telegram read by David Hartman, said, ``How
fortunate our nation is to have her contribution to the art of
filmmaking.''
   Other celebrities attending were Roddy McDowell, George
Hamilton, Lionel Stander and Robert Wagner.
   A 38-minute highlight reel of Miss Davis' work was shown.
   Her scores of movie credits included ``Jezebel'' and
``Dangerous,'' for which she won Oscars, ``Dark Victory,'' ``The
Petrified Forest,'' ``The Little Foxes,'' ``All About Eve,'' ``What
Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' and ``The Whales of August.''

<HEAD>One Cargo Ship Sinks, Another Missing In Stormy Gulf Of Thailand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese cargo ship sank and a Thai
freighter disappeared in a tropical storm in the Gulf of Thailand,
leaving 36 crew members missing, officials said today.
   Tropical storm Gay hampered a Thai navy search today for the
crews of the ships that disappeared Thursday, a navy officer said.
   The Vietnamese vessel, the 500-ton Long Dien 01, sank about 120
miles from the Malaysian port of Kota Baharu.
   According to a message received by Malaysia's Maritime Rescue
and Co-ordinating Center, the 21 crewmen, all Vietnamese, fled in
life rafts and their whereabouts were unknown, said center chief
Capt. Jaffar Lamri.
   A Royal Malaysian Navy patrol craft and two helicopters from the
Royal Malaysian Air Force mounted a search, said Lamri, quoted by
the national news agency Bernama.
   ``We have also sent out messages to ships and fishing vessels
sailing in the vicinity to be on the look out for the crewmen,'' he
added.
   Jaffar said the ship, carrying general cargo, was sailing from
Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore when it sank.
   The Thai naval officer said a distress signal was received
Thursday morning from the Thai ship, the New Star, when it was
about 85 miles off the southern Thai province of Narathiwat.
   He said the vessel, carrying a cargo of wood, left Malaysia for
Thailand with 15 crewmen including Thais, Indonesians and Burmese.
   A patrol boat that set out to search had to return to port
because of rough seas, said Capt. Boonthrik Chayent, deputy
commander of the Navy station in the southern province of Songhkla.
   The Meteorological Department said the tropical storm caused
widespread and heavy rains in several southern Thai provinces on
Thursday. On Friday, with winds of 63 mph at its center, the storm
was about 150 miles off the coast of Prachuap Khiri Khan province,
where there were heavy rains.

<HEAD>Botha Acknowledges Reports of Rebel Incursion in Namibia May Have
Been Fake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha
acknowledged today that his allegations of an incursion by black
nationalist guerrillas into Namibia may have been based on fake
radio broadcasts.
   However, Botha said he was not embarrassed to have made the
charges, even if the messages were the work of ``a crackpot.''
   Botha claimed he was simply trying to avert conflict prior to
the Nov. 7-11 elections that are to lead Namibia, a South African
colony, into independence.
   ``If these transmission are a hoax, I would be the first to be
overjoyed,'' Botha said in a statement today. ``At least it has had
the result that everybody has been sensitized to the need to
curtail violence or intimidation.''
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, fought a
23-year war in the territory against the guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization. South Africa signed a
regional peace accord last year under which it has agreed to grant
the territory independence with U.N. supervision.
   Botha announced Wednesday that South Africa had placed its
troops on alert and was prepared to delay the elections due to an
alleged incursion by Namibian guerrillas. He said members of the
U.N. monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic the
infiltration of 600 guerrillas from Oct. 26-31.
   However, Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping
troops in Namibia, said Thursday the messages ``are phony in
content and format.''
   South African military technicians investigating the matter
found the radio traffic was sent on frequencies allocated to the
U.N. monitoring group, Botha said.
   However, Botha's statement provided no evidence that it was U.N.
personnel who sent the messages.
   ``Whether it was a crackpot or (U.N. officials) is to me not the
important issue,'' he said. ``My purpose is to avoid bloodshed.''
   U.N. soldiers and territorial police regularly patrol the border
area and have not reported any incursions. A reconnaissance team of
South Africans, Angolans and U.N. personnel also is searching the
border by helicopter, Botha said.
   The Angola-Namibia border stretches for several hundred miles of
thinly populated scrub brush. Many civilians cross each way daily,
ignoring the few isolated border posts.
   The guerrillas and Angolan officials have denied that any
guerrillas are massing on the Angola-Namibia border or have crossed
into Namibia.
   The U.S. State Department said Thursday it had no independent
information to confirm the South African allegations.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization is widely favored to
win next week's elections and run Namibia's first independent
government.

<HEAD>Mohtashemi Denies Power Struggle Within Leadership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of Iran's hard-line
conservatives, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, today denied reports of a
power struggle in Iran's leadership and said it is united in its
anti-American policies.
   In an interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency, the
former interior minister said reports of fighting between
hard-liners and pragmatists, who favor closer ties with the West,
were ``totally erroneous.''
   ``Conservative or extremist in the Western sense of the words
are just alien expressions to Islam, and when a common enemy is
concerned, a Moslem has just one single outlook,'' he told the news
agency in an interview monitored in Nicosia.
   Mohtashemi was dropped from the new government of the president,
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   In a news conference in Tehran last week, Rafsanjani said there
was a ``difference in thinking'' among the Iranian leadership.
   Rafsanani, elected in July, dropped many leading radicals from
his government in favor of better qualified, often Western-educated
technocrats.
   While the radicals eschew any relations with the West _
especially the United States _ the pragmatists are believed to want
to change Iran's radical image and end its isolation to help obtain
economic assistance.
   Mohtashemi's interview came on the eve of the anniversary of the
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. The
anniversary is to be celebrated before the former embassy compound,
where ``a bonfire will be made of 160 American flags,'' IRNA
reported.
   The 160 flags will honor 16 Kuwaiti Shiites beheaded in Saudi
Arabia in September for planting bombs in Mecca during the annual
Moslem pilgrimage to that city.
   Saudi television aired what it said were confessions of the
Kuwaiti Shiites, in which they said they were trained by Iran.
   Iran said the confessions were baseless and denounced the
beheadings as an American plot.
   Rafsanjani has tried to play down the anniversary of the embassy
takeover. At his news conference, he did not show much enthusiasm
for the occasion and said that ``usually we do celebrate such
events, but it all depends on the spirits of the people.''
   Iranians interviewed on the streets of Tehran have also shied
away from talking about the event.

   Rescuers searched by sea and air today for a U.S.
Customs Service employee missing after a helicopter crashed off the
Florida coast while chasing a suspected drug boat, authorities said.
   At sunrise, crews from the Coast Guard, Customs and Air Force
doubled the search area to 500 square miles around the site where
the Customs helicopter went down about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, said
Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   The craft crashed in the Cay Sal Bank area, about 75 miles
southeast of Miami.
   Sheehan said searchers speculated Gulf Stream currents may have
picked up the missing man, who is believed to have been wearing a
life jacket.
   The Blackhawk helicopter was carrying four customs officials and
two Bahamian police officers.
   ``When they hit the water they were all able to get out safely.
The problem came when they were unable to physically link up with
one another in the water,'' Sheehan said.
   A hydrofoil from the Naval Air Station at Key West recovered
five people, Sheehan said.
   They were taken first to a hospital in Key West, then
transferred to Homestead, where they were being examined by Air
Force physicians this morning, Sheehan said. ``They are basically
in good condition,'' he said.
   No cause for the crash had been determined.
   The suspicious boat got away.

<HEAD>Drug Dealer Sentenced to Life Without Parole Under New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug dealer caught at an airport was
sentenced to life in prison without parole in what a federal judge
said was the first application of a mandatory penalty Congress
approved last year.
   ``That means you will have to stay in prison until you die,''
U.S. District Judge Elmo B. Hunter told James A. McKines, 38, of
Las Vegas at the sentencing Thursday.
   McKines was convicted by a jury of trying to smuggle eight soft
drink bottles filled with liquid phencyclidine, the hallucinogen
known on the street as PCP or angel dust, through Kansas City
International Airport on June 8.
   McKines had two previous felony convictions for trafficking in
PCP, in Nevada in 1981 and in California in 1986.
   The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 requires a mandatory sentence of
life in prison without release for a third felony drug conviction.
Hunter said it was the first time the law has been applied since it
became effective.
   McKine's lawyer, David L. Owen Jr., said he would appeal the
sentence.
   ``As mandated by Congress, this violates (the constitutional
protection) against cruel and unusual punishment,'' Owen told the
judge.
   ``I thought about the constitutional aspects,'' Hunter replied.
``I am satisfied that the statute is lawful. I don't find anything
cruel and unusual about it when compared to the damage drugs do to
humanity. The law does not begin to cause the sadness and damage
that one man can do selling PCP or cocaine or crack.''
   McKines, who has known since his conviction what his sentence
could be, showed no emotion when the sentence was pronounced.
   ``I have nothing to say,'' McKines told the judge. ``I just want
to thank my lawyers for trying to help me.''
   McKines was stopped by Agent Carl Hicks of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration during a routine surveillance of flights
arriving from the West Coast, a major source of drugs sold in the
Midwest.
   A jury convicted McKines on Aug. 28 of conspiring to possess
with intent to distribute PCP, possession of PCP with intent to
distribute the drug, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   Hunter imposed the mandatory life sentences without release on
both of the PCP convictions and five years in prison on the
interstate travel charge. He also fined McKines $40,000.

<TEXT>
   Romania blocked final agreement on a
35-nation environmental accord today because it objected to a
provision that would allow citizens to protest pollution, diplomats
said.
   Despite Romania's objections, however, a U.S. delegation source
said the pact likely will be adopted by the other 34 nations
meeting in the Bulgarian capital.
   The conference, which began Oct. 16, has been considering
measures that include how to deal with industrial accidents in
border areas and treating dangerous chemical products that leak
into international waterways.
   But Romania, under hard-line Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu,
refused to accept any reference to permitting citizens or
unofficial groups to voice their concerns on ecological issues in a
final conference document, diplomats said.
   Bulgaria and the Soviet Union were said to have made last-ditch
efforts Thursday to persuade Romania to drop its objections.
   This morning, Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov personally appealed
to Ceausescu by telephone to drop the Romanian objections but
failed, the U.S. source said, speaking by telephone from Sofia on
condition of anonymity.
   The Sofia conference is being held as part of the process
started by the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, signed by 35 nations
including the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all
European nations except for Albania.
   Romania has a history of blocking or diluting agreements reached
by the 35 nations who signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act on
security and cooperation in Europe.
   Romanian objections blocked a final agreement on a document at a
cultural symposium in Budapest in 1985.
   Romania also marred a landmark agreement on human rights reached
at a 35-nation Helsinki follow-up conference in Vienna last January
by announcing it would not feel bound by provisions on religious
freedom and other human rights.
   Until the current conference in Sofia, Bulgaria also had
harrassed independent ecological groups and other emerging
unofficial organizations.
   But the presence of Western officials attending the conference,
which opened Oct. 16, has allowed the independent group
Eco-Glasnost and other dissenters a margin of public activity
unknown before on Sofia streets.
   Police intervened once with ``Eco-Glasnost'' activists,
arresting at least 22 of them as they collected signatures in a
Sofia park on a petition against a government-backed industrial
project.
   Following strong complaints from Western delegations about the
incident, the head of Bulgaria's delegation to the ecological
conference, Nikolai Dyulgerov, said next day the police action was
``regrettable.''

<TEXT>
   About 4,000 East Germans were
jammed into the West German Embassy in Prague today with new
arrivals pouring in each hour, all eager to emigrate West despite
promises of reform from their Communist leaders.
   ``It's just the same hardheaded idiots as before,'' said a
bricklayer from Karl-Marx-Stadt. ``What's going to change? The
corrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes,
that's all.''
   ``I don't believe that anything will change there,'' said
another young man. ``The reforms are only for the outside world.''
   Red Cross workers and refugees unloaed tents and bedding trucked
in from West Germany.
   East Germany has agreed to let its citizens here renounce their
citizenship and then go to West Germany, where they are
automatically granted citizenship.
   But with East German diplomats processing only about 100
applications a day, it was feared the embassy and its gardens,
which have a capacity of about 5,500 people, would be overflowing
by the weekend when a rush of new arrivals was expected.
   Embassy sources, who put the number of East Germans at about
4,000 just before noon, said negotiations were under way with
Czechoslovak authorities for more space.
   Some people arriving today said the roads to Prague were crammed
with East German cars.
   The wave began Wednesday after East Germany's new leader, Egon
Krenz, lifted a month-old travel ban to Czechoslovakia, the only
country East Germans can visit freely. Krenz's predecessor, Erich
Honecker, had imposed the ban to stop an earlier exodus of East
Germans to the West German Embassy in Prague.
   The exodus has mainly involved skilled workers in their early
20s and 30s. At least 200 to 300 children played inside the embassy
grounds.
   Those who have left East Germany include at least 1,100 doctors
and nurses, and this has severely strained health services in the
Communist country, an East German health officials said today.
   Dr. Geerd Dellas, the health administrator for the city of East
Berlin, said doctors and nurses from exclusive clinics serving
high-ranking Communist officials have been drafted to work in
ordinary hospitals. Nurses still in school who were near graduation
have also been employed, Dellas said.
   East Germans were swift to take advantage of the lifting of the
travel ban. Eight thousand crossed into Czechoslovakia in the first
24 hours, and the number in the West German Embassy swelled from
2,100 Thursday night to some 4,000 by noon today.
   ``You've just got to use an open barn door to the West while you
can,'' said one 25-year-old from Leipzig.
   Most refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors of
the Palais Lobkowicz, the elegant Baroque palace that houses the
West German Embassy in Prague's ancient Mala Strana district.
   A Czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagues
had orders not to interfere because it was a matter for the two
Germanys alone.
   The West German government appealed to East Germany to speed up
the bureaucratic process for the East Germans in Prague and about
700 still waiting at the West German mission in Warsaw, Poland.
   East Germany said it was working as fast as possible and
reiterated that it would be better for its citizens to apply for
legal emigration.
   East Germans complain that it often takes years for a such
requests to be granted.
   Since August, more than 70,000 East Germans have fled their
homeland through Hungary and Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw.
   On Oct. 3, Honecker banned travel to Czechoslovakia to try to
halt the exodus of young, skilled workers badly needed in his
labor-intensive economy.
   But the exodus and pressure for reform led to Honecker's ouster
Oct. 18. He was replaced by Krenz, who is trying to bolster the
Communist Party's sagging authority with promises of reform and
foreign travel.
   Krenz faces mounting pressure for democratic reform in East
Germany, where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to the
streets to press for more democracy.
   Returning from Poland on Thursday, Krenz urged closer economic
ties to the West. Several top Communist officials resigned,
including Honecker's wife, Margot, as education minister.

   The superintendent of the prison wracked
by two riots last week was suspended and will receive no salary
until an investigation is complete, officials said.
   The suspension of Superintendent Robert M. Freeman will last
until a three-member commission appointed by Gov. Robert P. Casey
makes its report in a month into the cause of the violence, said
Pennsylvania Corrections Commissioner David S. Owens.
   Freeman, a 19-year veteran of the corrections system who has
headed the prison since 1984, could not be reached for comment. He
has an unlisted phone number.
   The fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed at
the prison five miles west of Harrisburg. Thirteen prison staffers
were held hostage at various points during the two riots; a total
of 123 people were injured.
   Spokesman Kenneth Robinson would not say on Thursday whether the
commissioner's decision was related to information reported by The
Associated Press about two hours before the suspension was first
announced Wednesday.
   In interviews this week, more than 15 correctional officers said
the prison administration failed to heed warnings about
lock-control panels broken during the first riot.
   Several guards also said officials lied about the time the
prison was secured after the first riot in an attempt to play down
the uprising. Prison officials said they stand by their accounts.
   In addition, some guards said they filed reports two weeks
before the riots, quoting inmates who had warned about the coming
trouble.
   Sherri Cadeaux, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections,
said an undetermined number of locking mechanisms were still being
fixed. But she said the inmates' cells were padlocked.
   The prison calm and locked down Thursday, the Corrections
Department said in a statement.
   Cleanup and repairs continued on the damaged control center,
office areas and four cell blocks. Arson investigators from the
Pennsylvania state police continued to look through burned modular
housing units and other fire-damaged buildings.
   Since Friday, about 877 inmates have been transferred to other
state and federal prisons. Another 50 inmates were to be sent
Thursday to the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa.

   A man was pulled early today from the rubble of
a collapsed downtown building after being trapped under the debris
for nearly five hours, authorities said.
   The upper floors of the three-story building, being renovated
for use as a shelter for homeless women, collapsed on top of the
man about 10:15 p.m. Thursday from unknown causes, authorities said.
   Russell Coleman, 58, was listed in satisfactory condition at
Johns Hopkins Hospital this morning, a hospital spokeswoman said.
The hospital did not release details about his injuries.
   Coleman was believed to be the only person in the building.
   Authorities at first believed Coleman was a homeless drifter who
was seeking shelter in the building, which is next to the Baltimore
Rescue Mission. But officials later said he might have been working
on one of the building's upper floors when the structure collapsed.
   ``I heard a loud crash, but I thought it was just another
tractor-trailer going by,'' said Hal Sall, assistant to the
supervisor of the Rescue Mission. ``And then I came out and saw
half the building was gone. Just as I was going back inside, I
heard someone screaming for help.''

<HEAD>Court Strike Spreads to Nationwide Indefinitely</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with strike extended indefinitely,
Medellin judges handing in resignations, two court workers killed; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges and other court workers shut down
the nation's justice system today and said they would not return to
work unless the government gives them more protection from drug
traffickers.
   Medellin judges, who began a strike a day earlier, handed in
their resignations today, reported the Colombian radio network RCN.
The resignations are viewed as largely symbolic gestures that are
not likely to be carried out.
   Drug thugs who have waged a bloody campaign since a government
crackdown began 11 weeks ago were blamed for a car bomb explosion
Thursday night in the capital of Bogota. Three members of a family
and a soldier were killed and two people were injured.
   Three other small bombs exploded in the capital and one was
deactivated, the police said in a communique.
   The strike by 17,000 members of the National Association of
Court Workers began Thursday and was to last through Wednesday. It
was sparked by the slaying of a federal judge in Medellin on
Wednesday, the third federal judge killed by drug traffickers in
the last three months.
   But this morning, union leader Helmut Romero told the Caracol
radio network that the strike will go on indefinitely until the
government gives protection to the courts.
   The judges want bullet-resistant cars and vests, bodyguards,
guns, weapons training and metal detectors at entrances to their
offices.
   This is the third strike by judges in the last three months, but
this is the first one where the courts have been closed down
indefinitely.
   The Medellin judges' resignations are symbolic to emphasize
their demands. Judges have resigned in the past to bring attention
to their problems and the resignations are not effective unless
accepted by the Supreme Court.
   In the past, the resignations have been rejected and the judges
have gone back to work after meeting with government officials.
Representatives of the Medellin judges were flying to Bogota today
to try to meet with President Virgilio Barco, El Tiempo said.
   El Tiempo also reported today that two court employees, both
union members, were kidnapped in Cali last Saturday, tortured and
then shot to death. A woman answering the telephone at the Cali
police department said the report was true but refused to give
other details.
   More than 180 bombings have rocked Colombia since the government
declared a crackdown on drug traffickers Aug. 19, the day after a
leading presidential candidate was assassinated. The terrorist
campaign has left 25 people dead and another 224 injured.
   Authorities here assume the drug traffickers are using the
bombings to try to force the government to abandon its policy of
extraditing drug suspects to the United States. Five suspects have
been extradited since the crackdown began.
   In the last eight years 222 court workers, including 43 judges,
have been killed, most of them by drug traffickers.
   Federal Judge Mariela Espinoza was killed Wednesday by
submachine-gun fire from two speeding cars as she arrived at her
Medellin home with two guards on motorcycles. One of the bodyguards
and a bystander were wounded.

<HEAD>State High Court To Review Suit Against Newspapers Who Revealed Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court has agreed to
review whether two Twin Cities newspapers must pay damages to a man
for publishing his name after reporters promised him anonymity as a
news source.
   The court said Thursday that it would hear oral arguments in
former publicist Dan Cohen's case against the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch and the Star Tribune of Minneapolis after both sides
have filed new briefs.
   In September, the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld a jury's
award of $200,000 in actual damages to Cohen, but threw out an
award of $500,000 in punitive damages.
   The newspapers last month asked the state Supreme Court to throw
out the actual damages. Cohen has asked the court to reinstate the
punitive damages.
   The case involves a 1982 incident in which Cohen gave reporters
copies of court documents showing that Marlene Johnson, who was
running for lieutenant governor, had been convicted of shoplifting
12 years earlier. Editors of the papers decided to name Cohen as
their source for the documents and Cohen lost his job with an
advertising agency.
   Johnson's conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence. She
was elected as Gov. Rudy Perpich's running mate and the two are
seeking re-election next year.

   Rescuers found another body in the rubble
of a plastics plant, bringing the confirmed death toll to 19 in
last month's explosions, and work resumed today in intact sections
of the 800-acre complex.
   Searchers, including high-rise experts and rappellers called in
this week, continued looking for four workers missing and presumed
dead since explosions and fires destroyed several buildings at the
Phillips Petroleum Co. plant on Oct. 23.
   The search involved using ropes to climb onto high floors of the
200-foot-high ruins of the polyethylene unit where leaking gases
somehow ignited, tiggering the explosions.
   About 300 hourly Phillips employees are expected to be back at
work within the next week at areas of the plant unaffected by the
inferno, and about 300 administrative and supervisory employees
already have returned, spokesman Bill Wicker said. About 900 people
worked in three shifts at the refinery before the explosion, which
injured 124 workers.
   The company said work resumed today at the refinery's K-Resin
plant. Construction work on a new polyethylene unit, which was
suspended after the accident, is expected to resume Monday, said
Greg Derrick, another company spokesman.
   Eighteen bodies have been found in the rubble, including the
latest found Wednesday night, Derrick said Thursday. Another worker
died of injuries at a Pasadena hospital late Tuesday. Eight of the
victims have been identified by the Harris County medical
examiner's office.
   The polyethylene plant manufactured almost 20 percent of the
nation's production of plastic pellets used to make such goods as
milk jugs and grocery bags.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rebel commander said today
the guerrillas canceled peace talks because the government left no
alternative but armed struggle after a union hall bombing killed 10
people.
   ``With the massacre ... the fascist dictatorship has been
unmasked. The only way being left open is the immediate taking up
of arms,'' said rebel commander Eduardo Sancho on rebel Radio
Venceremos.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said Thursday it
had ``suspended our participation'' in peace talks. Rebel and
government representatives were to meet Nov. 20 in Caracas,
Venezuela, in a third round of talks that began in Mexico in
September.
   The talks had produced virtually no progress toward ending a
10-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 70,000 people.
Each side accused the other of bad faith.
   The government had no comment early today on the suspension of
the talks.
   Sancho said Tuesday's bombing of the National Federation of
Salvadoran Workers was ``the principal reason'' for suspension of
the talks. He said the bombing ``marks a new line, a new political
moment'' similar to the early 1980s, when rampant political
violence was claiming up to 800 lives a month.
   On Thursday, thousands of unionists buried their slain comrades
and vowed revenge.
   ``Because the color of blood is never forgotten, our slain
companions will be avenged!'' the unionists shouted as they marched
through downtown.
   Many carried wreaths and banners denouncing President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government.
   The rebels said they had evidence the bombing was the decision
of military chief of staff Col. Rene Ponce, was authorized by
Christiani and executed by Col. Elena Fuentes, commander of the San
Salvador-based 1st Army Brigade.
   The rebels did not describe the nature of their evidence.
   El Salvador observed the Day of the Dead holiday Thursday, and
no government spokesman was available to respond to the accusation.
The two-day holiday honors the deceased.
   Cristiani, in an address Tuesday night, condemned the bombing as
terrorism and pledged an investigation.
   ``Death to D'Aubuisson!'' chanted the marchers Thursday,
referring to Roberto D'Aubuisson, founder and honorary president of
Cristiani's Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   Human rights advocates consider D'Aubuisson the mastermind of
rightist death squads that killed thousands of suspected leftists
in the early 1980s.
   The marchers, some of whom wore bandanas covering their faces
and carried nail-studded wooden staves, plastered walls downtown
with red-bordered posters emblazoned with the initials of the
guerrilla front.
   ``For the future of our children, everyone against Arena!,''
said the poster.
   Soldiers and police generally stayed well away from the march
route. The only incident occurred when a truckload of army troops
approached the rear of the march.
   Marchers taunted the troops with shouts, and a soldier tossed a
tear-gas grenade that left a few dozen demonstrators crying and
coughing.
   Two rocket-equipped air force helicopters flew over the march in
rapid succession as it approached the Bermeja Cemetery on the
city's southern edge. The marchers shook their fists and sticks at
the aircraft.
   The victims were buried without incident. Guerrilla priest
Miguel Ventura, who had come secretly from the rebel-controlled
northeastern mountains, officiated at the burial.
   President Bush on Thursday condemned recent violence ``from
extremists from both the left and the right'' but said Cristiani's
government ``continues in the democratic path'' of former
Salvadoran president Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Bush spoke at a ceremony honoring Duarte at Walter Reed Medical
Center in Washington, where the former Salvadoran leader is
hospitalized with terminal cancer.
   In March, voters elected Cristiani over the candidate of the
then-governing Christian Democratic Party. Cristiani replaced
Duarte, who by law could not run for re-election.

   The Dakotas celebrated their 100th
birthdays with vows to make the first years of the second century
bright ones despite declining economic fortunes in recent years.
   About 6,000 second-graders scheduled to graduate in the year
2000 packed the Bismarck Civic Center on Thursday and counted down
to 3:40 p.m., the time on Nov. 2, 1889, when North Dakota and South
Dakota were admitted to the union.
   Hundreds of balloons floated from the ceiling and a
28-square-foot cake glowed with 100 sparklers as the arena erupted
into a boisterous ``Happy Birthday.''
   In South Dakota, state officials braved freezing temperatures
and a stiff wind for re-enactment of the swearing-in ceremony of
the state's first governor, Arthur C. Mellette.
   Mellette's hometown, Watertown, was declared ``Capital for a
Day.''
   Pony Express riders carrying messages between the two states
``ran flat out'' trying to emulate the riding of their
predecessors, said one rider, Ken Tichmak.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner read a letter of congratulations
from President Bush and chided the gloomy predictions of skeptics
who question the states' future after years plagued with drought
and depressed oil prices.
   ``Those people don't understand at all what we have here,''
Sinner said. ``But we know all this, and we know our heritage.''
   Earlier, Sinner kidded his South Dakota counterpart, Gov. George
Mickelson, after Mickelson arrived late for a morning radio show in
which the governors exchanged birthday greetings.
   ``I thought it was appropriate that you got in a minute or two
late,'' Sinner told Mickelson. ``We did some research, and it turns
out that North Dakota was actually the first of these states to
become states, and so that minute or two was just exactly right.''
   Officials said not even President Benjamin Harrison, who signed
the Nov. 2 proclamation that created both states from the Dakota
Territory, knew which one came first.
   ``President Harrison really did kind of a wonderful thing when
he shuffled those papers and didn't let anybody know who was
first,'' said Jim Soyer, assistant director of the South Dakota
Centennial Commission.
   ``The president covered the papers up and then he said `They
were born together, they are one, and I shall make them twins.'
Then he shuffled them again and signed them. Even he doesn't know
which one came first.''
   North Dakota was admitted as the 39th state and South Dakota as
the 40th.

   The government expressed support
today for laws that permit groups to organize and said a violent
police crackdown on protesters last week was no way to solve
political problems.
   ``We see an urgent need to formulate more precisely legal
measures guaranteeing the citizens their right of gathering and
association,'' said government spokesman Miroslav Pavel, quoted by
the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo.
   ``The intervention of police forces, however legally justifiable
it may be, cannot permanently solve the essence of these political
problems,'' he said.
   Thousands of people last Saturday marked the 71st anniversary of
independent Czechoslovakia by demanding free elections and genuine
reform.
   Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist authorities have so far
refused to implement far-reaching reforms similar to those in
neighboring Poland and Hungary or initiate dialogue with
independent groups.
   Police arrested 359 people during the mass anti-government
protest and arrested 18 foreigners, according to final figures
released by the government Thursday.
   All the foreigners were released, including a Hungarian
journalist who was expelled from Czechoslovakia on Monday. Police
said 148 Czechoslovaks were detained until early Monday morning.
Twenty-two Czechoslovaks had to pay fines, while another 163 face
possible misdemeanor charges, punishable under tough new
anti-demonstration laws by fines of up to $2,000.
   Rude Pravo on Monday said five policemen and seven demonstrators
were hurt during Saturday's rally, when several people were beaten
by riot police wielding batons.
   A newspaper said today that the Socialist Party, part of the
National Front led by the Communist Party, recently proposed laws
to permit gathering and association ``with regard to the accepted
international covenants.''
   The paper, Socialist Orientation, said the proposed laws will be
discussed by Parliament in the near future and ``in view of their
topical importance ... a possibility is considered to approve them
before the new Czechoslovak constitution is approved (in 199O).''
   In other developments, officials and activists confirmed today
that Jan Carnogursky, a leading human rights and Roman Catholic
activist, will go on trial Monday in the Slovak capital of
Bratislava on charges that could jail him for up to 10 years.
   Carnogursky was arrested Aug. 14 and charged with subversion
after calling for peaceful commemorative ceremonies Aug. 21 in
honor of the victims of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
21 years earlier.
   The Polish PAP news agency reported that 20 Czechoslovakians
were barred from leaving their country for a conference on Central
Europe organized today by the Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity in
Wroclaw.
   The officials told the group that their trip to Poland would
``run counter to the reason of state,'' the agency report said.

   President Bush is sending mixed signals about
seeking military aid for the Nicaraguan Contras, seeming to revive
that option after his spokesman ruled it out a day earlier.
   ``We will leave our options open,'' Bush said Thursday after
visiting El Salvador's ailing former president, Jose Napoleon
Duarte, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
   On Wednesday, after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called
off a 19-month cease-fire, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
regarding the possibility of seeking military aid for the rebels,
``We don't want to go that route. We want to get free elections.''
   Bush had appeared on Tuesday to leave the door to military aid
open when he specifically declined during a news conference to rule
it out.
   After his visit to Duarte, who is thought to be near death from
stomach cancer, Bush also accused Nicaragua of ``armed subversion''
of its neighbors.
   ``It's not clear how far Ortega intends to take his military and
intimidation campaign. Accordingly, we must and we will leave our
options open,'' he said.
   Pressed to elaborate, Bush said only that he would let his
statement stand for itself. Congress cut off military aid to the
Contras in February 1988 but has approved humanitarian aid for the
rebels through February, when Nicaragua is scheduled to hold
national elections.
   Bush said it was hypocritical for Ortega to expect the Contras
to disband and return home voluntarily ``while sending in vast
armed forces to attack them.''
   The administration issued different assessments of Ortega's
offer to hold talks between Sandinista officials and the Contras
next week at the United Nations.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the U.N. talks
``a positive sign, something we've called for all along.''
   Bosco Matamoros, a rebel spokesman in Washington, had said
Thursday that the rebel leaders in Honduras had accepted Ortega's
offer. The State Department called the move a propaganda ploy
because it came on the heels of Ortega's cancellation of the
cease-fire. There have been no direct contacts between Sandinista
and Contra officials for more than a year.
   But Fitzwater reacted differently today.
   ``What we'd like to see is for these positive steps to lead to a
reinstatement of the cease-fire and to get President Ortega to
create a climate in Nicaragua for democracy and repatriation,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater spoke to reporters while traveling with Bush aboard
Air Force One to Richmond, Va.
   Sentiment on Capitol Hill appears to be strongly opposed to
restoring military aid to the rebels, although the House, often a
bastion of anti-Contra sentiment, blamed the Sandinistas Thursday
for the escalation in fighting in Nicaragua.
   The State Department said two military operations launched by
the Sandinistas were ``large-scale'' and involved the use of
artillery and attack helicopters.
   The House resolution called on Ortega to ``cease his reckless
rhetoric'' and said Nicaragua's leaders must fulfill commitments to
``end their aggression in the region, end their tyranny over their
own people and permit the establishment of democracy inside
Nicaragua.''
   Meanwhile, Ortega and the U.S. State Department offered sharply
conflicting versions of the reasons behind a recent reinfiltration
of an estimated 2,000 Contras into Nicaragua from base camps in
Honduras.
   The State Department said the rebels' intentions were peaceful
but Ortega forcefully disagreed.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, citing reports from
Contra leaders, said about 2,000 rebels have reinfiltrated into
Nicaragua in recent weeks. A Pentagon estimate said about 4,000
Contras are now in Nicaragua and 10,000 others remain in Honduras.
   Boucher said one purpose for the reinfiltration was to encourage
Contra supporters to register to vote. Other officials, insisting
on anonymity, said a number of Contras, worried about a Central
American plan to demobilize them, decided to return on their own
because they feared they might be forced back against their will
later without arms to protect them.
   In a column in Thursday's New York Times, Ortega contended the
Contras were trying to subvert the electoral process because ``they
are as convinced as I am ... that the Nicaraguan people will give
the Sandinistas a landslide victory'' in the elections.
   He said that during October, Contra units closed more than 50
voter registration centers, preventing thousands of citizens from
registering.
   ``They targeted for assassination known Sandinista supporters _
prominent community leaders, party activists and candidates for
municipal offices _ and slit their throats,'' Ortega wrote.
   But Boucher said there was no basis for that version.
   ``I think the important thing is ... that there's no reason to
believe that they are engaged in any offensive operations,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Bombs exploded outside the homes of three
Christian legislators today shortly after Christian leader Gen.
Michel Aoun threatened to dissolve Parliament if it tried to ratify
a peace plan without his approval.
   The blasts wounded a woman outside the residence of Parliament
deputy Michel Khazen in Jounieh, in the Christian heartland north
of Beirut.
   The explosions outside the homes of deputies August Bakhos and
Salem Abdel Nour in the east Beirut districts of Jdeideh and Badaro
caused no casualties, police said.
   The three deputies are in Paris along with 25 colleagues from
the Christian heartland who have refused to return home after
endorsing the Arab League-brokered peace accord during a special
Parliament session in Saudi Arabia last month.
   The blasts occurred within an hour after Aoun ended a news
conference at his residence in the bunker of the shell-ravaged
Baabda presidential palace.
   He said: ``I ask the legislators not to commit the final and
major mistake. I ask them not to take part in the parliamentary
session. Let them take their time. Let them come here and let's
discuss the document.''
   That was a reference to the 28 Parliamentarians in Paris.
   ``Parliament will be dissolved before the meeting gets underway
if they tried to pass the document without discussing what they
have done with me,'' said Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government.
   An aide to Aoun said earlier the Maronite general and the two
other officers in his interim military cabinet were considering
adopting ``historic decisions. Its a crucial meeting.''
   That led to speculation he would dismiss the 73 deputies, the
last elected officials still in office after 14 years of civil war.
   Aoun's Cabinet is vying for power with the predominantly Moslem
government of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said Lebanon's ambassador to
France, Fuad Turk, informed the lawmakers currently in Paris that
Aoun has decided to dissolve Parliament.
   Aoun's move is not expected to have a drastic effect on the
parliamentary session that Speaker Hussein Husseini called for
Saturday.
   A Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the legislators ``will meet in Lebanon at any cost
to carry out our national duty.''
   Husseini, a Shiite, has invited legislators for a three-session
meeting Saturday at parliament's Villa Mansour headquarters in the
no-man's land of Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   The first session would be to elect a successor to Husseini, the
second to ratify the peace accord and the third to elect a new
president.
   The peace accord raised parliament's 99 seats to 108 to be
evenly distributed between Moslems and Christians, stripped the
president of the authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers
and extended the speaker's mandate from one to four years.
   Aoun has rejected the peace plan because it did not include a
clear timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from
Lebanon.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, 1988,
when the six-year-term of former President Amin Gemayel expired
with parliament failing to elect a successor.
   The peace plan maintained a 45-year-old formula of distributing
power along sectarian lines. The president would be a Maronite, the
Prime Minister a Sunni and the house speaker a Shiite.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Barrow Cutting Young's Lead In Detroit Mayor Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Challenger Tom Barrow gained ground on Mayor
Coleman A. Young in a new survey, while Young lost a previous
endorsement and continued defending his tally of Devil's Night
fires in Detroit.
   But Barrow, trying to stop Young's bid Tuesday for a fifth
four-year term, wasn't in town Thursday to capitalize on the flurry
of generally favorable news. He was in Washington, D.C., meeting
with federal officials to argue against plans to foreclose on
Detroit's New Center Hospital, of which he is board chairman.
   A telephone survey of 400 registered voters, conducted Tuesday
and Wednesday by Market Opinion Research for the Detroit Free Press
and WXYZ-TV, showed Young leading Barrow, 47 percent to 39 percent,
with 14 percent undecided. The margin of error was 5 percentage
points.
   Young led Barrow by 16 percentage points in a similar poll
conducted in early October. Fred Currier, chairman of Market
Opinion Research, said the latest survey results might have
reflected Barrow's endorsement by Detroit's two daily newspapers
and the controversy surrounding Devil's Night arson statistics.
   Young repeated his claim Thursday that 223 fires occurred during
the Devil's Night period in Detroit, compared with 229 a year
earlier. The Detroit Fire Fighters Association, whose leaders
support Barrow and which is negotiating a new contract with the
city, tallied 412 fires Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
   Young challenged reporters to file Freedom of Information Act
requests for city fire statistics, but he said: ``I resent anyone
even implying that I'm a liar. When you request to review the raw
data, that's what your implication is.''
   Meanwhile Thursday, businessman Charles Costa, who finished
fifth in the 13-candidate mayoral primary on Sept. 12, withdrew his
previous support of the mayor and instead endorsed Barrow.
   Costa acknowledged meeting earlier with Young and deciding to
support him. ``However, there were some promises made that day that
never took place,'' Costa said. ``And because of that, I want to
withdraw my support for the mayor and turn it to Mr. Barrow.''

<TEXT>
   A formal agreement was signed today giving
Poland up to 10,000 metric tons of pork bellies, part of a $100
million package of U.S. food aid promised by President Bush for
this fiscal year.
   The agreement was signed Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter,
Ambassador Jan Kinast of Poland and Philip Christenson of the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
   During the Agriculture Department ceremony, Kinast said the pork
``helps us to meet our immediate needs'' and that Poland has many
complex economic reforms under way, which he said must be
accomplished by the Polish people themselves.
   Yeutter said he will head a U.S. fact-finding mission to Poland
later this month. Meanwhile, he and Kinast indicated there are no
serious shipping problems foreseen that would impede delivery of
the pork bellies as quickly as possible.
   Kinast was asked if the pork might have a depressing effect on
Polish farm prices. He said the quantity was not all that large,
considering Poland's 38 million people.
   Bush has been under pressure from Democratic leaders in Congress
to increase the aid to Poland, the first Eastern Bloc country not
led by a communist. But further aid is stalled over Republican
efforts to attach to the Polish assistance bill an unrelated
amendment to cut the U.S. capital gains tax.
   Asked about the possibility of expanded aid and what it might
entail, Kinast said he would like to see more of ``such products
which would help us stimulate the agricultural production'' of his
country.
   Yeutter, while not being specific, said that in the case of
further money being made available for Poland ``we would obviously
evaluate priorities for usage'' by discussing the matter with
lawmakers and the Polish government.
   ``Clearly, we would not wish to send quantities of food aid ...
that would reach the point of depressing the agricultural sector of
Poland,'' Yeutter said.

   Although the superpowers profess to
have no fear of a reunited Germany, Europeans on both sides of the
East-West divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect
of a German giant in their midst.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact lawmakers who met here this week to discuss
political changes indicated that Europeans, afraid of the rise of a
new dominant power on the continent, may be more comfortable with
the status quo of two Germanys.
   East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, quashed the prospect of a
reunited Germany in the near future when he told reporters in
Moscow that ``division is an element of our European security.''
   But French President Francois Mitterrand, at the end of a
two-day summit in Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said today that
he deemed the desire for a reunified state as a legitimate goal.
   ``No responsible politician in Europe can ponder the future
without taking this into consideration,'' Mitterrand told a news
conference. ``It is a phenomenon that will dominate the end of this
century.''
   Mitterrand's comments were the most tolerant by a leading French
politician to date on the subject.
   West German officials and scholars say the mass demonstrations
sweeping the Communist state could lead some day to the kinds of
reforms that would allow East Germans to reconsider their separate
status.
   The East German state under Communist Party control ``has never
been accepted by the people,'' said Burkhard Dobiey, head of the
German Policy department of the federal Inter-German Affairs
Ministry in Bonn.
   ``If they decide that as Germans they would like to be with us,
for instance, we have to accept that. This is in our Constitution.''
   Dobiey's comments came during a three-day discussion between
lawmakers from the East and West sponsored by the North Atlantic
Assembly, an advisory body to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The long-dormant idea of a reunified Germany has been
revitalized in recent months by the flight of tens of thousands of
East Germans disillusioned with conditions in their country.
   President Bush said in an interview with The New York Times last
week that he doesn't ``share the concern that some European
countries have about a reunified Germany.''
   But European parliamentarians at the East-West roundtable did
indeed show discomfort. They pressed the West Germans to explain
their intentions.
   ``We are very much concerned about the impact the rapprochement
of the two Germanys might have on the European Community,'' said
Loic Bouvard, a French parliament member.
   Pieter Maris of the Netherlands' Parliament noted the thorny
problems of bringing together two Germanys belonging to opposite
political and defense camps. He asked the West Germans to explain
what they see as ``the last step.''
   West European unease with talk of reunification likely reflects
concern about the emergence of an overpowering economy as much as
security questions.
   Joining the two states would boost the population to more than
75 million, and expand the industrial base of what is already
Europe's strongest economy, West Germany.
   Some East European states, like Czechoslovakia, view efforts at
reunification as a drive powered by a revengeful spirit on the part
of the Germans to reclaim territory lost in World War II.
   The Kremlin, however, has signaled through envoys abroad it
would pose no barriers to East Germany's departure from the Warsaw
Pact if the populace so decided.
   ``Everything is up to the Germans,'' the Bonn-based daily Die
Welt quoted Nikolai Shishlin, head of the Communist Party Central
Committee's East European department, as saying in Washington.
   The newspaper also quoted Yevgeny Primakov, head of the lower
house of the Supreme Soviet, as telling CBS television the Kremlin
has no objections to the departure of any of its allies from the
Warsaw Pact.
   Istvan Gyarmati, a deputy foreign minister of Hungary and a
negotiator at the Vienna-based conventional arms talks, said
Europeans would accept reunification if existing military blocs
were dissolved.
   Jerzy Golaczynski, head of the national defense committee in
Poland's Sejm, or parliament, said his nation recognizes the right
of both East Germany and West Germany to determine their own
futures.
   ``But it has been made clear at this conference that
reunification is not just a concern for Germany, but for all of
Europe and the world,'' Golaczynski said. ``The concerns of
Germany's neighbors must also be kept in view.''
   While Poland and West Germany have made major advancements in
their relations recently, and Kohl will visit Warsaw next week, it
was Poland that suffered first at the hands of Nazi Germany 50
years ago.
   Resistance remains strong in Poland to reunification and to a
militarily and economically strong Germany rising again on the
western border.

   President Bush gave Republican
gubernatorial candidate J. Marshall Coleman a push today in his
battle against Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, who polls show leads in
his bid to become the nation's first elected black governor.
   Bush, campaigning for Coleman in downtown Richmond, said the GOP
candidate is ``the right man to lead Virginia in the battle against
drug abuse'' and that Wilder would have ``a sharp eye on your
wallets.''
   With Coleman as governor, Bush said, ``Taxpayers won't feel like
there's a bull's-eye painted on their backs.''
   Bush also said Coleman knows the issues that matter most to
Virginians _ law and order, drugs and education. He pointed to
Coleman's support of merit pay for teachers and greater choice in
public schools.
   ``But it's when we talk about taxes that we know how important
the election of Marshall Coleman really is,'' Bush said at an
outdoor rally attended by several thousand people on a chilly,
windy day. ``I hear the same things up on Capitol Hill that you do
from Capitol Square _ and it's beginning to sound like a broken
record.
   ``It doesn't matter what it is, every issue is an opportunity _
to raise your taxes,'' the president said. Bush also planned a stop
in Norfolk.
   On Thursday, Coleman accused the news media of giving Wilder
favorable treatment.
   Wilder's lead has been growing in polls in recent weeks, after
he released a daring campaign ad identifying himself as a supporter
of a woman's right to choose abortion.
   Jesse Jackson said a Wilder victory Tuesday would send a signal
across the country that ``something profound is taking place'' in
Virginia. But he downplayed any comparison of his own national
leadership with that of Wilder's.
   ``Doug will become a governor, a visible governor, a great
governor, but I relate to that state and 49 others. I think as he
settles into the day-to-day management of the state, he'll be seen
as one of 50 governors,'' said Jackson, who was interviewed at
Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.
   Wilder, who did not seek Jackson's help in his campaign for
governor, was told of Jackson's comments while campaigning near
Williamsburg.
   Wilder laughed and said: ``That Jesse is really something, huh?''
   Coleman said he doesn't think it matters how much history
Wilder's election would make.
   ``He has to meet the same high standards that Virginians have
always demanded of their governors,'' Coleman, a former attorney
general, said at a news conference at the state Capitol.
   He accused the press of treating instances of ``dishonesty and
corruption'' by Wilder ``as minor foibles.''
   Coleman stopped short of saying race was the reason for what he
said was Wilder's soft treatment.
   ``I don't know what the reason (for the press coverage) is,'' he
said. ``All I know is I see it because I am on the receiving end of
it.''
   Laura Dillard, Wilder's press secretary, said Coleman's remarks
were ``offensive and will sicken the voters of Virginia. ... I am
offended that Marshall Coleman is so desperate that he would
suggest that.''
   Ms. Dillard said Wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by the
press. ``I will leave it to others to conclude what is behind'' the
double-standard claim, she said.
   A poll that Mason-Dixon Opinion Research Inc. released Thursday
night showed Wilder leading Coleman 48 percent to 44 percent. The
poll, with a 3{ percent margin of error, showed a 2-point gain by
Wilder since the last Mason-Dixon sampling two weeks ago.
   A poll published Sunday in The Washington Post gave Wilder a 15
percent lead.
   In calling the news conference, Coleman invited Wilder to come
and explain his views on Virginia's anti-union right-to-work law.
Wilder did not appear, and Coleman released a videotape of a
meeting Wilder held with United Mine Workers officials that he said
showed discrepancies in Wilder's position on the law.
   Coleman also listed seven points, among them Wilder's reprimand
by the Virginia Supreme Court in 1978 for mishandling a case;
sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threatening
a malpractice lawsuit; and housing code violations by property
Wilder owned.
   In such cases, Coleman said, if he had been the offender he
would be ``laughed out of the contest'' and ``not be in the
running.''
   ``But, for the most part, members of the news media have treated
these examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles,'' he
said.
   On the tape, Wilder says he supports Virginia's right-to-work
law, which bars compulsory union membership. But asked whether he
supports a ``free-rider'' amendment allowing non-union members to
be required to pay dues to unions that negotiate contracts for
them, Wilder says, ``That's correct.''
   After a part of the tape was first released Tuesday, Wilder said
he would veto any effort to weaken the law and said the tape did
not contradict that position.
   Coleman said the tape shows that Wilder is ``so lacking in
personal integrity that he would take two positions at once.''
   Wilder campaigned at the College of William &amp; Mary, where he was
heckled by students who shouted ``Why do you lie?'' and carried
signs that read, ``Doug, Your Nose Is Growing'' and ``Lies, Wilder
and Audiotape.''

   The mayor of Leipzig resigned today after his city
was hit by the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in East German
history, the state-run news agency ADN reported.
   Bernd Seidel, 40, stepped down because he had lost the
confidence of Leipzig citizens, ADN said.
   About 300,000 people demonstrated for reforms in Leipzig on
Monday, and a similar number took to the streets of the city of
650,000 last week.
   The pro-reform demonstrations began in Leipzig two months ago,
about the same time thousands of East Germans began fleeing to the
West. The protests spread across the country, which was rocked by
protests again Thursday.
   Also today, a senior health official said the exodus of
thousands of skilled workers is seriously straining medical
services in East Germany.
   East Germany's state-controlled media also reported widening
calls for the resignations of top Communist Party leaders. A West
German newspaper reported that the East German premier, Willi
Stoph, will step down next week.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper, which forecast the ouster
of East German leader Erich Honecker last month, reported today
that Stoph will be removed at a party Central Committee meeting
convening Wednesday.
   About 70,000 East Germans have fled the country since August,
citing dissatisfaction with the authoritarian government.
   Dr. Geerd Dellas, the health administrator for the city of East
Berlin, told a Communist newspaper that 1,100 doctors and nurses
had left East Berlin so far.
   ``The situation is so difficult that an emergency system of aid
is going on,'' Dellas told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung.
   ``The (East) Berlin health and social services have been
seriously strained by the departure of doctors, dentists,
scientists and other medical personnel,'' Dellas said.
   He said doctors and nurses from exclusive clinics serving
high-ranking Communist officials have been drafted to work in
ordinary hospitals. Nurses still in school who were near graduation
have also been employed, Dellas said.
   The West German ZDF television network reported that Dresden
mayor Wolfgang Berghofer has predicted more top-level changes in
East Germany, where Egon Krenz replaced Honocker as Communist Party
chief last month.
   On Thursday, the resignations of several East German officials
were announced, including that of Honecker's wife, Margot. She had
been education minister for 26 years.
   Also Thursday, Annelis Kimmel became the first woman to head the
federation of trade unions, replacing Honecker protege Harry Tisch.
   Two regional party bosses quit after more than 20 years in their
posts, and the leaders of two Communist-aligned parties resigned
under pressure.
   The Liberal Democrats, another Communist ally, called for the
resignation of the entire 45-member Cabinet.
   The Liberals have led a drive by non-Communist parties for more
independence in recent weeks.
   Despite the changes, tens of thousands of people again
demonstrated for reforms in at least four cities late Thursday.
   They marched in Gera, Erfurt, Halle and Wilhelm Pieck Stadt, the
official ADN news agency reported.
   It said marchers bearing candles and banners shouted through
loud speakers for more democracy and an end to Communist Party
privileges.
   During recent weeks, tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to
the streets for such protests.
   Krenz, who replaced Honecker on Oct. 18, returned late Thursday
from an afternoon visit to Warsaw, Poland. He met with
non-Communist Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and declared that
East Germany could learn something from that country.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has canceled
plans to visit the site of a 1921 German-Polish battle because of
opposition from Poles, his spokesman said today.
   Kohl's Nov. 9-14 visit to Poland is meant to be a major step
toward reconciliation between two nations with a history of
hostility.
   His plan to visit St. Anne's Mountain in southwest Poland
triggered controversy because Poles and Germans fought for the
site. Poland's Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu had said it
would be a ``scandal'' to the memories of fallen Poles for Kohl to
travel there.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's spokesman, said the chancellor and Polish
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki discussed the issue by telephone
today.
   The men agreed that instead of going to St. Anne's Mountain,
Kohl will travel to the town of Krzyzowa, known in German as
Kreisau.
   During World War II, a number of German opponents of Adolf
Hitler, known as the ``Kreisau Circle,'' held meetings in the town
to map out plans for a Germany without the Nazi leader.
   Some of the Kreisau Circle members were later involved in the
July 20, 1944, attempt to kill Hitler.
   Klein said Kohl viewed a visit to St. Anne's Mountain as a
gesture ``of reconciliation, not just between our countries, but
also between Poles and members of the German minority (in Poland).''
   He said Kohl changed his plans to avert ``disagreements with
segments of the Polish population.''
   West Germany and Poland have been struggling to overcome mutual
unease that has historical roots, including the 1939 invasion of
Poland by Nazi Germany that touched off World War II.
   Ethnic Germans clashed with Poles in 1921 over whether Silesia,
where St. Anne's Mountain is located, would belong to Poland or
Germany.
   After the 1921 uprising, Upper Silesia went to Poland while
Lower Silesia remained in Germany.
   Lower Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia were awarded to Poland
by the Allies after World War II and millions of Germans living
there were expelled.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, stumping today for two
underdog gubernatorial candidates, listed a potpourri of the
``challenges of tomorrow'' critical to Virginia voters, but failed
to mention the most emotional issue of the campaign _ abortion.
   In a pair of campaign appearances for Republican J. Marshall
Coleman, Bush sounded themes familiar from his own presidential
campaign _ saying Coleman would be the state's best hope in dealing
with crime, drugs, taxation, environment, education and a strong
military. He even dusted off an issue that mired his 1988 campaign
in controversy _ prison parole procedures.
   But even as the president campaigned on those issues, the
divisive abortion question promised to figure in voters'
calculations at the polls on Tuesday.
   Bush's visit came a day after an anti-abortion group accused
four TV stations of refusing to air its pro-Coleman ads.
   Also on Thursday, the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Douglas
Wilder, was confronted by angry hecklers who called him a ``baby
killer'' for his pro-choice stand on abortion.
   At an outdoor rally in Richmond, anti-abortion activist George
Lucas distributed leaflets blasting Wilder as a candidate who
believes ``babies can be killed for any reason at all.''
   The abortion question also figured as an issue in the New Jersey
governor's contest. Bush was heading there later today to try and
boost Republican Rep. James Courter's long odds against Democratic
Rep. James Florio.
   In Richmond, Bush called Coleman ``the right man to lead
Virginia in the battle against drug abuse. The war on drugs isn't a
war of words. Anyone can talk tough _ but talking tough doesn't
keep dealers off the street.''
   The president said in a speech prepared for delivery in Norfolk
that Coleman ``understands that the Old Dominion doesn't need old
ideas _ like the liberal creed which blames everyone except the
criminal.''
   ``He wants the end of a hit-or-miss parole system that lets
hardened drug dealers prey on society,'' Bush said, adding that
Coleman wants to toughen Virginia law that currently could allow a
20-year sentence for drug dealing to be reduced to 3{ years of
actual time served.
   Bush made parole of felons a central issue of his own
presidential campaign, attacking the law in rival Michael Dukakis'
home state of Massachusetts that allowed parole for a convicted
murderer, Willie Horton.
   ``What are those problems, Virginia's challenges of tomorrow,''
Bush asked in his Norfolk speech. ``They're the same challenges we
face in Washington.''
   He cited educational reform, environmental protection and the
need to maintain a strong military, which also means preserving
defense-related jobs in Virginia.
   Touching on Coleman's plan to address commuter bottlenecks in
the state's rapidly expanding urban areas, Bush said `` look
forward to his regional transportation plan to reduce gridlock in
areas such as Tidewater.''
   On Thursday, Coleman had lashed out at the news media, accusing
them of giving favorable treatment to Wilder, who is seeking to
become the first black elected governor of any state.
   Wilder's press secretary, Laura Dillard, said Coleman's remarks
were ``offensive'' and that Wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized
by the press.
   Without referring directly to Wilder's race, Coleman had said,
``I don't think it matters how much history Doug Wilder's election
on Tuesday would make.''
   Bush said Coleman would have a ``no-nonsense, real-world
approach'' on crime and drugs,'' and would not ``confuse your
future with having a sharp eye on your wallets.''
   Wilder has used the abortion issue against Coleman in television
ads. Coleman opposes abortion.
   But Bush acknowledged the often-bitter nature of the state's
campaign.
   ``It's been a long, hard campaign, and in the end every campaign
comes back to basics, to the simple question every voter asks
himself, which candidate is right for the job?''
   A recent Washington Post poll showed Coleman trailing Wilder by
15 points, but other surveys show Wilder with a smaller margin. In
the New Jersey race, Courter trailed Florio, an eight-term member
of Congress, by 15 to 19 percentage points in late October polls.
   White House political director Jim Wray said the visits show
Bush ``is absolutely committed to do whatever we can to help
Republicans win,'' even against long odds.
   He said the Virginia race ``is close and we're going to do
whatever we can to mobilize the votes.'' He said Bush's appearances
for Coleman are ``as much as anything to help breathe a little more
excitement into the workers and the Republican voters.''
   In New Jersey, Wray said, ``We'll do what we can in the final
kick to help Jim Courter. Just as important is what we can do to
help the whole ticket.''
   He said that despite the polls, ``A lot can happen in four days
in politics.''
   Maintaining GOP control of the New Jersey legislature, where
Republicans hold a 41-39 advantage, ``is critical for us'' because
of the impending 1991 redistricting battle, said Leslie Goodman,
spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. About a dozen of
the legislative races are considered close.
   Control of state legislatures is key to the reapportionment
battle between Democrats and Republicans since the state
governments will draw the political district boundaries in which
elected officials run for office.
   ``What the president can do and has done is focus his efforts on
fund-raising and turning out the party faithful,'' said Goodman.
``It's not just the top of the ticket. We have critical state
legislative races.''
   Democrats are the majority in Virginia's House of Delegates, but
the 34 seats held by Republicans there are just enough to uphold a
possible governor's veto of new legislative boundaries if Coleman
wins his race.
   The Virginia campaign has been marked by often bitter exchanges
and charges on issues including abortion, taxes and congested
highways.
   Wilder has hammered in television ads and campaign appearances
at Coleman's opposition to abortion. Coleman has run ads
criticizing Wilder in a number of areas, including his performance
as an attorney in a civil case for which Wilder was reprimanded by
the state Supreme Court in 1978.
   Abortion, given more urgency by a Supreme Court ruling this year
that granted states greater leeway in regulating the procedure, has
also been an issue in New Jersey.
   Florio, who lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to Republican Tom
Kean by 1,797 votes, is pro-choice.
   Courter says he is against abortion personally and has supports
abortion only in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of
the mother. But he said he would not move to impose his views on
New Jersey women by dismantling the state's tough pro-choice law.

   Sandinista army troops backed by
helicopter gunships attacked about 500 Contra rebels in the
mountainous central province of Chontales, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said helicopter troop
carriers were being used to ``persecute the criminals'' in La
Pinuela and La Cusuca, 170 miles east of here.
   Defense Ministry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the army was fighting bands of Contras in the mountains that
run from the northern border with Honduras to the southeast.
   ``We still don't have any information about the results of the
fighting nor about the number of casualties,'' said one source.
   The fighting began soon after President Daniel Ortega announced
Wednesday that he was ending a 19-month truce.
   A Defense Ministry communique said Thursday that three rebels
were killed in El Guapote, 120 miles northeast of the capital in
Matagalpa province.
   Fighting in two places in Jinotega _ Pantasma and Plan de Grama
_ wounded seven government soldiers, the ministry said.
   Government troops in three northern provinces, Nueva Segovia,
Madriz and Esteli, were reorganizing, Radio Sandino said.
   ``The (government) troops began to disperse and restructure the
commands, which went to experienced fighters,'' it said.
   Ortega cited infiltration by 1,100 rebels from Honduran camps in
the past three weeks as a reason for ending the truce.
   Radio Sandino said Thursday that 400 rebels had worked their way
back into the country in the Quilali area and two other northern
zones and were ``assassinating and kidnapping civilians and making
propaganda for the rightist Unified National Opposition coalition.''
   The coalition encompasses parties from both the left and right
and is Ortega's main opposition in presidential elections scheduled
Feb. 25, 1990.
   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Contra commander Enrique Bermudez said
the rebels would continue observing the cease-fire. Since U.S.
weapons and ammunition supplies were cut off in February 1988, he
said, the rebels are not equipped to attack.
   ``These troops will only carry out evasive actions,'' he said.
   The rebels said Thursday they had accepted in principle a
Sandinista offer to meet Monday and Tuesday at the United Nations
to discuss demobilization of the rebel army. Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said he had also accepted an
invitation.
   Under a peace agreement signed by Ortega and four other Central
American presidents on Aug. 7, the rebels are to disband and
relocate by early December. The Contras never agreed to the plan.
   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, a military spokeswoman, denied a Honduran
accusation that Nicaraguan troops attacked the border town of Las
Manos on Monday.
   ``Nicaragua does not attack neighboring countries,'' she said.
   Honduras reported no casualties in the attack.
   A source inside the Sandinista army estimated 4,000 rebel
fighters were inside Nicaragua. U.S. sources also estimated the
number at about 4,000. Bermudez said there were more than 6,000.
   When the peace accord was signed, about 12,000 were in the
Honduran camps.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling aboard
Air Force One with President Bush on the way to Richmond, Va.,
called the U.N. talks ``a positive sign, something we've called for
all along.''
   ``What we'd like to see is for these positive steps to lead to a
reinstatement of the cease-fire and to get President Ortega to
create a climate in Nicaragua for democracy and repatriation,''
Fitzwater said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State-owned British Rail said Friday it has
shelved for a year plans to build a high-speed line from London to
the English side of the Channel Tunnel.
   The announcement followed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
refusal to help meet the cost of digging part of the 68-mile line
underground across south London. Environemental and residents'
groups oppose an above-ground rail line.
   British Rail said it will still go ahead with the link and has
awarded the contract to a private consortium, Eurorail Ltd., led by
the British construction group, Trafalgar House.
   Eurorail Ltd. said it will still meet the deadline for
completing the rail link in 1998.
   The underground tunnel has pushed the cost of the high-speed
line from $2.7 billion to $5.6 billion.
   Most the line will run though the southeastern England county of
Kent to Dover, the entry point to the 31-mile Channel Tunnel,
linking England and France.
   The Channel Tunnel, being built from both sides, is due to open
in 1993. Costs have also soared to $11 billion, 44 percent more
than estimated.

<TEXT>
   American scientists Lance A. Liotta and
Isaiah J. Fidler have won the 1989 Dr. Josef Steiner Cancer
Research Award, the Steiner Foundation announced Friday.
   They will share a prize of $250,000, which will be invested in
cancer research of their choice. This was stipulated in the will of
the founder of the award, a wealthy Swiss pharmacist who died in
1983.
   Liotta's group from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md., discovered a series of five proteins and their associated
genes which simulate and suppress key steps in the process by which
tumor cells invade normal tissue and spread in the body, the
foundation said.
   Fidler, of the University of Texas' Cancer Center, was honored
for his pioneer work in metastasis research, discovering that
metastasis is the result of a selective outgrowth of specialized
subpopulations of tumor cells, the foundation said. In other
studies, he worked on understanding the role that host defense
cells play in the growth and regression of cancer metastases.

<HEAD>Eds: Adds 9 grafs of details and background. A version moved on financial
wire.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. today announced 4,000
layoffs at three plants and said it will stop producing the
subcompact Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon in February.
   The No. 3 automaker behind General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. said slow sales and stiff competition forced it to lay off the
1,700 hourly employees at its Jefferson assembly plant in Detroit.
   The company said it is cutting one shift from the 3,600-worker
St. Louis Assembly Plant No. 1 because of falling sales of the
Chrysler LeBaron sports coupe and convertible made there. That will
reduce employment at the plant by 1,900 during the first quarter of
1990.
   Chrysler's Acustar subsidiary will close its Coleman, Wis.,
electronic component plant by June 1990, laying off 400 employees.
   The United Auto Workers union had no immediate comment.
   Chrysler said it will go ahead with construction of a $1 billion
Jefferson North assembly plant, and many of the Jefferson plant
workers to be laid off Feb. 2 could be called back in fall 1991
when training begins for the plant's production of a new
sport-utility vehicle.
   The fate of 250 salaried employees at the Jefferson plant was
undetermined, Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said.
   Shutdown of the 82-year-old Jefferson assembly plant, which
Chrysler bought in 1925, had been scheduled for 1992.
   ``Sales has accelerated it,'' Nicoll said. ``We're no different
from any other company. We're market-driven.''
   Jefferson produces 470 cars a day on a single shift, but demand
is much lower. Omni-Horizon sales are projected to be 89,500 cars
this year, down 57 percent from the 208,000 sold in 1986. No other
production is being assigned to the plant, effectively closing it.
   In St. Louis, Chrysler also said it was extending a plant
shutdown until Nov. 27 to allow excess inventory to be sold.
   Chrysler blamed Thursday's worker rejection of a four-day,
40-hour work week at the St. Louis No. 2 plant for the layoffs at
St. Louis No. 1. Chrysler said St. Louis No. 2, which makes the
company's popular minivans, could have increased production by 20
percent and jobs by 1,000 to 1,300, if the new work week had been
adopted.
   Combined sales of the Daytona and LeBaron models are about
150,000 a year; the St. Louis plant can produce about 225,000 of
the cars a year.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca announced a
program to slash $1 billion of the automaker's $26 billion annual
budget by the end of 1990. It included trimming about 2,300
salaried jobs, about 8 percent of the company's non-hourly
employees.

<HEAD>Regulators Recommend License Suspended to Punish Caesars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caesars Hotel and Casino's gaming
license should be temporarily suspended because it removed black
and female employees from a table to please a big-spending
customer, officials say.
   ``The conduct was repugnant,'' said state Division of Gaming
Enforcement Director Anthony Parrillo on Thursday. ``I think this
will show the length they will go to cater to a high roller.''
   Trump Plaza was facing similar discrimination charges, a
newspaper reported today.
   The DGE on Wednesday recommended that Ceasar's casino be shut
down for an undetermined period for violating equal opportunity and
anti-discrimination provisions of the Casino Control Act, New
Jersey law and the federal Civil Rights Act.
   An administrative law judge ruled in August that Caesars ``did
not abide by its guarantee of equal employment opportunity for
all.''
   The judge ordered the casino to pay $15,600 in fines _ the
amount the high roller lost at the gaming tables. The fine, like
the suspension that was recommended Thursday, must be approved by
the Casino Control Commission.
   The ruling stemmed from a discrimination complaint the DGE filed
against Caesars in June 1988, charging that on several occasions
the gaming hall removed black and female employees from a craps pit
at the request of Robert Libutti of Saddle River.
   Libutti was also involved in allegations made against Trump
Plaza, according an official quoted in this morning's editions of
The Record of Hackensack.
   Trump Plaza exhibited ``a pattern of discriminatory behavior''
between May 1986 and May 1988 by ordering minority dealers not to
work at certain craps pits on a number of occasions when Libutti
played there, said Frederic Gushin, a deputy attorney general
assigned to the state Division of Gaming Enforcement.
   Both Parrillo and Gushin said gaming officials do not know
whether the casino's actions came after a specific request from
Libutti or a perception of his tastes.
   But in the Trump Plaza case, ``it became so pervasive that every
time a minority was scheduled to deal with Libutti, they were
moved,'' Gushin said.
   Caesars attorney Gregory Parliman said Thursday that ``what
occurred was an aberration. Caesars does not have practices that
are discriminatory.'' Immediately after an employee told top
management about the problem, several days after the May 13
incident, Caesars changed its procedures, he said.
   Trump Plaza President Jack O'Donnell did not immediately return
a message left at his office this morning seeking comment. Libutti
could not be immediately reached; there was no telephone listing
under his name in Saddle River.

<TEXT>
   The White House said today President Bush will
support a new attempt on Capitol Hill to get a pay raise for
members of Congress, federal officials and judges.
   ``We're just waiting for them to give us a package,'' press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. ``We'll be supportive if the
Congress produces any reasonable proposal.''
   Fitzwater said Bush would like to see any pay raise tied to a
package of ethical standards that would prohibit lawmakers from
accepting honoraria _ fees for speeches, public appearances and
writing.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., met with Bush on Wednesday to discuss pay
raises, Fitzwater said.
   Foley and Michel both back a pay raise proposal, made by a
bipartisan task force, which would phase in a 35 percent salary
boost over two years, according to congressional aides. The plan
also would include changes in Congress' ethics rules, including new
restrictions on members' speaking honoraria.
   A Democratic leadership aide said today that ``no final decision
has been made'' on moving a pay raise this year, but the meeting
with Bush was sought because ``president once was.''
   She said some of the criticism has been unjust, but also said
her agency would be increasingly vigilant in assessing proposed
mergers and in reviewing its own policies.
   Rill said the Justice Department would take similar measures.
   ``While I have no intention of a major revision of the (merger)
guidelines, I want to know if, in practice, the division's merger
standards are conducive to consistent and reliable results,'' he
said.
   ``The fact is that antitrust is critical to the well-being of
the American economy, and plays a vital role in the governing
process,'' Rill said. ``Policies may evolve, and emphasizes change,
but the voice of competition cannot be quieted.''
   A key part in the antitrust agenda will be supporting tougher
criminal penalties. Rill noted that antitrust fines cannot exceed
$1 million for corporate violators.
   Rill said he supports proposed legislation that would raise the
maximum to $10 million ``for corporate felons.''
   ``The current statutory maximum fines do not present a
sufficient deterent to antitrust crime.'' Rill also said the
Justice Department will pursue criminal enforcement against more
industries and he singled out health care providers.
   ``Health care providers have always been subject to antitrust
jurisdiction and investigation, but they have rarely been
prosecuted,'' he said. ``This has led to a complacency within the
profession that cannot be permitted to persist.''
   The Justice Department also will pay increased attention to
competition in recently deregulated industries, Rill said.
   Under new federal rules, for example, airlines have become
subject to essentially the same antitrust laws that govern other
industries.
   Rill said that his office has already taken an active stance
toward proposed ventures between airline companies and, in some
cases, the mergers were abandoned. As an example, he noted that the
Justice Department opposed plans by Eastern Airlines to sell
airport gates in Philadelphia to USAir, and consequently Eastern
abandoned the plan and sold the gates to Midway Airlines.

   A botanist has begun a two-to-three-week
stay inside an airtight, steel-and-glass enclosure that with its
own ecosystem and atmosphere is a possible prototype for space
colonization.
   Linda Leigh on Thursday became the third person to stay inside
the 17,000-cubic foot test module. One colleague spent three days
in it in September 1988 and another scientist spent five days in
March.
   Ms. Leigh plans to celebrate her 39th birthday nine days from
today by baking a sorghum cake in a microwave oven in the habitat's
efficiency kitchen.
   After she spends two weeks inside, the experimenters will
evaluate whether to continue toward a 21-day goal.
   The scientists are testing systems designed for Biosphere II, a
$30 million private venture scheduled to begin next September in
which four men and four women will live for two years in a much
larger sealed structure.
   In that facility, covering about 2.5 acres, all their plant and
animal food will be grown and all air, water and wastes recycled.
   ``Adventure, science and teamwork _ these are the three reasons
I'm working on Biosphere II,'' said Ms. Leigh, director of
terrestrial design for the project.
   Biosphere II's 600- by 160-foot structure will include some
3,800 species of carefully selected plants and animals in five
ecosystems, ranging from desert to marshlands, ocean, savannah and
rain forest. It is being built on a ranch about 30 miles north of
Tucson by an organization called Space Biosphere Ventures.

   The Senate today removed U.S. District Judge
Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi from the bench on impeachment
charges stemming from a perjury conviction.
   Nixon was the second judge in two weeks removed from office
through impeachment.
   With Nixon watching from his seat on the Senate floor, lawmakers
sealed his fate by voting 89-8 to convict him on the first of three
articles of impeachment. Senators quickly followed by approving a
second charge, 78-19, but acquitted him on a third. The vote on
that was 57-40, less than the necessary two-thirds of those voting.
   Defense attorney David Stewart put his arm around Nixon as the
secretary of the Senate read the names of senators voting guilty.
The judge closed his eyes as the list grew longer and longer.
   The 61-year-old Nixon was convicted of perjury in 1986 for lying
to a grand jury about his unofficial talk with a prosecutor in a
marijuana-smuggling case. He served more than a year in prison and
in recent weeks was moved to a New Orleans halfway house.
   He has been collecting his 89,500 salary and saying he would
like to return to the bench to preside over trials.
   ``We fought the fight for 5{ years because we know we are not
guilty of anything and we don't feel like it,'' Nixon told
reporters outside the Capitol after the vote as he held hands with
his wife, Barbara, and his daughter, Courtney.
   ``We can hold our heads high because we are innocent ... We have
to go home and talk about things and get on with our lives,'' he
said.
   Nixon was charged in the first impeachment article with lying to
a federal grand jury in 1984 by saying that then-District Attorney
Paul Holmes of Forrest County, Miss., never discussed a
drug-smuggling case with him.
   He was accused in the second article of lying to the grand jury
by saying he was never involved in the marijuana-smuggling case.
   The Senate convicted him on those two articles.
   The final article accused him of lying to a Justice Department
attorney and an FBI agent as well as to the grand jury. The charge
said he ``undermined the confidence in the integrity of the
judiciary and disobeyed the laws of the United States.'' On that
article he was acquitted.
   Nixon became the seventh official ever removed from office
through impeachment and the third judge in the last three years.
   Before voting on the impeachment articles, senators rejected
90-7 a move by Nixon to bring witnesses to the Senate floor. They
also turned down, 63-34, a Nixon request to drop one of the charges.
   Senators were sworn to secrecy about the specifics of a six-hour
closed-door debate Thursday on the impeachment articles.
   ``It was thorough, it was courteous,'' Sen Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
said after the debate session.
   Only two weeks ago the Senate ousted Alcee L. Hastings from the
U.S. District Court bench in Miami.
   Hastings was the first official ever removed through impeachment
after being acquitted of the same charge in a criminal trial.
   The impeachment articles against Nixon were approved May 10 by
the House, 417-0.
   Throughout the case, Nixon has said the witnesses against him
lied and that overzealous prosecutors unfairly expected his grand
jury testimony to be perfectly accurate.
   He was convicted in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury in
denying that he talked with Holmes about the case of Drew
Fairchild, the son of a wealthy contractor. He served more than a
year of a five-year sentence at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida
before being moved to the New Orleans halfway house.
   Investigators said Drew Fairchild's father, Wiley Fairchild,
provided Nixon with a lucrative oil and gas investment. But Nixon
was acquitted at his 1986 trial of accepting an illegal gratuity.

<HEAD>Board Game Takes on Subject of Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new board game sold in the Israeli-occupied
territories challenges players with army roadblocks, raids, curfews
and settler attacks that leads to an independent Palestinian state
led by Yasser Arafat.
   But in ``The Intefadeh Game,'' the way is no less circuitous
than in the real ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, that has been going on
for the past 22 months in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The first instruction is a warning telling players they must go
back two spaces if the roll of the dice lands them at an Israeli
army checkpoint.
   Then the player is faced with the small triumphs and, more
often, large setbacks that could occur in the typical Palestinian
village represented in the board's circular pattern.
   _ ``A (Palestinian) flag is raised on your street: Go forward
four spaces.''
   _ ``The army suspects you. Your house is destroyed. Go back to
start.''
   While the game takes a sometimes light approach to a deadly
serious subject, Palestinian psychologist Nadira Kevorkian says
this is not necessarily an unhealthy reaction to the violence of
the uprising.
   ``The game is another way of crying out and letting out the
depression without fear,'' she said. ``What is different about the
game from real life is that it can be played without fear, without
being frightened by the army.''
   The Jerusalem psychologist said playing the game could relieve
tension, must as games do in other places. But she added that the
game's ironic humor also could reflect a ``chaos'' in Palestinian
values brought about by the daily violence.
   The game is seen as the Palestinian answer to an Israeli
computer game introduced earlier this year in which soldiers battle
stone-throwing Palestinians, braving both firebombs and criticism
in world public opinion.
   ``The Intefadeh Game,'' crudely made on a simple slab of
cardboard, first appeared in the West Bank city of Ramallah, eight
miles north of Jerusalem.
   It is being sold by Palestinian activists and whatever profit is
gained from the cost of $7.50 is donated to the town of Beit
Sahour, where residents have had property confiscated for
boycotting Israeli taxes.
   The woman who developed the game said she thought it would be
``a good and amusing idea,'' but added that it turned out to
reflect too closely the uncertainties of the uprising.
   ``When you see the game, it's very sad,'' she said. ``It still
remains a game.''
   The woman, a French citizen, asked that her name not be used for
fear of trouble with Israeli authorities. She said she hoped
Israelis would buy the game since it could tell them something
about life in the occupied territories.
   Dozens of the games have been sold in English, Arabic, French
and Hebrew versions, she said, adding that it is being translated
into German and Norwegian.
   While the game is nationalistic in tone, it is also pacifistic.
   Players go forward when Israeli peace advocates hold
demonstrations or government officials meet with the PLO. They must
go back when Palestinian protesters or soldiers are killed.
   The game, which can take several hours to complete, is not
without its humor. A lucky player can land on the space that says:
``A miracle! The soldiers at the checkpoint are asleep! Go forward
two places.''
   Then there is victory, an oval at the board's center picturing a
crowd waving Palestinian flags. ``Palestine is independent,'' it
says. ``Arafat enters Ramallah.''

   An American nun who disappeared from a retreat
house in Guatemala after receiving a series of threatening letters
returned to her convent today unharmed, U.S. officials said.
   The officials said they had not been informed of the
circumstances of Sister Diana Ortiz's disappearance. After her
return, she was being interviewed by a U.S. consular officer in
Guatemala.
   Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio said in an interview late
Thursday in Guatemala that the 31-year-old nun, a member of the
Ursuline order, had gone into the garden of the Belene Sisters
Retreat House, a former convent in the town of Antigua, on Thursday
and ``she did not return at lunch time.''
   The archbishop said the nun probably had been watched and then
was kidnapped from the courtyard without anyone noticing. She had
been attending classes at the house, he said.
   Since mid-July, Guatemala has been suffering from a resurgence
of the assassinations, disappearances and other violence that
claimed tens of thousands of lives in the late 1970s and early
1980s. A leading Christian Democratic politician, a prominent
banker and students have been among its victims.
   The extreme right, with traditional links to the military, is
being blamed by some observers for the most of the violence.
   Ortiz had been threatened several times while teaching
kindergarten for more than a year in San Miguel Acatan, in
Huehuetenango province, 225 miles northwest of Guatemala City, the
archbishop said.
   A native of Grants, N.M., she had taught school in Owensboro and
Hawesville, Ky., before going to Guatemala two years ago.
   National police in Antigua, 28 miles west of Guatemala City,
would not comment on the case. The national police office in
Guatemala City said it had no information.
   In Louisville, Ky., The Courier-Journal quoted Sister Mary
Elizabeth Dallard, who worked with Ortiz, as saying Ortiz had
received at least seven letters since January warning her to leave
the country.
   After an incident in Guatemala City in mid-July, she did leave
for a time, said the sister, of the Mount St. Joseph Ursuline
Sisters of Maple Mount, Ky.
   ``A man she didn't know called her by name, took her arm and
sort of forced her to walk with him while he talked,'' The
Courier-Journal quoted Dallard as saying. ``He knew where she
worked and told her to leave.''
   A stronger threat came on Oct. 12, about a month after she
returned to Guatemala, Dallard said.
   ``Violent words, such as `decapitated,' `assassinated' and
`rape,' were cut out of the paper and pasted on a paper,'' she
said. The paper was put under the door of her room at a convent in
Guatemala City.
   Ortiz had asked her to keep the letters in case they were ever
needed as evidence, Dallard said.
   Dallard returned to Kentucky because her father died and planned
to return to Guatemala on Saturday.
   The archbishop said Sister Patricia Denny, 54, of the Maryknoll
order, left the country in mid-October after receiving repeated
death threats.
   The archbishop, who led a peace march of 15,000 children on
Saturday, said he would ask the government to try to locate the
missing nun.

<HEAD>`Meet Me in St. Louis,' An Old-New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics' comments. No PMs planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some golden oldies of the stage and screen are
best left undisturbed, particularly if they are going to be
repackaged in wrapping that smothers the charm of the original.
   A case in point is ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' the old-new musical
that opened Thursday at Broadway's Gershwin Theater. It is a
relentlessly old-fashioned show, not only because of its subject
matter, but because the production is frozen in the cheery,
complacent and cardboard style of Broadway song-and-dance that
flourished in the mid-1950s.
   It's reminiscent of those undemanding, undistinguished shows of
yore, the kind that had big, expensive sets, pretty costumes,
athletic dancing, maybe a star or two and a couple of hummable
tunes. But what may have been, let's say, the best musical of 1953,
has a tougher time on Broadway 1989.
   The musical has its charms, primarily a sweet-singing young
woman named Donna Kane in what used to be called the ingenue role.
In the tradition of Barbara Cook, Florence Henderson, Susan Watson
and others, Kane is bright and, dare we say it, perky. She floats
effortlessly through the score written by Hugh Martin and Ralph
Blane. And the production looks good, thanks to designer Keith
Anderson's opulent, ever-gliding sets.
   But much of the material, spoken and sung, seems second-hand and
as emotionally involving as a saccharine greeting card. The musical
itself comes from an amalgam of sources. It's based on Sally
Benson's ``Kensington Stories'' in The New Yorker, the classic MGM
film starring Judy Garland and another stage incarnation _ also
with music by Martin and Blane _ which was done at the St. Louis
Municipal Opera in the early 1960s.
   This latest version, adapted by Hugh Wheeler before he died in
1987, faithfully follows the plot of the movie. It tells of the
Smith family, circa 1903, which lives in St. Louis right before the
opening of the big Louisiana Purchase Exposition.
   The big development of Act 1 is daughter Esther's attempt to be
noticed by the Boy Next Door, which also is the title of Martin and
Blane's best song. The second act concerns Papa Smith's attempt to
move his family to New York, a decision resisted by everyone in the
clan. For humor, there's little Tootie, the family's youngest
daughter who decapitates her dolls and buries them in the backyard.
   That's not exactly a barn-burner of a plot, so director Louis
Burke and his production team have filled the show with movement
and a lot of dance. Some of it works, particularly the way the
Victorian gingerbread home of the Smith family swirls and glides
into place. And the famous trolley of ``The Trolley Song'' fame
does indeed go clang-clang as it careens around the large Gershwin
stage.
   At other times, all that movement is just an exercise in killing
time. Joan Brickhill's choreography is upbeat, endless and
derivative, particularly a banjo number that suggests the musical
``Half a Sixpence'' and a Sousa march that could have the audience
wondering whether they are watching the finale of ``The Music Man.''
   Martin and Blane's best songs are left over from the Garland
movie. Besides ``The Boy Next Door,'' they include ``Have Yourself
a Merry Little Christmas'' and ``The Trolley Song.''
   ``You Are for Loving,'' a soaring love song from the Muny Opera
version, is the best of the newer numbers. But the other additions
range from pleasant to awful. In the latter category is ``Ice,'' a
hymn to ice-skating that includes the line, ``Ice is nice.''
   George Hearn plays the authoritarian father. He has little to do
but stand there and be stern. He does it quite well. Milo O'Shea as
the kindly grandfather and Betty Garrett as the Irish maid have
their own forgettable musical numbers _ he a little soft shoe, she
an Irish jig _ which they could probably phone in from home.
   Besides Donna Kane, the younger performers include Jason
Workman, in sterling voice and appropriately awkward manner as the
boy next door; Juliet Lambert as her equally lovestruck older
sister; Michael O'Steen as her pompous, Princeton-bound brother;
and an excessively aggressive Courtney Peldon as the unstoppable
Tootie.
   The production also runs on too long, more than two hours and 30
minutes. Director Burke and designer Anderson can pad the show with
fireworks, ice-skating, water fountains that spurt real water and
that ever-clanging trolley, but they can't disguise the fact that
``Meet Me in St. Louis'' never has much more than nostalgia going
for it.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: What's the mission of the stage
replica at the Gershwin Theater? To spread the good will earned by
the overture, I guess. And that task, if not a lot else is
accomplished by this lavish show despite such obstacles as insipid
acting, an inane book and a complete lack of originality.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: Maybe it's the onset of middle age,
but I found ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' an unexpected delight. There
are dull stretches, songs that don't really pay off, a bit too much
moving of scenery, but if the show doesn't charm you, your heart
must be even harder than a theater critic's.
   Linda Winer, Newsday: ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a $6 million
stage version of the MGM movie, opened at the Gershwin Theater last
night, leaving no cliche undecorated. This is a bankrupt idea with
a major bankroll _ a contradiction that amounts to very, very fancy
summer stock.

   Thousands of people pushed past
police barricades today and rallied outside a military post,
demanding that the body of former President Ferdinand Marcos be
buried on Philippine soil.
   A crowd estimated by police at about 25,000 gathered to denounce
President Corazon Aquino for blocking the return of Marcos' body.
It was the largest show of support for the former president in
years and came on the eve of Mrs. Aquino's trip to Canada and the
United States, where she hopes to convince business leaders that
her country is stable for investment.
   Among those participating were Vice President Salvador Laurel,
opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and other former officials of the
Marcos administration.
   Protesters defied police orders and marched to Camp Crame,
headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary military police force,
and nearby Camp Aguinaldo, the armed forces headquarters.
   Police blocked the road about a mile from the camps, but the
protesters pushed through, and several thousand reached the gate of
Camp Crame.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, a senior military commander, agreed
to let them rally at the gate because he said the crowd was too big
to disperse. Later, the military said the rally must end but it
made no move toward the protesters.
   By late Friday the crowd estimated at 15,000 people refused to
disperse by midnight (11 a.m. EST), but their leaders then
negotiated an agreement to leave at 5:30 a.m. Saturday (4:30 p.m.
EST Friday).
   Armed troops stood guard. Several firetrucks were brought into
the garrison, apparently to disperse protesters if they tried to
storm the camp.
   Riot police on one truck flashed the ``V-for-Victory'' sign,
associated here with the Marcos movement. Marcos supporters chanted
``Thank you, Thank you!''
   Marcos died Sept. 28 in Honolulu, where he had lived since being
ousted in a 1986 civilian-military uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino
to power.
   In a statement broadcast by pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, the
late president's son, Ferdinand Jr., said the demonstration was a
reaction to the ``arrogance'' of the Aquino administration.''
   ``I congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageous
actions,'' the statement said. ``You show to the world, although we
are a moderate, patient people, we Filipinos will not compromise
principles.''
   The rally in suburban Quezon City climaxed an 11-day march from
Marcos' home province, Ilocos Norte, to demand that Mrs. Aquino
allow Marcos' body to be buried here.
   The crowd cheered wildly as Laurel asked: ``Do you agree that
Marcos' body must be allowed home?''
   ``It is now very clear what the people want,'' Laurel said.
``You are a very powerful force. The government must follow the
peoples' will. If not, you know what to do.''
   He described the ban on the return of Marcos' body as ``the
worst mistake'' Mrs. Aquino had made in office.
   Although vice president, Laurel resigned as foreign secretary in
1987 because of policy differences with Mrs. Aquino. Last May,
Laurel and Enrile reorganized the Nacionalista party as the major
center-right opposition movement and have been seeking support from
Marcos' supporters.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Gen. Renato de Villa ordered
soldiers not to join the protest. Marcos still enjoys support among
the rank-and-file of the 160,000-member armed forces.
   The crowd was the largest mustered in Manila by the loyalists
since rallies in 1986 shortly after Marcos was overthrown and
forced into exile. In recent months, crowds at loyalist rallies
have numbered only a few hundred.
   March organizers appealed to Filipinos to join the protest as a
gesture of dissatisfaction with the Aquino government.
   Protesters distributed handbills warning that the nation was
facing civil unrest by the Communists. It urged people to stock up
on food, water and essentials as well as enough cash to buy tickets
``to a safe haven for your family.''
   On Oct. 27, the Supreme Court upheld Mrs. Aquino's ban, which
also prevents Marcos' widow, Imelda, and their three children from
returning. The court ruled 8-7 that the return of the family would
endanger national security.
   Last year, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Marcos and
his wife on racketeering charges in connection with the alleged
looting of the Philippine treasury during his 20-year
administration.
   Imelda Marcos was freed on $5 million bail and is to stand trial
in March.

   Federal regulators may stop allowing
parents to carry very young children on their laps for free during
airplane flights in the wake of the July 19 crash that killed 112
people, an official said today.
   Donnell Pollard, the Federal Aviation Administration's cabin
safety specialist, said the agency expects to make a recommendation
to the U.S. Transportation Department by the end of the year.
   Testifying on the fourth and final day of National
Transportation Safety Board hearings on the United Airlines crash,
she said the agency might propose requiring separate child
restraing seats for infants, but that she is not sure it will go
that far.
   ``We're considering a lot of factors,'' she testified. ``I guess
I could summarize it by saying we're looking at practically every
aspect that anybody could think of.''
   Five children under 2 were carried on adult laps aboard the
DC-10, and one of them, a 23-month-old, died, hearing documents
said. In all, 184 people survived the crash.
   Ms. Pollard acknowledged that there is a danger in bringing an
infant aboard a plane without a separate seat and child restraint
device. But she said economic reasons have contributed to FAA
regulations that require separate seats only for passengers older
than 24 months.
   ``We have indications from the public that they like the option
of not having to purchase a seat for children under the age of
two,'' she said.
   Most airlines allow parents who do not purchase tickets for
infants to put those infants in vacant seats, if any are available.
However, most of the airlines do not provide child restraint seats
similar to those most states now require for automobiles.
   Ms. Pollard said the FAA issued an advisory in 1985 that
recommends _ but does not require _ use of child restraint seats in
airliners.
   ``The FAA's position for a number of years has strongly been
that infants be restrained in a child restraint system,'' she said.
   The investigation of the crash centers on the rear engine fan
disk that split apart in midair, severing hydraulic lines that
enable the pilot to control the airplane. The crew managed to
manipulate the plane to the Sioux City airport but it crashed on
landing.
   Preliminary NTSB studies of the titanium fan disk that split
have detected a tiny crack. Officials of General Electric Co., the
part's maker, said this week that the crack existed when the disk
was last examined by United Airlines in February 1988.
   United Airlines officials said the examination detected no
crack. Since the crash, the FAA has ordered more extensive testing
of disks on existing DC-10s.
   On Thursday, questions about the origin of the defective part
were raised further, when officials testified during the third day
of the federal safety board's hearing that a GE bookkeeping mixup
had resulted in two fan disks with the same serial number, that of
the disk on United Flight 232.
   While one of the disks was found to be faulty during its
manufacture in 1971, another disk with the same serial number was
supposed to be sent on for installation in a DC-10 engine.
   James Tucker, general manager of the engineering department at
GE's Evendale, Ohio, plant that makes the disks, testified he is
certain the disks were not interchanged.
   But D.B. Robinson, a regional accident investigator for the Air
Line Pilots Association, told reporters Thursday he had his doubts
that the faulty disk did not get into production.
   Dale Warren, a vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co., the
McDonnell Douglas unit that made the DC-10, said company engineers
would implement changes beginning next March in the 429 DC-10s
still in operation.
   In the July 19 crash, an explosion in the plane's rear engine
severed all three hydraulic lines and left the plane virtually
uncontrollable as its pilot brought it in for an emergency landing
at the Sioux City airport.
   Warren said the improvements to shut off individual hydraulic
lines and regulate the flow of hydraulic fluid will be implemented
despite company projections that the engine explosion was a
billion-in-one occurrence.
   Hydraulic lines operate controls on a plane's rudder, wings and
tail. Warren said it is possible to control a DC-10's flight with
just one of the three hydraulic lines in operation. He said the
improvements designed by the company, although not yet tested
aboard a plane, appear to virtually guarantee that a similar
explosion would not destroy all three hydraulic lines.
   ``In every way we find that, it looks good,'' Warren told the
safety board.

   A former engineer at the troubled Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant who was fired after repeatedly pointing
out safety hazards there has lost his lawsuit against Rockwell
International.
   Jefferson County District Judge Kenneth Barnhill dismissed the
lawsuit on Wednesday without submitting it to the jury, even though
the jury had listened to a week of testimony.
   Before the trial began, Barnhill significantly narrowed the
suit's scope, ruling that attorneys for Jim Stone had not
established that Rockwell violated Stone's employment contract when
he was terminated in 1986.
   Rockwell countered that Stone was let go as part of a layoff
program, and that the firing was not related to his complaints.
   Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, located 16 miles northwest of
Denver, is the only U.S. weapons plant that makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons. Rockwell International operates the
facility for the Department of Energy.
   Rockwell officials said they were not surprised by the ruling in
their favor.
   ``This is the position that Rockwell has taken since the
beginning,'' said company spokesman Pat Etchart. ``We are not
surprised that the judge agreed with it.''
   Stone is credited with supplying some of the information that
led to an FBI raid on Rocky Flats in June and a subsequent grand
jury investigation into alleged waste storage and disposal
violations. He said he would appeal the judge's decision.
   Earlier this year, Barnhill ruled that Stone could not sue for
wrongful discharge, denying Stone the right to allow testimony
about Stone's complaints and how the criticism alienated his
superiors. Barnhill limited the case to a question of whether
Stone's contract was violated.
   Hartley Alley, Stone's attorney, said Barnhill ruled that
nothing in Stone's contract precluded Rockwell from retaliating
against Stone, but that doesn't mean it was right.
   ``We felt it was an injustice,'' Alley said. ``We're confident
that if it could go to the jury, we would prevail.''

<TEXT>
   After more than two years of testimony,
jurors have began deliberations in the McMartin preschool
molestation trial dealing with the alleged rape of children and
satanic rituals.
   The longest-running criminal case in U.S. history has lingered
in the courts in various stages for nearly six years and cost
taxpayers more than $15 million.
   ``It seems like a historic moment but I'm too tired to enjoy
it,'' Superior Court Judge William Pounders said Thursday after the
jurors adjourned to select a foreman and begin deliberations. ``All
of the jurors are present on a day I think you may have felt would
never arrive.''
   Jurors resumed deliberations this morning.
   The McMartin investigation ignited a wave of hysteria about
child molestation, in Southern California and nationally. It set
the standard for widespread fear among working parents that their
children might not be safe in the private schools they picked to
care for them.
   During the weeks in early 1984 that allegations about abuse at
the McMartin school blossomed, a rash of reports of child
molestation at other day-care centers surfaced.
   A jury of 12, plus six alternates began the trial in April 1987.
Since then, job problems and illness plagued the jury, leaving the
bare dozen panelists needed to deliberate and avoid a mistrial.
   The case began in August 1983 when Judy Johnson, mother of a
child at the school called Manhattan Beach police. She told the
department's sex abuse and juvenile investigator that her son's
bottom was red and that he had spoken of a man named Ray who worked
at the school.
   When they were indicted in 1984, prosecutors alleged Raymond
Buckey, his mother, sister, grandmother and three other female
teachers had molested hundreds of children at the school during a
five-year period.
   Children gave investigators accounts of satanic rites and
animals tortured to frighten them into silence.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office took over the
investigation, and sent nearly 400 children who had attended the
school at various times to be interviewed by counselors at
Children's Institute International, an agency for abused and
neglected children.
   Based on the interviews, prosecutors initially concluded that
hundreds of acts of child abuse had occurred at the school founded
in 1958 by Virginia McMartin, grandmother of Raymond Buckey and
mother of Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   Virginia McMartin, elderly and confined to a wheelchair, was
among the seven staff members arrested in February 1984. Charges
later were dropped against her and four other defendants because
District Attorney Ira Reiner deemed that the charges against them
constituted ``an incredibly weak'' case.
   When the case finally came to trial, the focus of the
prosecution had narrowed. What had originally been hundreds of
counts of child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared
count of conspiracy between Raymond Buckey and his mother.

<HEAD>Court Says Trio May Be Prosecuted in Capitol Bombing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today reversed a
ruling that had barred the prosecution of three people for bombing
the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings in 1983 and 1984.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals decided that a lower court erred when
it said the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment
prohibited the prosecution of Susan Rosenberg, Timothy Blunk and
Alan Berkman in the bombings.
   The three had been convicted in previous trials in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey of conspiracy to possess unregistered firearms,
explosives and false identification. They subsequently were
indicted in Washington, D.C., for the bombings of the government
buildings.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene ruled that the double jeopardy
clause barred the subsequent prosecution because the government
planned to use the same actual evidence that it had used in the
previous trials.
   The appeals court reversed the finding ``because we find no
support for the use of a `same actual evidence' test in assessing
whether successive prosecutions violate the double jeopardy
clause.''
   ``The government is not precluded from prosecuting ... for the
Washington bombings on a theory of liability of aiding and abetting
or on a theory of direct participation in the bombing,'' said the
opinion written by judge Abner Mikva. ``Nor is it precluded from
using any evidence introduced at earlier trials.''
   A late-night blast on Nov. 7, 1983, blew out windows and damaged
a hallway outside the Senate chamber. No injuries were reported.
   A group named the Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility.
The group said the bombing was in support of all nations, including
Grenada and Lebanon, struggling against the United States.
   Criminal charges are pending against four others in the bombings
and proceedings have been delayed during the appeals court case.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union joined
for the first time today to sponsor a General Assembly resolution
calling on all nations to respect human rights and abandon the use
of force except in defense.
   The resolution urges all nations to uphold the principles of the
U.N. Charter, but offered no specific proposals. Participants in
the joint news conference stressed the symbolic value of
U.S.-Soviet cooperation on political principles.
   ``Perhaps the most important thing about this resolution is not
its specific language, but what it symbolizes as a new beginning at
the United Nations _ a new spirit of constructive cooperation,''
said a joint U.S.-Soviet statement.
   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State John Bolton said ``The
resolution is not the alpha and omega of all issues. I like to
think it is the alpha, however.''
   The resolution calls on all nations to work cooperatively
through the United Nations to ensure international peace and
security and honor its Charter.
   It particularly calls on all nations to ``respect the principles
of sovereign equality, political independence and territorial
integrity of states, and non-intervention in foreign affairs.''
   The resolution also calls on nations to ``refrain from the
threat or use of force inconsistent with the Charter,'' which
permits only self-defense, and to ``peacefully settle disputes.''
   Nations should ``adhere to the principles of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms, cooperation among states.''
   The resolution will go directly to the whole General Assembly,
where passage is guaranteed, Bolton said.

   Three motorists given speeding tickets
sent the St. Clair Circuit Clerk thousands of pennies, and the

   Workers opened three heavy boxes Thursday to find thousands of
loose pennies, said Circuit Clerk C. Barney Metz. Each box
contained $50 in pennies and the citations.
   ``It was very disgusting to me. We are merely processing the
paperwork. We had nothing to do with the ticket,'' Metz said
Friday. ``I will not accept it as payment. They can come and pack
them up or they can send me the money.''
   Dixon B. Callahan, 22, and twin brothers Terry M. Grant, 23, and
Gary Grant, all of Chatsworth, Ga., who were driving separate
vehicles, were given the tickets Oct. 20 by an officer using radar,
officials said.
   The three, who were returning from a hunting trip in Colorado,
have until Dec. 12 to make payment or face losing their driver's
licenses, Metz said.

   This tiny principality wants to join
the big boys.
   Liechtenstein, which on many maps is not much bigger than the
famous postage stamps it exports, said Friday it plans to seek full
membership in the United Nations next year.
   If the world body accepts the 63-square-mile principality _ it
could fit inside the District of Columbia _ Liechtenstein would
replace the 100-square-mile nation of St. Kitts-Nevis in the
Caribbean as the smallest in the United Nations.
   Nestled in a mountain valley between Switzerland and Austria,
Liechtenstein is known as a tax haven and skier's paradise, has the
highest per capital income in Europe, no unemployment among its
28,000 people, and a coalition government that has lasted half a
century.
   Export-oriented industries produce goods ranging from false
teeth to protective coatings for the windows of space vehicles. Its
tax-saving ``letter box companies'' are of great value to
foreigners.
   Crown Prince Hans Adam owns half of a farming and ranching
partnership in Texas that controls 76,500 acres in one county and
more land elsewhere. Liechtenstein covers something over 40,000
acres.
   It already is a member of several U.N. agencies, including the
World Health Organization and International Court of Justice,
belongs to the Council of Europe and is a signatory to the 1975
Helsinki agreements on security and cooperation in Europe.
   A government statement said Liechtenstein would seek full U.N.
membership by the end of 1990. The world organization now has 159
members and, depending on when Namibia joins, the the Alpine
principality would be No. 160 or 161.
   The government said it views full membership in the United
Nations as the best way to ensure international recognition for
Liechtenstein as a sovereign state.
   If Parliament approves the membership application, the
government will submit a formal request to U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   U.N. membership it is open to any ``peace-loving'' country. A
country must apply to the Security Council. When it recommends the
new member, the application is sent to the General Assembly, which
must approve it by a two-thirds majority vote.
   A U.N. spokesman on Friday refused to comment on Liechtenstein's
chances.

   On the eve of a sold-out Rolling Stones
concert, a much-used pedestrian walkway to the Oakland Coliseum has
been closed because of structural damage from the Oct. 17
earthquake.
   Fans attending the concerts Saturday and Sunday afternoons will
be transported by shuttle buses from the Bay Area Rapid Transit
System's Coliseum station to the Coliseum.
   Shuttle buses also will take fans to the Golden State Warriors'
first regular-season home basketball game Saturday night, said Sy
Mouber, BART spokesman.
   Following the quake, engineers had said the walkway was damaged
and couldn't bear crowds. Still, the walkway stayed open for an
Oct. 25 Warriors pre-season game. But barriers had been placed to
limit the number of users.
   Coliseum officials Thursday ordered the walkway closed because
of an anticipated 15,000 BART riders for each concert this weekend.
   ``We're just more concerned because of the larger numbers of
people using the facility,'' said Coliseum President George
Vukasin. He said he believes the walkway can be fixed in a matter
of weeks.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the superpowers profess to
have no fear of a reunited Germany, Europeans on both sides of the
East-West divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact lawmakers who met in Bonn this week to
discuss political changes indicated that Europeans, afraid of the
rise of a new dominant power on the continent, may be more
comfortable with two Germanys.
   East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, quashed the prospect of a
reunited Germany in the near future when he said in Moscow that
``division is an element of our European security.''
   But West German officials and scholars say the mass
demonstrations sweeping the Communist state could lead to the kinds
of reforms that would allow East Germans to reconsider their
separate status.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Friday, after his
two-day visit to Bonn, that the issue of reunification ``will
dominate the end of the century.''
   The East German state under Communist Party control ``has never
been accepted by the people,'' said Burkhard Dobiey, head of the
German Policy department of the federal Inter-German Affairs
Ministry in Bonn.
   ``If they decide that as Germans they would like to be with us,
for instance, we have to accept that. This is in our Constitution.''
   Dobiey's comments came during a three-day discussion between
lawmakers from the East and West sponsored by the North Atlantic
Assembly, an advisory body to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The long-dormant idea of a reunified Germany has been
revitalized in recent months by the flight of tens of thousands of
East Germans disillusioned with conditions in their country.
   The developments in East Germany and their consequences for
hopes of a reunified Germany were the focal points of Mitterrand's
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``No responsible politician in Europe can ponder the future
without taking this into consideration,'' Mitterrand said of the
reunification debate. ``It is a phenomenon that will dominate the
end of this century.
   ``It will go quickly, very quickly, but maybe not so quickly as
many would like,'' he added in a clear reference to West German
conservatives.
   President Bush said in an interview with The New York Times last
week that he doesn't ``share the concern that some European
countries have about a reunified Germany.''
   But European parliamentarians at the East-West discussions
showed some discomfort. They pressed the West Germans to explain
their intentions.
   ``We are very much concerned about the impact the rapprochement
of the two Germanys might have on the European Community,'' said
Loic Bouvard, a French parliament member.
   Pieter Maris of the Netherlands' parliament noted the thorny
problems of bringing together two Germanys belonging to opposite
political and defense camps. He asked the West Germans to explain
what they see as ``the last step.''
   West European unease with talk of reunification likely reflects
concern about the emergence of an overpowering economy as much as
security questions.
   Joining the two states would boost the population to more than
75 million, and expand the industrial base of what is already
Europe's strongest economy, West Germany.
   Some East European states, such as Czechoslovakia, view efforts
at reunification as a drive powered by a revengeful spirit on the
part of the Germans to reclaim territory lost in World War II.
   The Kremlin, however, has signaled through envoys abroad it
would pose no barriers to East Germany's departure from the Warsaw
Pact if the populace so decided.
   ``Everything is up to the Germans,'' the daily newspaper Die
Welt quoted Nikolai Shishlin, head of the Communist Party Central
Committee's East European department, as saying.
   The newspaper also quoted Yevgeny Primakov, head of the lower
house of the Supreme Soviet, as telling CBS News the Kremlin has no
objections to the departure of any of its allies from the Warsaw
Pact.
   Istvan Gyarmati, a deputy foreign minister of Hungary and a
negotiator at the Vienna-based conventional arms talks, said
Europeans would accept reunification if existing military blocs
were dissolved.
   Jerzy Golaczynski, head of the national defense committee in
Poland's parliament, said his nation recognizes the right of both
East Germany and West Germany to determine their own futures.
   ``But it has been made clear at this conference that
reunification is not just a concern for Germany, but for all of
Europe and the world,'' Golaczynski said. ``The concerns of
Germany's neighbors must also be kept in view.''
   While Poland and West Germany have made major advancements in
their relations recently, and Kohl will visit Warsaw next week, it
was Poland that suffered first at the hands of Nazi Germany 50
years ago.
   Resistance remains strong in Poland to reunification and to a
militarily and economically strong Germany rising again on the
western border.

   A U.N. envoy arrived in Tehran from
Baghdad on Friday in a new effort to break the 14-month-old
deadlock in the Iran-Iraq peace talks, Tehran television reported.
   ``We're searching for a solution to close the gap in the views
of the two countries,'' said the envoy, Jan Eliasson, upon arrival
at Tehran's Mehrabad airport. He was accompanied by a six-man
delegation, according to the broadcast, which was monitored in
Cyprus.
   ``I, the U.N. secretary-general, and the Security Council stand
united behind complete implementation of Resolution 598,'' said
Eliasson, Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations, refurring to
the cease-fire resolution.
   He insisted that ``nothing must obstruct the complete
implementation of the resolution.''
   It was Eliasson's first visit to the Iranian capital in a
mission that is expected to take up to three weeks.
   Talks on implementing the U.N. cease-fire resolution began five
days after the eight-year war halted Aug. 20, 1988. They have been
deadlocked ever since.
   Iran insists there can be no progress until Iraq withdraws its
forces from territory it seized in the closing stages of the
fighting ine early 1988.
   Tehran claims the Iraqis hold 1,020 square miles of border
territory. U.N. cease-fire observers estimate the Iraqis hold 386
square miles.
   Baghdad insists it will not make any concessions until Iran
agrees to dredge and reopen the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, the
southern boundary between the two countries.
   The U.N. resolution calls for withdrawal of troops to the
internationally recognized pre-war border, an exchange of prisoners
of war, and dredging the Shatt-Al-Arab of war debris.
   In Baghdad, Eliasson met with President Saddam Hussein and other
senior Iraqi officials.

<BYLINE>Army Units Pull Out of Remembrance Day Parades; Pacifist Protest

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Remembrance Day, the annual tribute to Britain's
war dead, is generating its own conflicts.
   Two army units, fearing attacks by the Irish Republican Army,
have pulled out of the Nov. 12 parades, in a move reportedly
condemned by Defense Secretary Tom King as a ``gesture of
surrender.''
   And a pacifist group has launched a campaign against the British
Legion's Remembrance Day fund-raising and memorials, accusing the
main veterans' organization of glorifying war.
   British Legion billboards depict a mythical Nazi invasion of
London in World War II and against a background of the Houses of
Parliament burning, declare, ``Give thanks for those who stood in
their way.''
   ``There is no evidence that in 1939 Hitler wanted to conquer
Britain,'' said Jan Melichar, leader of the pacifist group, the
Peace Pledge Union.
   Meanwhile, officials confirmed that two army units, an ordnance
corps and an artillery regiment, have withdrawn from parades
scheduled in a north England town, Thirsk, and in two southern
English coastal centers near Bournemouth.
   The parades are among hundreds held across the country on
Remembrance Day, the Sunday nearest the Nov. 11 Armistice Day.
   At the main ceremony, Queen Elizabeth II and government leaders
lay wreaths at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, the government center in
London.
   Security at parades has been tightened since IRA terrorists
bombed a Remembrance Day service in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland,
in 1987, killing 11 people, all civilians, and injuring 63.
   London's Daily Telegraph reported that the commander of the
artillery unit which pulled out of the Thirsk parade, Lt. Col.
Phillip Wilkinson, said the risk of another IRA attack was too
great.
   According to published reports, quoting sources close to King,
the defense secretary accused the units of ``surrender'' to the IRA.
   Governing Conservative Party legislator Robert Adley, whose
constituency includes the headquarters of the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps, said the pullout was ``shameful.''
   ``The queen and members of the royal family, the prime minister
and members of the Cabinet ... continue to carry out their duty
regardless of these threats and yet this decision was taken by a
serving officer,'' said Adley.
   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the withdrawals.
   ``It is a point of pride and honor for units to take part
wherever and whenever possible, although operational and duty
commitments may make it impractical in certain cases,'' the
ministry said. It refused to elaborate.
   Next week, the Peace Pledge Union plans to sell white poppies on
street corners in competition with the British Legion's sales of
red poppies.
   Red poppies, made of paper and wire, are the traditional symbol
of the Legion's Remembrance Day fund-raising.
   The union was founded in the 1930s. Its membership peaked at
200,000 during World War II, but is now down to about 1,200 members.
   The British Legion dismissed the protests and said its
Nazi-occupied London posters depicted ``a situation that might have
been a reality during the Second World War.''
   ``We feel it is an affront that the peace union puts themselves
across as having a monopoly on peace,'' the Legion said. ``Many of
our 790,000 members have experienced war. Who could want peace
more?''
   The peace union hopes simply to cover its costs with the white
poppies.
   The British Legion expects to raise about $19 million for
veterans and war widows during its two-week red poppy selling drive.

   Jim Bakker today received his expected

   He arrived at the prison system's Federal Medical Center here at
about 11:45 a.m., said spokesman Gary Driver. He was transferred
this morning from the Federal Correctional Institution at
Talladega, Ala.
   Bakker, 49, arrived at Talladega the night of Oct. 24, several
hours after he was sentenced by a federal judge in Charlotte, N.C.,
to 45 years in prison and fined $500,000.
   The Talladega facility often is the first stop for prisoners in
the Southeast before they are sent to more permanent lodgings.
   While in Talladega, Bakker was visited by his wife, Tammy Faye,
and his brother, Norm.
   The Bakkers, before their 1961 marriage, dated while students at
North Central Bible College in Minneapolis. Mrs. Bakker grew up in
International Falls, Minn.
   Bakker will serve his sentence as part of the medical center's
general population, not as a patient for treatment of any mental or
physical illness, officials have said. He suffered a breakdown
during his trial that forced a postponement of several days.

   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has
fired the planning chief for the state-run economy and the foreign
minister in yet another shakeup of top-level jobs, Romania's news
agency reported Friday.
   Radu Balan was ``released from his functions as president of the
State Planning Committee by a presidential decree,'' Agerpres said
in a report from Bucharest, monitored in Vienna.
   It later reported that Foreign Minister Ioan Totu was replaced
by Ion Stoian, who has been a party secretary in charge of
international relations so far.
   Stoian and Ion Sarbu, another party secretary, earlier had been
released from their functions at a meeting of the Communist Party's
Politburo.
   The meeting, chaired by Ceausescu, criticized shortcomings in
Romania's centralized economy, Agerpres said.
   The committee named Ilie Matei and Iosif Szasz to replace Stoian
and Sarbu.
   As reported by Agerpres, Totu was named head of a new State
Committee Of Planning and Technical-Material Supply, while former
Technical-Material Supply Minister Gheorghe Stoica became head of
the Technical-Material Supply Department in Totu's new State
Committee.
   Western analysts said Balan's and Sarbu's dismissal was likely
connected with the poor performance of the Romanian economy this
year.
   Balan, who had been appointed chief planner in June 1988,
apparently came under fire recently at party meetings where
Ceausescu criticized failures to meet plan targets in industry and
export.
   Ceausescu, 71, is the architect of a crash industrialization
program which has resulted in investment bottlenecks, rationing of
basic foods and increased exports to repay the Western debt.

   For 15 aspiring butlers, drawing a gun will be as
important as drawing a bath.
   The would-be servants will be taking a three-day course on
handlng guns so they can protect employers and their families in
the United States and other overseas posts.
   ``Unfortunately, we're living in an era of violence, and wealthy
people overseas who employ butlers want somebody who in an
emergency can go to a drawer and fire a gun to protect them and
their families,'' said Ivor Spencer, who runs the International
School for Butler Administrators.
   Spencer said he was surprised that all 15 students in the
seven-week course said they wanted to learn how to handle guns and
semi-automatic weapons.
   ``I gave them the option and thought some would be afraid of
guns,'' he said.
   The three-day course in Newport, Wales, starting Nov. 9, will
include training on the use of semi-automatic weapons, he said.
   Spencer said he didn't expect butlers to be toting guns in
Britain, which has strict gun control laws and has banned
over-the-counter sales of the weapons. But he said he does expect
some butlers going overseas to get licenses and use their training.
   The school, which recently added karate to its curriculum, runs
several courses in London, one in Houston and is starting one in
Australia.
   Butlers trained by the school are now working for the Duke and
Duchess of York, Prince Edward and King Hussein of Jordan, Spencer
said.

   California lawmakers opening a special
session on aid to earthquake-stricken areas questioned relief plans
but barely debated the proposed source of funds: a sales tax
increase local officials deem inadequate.
   Marilyn Quayle, meanwhile, began visiting farm towns south of
San Francisco left devastated by the Oct. 17 quake measuring 7.1 on
the Richter scale.
   ``You've got me behind you,'' the wife of Vice President Dan
Quayle told the owner of one damaged building on Thursday. This
morning, she met with city officials in hard-hit Santa Cruz.
   Also, Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban
development, said at a San Francisco news conference that the
federal government likely would be sending an additional $165
million to the Bay area to provide and repair rental housing.
   Congress last week approved $3.45 billion in quake relief. The
state is required to come up with $855 million more, said state
Finance Director Jesse Huff.
   To raise $786 million of that money, Gov. George Deukmejian and
legislative leaders this week agreed to propose boosting the sales
tax from 6 percent to 6.25 percent for 13 months starting Dec. 1 _
encompassing two Christmas shopping periods.
   The state Assembly and Senate opened a special session Thursday
on quake relief. Several legislators closely questioned Huff on
whether the highway funds included strengthening bridges.
   ``Before I can vote for a tax increase, I want to make sure some
of the money is coming down to Southern California'' to fix
vulnerable highways, said Assemblywoman Marian La Follette.
   Huff said the relief plan plan includes $300 million _ $60
million of it in state funds _ for retrofitting bridges.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and officials from the counties
shaken worst said they would ask for a sales tax increase to 7
percent for one year to raise about $2.5 billion for repairs.
   But some Republican lawmakers questioned whether any tax
increase was needed. Assemblyman Tom McClintock proposed a freeze
in state spending to save the $800 million during the start of the
1990-91 fiscal year.
   McClintock's plan would delay by 12 weeks the normal inflation
increases due July 1 for programs from schools to welfare.
   After hearing testimony and discussing quake relief needs,
lawmakers broke into committees to consider specific legislation.
Floor votes on bills were possible this afternoon. The session was
expected to last at least until Saturday.
   Any tax increase must be approved by two-thirds of each
legislative house. While the state sales tax is 6 percent, the
total sales tax charged in some counties is higher because of
locally levied sales taxes.
   The vice president's wife on Thursday toured Hollister, an
agricultural town in San Benito County, then moved on to
Watsonville in Santa Cruz County. Today, she was scheduled to visit
inland Los Gatos, seaside Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
   ``I'm glad I came here and will certainly go back to Washington
and tell the president of the problems here now and the hardships
that will be faced in the months to come,'' Mrs. Quayle said in
Watsonville.
   Robert DeMonte, regional administrator for the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development, said that at Kemp's request
Congress probably will approve an extra $165 million in housing aid
next month.
   And Kemp said another $300 million in housing aid already
earmarked for the area over several years will be sent faster to
help quake repairs.
   In other developments:
   _The Federal Emergency Management Agency reversed an earlier
decision and decided to send 100 mobile homes for use by displaced
people in Santa Cruz, San Benito and Monterey counties.
   _The circa-1924 Giant Dipper wooden roller coaster at the Santa
Cruz Boardwalk survived the quake and will roll again. Proceeds
from all the boardwalk's rides this weekend will go to earthquake
relief.
   _Buck Helm, rescued after 90 hours in the rubble of Interstate
880, was moved from Highland Hospital to Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Oakland. He remained in serious condition. He is still
using a respirator and unable to talk. His family communicates with
him ``with our eyes,'' said his former wife, Lorene. Family
attorney Bill Choulos said there have been numerous movie offers.

<HEAD>Mother's Case Raises New Fifth Amendment Questions, Lawyers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of a woman behind bars for refusing to
disclose the whereabouts of her son gives the Supreme Court an
opportunity to refine how the Fifth Amendment protects people
against self-incrimination, lawyers say.
   Ralph Tyler III of the Maryland attorney general's office plans
to argue before the high court Tuesday that the importance of
protecting an endangered child outweighs the constitutional claim
of Jacqueline Bouknight, who has been jailed in Baltimore for 18
months for contempt of court.
   Her lawyers say the case could affect whether courts may use
their contempt powers to persuade defendants to produce evidence
that could help convict them.
   ``If Ralph were right ... we wouldn't need a criminal code. We
could just hold people in contempt until they produce the
evidence,'' said George Burns Jr., a state public defender who is
representing Bouknight.
   City social workers have not seen Bouknight's son Maurice, now 3
years old, for more than two years and fear he may be dead.
   Maurice, born on Oct. 3, 1986, was hospitalized twice before he
was 4 months old with pneumonia and a broken leg. Social workers
said his mother was seen shaking the baby and dropping him into his
hospital crib. According to prosecutors, X-rays revealed the child
had previous bone fractures.
   The state took protective custody of the child for several
months, but his mother regained custody in July 1987, after
promising not to physically punish him and to undergo training in
parenthood.
   Nine months later, after social workers said Bouknight had
ceased to cooperate with them and would not show them her son, a
juvenile court issued a civil contempt order that she be jailed
until she revealed his whereabouts.
   Bouknight, now 23, remains in the Baltimore City Jail. Her
attorneys refused to allow her to be interviewed, saying she is
hampered by severe learning difficulties, although she meets legal
standards of mental competency.
   ``She's sort of a lost soul,'' Burns said, noting that he could
not find any relatives of Bouknight's. ``I know of no real work
background. I think she's probably lived from place to place.''
   Maurice's father, who had been jailed for distributing cocaine,
was shot to death in March 1988, and Bouknight had a history of
drug use, according to testimony in juvenile court.
   Defense attorneys say if the child has been harmed or killed,
Bouknight would be the most likely suspect, even if someone else
were responsible.
   ``If she said, `I can't produce the baby, the baby's dead and
gone,' it doesn't take a very imaginative prosecutor to add up the
facts,'' Burns said. ``... You can have successful prosecutions of
innocent people.''
   The Fifth Amendment forbids authorities from compelling people
to testify against themselves but does not prohibit courts from
ordering them to perform certain actions, Tyler said. For example,
courts have held that suspects can be required to provide samples
of their blood, handwriting and voice, and to stand in a police
lineup.
   ``Here, Ms. Bouknight can comply with the juvenile court's order
and produce Maurice without uttering a sound to any representative
of the state,'' Tyler said in written arguments. ``... Maurice's
right to freedom from bodily harm and the state's obligation to
protect that right are fundamental societal values which outweigh
Ms. Bouknight's marginal Fifth Amendment claim.''
   Dan Goldstein, a Baltimore criminal defense lawyer and former
federal prosecutor, said the state's argument that the right
against self-incrimination should be balanced against the need to
safeguard children provokes an ``unnecessary constitutional
confrontation.''
   If the state's only object were to protect children, the General
Assembly could pass a law granting immunity from prosecution to
parents in Bouknight's position, he said.
   ``The state's attack goes to the very heart of the Fifth
Amendment,'' Goldstein said. ``This case really poses the risk for
the first time that the absolute protection of the Fifth Amendment
can be breached.''
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, voting 5-2, ruled Dec. 19 that
jailing Bouknight for refusing to produce Maurice violated her
constitutional rights and that she should be released immediately.
But the same day, U.S. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set aside
that decision, pending review by the full Supreme Court.

   Marilyn Quayle began inspecting
California earthquake damage with tours of two devastated farm
towns and private visits with refugees living in tents.
   ``You've got me behind you,'' the wife of Vice President Dan
Quayle said Thursday as she hugged Marie Deverly, owner of a
damaged building in downtown Watsonville.
   ``I'm glad I came here and will certainly go back to Washington
and tell the president of the problems here now and the hardships
that will be faced in the months to come,'' Mrs. Quayle told
reporters.
   She began her tour in Hollister, an agricultural town in San
Benito County, then visited Watsonville in Santa Cruz County. She
went to seaside Santa Cruz this morning, meeting with city
officials, and was scheduled to visit San Francisco this afternoon.
   The epicenter of the Oct. 17 quake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter
scale, was 15 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and about 55 miles
south of San Francisco. Watsonville is about 15 miles east of Santa
Cruz and Hollister is about 20 miles east of Watsonville.
   Watsonville Mayor Betty Murphy told Mrs. Quayle of losses
suffered in the city of 28,000 residents.
   ``Sometimes it's a lot harder for the smaller towns,'' Mrs.
Quayle told the mayor as they walked past crumbling buildings.
   They paused in front of a mound of brick and wood that once was
a building housing homes and shops. It had been demolished hours
earlier, the first of at least seven downtown buildings that must
be torn down.
   Mrs. Quayle later had dinner at a Red Cross shelter where 170
people, mostly poor Hispanics, live in 23 tents. Wearing a Red
Cross windbreaker and cradling a baby boy, Mrs. Quayle then walked
to a tent to talk privately with a family about its problems.
   Mrs. Quayle remained about 15 minutes in the tent shared by 13
people, chatting with Maria Rosario Hernandez and Guadalupe Marquez
about their problems finding affordable housing since their homes
were destroyed. They said rents are about double the $400 they used
to pay for a one-bedroom house shared by nine people.
   ``She seemed very nice and answered all our questions,'' Mrs.
Marquez said afterward. ``I'm glad she saw how we live and I hope
she noticed how cold it is. My child has been to the doctor twice
because of the cold.''

<HEAD>Michigan Voters Face Two School Ballot Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan voters will give their verdict
Tuesday on almost three years of work by state lawmakers to revamp
school funding, and many experts fear they'll give the effort an
``F.''
   The voters will face two ballot proposals, each raising the
state sales tax to provide more money for schools. One also
provides some property tax relief and does more to equalize funding
among school districts.
   But many observers believe the combination of a proposed tax
increase, a complex issue, the expected low voter turnout, and
public skepticism of the politicians who put the issues on the
ballot will be hard to overcome.
   ``There is indeed a lot of cynicism, at least about anything
that involves spending money and increasing taxes to spend money.
It's not impossible, but any tax increase has a tough row to hoe,''
said David Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan State
University.
   ``Nobody wants to pay more taxes. Everybody would like the
schools to be better. It's really a question of the balance between
what nearly everybody would say is two desirable ends.''
   Two proposals on the ballot will increase the chances that one
will pass, Rohde says. Others maintain the two work against each
other, dividing the support of those who back the basic idea of
raising money for schools.
   Opponents _ led by the influential Michigan State Chamber of
Commerce _ are reminding voters they don't have to choose between
the proposals but can vote against both.
   ``The further we get away from the Capitol, the better the
reception,'' said chamber vice president Richard Studley.
   If both were to pass, the one with the most votes would take
effect.
   If both are defeated, few believe the Legislature would
immediately tackle the issue again but citizens groups might start
petition drives.
   Treasurer Robert Bowman said if both proposals fail, Gov. James
Blanchard would push school quality legislation and then property
tax relief, trying to limit assessment increases.
   Legislation already has been introduced to sharply cut the
number of school districts in an attempt to equalize their wealth.
The state has 524 kindergarten-through-12th grade districts.
   Proposal A on Tuesday's ballot would raise the state sales tax
to 4.5 percent from 4 percent and generate about $400 million more
for schools.
   Proposal B would raise the sales tax to 6 percent, cut property
taxes some $1.5 billion and put about $350 million more into
schools.
   ``Proposal A has money and B doesn't,'' said state Sen. Dan
DeGrow, a Republican and a Proposal B backer. ``But they both face
an uphill fight.''
   Proposal A, backed by the governor, has a campaign budget of
about $3 million and an impressive list of supporters, including
two large teachers' unions and major corporations.

<HEAD>Two Pakistanis, Six Saudis Beheaded For Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight men accused of crimes ranging
from drug smuggling to rape and murder were beheaded Friday in
keeping with strict Islamic law, the government said.
   Two Pakistanis identified as Mohammed Dustan Aslam Khan and Taj
Ali Khan were executed in the port city of Jiddah after they were
convicted of smuggling heroin, the Interior Ministry said in a
statement on state-run Riyadh Radio.
   Six Saudis also were beheaded nationwide for various crimes.
Without providing further details, the statement said the crimes
included murder and rape.
   Beheading murderers is prescribed by Islamic religious law.
Thieves have their hands chopped off and adulterers are stoned.
   In recent years, Saudi theologians ruled that drug trafficking
also was a crime that ``spread corruption on the face of the
earth'' and merited beheading or crucifixion.
   There have been several beheadings for drug offenses in recent
years.
   Executions are carried out on Friday, the Moslem holy day, in
front of mosques as the faithful pray. The bodies are sometimes
hung from crossed beams as a warning to others.
   In recent weeks, Saudi authorities have made a point of
announcing executions and hand-chopping on the state radio,
apparently to demonstrate that such justice is meted out regardless
of nationality.
   This followed the Sept. 21 beheading of 16 pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems from Kuwait who were convicted by Saudi Islamic courts for
bombings during the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in July.
   The blasts killed one Pakistani and wounded 16 other pilgrims.
   Those executions heightened a feud between the Saudis and Iran.
A pro-Iranian group killed a Saudi Embassy official in Beirut
earlier this week, claiming the slaying was to avenge the 16 men
executed in Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudi Interior Minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz, has
rejected criticism of the beheadings by organizations such as
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, as
tantamount to attacking the Islamic faith.

<TEXT>
   West German officials will brief
relatives of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 next week about their
investigation of the bombing, but a spokesman said Friday the
information already is widely known.
   Three U.S. congressmen said Thursday a group of relatives from
among the 270 killed in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the jumbo jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland would visit Bonn and Frankfurt to learn
what they could about the incident.
   ``I imagine that these people are seeking information that would
help them put together a picture of where the investigation
stands,'' said Detlef Dauke, spokesman for the federal Interior
Ministry overseeing the inquiry.
   Dauke said investigators from the United States, Britain and
West Germany have been cooperating closely in sharing information
about the case.
   ``I can't imagine that any new details will come out,'' Dauke
said.
   The group is expected to arrive Wednesday for talks with airport
administrators and officials of the Federal Criminal Investigations
Office, the West German equivalent of the FBI.
   Pan Am Flight 103 originated at Frankfurt Airport. After landing
at London's Heathrow Airport, passengers and luggage were
transferred to a Boeing 747 that exploded and showered fiery debris
over the town of Lockerbie after taking off for New York on Dec. 21.
   West German and Scottish investigators say a radio-cassette
player packed with plastic explosives and an air pressure-regulated
timing device exploded in a suitcase.
   The Criminal Investigations Office in Wiesbaden confirmed
earlier this week that investigators were pursuing clues that the
bomb-laden suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 after being
brought to Frankfurt Airport unaccompanied on an Air Malta flight
from the island nation. Air Malta has denied any connection with
the disaster.
   U.S. media reports have alleged that the bombing has been traced
to terrorists jailed in West Germany who belong to the People's
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   Pan American World Airways, facing $300 million in lawsuits over
the bombing, asked a U.S. federal court for access to any
information showing West Germany warned U.S. authorities of
suspicious activity in Frankfurt Airport's baggage handling area 90
minutes before the flight took off.
   The Criminal Investigations Office has denied issuing any such a
warning and the State Department has denied receiving any.
   A U.S. presidential commission formed to look into the bombing
will investigate Pan Am's claims, U.S. Sens. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., told a Washington news
conference Thursday.
   The relatives group visiting West Germany will be accompanied by
staff members from the office of Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court said Friday the
government may proceed with its prosecution of three people
implicated in the bombing of the U.S. Capitol and other government
buildings.
   The court reversed an April 11 decision by U.S. District Court
Judge Harold Greene, who said the same evidence is being used in
successive trials on different charges against Susan Rosenberg,
Timothy Blunk and Alan Berkman. Such a procedure violates the
double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, said Greene, but the
appeals court disagreed.
   ``We find no support for the use of a `same actual evidence'
test in assessing whether successive prosecutions violate the
double jeopardy clause,'' said appeals court judge Abner Mikva.
   Rosenberg, Blunk and Berkman were convicted in separate trials
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey of conspiracy to possess
unregistered firearms, explosives and false identification. They
were then indicted in Washington, D.C., for the actual bombings and
were listed as unindicted co-conspirators in an alleged scheme
involving four other people to carry out the bombings.
   The appeals court did say that the government cannot rely solely
on a legal theory of vicarious liability, in which a jury is asked
to infer guilt from the defendants' involvement in a conspiracy.
   That could prove troublesome for prosecutors, since as the
appeals court noted, ``the government apparently has little
evidence linking the three'' to the bombings and had planned to use
the theory of vicarious liability.
   ``The government is not precluded from prosecuting ... for the
Washington bombings on a theory of liability of aiding and abetting
or on a theory of direct participation in the bombing,'' said
Mikva. ``Nor is it precluded from using any evidence introduced at
earlier trials'' and it may rely in part on the conspiracy theory.
   Seven people are accused of bombing the U.S. Capitol, the
National War College Building at Fort McNair, the Computer Center
at the Washington Navy Yard and the Officer's Club at the Navy Yard
in 1983 and 1984.
   The others in the case are Laura Whitehorn, Linda Evans, Marilyn
Buck and Elizabeth Duke.
   The case has been delayed while the government appealed Greene's
ruling.

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces on Friday clashed
with an angry crowd in Podujevo and moved to quell other protests
by ethnic Albanians in this southern province where at least three
people died in unrest this week.
   The wave of protests in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's poorest region, was
sparked by the trial of a popular former communist chief, Azem
Vlasi, and 14 other leaders of the province's ethnic Albanian
majority.
   More than 500 villagers tried to force their way into the center
of Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina, sources said on condition
of anonymity. Security forces blocked off a local road where
demonstrators were marching and used tear gas in a bid to disperse
them.
   The government's Tanjug news agency said the demonstrators and
the security forces clashed, and sources said gunshots were heard,
but no other details of the incident were reported.
   A demonstration by about 150 school children was also reported
in the town of Suva Reka, 40 miles south of Pristina. The
demonstrators dispersed as soon as riot police took up positions in
front of them, a witness said.
   Riot police and armored vehicles were out in force in the center
of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, where they dispersed
70 people who were attempting to stage a demonstration.
   Police said a shootout with ``terrorists'' Thursday night ended
when a 26-year-old railroad worker committed suicide while another
unindentified man died of wounds inflicted by police and was found
with an explosive device.
   The railroad worker, Fahri Fazliu, was a ringleader during
previous demonstrations and was followed by police Thursday to an
apartment complex after he tried to organize new riots, police said.
   Earlier reports had said four people holed up in the basement
died in a six-hour shootout with police.
   An ethnic Albanian identified as Bedri Sokilji was shot and
killed Wednesday night when about 1,000 demonstrators took to the
streets in Pristina and some battled with security forces.
   Sources close to the police said security forces throughout the
province neighboring Communist Albania were put on extra alert.
   Fearing more unrest by the ethnic Albanian majority in the
province, a heavy police presence was evident on streets of most
Kosovo towns which have for the past five days been the scene of
violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.
   Riot policemen wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and
carrying submachine guns patrolled downtown Pristina.
   The latest unrest was sparked by the trial of Vlasi and 14 other
defendents on charges of engaging in ``counterrevolutionary
activity'' to win Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia. They could
face the death penalty.
   The trial, began Monday but was postponed for at least 10 days
while an appeals courts rules on a demand by Vlasi and his lawyers
for the exclusion of the presiding judge and the public prosecutor.
   Officials and the media in Yugoslavia's liberal northern
republics, as well as international human rights organizations,
have denounced the proceedings, describing them as a ``farce'' and
a ``show trial.''
   Vlasi also is charged with inciting riots in February and March
that left at least 25 people dead, including two policemen.
   Albanians were angry over the passage of a constitutional
amendment last spring that gave Yugoslavia's largest republic of
Serbia tight control over the police and judiciary in Kosovo, a
province within Serbia.
   The Serbian leadership claimed the amendments will prevent
alleged harassment of the Slav minority by the ethnic Albanians,
who make up more than 85 percent of Kosovo's population.
   Kosovo's communist party leadership on Friday assessed the
latest spate of unrest in Kosovo as ``the continuation of
counterrevolutionary activities'' by ethnic Albanians ``aimed at
the secession of Kosovo from Yugoslavia.''

   Mayor Jacques Chirac bestowed one of the city's
highest awards, the Grande Medaille de Vermeil, on American jazz
composer Miles Davis at the 17th-Century city hall Friday.
   Davis accepted the gold-and-silver medal which Chirac said
symbolized ``an old and faithful friendship'' between the trumpet
player and the French capital.
   ``You have never stopped being one of the rare musicians who can
win the lasting favor of the widest public without ever abandoning
the least bit of your art,'' Chirac said. ``You have often been
followed, but never been a follower.''
   Davis, 63, was in Paris for the 10th annual Festival of Jazz. He
first played before a Parisian audience in 1949.

   A tiff over a master tape of a new Tiffany
album has surfaced in federal court, where MCA Records is suing a
producer for the pop singer.
   A federal complaint alleges that producer George Tobin
threatened to sell to another company a master tape of a new
Tiffany album containing songs, the copyrights of which are owned
by MCA.
   Tobin signed an exclusive contract with MCA in April 1986 under
which the record company had sole rights to manufacture and
distribute Tiffany's records, cassettes and compact disks,
according to the lawsuit.
   Tobin said the lawsuit was a move by Tiffany and MCA to force a
change in his recording agreement with the teen-age star.
   ``I've got a California court-approved contract and I'm not
going'' to change the contract, Tobin said.
   He said he offered the tape to another company because MCA
declined to release it and accused the company of breaching their
contract.
   Tobin said Tiffany had stopped recording with him and that he
had about 40 unreleased songs.
   Tiffany's two albums have sold about 9 million copies.

   Former congressman John Jenrette has begun
200 hours of community service as part of his shoplifting sentence,
working in the Horry County public defender's office.
   ``I've done volunteer work all my life, but this is the first
time it's gotten so much publicity,'' Jenrette told reporters as he
left the office to have lunch Thursday, his first day of work.
   ``It's been a fun day,'' he said. ``I've been helping them fix

   Jenrette, who served two years in federal prison for conspiracy
and accepting a $50,000 Abscam bribe in 1980, now operates a

   He was ordered to complete 200 hours of community service after
a Virginia jury convicted him of stealing a pair of shoes and a tie
and of altering the prices on two garments in a department store
last year. He also served 20 days in jail.

<HEAD>Jane Fonda's Daughter Ordered to Do Three Days Community Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vanessa Vadim, daughter of actress Jane Fonda,
was ordered Friday to do three days of community service for
interfering with police when they arrested her boyfriend on drug
charges.
   Vadim, 21, was arrested Oct. 6 on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
where her boyfriend, Thomas Feegal, was allegedly buying heroin.
   As police seized Feegal, Vadim reportedly got between him and a
policeman and said, ``If you're going to arrest him, you have to
arrest me.''
   Police charged her with obstructing government administration,
disorderly conduct and loitering. The police complaint alleged that
she tried to prevent Feegal's arrest by ``intimidation, physical
force and interference.''
   Feegal allegedly told police, ``We were only buying the drugs
for a school project.'' A hearing on his drug possession charges is
scheduled next week.
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Judy Kluge adjourned the case and
told Vadim that if she does the community service as required and
stays out of trouble for the next six months, the complaint will be
dismissed.
   ``When she was arrested, we felt she was guilty of nothing and
this disposition bears that out,'' Vadim's lawyer, Robert Kalina,
said outside court.
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Shechtman said, ``She made no
physical contact with the police. I'm not saying it was a bad
arrest, but it's not the crime of the century.''
   Shechtman said an agreement will be worked out within the week
on whether Vadim will do the community service in New York or in
Providence, R.I., where she is a student at Brown University.
   Vadim, whose father is French movie director Roger Vadim, and a
woman Kalina said was her sister Natalie, left the courthouse
without speaking to the crush of news people.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor has proposed creating a
religious order he calls ``The Sisters of Life,'' whose nuns would
devote themselves to opposing abortion and euthanasia.
   The cardinal made the proposal in his column in the archdiocesan
weekly newspaper, Catholic New York. Such an order's ``total
commitment will be to the cause of life as threatened by abortion
and euthanasia,'' he wrote.
   But in an interview Thursday night with the New York Post,
O'Connor denied the order would have an overtly political agenda.
   ``I hope they would concern themselves with the moral dimensions
of public policy, but I would hope they would never become
politicized,'' he said. The nuns' first priority, he said, would be
prayer.
   The Catholic Church frowns on direct involvement by its priests
and nuns in political elections, but allows or encourages them to
speak out on political issues.
   O'Connor wrote that his column was intended as a ``Help Wanted''
ad to elicit reaction from potential members of the proposed order.
But he told the Post he hoped that the order could begin its work
as early as the end of next year, if enough women are interested.
   Membership in the church's existing religious orders _
especially those for women _ has been declining steadily.
   The Vatican's Congregation of Religious does not necessarily
have to get involved in the formation of a religious community if
it is done inside one diocese or archdiocese, according to the Rev.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators in Bulgaria
staged the first large pro-reform rally in the country's postwar
history Friday, a diplomat and another source said.
   Estimates of people taking part ranged between 4,000 and 9,000
demonstrating on the last day of a 35-nation conference on the
protection of the environment in Sofia, the capital.
   Earlier in the day, Romanian objections to clauses on human
rights blocked final agreement at the conference that had drawn up
non-binding recommendations to member states dealing with such
topics as cross-border pollution from industrial accidents,
diplomats said.
   A diplomat reached by telephone from Vienna told The Associated
Press the demonstrators were chanting ``Democracy!'' and
``Glasnost!'' in what was a peaceful gathering that lasted for
about 40 minutes.
   According to the diplomat, who asked not to be identified,
police ringed the National Assembly but a group of activists
belonging to the Eco-Glasnost independent group managed to deliver
a petition.
   He said there were many police on the square but there was no
word of people being detained during or after the rally.
   Later, the government-run BTA news agency confirmed ``a group of
citizens'' presented a petition concerning two hydropower projects
to Atanas Dimitrov, deputy chairman of the National Assembly.
   It said those who gathered the signatures organized ``a brief
demonstration'' with the permission of the Sofia city council
before presenting the petition. It provided no other details.
   No such demonstration has taken place in the Bulgarian capital
since the end of World War II, but last week Eco-Glasnost activists
collected signatures in a Sofia park under a petition against
construction of a hydroelectic power project.
   The diplomat did not know how many of the demonstrators were
members of Eco-Glasnost or other independent group.
   At the conference, Romania, led by hard-liner Nicolae Ceausescu,
refused to accept any reference to permitting citizens or
unofficial groups to voice their concerns on ecological issues in a
final conference document, diplomats said.
   Bulgaria and the Soviet Union were said to have made last-ditch
efforts Thursday to persuade Romania to drop its objections.
   On Friday, Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov personally appealed to
Ceausescu by telephone to drop the Romanian objections but failed,
a U.S. delegation source said, speaking by telephone from Sofia on
condition of anonymity.
   Since Romania refused to agree to the final document, the U.S.
source said, the 34 other nations at the Sofia conference will go
ahead and accept it as a proposal for action.
   The Sofia conference was being held as part of the process
started by the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, signed by 35 nations
including the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all
European nations bar Albania.
   Until the current conference in Sofia, Bulgaria also had
harassed independent ecological groups and other emerging
unofficial organizations.
   But the presence of Western officials attending the conference,
which opened Oct. 16, has allowed ``Eco-Glasnost'' and other
dissenters a margin of public activity unknown before on Sofia
streets.
   ``Eco-Glasnost,'' which was been refused official registration,
says it has collected 7,000 signatures on its petition against a
planned hydroelectric plant in the scenic Rila mountains 75 miles
southwest of Sofia.

   ``Jewish-American princess'' jokes are the
most common manifestation of a rising anti-semitism on college
campuses, a speaker told a workshop Friday at a convention of
Reform Jews.
   Items such as ``Slap a JAP'' or ``JAP Buster'' T-shirts are
being sold on campuses, Nancy Kasten, a rabbinic intern for the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, told participants in that
group's convention.
   ``JAP baiting is the most common form of anti-semitism we find
on campuses. It's disguised as humor, or kidding, but it's very
harmful, nonetheless. We even do it ourselves, and it tends to put
a wedge between Jewish men and women,'' Kasten said.
   Hundreds of college students and others from the United States
and Canada attended the workshop, and some said ``JAP baiting'' was
only one form of anti-semitism they encountered on campuses. They
described incidents ranging from verbal assaults to discrimination
by fraternities and sororities.
   ``It's not just in one area or on one campus. I attend the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the so-called liberal
Northeast. We had an incident just recently where one morning we
found swastikas painted on the walls of a hallway in one of the
dorms,'' Andrea Dine told the group.
   Major incidents of anti-semitism on the nation's colleges have
risen sharply in the past few years, Kasten said. Up from six in
1984 to 38 incidents recorded in 1988.
   ``It's part of an overall problem. All kinds of bigotry and
prejudicial acts take place now. I think it has to do with the
number of people attending school now and the diversity. We live in
a society that has a low tolerance and when you put this many
people in close proximity these things tend to flare up,'' she said.
   Many of the students at the conference agreed that anti-semitism
was part of a larger problem on campuses that included anti-black,
anti-women and anti-gay prejudices.
   ``There's a larger issue here. It's not just anti-semitism or
race. It's that of people hating. We have to start earlier to
educate people about other people and about their differences,''
said Nikki Horberg of Skokie, Ill.
   Students at the workshop discussed ways to stem anti-semitism,
and although many said they had success with workshops and
coalitions of Jews and other minorities, most agreed that the work
needed to begin much earlier.
   ``Our campus claims to accept everyone, but if you look around
you see that blacks stay with blacks and Orientals with Orientals
and each group together. We don't really get to know each other or
like each other. Everyone thinks they are aware but they're not,''
said Roxanne Schnider of Dennison University near Columbus, Ohio.
   ``You need to start teaching people not to discriminate in
elementary or even pre-school,'' she said.
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations is the central
organization of Reform Judaism in North America, representing 822
Reform temples with 284,000 members in the United States and
Canada. Kasten, a workshop panelist, is in her last year of study
to become a rabbi at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of
Religion in New York.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III on Friday rejected resuming full ties with New Zealand because
of the country's tough anti-nuclear policy, officials said.
   Sources close to the talks said Australian Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans suggested the United States end its deep freeze in
relations with New Zealand, but that Baker replied the time was not
appropriate.
   The officials emphasized there was no major disagreement. They
said New Zealand was one of many issues raised during the
wide-ranging talks.
   ``The meeting was more one of opening doors, not closing
doors,'' said a senior U.S. administration official, who briefed
reporters on condition he not be named. Australian officials gave
similar briefings.
   The U.S.-Australia talks replace those that were held annually
when New Zealand was a functioning partner of the treaty that
groups Australia and the United States.
   New Zealand in 1984 adopted an anti-nuclear policy that banned
port visits by U.S. vessels capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
   Washington retaliated by refusing to share intelligence with the
country and suspended New Zealand as an active member of the
treaty. It also froze ministerial contacts between the countries.
   Delegation sources said Evans twice raised the New Zealand issue
with Baker, suggesting that it was now time for a thaw following
leadership changes in both New Zealand and the United States.
   But Baker, after pointing out the United States had normal
economic relations with New Zealand, refused to budge on political
and strategic contacts, the sources said.
   However, there was a sign Friday of a slight thaw in relations.
U.S. officials announced support for a U.N. resolution against
driftnet fishing that was co-sponsored by New Zealand. The giant
nets sometimes are lost at sea and pose hazards to protected
species.
   Evans, accompanied at the talks by Defense Minister Kim Beazley,
also suggested the United States should support the Soviet Union's
request for observer status at the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. But Baker said there were still too many problems with the
Soviet's centrally controlled economy for it to join Western
finanical institutions in the trade pact.
   Baker, accompanied by U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, heads
the highest-ranking diplomatic delegation to Australia in more than
20 years. The two-day ministerial consulations are to be followed
Monday by a 12-nation economic conference of Pacific Rim countries.
   Other visiting U.S. officials include U.S. trade representative
Carla Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
   Baker is on his first visit and said he did not want to be a
``stranger Down Under.'' He also said the two countries share
similar perspectives on most issues ``to a remarkable degree.''
   He added: ``Whenever we do not see eye-to-eye, we can rely on
our tradition of close consultations.
   ``I cannot overstate the value the United States attaches to
continued excellent relations with Australia,'' Baker said.

   The sun is more than 4 feet around and
Uranus is all the way downtown in Eugene.
   Neptune is across the Willamette River, just where Jack VanDusen
and his son Ben left it.
   As an educational experience, VanDusen and his 8-year-old
painted a chart of the sun and its planets to scale along the
city's bicycle paths and sidewalks. The scale is 1 inch to 25,000
miles and includes a yellow sun that's 4{ feet in diameter.
   ``The idea from my perspective was just to give Ben a real clear
idea of the size of the solar system and the planets,'' said
VanDusen, a former teacher who paints houses for a living.
   ``Textbooks create this really warped perspective,'' he said.
``They make planets look so big and close to the sun when really
they're extremely tiny and far away.''
   Jupiter is almost a half-mile from the sun and Saturn is almost
a mile on the VanDusen's walk-on mural. Uranus is downtown and
Neptune is across the Willamette River.
   VanDusen got information on the distances between the planets
from a National Geographic atlas of the universe. His son punched
numbers into a calculator to figure how to reduce the solar system
to city size.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who never was at a loss
for words during his 12 years at City Hall, says that won't change
when he leaves office Jan. 1 _ but he expects to make a lot more
money for speaking his mind.
   Koch said Friday he plans to go on the lecture circuit and
become a pitchman for commercial products when his third term ends.
The word from the Harry Walker Agency, which will handle his
lectures, is that Koch should be a busy man.
   ``They said the number of lectures I can give are unlimited,
that, for whatever reason, I'm in great demand,'' the mayor said.
``So those speeches I used to deliver around the country for free,
people will now have to pay for.''
   The Walker Agency represents Henry Kissinger, former President
Gerald Ford, ex-U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and former House
Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill. Its top clients command $20,000
to $25,000 per spiel, plus expenses.
   Koch also plans to do some commercials, although he declined to
say what products he will endorse. Whatever they are, ``I will do
them tastefully,'' Koch said.
   Asked what he would talk about to audiences on the lecture
circuit, Koch responded, ``It will be their choice.'' He then he
ticked off several subjects: government, drugs, AIDS, economy,
international affairs.
   Don Walker, president of the agency, said his office has
received hundreds of inquiries in the past 12 years from business
groups, trade associations and universities eager to hear Koch
speak.
   ``I expect that Mayor Koch will establish himself as one of a
handful of the most sought after speakers in the country,'' he
predicted.
   Koch already has agreed to become a visiting fellow at New York
University where he will lecture on urban affairs and government,
and a daily commentator on WNEW-AM Radio.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The realities of conflict are
drowning optimism about the Central American peace process in a
wave of violence and terror.
   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega canceled a 19-month
cease-fire with U.S.-supported Contra rebels who refused to accept
a peace agreement that called for their demobilization.
   In El Salvador, the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front suspended peace talks with the government after 10 people
were killed in the bombing of a union hall.
   Both the moves this week were steps backward from agreements
signed by five Central American presidents Aug. 7 that called for
disbanding the Contras, dialogue between governments and
guerrillas, and an end to outside support for guerrilla movements.
   In the case of El Salvador, the peace talks foundered because
the government and insurgent armies are both convinced they can
eventually win a decade-old civil war.
   ``What can be expected now is total war,'' said Aronette Diaz,
leader of the leftist Nationalist Democratic Union in San Salvador.
   She said the violence could become worse than the bloody days of
the early 1980s, when up to 800 people a month were being killed,
most of them by rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated by the
armed forces.
   ``Ten years later, both armies are more experienced, stronger.
The war has reached another level,'' said Ms. Diaz.
   From the moment government and guerrilla representatives sat
down to talk in Mexico in September, the two sides accused each
other of lacking the will to find a route to peace. Each contended
the other was using the talks tactically to blame the other for
their inevitable breakdown.
   The Mexican session and a subsequent round of talks in Costa
Rica in October produced virtually no progress toward ending a
conflict that has killed an estimated 70,000 people.
   Rebel commander Eduardo Sancho said Tuesday's bombing of the
National Federation of Salvadoran Workers was ``the principal
reason'' for suspending the talks. Ten people were killed and 29
wounded in the blast, which he said ``marks a new line, a new
political moment'' similar to the early 1980s.
   ``With the massacre ... the fascist dictatorship has been
unmasked. The only way being left open is the immediate taking up
of arms,'' Sancho said Friday on the clandestine rebel Radio
Venceremos.
   In Nicaragua, as in El Salvador, a burst of optimism followed
the Aug. 7 agreements.
   The Sandinistas called elections for Feb. 25, as promised.
Fourteen opposition parties joined a coalition and nominated a
candidate _ Violeta Chamorro _ to face Ortega. Voter registration
took place.
   But the Contras, who were not a party to the agreements, began
moving troops back into Nicaragua from their camps in neighboring
Honduras. They said they would observe the cease-fire and fight
only defensively but said there could be no peace without their
participation.
   Ortega said he canceled the cease-fire because of an escalating
series of Contra attacks in the last three weeks. He promised to
forge ahead with the vote.
   Sandinista forces immediately attacked Contra positions to a
chorus of criticism from the United States and other Central
American nations, and there were hints that U.S. military aid to
the guerrillas might be renewed.
   But the defiant Contras are small and isolated, and U.S.
officials fear they will simply be wiped out by the much larger
Sandinista army. Even without their demobilization, the Sandinistas
could then go ahead with elections without worrying about Contra
violence.
   The union hall bombing in El Salvador came the day after urban
guerrillas attacked the defense ministry and headquarters of the
joint chiefs of staff with mortars, killing one person and wounding
15.
   President Alfredo Cristiani says it is impossible to predict
when the rebels will be defeated. ``But there will come a point
when they'll find themselves very diminished and they will become
just isolated terrorist groups,'' he said.
   But four U.S. army colonels said in a report this year that the
insurgents, estimated at 7,000 full-time combatants and about twice
that many part-time fighters, were well-trained and highly
motivated. They concluded the rebels could keep the conflict
stalemated ``indefinitely.''
   The insurgents believe stalemate favors them _ that time is on
their side.
   The 56,000-member armed forces of the government is dependent on
U.S. military aid, which has reached more than $800 million this
decade. The rebels are confident the ``Yankees'' will eventually
tire of financing a tie and will be embarrassed by renewed
right-wing violence.
   ``If negotiations don't work out, we'll eventually win,'' said a
guerrilla commander who used the nom de guerre Luis in a recent
interview. ``It's just a question of how high the human and
material cost will be.''

<HEAD>Teen Killed By Soldiers, Woman Killed as Collaborator</HEAD>

   Soldiers fatally shot a 14-year-old
Palestinian in a clash with stone throwers Friday in the occupied
West Bank, and an Arab woman was killed by fellow Palestinians
apparently for collaboration with the Israelis, Arab reports said.
   Also Friday, Israel's top four leaders met for 90 minutes to
discuss their response to the latest U.S. proposal on starting
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.
   Sources in Jerusalem said the U.S. proposal made Wednesday by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was acceptable in principle.
A senior government official said the leaders were ``not far'' from
submitting a joint formula to the Israeli Cabinet for a vote.
   The violence occurred in the old central market of Nablus, the
West Bank's largest city with 120,000 people. The city was put
under curfew by the army after the incidents.
   The army confirmed the woman's death and said she had a criminal
record.
   The army also said that troops opened fire with plastic bullets
in the central market after stones were thrown, but said it could
not determine if the teen-ager was killed in the incident because
his family removed the body from a Nablus hospital for burial
before troops arrived.
   Arab reports said the youth, Nadir Abu Yassin, was shot in the
chest when troops opened fire on stone throwers. He was dead on
arrival at Anglican Hospital.
   His death raised to 609 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis since the Arab uprising against Israeli occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Forty Israelis
also have died.
   The woman, Naima Farouk Jaara, was taken from her home by masked
Palestinians and found later with a single bullet wound in the
head, Arab reports said.
   The reports said she had collaborated with Israeli authorities
and was a prostitute.
   Her death raised to 140 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration, drug dealing or
prostitution.
   The meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance
Minister Shimon Peres took place at Peres's apartment in the Tel
Aviv suburb of Ramat Aviv, where he is recovering from a urinary
tract infection.
   Rabin told reporters afterward that there was still a chance of
a positive response to Baker's call for an Israeli-Palestinian
meeting in Cairo to discuss Israel's proposal for election in the
occupied territories.
   ``I see great significance in that the National Unity government
will continue to look for opportunities to realize our initiative.
I think it certainly has a chance,'' he said.
   Shamir and Arens said nothing as they left.
   Informed sources said Israel was still seeking assurances from
the U.S. that it would not be put in a position to negotiate with
the PLO.
   The Labor Party favors Baker's plan while Likud has resisted it.
The two parties sit together in Israel's coalition government,
which has led to a long process of indecision about how to make
peace with the Palestinians and Arab states.

<HEAD>Dannemeyer Rebuked for Ethics Comments on House Floor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., was
rebuked twice by the speaker pro tem of the House on Friday for
criticizing by name two colleagues being investigated by the ethics
committee.
   Dannemeyer was cited for the relatively rare violation of House
rules while making a speech to an empty chamber. He said he
intended to file resolutions calling for the explusion of Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio.
   After his first warning, Dannemeyer referred to Frank as
``Member X.'' He was cited again for violating House rules that
prohibit discussion in floor debate of colleagues and of matters
pending before the ethics committee.
   The House ethics committee is considering the case of each _
Frank, for his involvement with male prostitute Steve Gobie, and
Lukens for his conviction of the misdemeanor charge of contributing
to the unruliness of a minor, after a jury heard evidence he had
sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   Dannemeyer is a conservative who has frequently and forcefully
spoken in the House against homosexuality.
   ``It is time for this House to regain its integrity and let the
dead bury their dead,'' Dannemeyer said. ``At the appropriate time
in the near future I will offer a resolution in one form or another
to expel two gentlemen from the House, Mr. Frank of Massachusetts,
and if his conviction is upheld ..., the gentleman from Ohio Mr.
Lukens.''
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., was presiding over the House. She
interrupted Dannemeyer, saying he was discussing matters before the
ethics committee and that Rule 14 of the House prevents members
from ``from engaging in personalities.''
   Continuing, Dannemeyer then referred to Frank as ``Member X'' as
he read an editorial from the Boston Globe calling for his
resignation.
   Unsoeld said, ``The gentleman will cease,'' read him the rules
and a 1987 ruling by the speaker suggesting his remarks were
improper. Dannemeyer protested that ``I have merely made reference
to Member X.'' Unsoeld responded that he was referring to newspaper
stories ``which named members.''
   Frank spokesman Doug Cahn, asked about Dannemeyer's remarks,
said, ``Barney is continuing to cooperate with the ethics
investigation, where this matter has been properly referred.''
   Bill Jarrell, spokesman for Lukens, said: ``His whole point is
moot because we're going to win the appeal. It achieved what he was
after, because he'll get his name in the newspaper.''

<HEAD>U.S. Concerned About Cease-Fire Breakdown</HEAD>

   The State Department said Friday that renewed
fighting in Sudan is endangering relief supplies for thousands of
starving people and urged both the government and the rebels to
observe a truce agreement.
   ``The United States government is deeply concerned by
indications that the cease-fire in the Sudan is breaking down,''
said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   A truce in the stalemated civil war was agreed to in April by
the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army to allow
international food shipments to be delivered.
   A military junta took power in Sudan in June, promising to end
the six-year civil war, and has extended the truce month-by-month.
The rebels have gone along and fighting had all but stopped.
   But Boucher said the rebel army, which is seeking autonomy for
the largely animist and Christian population in southern Sudan from
the Moslem-dominated central government, attacked the
government-held town of Kurmuk last weekend, forcing the town's
evacuation.
   On Tuesday, two unidentified planes bombed the rebel-held town
of Yirol, he said.
   ``The cease-fire was vitally important in allowing the movement
of relief supplies into southern Sudan and averting mass
starvation. Renewed fighting will severely hamper this continuing
relief effort,'' Boucher said.
   A U.N.-led relief effort, to which the United States has given
$115 million, was launched this summer to prevent the famine that
killed at least 250,000 Sudanese last year.
   ``We're particularly distressed by the breakdown at this time
because of earlier indications that both sides were thinking
positively about the peace process,'' Boucher said.
   He called on both sides to resume the peace negotiations they
began last August as soon as possible.

<HEAD>Vatican, Russian Church Officials Meet on Ukraine Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of the Vatican and the Russian
Orthodox Church called for a calm resolution of their dispute over
an unofficial Ukrainian church that pledges its allegiance to Rome,
Tass said Friday.
   ``The spirit of Christian love requires all to renounce violence
which not ony does not solve any problems but impedes progress
toward a genuine solution,'' the Soviet news agency quoted a joint
statement as saying.
   The Vatican delegation led by Cardinal Johannes Willebrands came
to Moscow on Thursday carrying a message from Pope John Paul II to
Patriarch Pimen of the Russian church, it said. Tass gave no
further details of the meetings or the statement.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was formed in 1596 in the Western
Ukraine on territory then a part of the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom.
It was forcibly merged with the Orthodox church when large parts of
the territory became Soviet land after World War II, and went
underground.
   But it has emerged in Lvov and other Western Ukrainian cities in
the past two years as one of the leading forces of resurgent ethnic
feelings. Members demand that the government recognize the church,
which is called the Uniate Church by most Soviet officials, but
Orthodox Church officials are against it.
   The dispute is likely to come up if President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev meets the pope when he travels to Italy later this month.
   Tass said the status of the Ukrainian Catholic Church ``has
become especially urgent recently because of illegal acts by
Uniates against Orthodox clergy and believers.'' It said they tried
to seize the Transfiguration Church in Lvov by force during a
service, and that prosecutors have started criminal proceedings.
   Anatoly Dotsenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki human
rights group, rejected official versions of events at the
Transfiguration Church as distorted.
   In an interview Thursday, Dotsenko said the church's two priests
and the congregation decided to switch allegiance from the Orthodox
Church to the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   He said several other priests and congregations in the area had
done the same thing in recent months, apparently because they
believe the Ukrainian Catholic Church soon will be legalized.

   Abortion-rights activists said Friday that
hundreds of thousands of people are expected to participate in more
than 1,000 rallies and other events in 150 cities on Nov. 12.
   The largest of the rallies will be in the nation's capital,

last April in one of the largest demonstrations ever in Washington.
   Organizers did not say how large a crowd they expect at the

   The events will be tied together by two coastal gatherings

sunrise candlelight service in Kennebunk, Maine, near Bush's
vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, and a sunset candlelight vigil
in San Francisco.
   Both are intended ``to bring out the hypocrisy, the cynicism of
George Bush's kinder, gentler nation, which does not involve
women,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National

<HEAD>New Jersey Races Feature Glossy, Sophisticated and Vicious Mailings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Glossy, sophisticated and downright nasty
fliers are filling mailboxes around New Jersey in a campaign that
some state lawmakers say has never before been so concentrated,
glitzy or vicious.
   One campaign flier depicts Assemblywoman Marion Crecco as a
poodle, decked out in sunglasses seated in the front seat of a
Jaguar sports car.
   ``She promised to fix our insurance problem,'' says the
Democratic attack on Ms. Crecco, noting instead she introduced a
bill to provide health insurance for pets.
   ``I think it's deplorable. This is about the lowest form of
campaigning,'' said Ms. Crecco. ``It's very demeaning to all women
in government to depict me as this poodle, sitting there in
sunglasses. This is gutteral campaigning.''
   Stakes are high in the state Legislature race. If the Democrats,
who already control the state Senate, can wrest control of the
Assembly, they would be able to redraw the state's congressional
districts in line with the 1990 Census to give their party an edge
in U.S. House races through the decade.
   David Welch, a Washington-based consultant responsible for the
Republican mailings, said mail warfare has been used in California
since the 1970s. And it is particularly attractive for New Jersey
candidates because they usually can't afford the cost of television
ads in the expensive New York and Philadelphia broadcast markets.
   ``If California is the major league, states like New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Florida have become the triple
A league,'' he said.
   ``The pieces are designed to deliver a very purposeful and
specific message,'' he said, and if most are negative it is because
the campaigns are nasty.
   But Cliff Pintak, the Republican's strategist for Assembly
campaigns, said one candidate's view of nasty is another's
``comparative campaigning.''
   ``Contrasts are what voters make their decisions on. Just like
they want to know the difference between a Dodge and a Chevy, they
want to know the difference between the people they vote into
office,'' Pintak said.
   The scurrilous Assembly attacks come after the 1988 U.S. Senate
race in which challenger Peter Dawkins referred to Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., as a ``swampdog.''
   And this year's race for governor, pitting Rep. James Florio,
D-N.J., and Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., is also particularly
vicious, with each using television commercials in which their
opponent's nose grows a la Pinocchio with every lie allegedly told.
   Even the lovable lion from the ``Wizard of Oz'' is not sacred.
   Democrats in northern New Jersey used a sepia photograph of the
Oz cast member to attack Assemblyman Pat Roma.
   ``There's something he doesn't have ... C-c-c-courage!'' says
the ad, charging Roma promised both sides of the abortion debate
that he would side with them.
   ``It's a desperate attempt by the opposition to cloud the real
issues of the campaign,'' said Bea Kroncke, a Roma aide.
   Another Democratic ad features a ``DiGaetano cocktail.'' Inside
the flier, the glass is filled with a putrid purple liquid and
attacks former Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano for voting against a
storage-tank licensing bill that he considered flawed.
   ``Go ahead, take a sip,'' the ad invites voters.
   About 100 different pieces of campaign mail have been stuffed
into mail boxes in about a dozen hotly contested districts. Eleven
days before Tuesday's election, Assembly candidates had shattered
previous spending records, pouring $5 million into their races,
most going to direct mail.
   Steve DeMicco, a Democratic strategist in New Jersey, said the
mailings hold opponents accountable for their records, and do it
with style.
   ``We're competing with a very sophisticated mix of media out
there in the New Jersey market. We've got to produce pieces that
catch the eye,'' DeMicco said. ``It's high quality, high impact
stuff.''
   In the 10th District along the Atlantic coast, where Republican
Assemblyman Robert Singer is fighting a challenge by Democrat
Marlene Lynch Ford, both sides have gone for the jugular.
   One flier features a tough-looking President Bush and his famous
``Read my lips'' no taxes pledge.
   Open it up to learn: ``Bob Singer didn't listen'' because he
broke his vow to fight tax increases by voting for two hikes.
   Singer struck back with a mock cereal box called ``Flakes,''
emblazoned with Ms. Ford's picture. It advertises her as ``Extra
Sugar Coated'' and promises a free American Civil Liberties Union
membership card to anyone voting for her.
   Ms. Ford's campaign struck back with a flier that shows the
children's ``Slinky'' toy.
   ``It flips, It flops, it bounces ... ,'' the ad says, attacking
Singer for flip-flopping on his tax pledge and talking tough on
crime while backing a bill making it easier to buy handguns.

<HEAD>Bust at Pot Party Raises Questions at Wesleyan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of Wesleyan University students
say they thought they had the school's tacit approval to revive an
annual drug party, and say the arrest of only one of the revelers
proves their point.
   ``They didn't really do anything to stop it,'' said sophomore
Marc Flacks of last week's bash in a university dining hall, dubbed
the ``Smoke Out.''
   ``They brought in a few cops instead of a whole army. It seemed
to me that they were saying, `We don't approve of this but we're
not doing anything to stop it.'''
   The Oct. 27 party, which was advertised by posters around
campus, was to revive a lapsed 15-year-old school tradition at the
prestigious, liberal arts college. Students gathered in a dining
hall to beat drums, clang cowbells, rattle maracas and smoke
marijuana.
   A second day of partying, called ``Uncle Duke Day'' _ named
after the self-indulgent, drug abusing character in the comic strip
``Doonesbury'' _ was devoted to taking LSD and playing party games,
Flacks said.
   Wesleyan officials defended the university's anti-drug policy,
noting that they tipped police off to the party and that two
students were arrested last year for selling drugs.
   ``Wesleyan doesn't condone drugs,'' said Bobby Wayne Clark, a
university spokesman. ``It's not a drug sanctuary. What we do know
about and what we can respond to, we will respond to.''
   But Flacks and several other students say the university's
response, combined with the school's stated policy, showed that the
university tacitly approved of the use of marijuana and LSD.
   ``What they're saying silently is that they don't consider it
serious,'' said Louis Maggiotto, a sophomore from Hastings on
Hudson, N.Y.
   The school's policy, contained in its code of conduct, defines
the use of cocaine and heroin as ``serious breaches,'' but does not
mention the use of marijuana or LSD.
   ``In the blue book, which is the sort of Magna Carta for the
school, there's nothing explicit about marijuana or acid,'' said
Flacks, a resident of Santa Barbara, Calif. ``So there is a kind of
tacit approval of marijuana and acid. Arresting just one person was
still sort of an approval.''
   School officials conceded the difficulty of policing casual drug
use by students.
   ``Wesleyan shouldn't make a bunch of rules for cosmetic reasons
that it can't enforce or has no intention to enforce,'' said Edgar
Beckham, dean of the college. ``In order to keep rules credible,
you have to keep them enforceable. What does the banning of a
single joint do for the institution?''
   Beckham said the university will probably re-examine the policy
in light of threats from the Bush administration to make federal
education grants contingent on the toughness of a school's
anti-drug policy.
   Wesleyan is a private university with an enrollment of about
3,400.

   The people gathering here Friday
don't mind if you call them fat. In fact, they prefer that to
chubby, pleasantly plump or overweight.
   ``We use the word fat, because we are fat. We could call
ourselves overweight, but over what weight? Fat is basically pretty
clear,'' said Marilyn Rock, co-chairwoman of the local chapter of
the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance.
   About 100 people from the Midwest chapter of the Sacramento,
Calif.-based group is meeting here through Saturday for its annual
convention, which includes exercise tips for large people and
speeches by fat activists.
   The group's mission is to help fat people build self-esteem to
face a society with ``fat phobia'' that sees them as freakish and
repulsive, the group's founder, William Fabrey, said Friday.
   ``We're not saying people should be fat or shouldn't be fat.
We're just saying that fat people shouldn't be harassed because of
the size of their waistline,'' said Fabrey, who is slightly
larger-than-average at 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds.
   Fabrey said he founded the group in 1969 because he was angered
by the hostility of society toward people, especially women, with
excess pounds. He met his wife, Nancy, through the organization in
1980.
   The group now has about 2,500 members worldwide, including human
rights advocates of all sizes. An estimated 38 million Americans
are heavier than insurance chart sizes.
   ``Fat people are bashed and battered all of their lives,'' Rock
said. ``If you are eating an ice cream cone, people look at you as
if you're sick.''
   Fabrey, an electrical engineer from Charlottesville, Va., said
there have been improvements over the years with more manufacturers
of clothes for large women and an emphasis on health rather than
being skinny. And scientists are gaining a deeper understanding of
the causes of obesity.
   ``What we're seeing is mothers who were raised in the Twiggy era
becoming hyper-conscious about their weight and the weight of their
children,'' said Dr. David Garner, a psychiatry professor at
Michigan State University who will speak at the convention Saturday.
   ``So many people are so frightened of being fat, they are
starving themselves, sometimes to death.''

<TEXT>
   Maverick politician Boris N. Yeltsin launched a
frontal attack Friday on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, accusing
him of taking on the role of top conservative in the Soviet
leadership.
   He told more than 1,000 people at a public forum for leaders of
the Soviet parliament's opposition faction that Gorbachev had
replaced hard-line Politburo member Yegor Ligachev ``at the head of
the right.''
   He also charged that at least four lavish country homes, or
dachas, costing ``tens of million of rubles'' have been built in
recent years for the Communist Party chief and head of state.
Gorbachev has acknowledged one such summer home was built on the
Black Sea, but he insisted it was only for his use while in office
and would not remain his personal vacation spot.
   Yeltsin said Gorbachev, his one-time sponsor, was clamping down
on the press and personally had forbidden the faction to put out
its own newspaper.
   The Soviet president ``openly threatened the press, pointing his
finger,'' Yeltsin said, referring to an Oct. 13 meeting at which
Gorbachev rebuked several top editors and suggested the chief of
the country's most popular newspaper resign.
   Gorbachev launched glasnost, the Kremlin's policy of greater
openness, soon after coming to power in 1985, but in recent weeks
he has moved to rein in the free-wheeling press. According to
accounts of the cloed-door meeting, he chastised the editors for
presenting too frightening a picture of the country's problems and
demanded they offer solutions to problems, not just criticism.
   Historian Yuri Afanasyev, also a leader of the opposition
Inter-Regional Group and a recent Gorbachev target, said the editor
of the newspaper in his home district was fired for publishing his
unorthodox views. The staff voted to strike in protest, he said.
   A draft law that would have led to a freer Soviet press has been
taken off the agenda for the current legislative session of the
Supreme Soviet, deputies said.
   Yeltsin, who was considered a Gorbachev protege until he was
fired from his post as Moscow party chief two years ago after
complaining that reforms were moving too slowly, was later elected
to the Congress of People's Deputies by a landslide.
   He took advantage of the rare public forum Friday _ he claimed
he is virtually banned from television and the Soviet press _ to
strike back at party officials on a wide range of personal issues
that have helped establish his image as a demagogue to some and a
national idol to others.
   He claimed footage shown on Soviet TV of his slurred speech
during a talk in the United States earlier this fall had been
doctored to stretch out the vowels and make him appear drunk. He
also charged there were a ``mass of discrepancies'' in Interior
Ministry claims about a mysterious incident in which a sopping wet
Yeltsin reportedly told police he had been pushed off a bridge in a
late-night attempt on his life.
   However, he offered no explanation for what actually happened
that night.
   The snowy-haired Siberian particularly objected to
``intentionally spread'' rumors that the imbroglio involved a
woman, and to Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin's statement that
Yeltsin was all bruised when he approached the police.
   ``What did he do, inspect me in the bathhouse or something?'' he
boomed.
   Within minutes of accusing Gorbachev of moving to the right,
Yeltsin accused the Soviet leader of trying to cater to both ends
of the political spectrum.
   ``Gorbachev, the eternal proponent of half-measures and
compromises, can hardly bring any real move forward,'' he said.
``He wants both to please the party apparatus and for the people
not to reject him. That can't be. You have to define yourelf.
Either you're with the people or you're with the party apparatus
that has held power for 72 years and brought the people to the
point they're at now.''
   For all his attacks on Gorbachev, Yeltsin turned coy when asked
what his program would be if elected president.
   ``Don't provoke me,'' he snapped.
   He said Gorbachev had visited him in the hospital soon after he
was fired from his Moscow post and offered him a government job but
told him, ``I'll never let you near political work.''
   Yeltsin smiled triumphantly: ``But the voters of Moscow thought
differently. Thank you very much.''
   The remark drew a roar of applause.

   Two bombs damaged the home of
the commander of a counterinsurgency battallion Friday, but no one
was injured, the officer said.
   Col. Orlando Carranza blamed the attack on leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, which has been
at war with the government for a decade.
   `Our houses shouldn't be military objectives,'' Carranza told
reporters.
   He said his two young children, a servant and two of his
security guards were in the house at the time of the blasts. The
explosions damaged the roof and broke windows but caused no
injuries, he said.
   The attack was the latest in a wave of violence this week that
has killed 12 people, injured 51 and prompted the FMLN to withdraw
from peace talks with the government. The next round of talks had
been scheduled for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela.
   The violence began Monday with an FMLN attack on Defense Forces
headquarters that killed one civilian. The headquarters of a
leftist union and a human rights group were bombed the following
day, killing 11 people. Union and rights officials blamed the
military for the bombings.

   An American nun who was feared kidnapped after
she received threatening letters reappeared Friday after being
missing for less than a day, the State Department said.
   Sister Diana Ortiz, who is associated with the Ursuline Convent
in Kentucky, was reported missing about noon Thursday in the nearby
town of Antigua and reappeared Friday morning.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said she was
at the Maryknoll office in Guatemala City on Friday, but he had no
details on the reasons for her disappearance.
   She reportedly had been receiving threatening letters, prompting
concern that she had been kidnapped.
   Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio said in an interview late
Thursday in Guatemala that the 31-year-old nun had gone into the
garden of the Belene Sisters Retreat House, a former convent in the
town of Antigua, on Thursday and ``she did not return at lunch
time.''
   Guatemala has had a resurgence of assassinations, disappearances
and other violence since mid-July.
   A native of Grants, N.M., Sister Ortiz taught school in
Owensboro and Hawesville, Ky., before going to Guatemala two years
ago.
   The Louisville, Ky., Courier-Journal quoted Sister Mary
Elizabeth Dallard as saying Sister Ortiz had received at least
seven letters since January warning her to leave the country.
   She did leave for a time after an incident in Guatemala City in
mid-July, Sister Dallard said.

<HEAD>Industry Warns Public on Limits to Degradable Plastics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern over the environment has led plastics manufacturers to
produce ``degradable'' trash bags and diapers designed to
disintegrate under sunlight. But some industry officials now
concede that such products won't solve the garbage crisis _ and
could be harmful.
   In a draft statement circulated Friday to industry, government
and environmental officials, plastics producers concede that
degradable plastics have ``little significant role'' in reducing
landfill and could deter recycling.
   ``If the public develops false expectations for degradable
plastics _ that it will magically solve the solid waste problem _
we are fearful of an overreaction against the industry,'' Karl
Kamena, director of government affairs for Dow Plastics, said
Thursday.
   Dow, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co., makes degradable plastic
six-pack rings.
   Industry officials say they worry that disillusionment over
degradable products will lead to a backlash, and bans against
non-recyclable plastics.
   More than two dozen officials met last summer in Concord, Mass.,
in a forum sponsored by the Council on Plastics and Packaging in
the Environment, a coalition of Dow and other large plastics
corporations. Acceptance of the draft statement is a formality,
Kamena said.
   Degradable plastic does have its defenders.
   ``We have a very environmentally friendly product,'' said Jerry
L. Petak, business development manager for Archer-Daniels-Midland
Corp., which produces an additive to plastic _ corn starch _ that
speeds the breakdown. ``There are certainly applications for it.''
   Degradable products, which were introduced in the United States
only about two years ago, have become successful commercially,
especially in garbage bags. No figures are available, but the
country's two biggest selling brands _ Hefty and Glad bags _
exclusively use the ingredients to make the bags disintegrate.
   Degradable products are designed to break down to their basic
components when exposed to air and sunlight. But entombed in
oxygen-starved landfills, they don't disintegrate, industry
officials say. Other plastic degradables include grocery bags and
sheets used on farms to hold down weeds.
   Kamena and other industry officials said degradable plastics do
have beneficial uses. But the degradable materials ``contaminate''
recyclable plastics, producing a less sturdy mix, the report said.
And they could lead consumers to believe there is no reason to
recycle.
   Allen Gray, a Mobil spokesman, said his company makes degradable
Hefty trash bags only because consumers demanded them.
   ``You're in a competitive situation right now. Consumers have
indicated a preference for the degradable bags,'' he said.
   He said the trash bags are ``no help as far as solving the
nation's solid waste problem.''
   Environmentalists are sharply critical of how companies sell
their product.
   ``When you see degradable bags sold in stores as being helpful
to the environment, that's all a hoax,'' said Darlene Snow, an
official at the National Solid Wastes Management Association in
Washington.
   Hefty trash bags show an eagle soaring over a pine tree with a
headline ``Degradable.'' On the back, the text says the bags show
``a step in our commitment to a better environment.'' Glad trash
bags' headlines say ``Degradable'' and ``Safe for the
Environment.'' On the back, though, the text points out that the
material will be ``inert'' once buried in a dump.
   And a TV commercial by Archer-Daniels-Midland suggests a trash
can full of plastic would vanish when its degradable agent is added.
   ``It's kind of hard to tell the story in a 30-second TV spot,''
Petak said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has recently begun studies
on how the plastic residue will affect wildlife, ground water and
marine life.
   Makers of the degradable plastic say their studies show the
residue is safe, but environmentalists fear it could contain toxic
materials often used to make plastics stronger.
   ``The more and more people talk about degradable plastics, the
more and more questions are raised,'' said Susan Mooney of the
EPA's municipal solid waste program.

<HEAD>Estonian Official Says Soviet Republic May Have Own Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonia's top economic official said Friday
that the Soviet republic hopes to be have its own currency perhaps
by 1991.
   Deputy Prime Minister Rein Otsason also contended that the
republic's drive toward achieving economic independence should help
strengthen rather than jeopardize Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's efforts to restructure the Soviet Union.
   ``We think our policy in Estonia is not a danger to perestroika,
but is an important part of perestroika,'' he said.
   Otsason, chief of Estonia's economic planning commission, spoke
at a luncheon sponsored by the Institute of International
Economics, a non-profit economic research organization.
   He said that establishing an independent currency system would
be important for Estonia because ``it is the only way for us to
realize the benefits of effective foreign trade.''
   Asked how soon this could be achieved, Otsason said that an
``optimistic plan'' looked toward launching the currency before the
end of next year. But if more ``intermediate steps'' are necessary,
he said, implementing the Estonian currency could take two years or
longer.
   Growth of East-West trade with the Soviet Union has been
significantly hampered due to the fact that the Soviet ruble is not
freely convertible with Western currencies.
   Otsason said Estonia eventually would like to become a member of
the European Common Market, although that would probably pose ``a
very difficult political and economic problem.'' The republic also
may seek to join the International Monetary Fund, he said.
   A year ago, Estonia became the first of the 15 constituent
Soviet republics to openly defy Moscow by proclaiming itself
``sovereign'' and declaring its right to veto Soviet laws that
conflicted with decisions of the local legislature.
   Moscow rejected those claims at the time, but since then Estonia
and the other republics have been granted broadened rights in
running their own economies and setting local policies.
   Otsason said that in other economic areas, Estonia has reached
agreement in principle with Moscow on establishing its own budget
and tax systems.
   He said Estonia wanted to retain its extensive economic
relations with other Soviet republics, but ``we in Estonia do not
want to develop these relations through Moscow ministries.''

   The Senate voted on Friday to issue gold and
silver coins to mark the 50th anniversary in 1991 of the
presidential memorial at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota's Black
Hills.
   The legislation, which now goes to the House, calls for the
minting of 500,000 gold coins bearing a face value of $5 and 2.5
million silver $1 coins.
   Both bullion coins would be sold at a premium with half the
profits being used to reduce the federal budget deficit and half to
be given to the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Society to
improve, enlarge and renovate the monument and its facilities and
grounds.
   An additional 2.5 million half-dollar Mount Rushmore coins would
be struck as legal tender.
   All three coins would bear the legend, ``Mount Rushmore: Shrine
of Democracy, Golden Anniversary, 1941-1991'' They would be issued
on Jan. 1, 1991.
   Giant portrait heads of presidents George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt were carved out
of Mount Rushmore's granite wall by the artist, Gutzon Borglum.
   Borglum died in 1941 and the monument was completed by his son,
Lincoln.
   Mount Rushmore is maintained by the National Park Service and is
one of its most heavily visited attractions.

   About 400 Czechoslovak intellectuals and
artists were stopped from leaving their country while en route to a
conference in Poland, organizers said Friday.
   Historians who were to deliver lectures and photographers whose
works were to be displayed were among those forced off trains at
the border by Czechoslovak guards.
   Another 1,500 Czechoslovakians managed to reach the three-day
symposium at a university in this southwestern city, and their
Polish hosts said they hoped the non-communist government of Prime
Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki would file a protest with Czechoslovak
officials. The conference was convened by the Polish-Czechoslovak
Solidarity organization.
   ``We feel obliged to take some necessary steps to let the Czech
government know that this should not happen,'' said Janusz Grzelak,
a deputy minister of education, who added that he was not speaking
on behalf of the Polish government.
   ``I am ashamed of this obstructive behavior of the Czechoslovak
government,'' said Franciszek Janoch, a physicist and president of
the Charter 77 Foundation of Stockholm, which supports Czechoslovak
dissidents, in the conference's opening address.
   Miroszlaw Jaszynski, one of the conference organizers, said
playwright Vlaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia'he
seminar, which had the title ``Culture Perplexed Between
Totalitarianism and Commercialism.''
   It is one of the largest independent East European seminars
organized in Poland and focuses on Czechoslovakia, where hard-line
authorities are resisting the kind of democratic changes under way
in Hungary and Poland.
   ``There is nothing in Czechoslovakia resembling a normal
political culture that we might feel part of. There is no natural
... self-structuring of society. There is no real public life,''
Havel said in an essay prepared for the conference and read by a
Czechoslovak exile.
   The meeting was conceived in April by Adam Michnik, now a
Solidarity deputy in the Polish parliament and editor of the
independent daily Gazeta Wyborcza, as a way to focus international
attention on Havel, who was then in prison.
   Havel has since been released, although he was detained again
while Czechoslovakia marked the 71st anniversary of its
independence. The conference is designed to be a forum for
independent Czechoslovak culture.
   An exhibition of photographs on the brutalitiy of the 1968
Soviet-led invasion that crushed dissent in Czechoslovakia hangs in
the walls of the university. There is a large display of
underground writing, and a long line at a bookstore selling banned
literature.
   But many events collapsed for lack of the participants.
   The walls of one art gallery were covered with picture frames,
the name of the artist and title of the work neatly attached. The
paintings, however, were missing _ seized at the border.
   Several films and a theater group performance had to be canceled.
   A member of a group of 20 Czechoslovakians forced off a train
Thursday night told the Polish state news agency PAP that men
without uniforms who accompanied border guards ordered them to get
off the train before the border and confiscated their invitations.
   The officials told the group that their trip to Poland would
``run counter to the reason of state,'' the PAP report said.
   The group filed an account of their treatment at the Polish
Embassy in Prague on Friday, protesting that the officials' actions
were ``not reconcilable with friendly cooperation between the two
countries,'' PAP said.
   Still, there is a strong Czechoslovak presence, including many
exiles, at the conference. Also invited were Hungarians, Soviets
and even Barbel Bohley, a leader of the East German New Forum
opposition group.
   The conference was the latest show of unity between opposition
leaders in Czechoslovakia and Poland. The Wroclaw branch of
Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity is the most active in Poland.

<TEXT>
   Television on Friday broadcast confessions
by four Iranians who said they were spies for the CIA, fueling
anti-American sentiment on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
storming of the U.S. Embassy.
   The hour-long program on state television was shown after the
evening news as Iran prepared a display of anti-West hatred at a
demonstration planned Saturday outside the former U.S. Embassy
compound.
   The compound was stormed Nov. 4, 1979, by militants who held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. The seizure shattered
Washington-Tehran relations eight months after the overthrow of the
pro-Western monarchy and the rise of the fundamentalist Islamic
republic led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a leader of the
hard-liners and closely linked with Shiite Moslem fundamentalists
holding Western hostages in Lebanon, will be the main speaker at
the rally.
   It will be the first public appearance by Mohtashemi, 43, since
he was dropped by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's
so-called pragmatists, when he formed his government in August.
   Radical leaders have been whipping up anti-American passions for
days, ignoring what had appeared to be government efforts to keep
the anniversary a low-key affair.
   Rafsanjani, attempting to revitalize Iran's economy after last
year's cease-fire in the 8-year war with Iraq, has been seeking to
improve relations with the West.
   Iranian officials have said dozens of spies who provided
Washington's Central Intelligence Agency with information were
arrested after a network was broken last spring.
   They refused to give a specific number, saying that would
provide the CIA with information, but more than a dozen Iranians
have appeared on television in past months and said they worked for
the CIA.
   One of the alleged spies shown on television Friday identified
himself as Col. Masoud Babaie and said he had been an air force
pilot. He broke down in tears as he cautioned his countrymen
against ``pursuing dreams of living in the West that turn into
nighmares.''
   He said he was recruited while in Turkey seeking political
asylum in the United States.
   He claimed he was approached by a Mr. Thompson, who he said was
a security officer at the consulate in Istanbul and promised to
help the pilot obtain asylum in the United States if he went back
to Iran and worked for the CIA for two years.
   Babaie said he accepted the offer and the American put him in
contact with an agent called ``Jimmy'' in Germany. Babaie said he
provided the CIA with information on the air force through the
agent, using coded radio messages, invisible ink reports and
telephone contacts with Germany.
   Another alleged spy identified himself as Jamshid-Amiri Bigwand.
   He said he worked as a researcher for the Shiraz Petrochemical
Co. in central Iran and was recruited by the CIA in Japan while
seeking a visa for the United States after the Iranian revolution.
   He gave this account: An official at the U.S. consulate in Tokyo
named Joe offered him a monthly salary of $1,200 in return for
information and ``introduced me to another man called Tim.''
   ``Tim hooked me up to a polygraph machine. ... I was taught to
use invisible ink, and to transmit and receive coded radio messages
after that.''
   The CIA's main interest was information on ``the capability of
Iran to develop a nuclear bomb.''
   Bigwand said he reported Iran had the ``means and expertise''
for such a program.
   The other alleged agents identified themselves as Mahmoud Zari
Feghneh and Kazem Afkhami.
   Feghneh said he was recruited in Turkey two years ago and wrote
110 reports to the CIA from that time until his arrest in September.
   He said in 1987 he provided information on terrain around
Mashhad in southern Iran that could be used to land U.S. troops.
   Kazem Afkhami said he was recruited in Turkey and the CIA didn't
ask much from him. ``They only wanted information on the communist
penetration of Mashhad,'' he said.

   The 63 train cars full of sewer sludge
have found a landing spot here after Louisiana residents kicked up
a stink about the smelly cargo.
   ``I see no problem at all with receiving the train. The county
handles much more hazardous waste every single day,'' said Mayor
Louis Jackson. ``Moss Point prides itself in being the industrial
backbone of Mississippi.''
   But state government wasn't so friendly.
   ``We don't want it here. We're going to do what we have to do to
get it out of here,'' said Mike Goff, Gov. Ray Mabus' special
assistant in Jackson for natural resources.
   The 63 plastic-covered, open train cars were hauled out of
Schriever, La., late Thursday. They were a source of controversy
the past few weeks in several southern Louisiana towns.
   GSX Land Treatment Inc. had contracted to have the 12,000 tons
of sewer sludge disposed of at White Castle, La. But residents
along the route complained.
   In a news release issued Thursday afternoon, South
Carolina-based GSX said the sewage would be taken to the rail yard
in Mississippi for ``stabilization and deodorization.''
   After that, the company said, it would do one of three things:
ship the sludge back to Louisiana, where it would be disposed of at
the GSX treatment facility at White Castle; ship it to another
landfill in another, unspecified state; or deliver it to a
landowner in another state for use as ``soil conditioner.''
   Dick Paul, vice president of the Mississippi Export Railroad,
said it would take about a week to treat the waste here and
transfer it to trucks for movement elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge in California has taken the
unusual step of ordering more than a dozen government agencies to
delete from their records any mention that former NASA
administrator James C. Beggs once was indicted.
   U.S. District Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez, now an appeals court
judge, signed the order in September and only recently notified
Beggs, now in private industry.
   ``This is the ultimate vindication, I guess,'' said Beggs' wife,
Mary. ``In fact, what they are saying is `it never happened.'''
   Beggs and three other former General Dynamics executives were
indicted in December 1985 on charges that they illegally billed the
government for cost overruns on a prototype of the Sgt. York
anti-aircraft gun. The Justice Department dropped the charges 18
months later, saying it had made a mistake.
   The judge ordered the agencies ``to expunge the records of the
indictment, arraignment and related documents.'' His notice went,
among others, to the Defense Department, the Justice Department,
the FBI, the armed services and agencies involved with defense
contracts.
   After the charges were filed, Beggs took a leave of absence and
his top assistant, only 10 days on the job, took over. Then came
the space shuttle Challegner accident with its loss of seven lives
and Beggs resigned to give his successor, William O. Graham, full
control.
   After the charges were dismissed, Beggs called a news conference
to say that despite an ``ill-advised, ill-considered decision'' by
the Justice Department to prosecute him he was not bitter.
   Beggs did not return to government service and instead took a
position as chairman of Spacehab, a company developing expanded
living quarters to be used by astronauts aboard space shuttles. He
also formed a space consulting firm.
   Beggs and the other three men later received a letter of apology
from the attorney general. Since then, Beggs has been awarded the
Robert H. Goddard Trophy, one of the most coveted aerospace awards,
and the 1989 NASA Distinguished Service Medal.

burst of bullets into a son of jailed mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo,
sources said.
   One suspect in the bungled, mob-linked assassination attempt on
Nicodemo Scarfo Jr. is Steven Vento Jr., 21, his attorney said. Two
sources, who refused to be identified by name, said there are three
suspects in the machine-pistol shooting Halloween night at a
restaurant.
   ``My client is innocent, and I advised him to take a lie
detector test to prove it because his life is in danger,'' said A.
Charles Peruto Jr., representing Vento.
   ``He is not involved. He was dining in a restaurant a block
away. The idea that he would do this one week after getting out of
jail is absurd. I'm afraid somebody's going to kill him,'' Peruto
said. ``In my law career I have never advised any client to give
any statement of any kind, but this is a different case because it
involves a person's life.''
   Vento became ``possibly the No. 1 suspect,'' Peruto said,
because he was involved in a drug dispute with the Scarfo family
several years ago.
   The several bullets that struck the 24-year-old Scarfo just
missed the heart and other vital organs. He is expected to be
released next week from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.
   While the victim reportedly is declining to cooperate with
authorities, police appeared uncertain whether the shooting was
locally inspired or ordered by New York gangsters seeking to take
control of the mob here, and its lucrative casino territory in
nearby Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``It's still speculative at this stage, and there are several
theories,'' said Joel Friedman, head of the Justice Department's
Organized Crime Strike Force in eastern Pennsylvania.
   ``One, obviously, is that it is a local hit, and the other
indicates it could have been from New York. It's too early to draw
any final conclusions, and you just can't rule out a possible New
York connection and their efforts to fill the vacuum,'' he said.
   That vacuum was created when Friedman's prosecutorial team
convicted the elder Scarfo and 15 of his mobsters last year on
racketeering charges that included murder, extortion, drug dealing
and illegal gambling.
   All are serving long prison terms with Scarfo getting the
stiffest, 55 years. Scarfo also has a 14-year federal extortion
sentence plus a life term for a Philadelphia murder, making it
unlikely he'll ever be free again.

<HEAD>GOP Criticized For Blaming Catastrophic Plan on Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems nobody wants all the credit for the
Medicare catastrophic health-care program that was enacted with
fanfare last year _ not now that it's been repudiated by irate
senior citizens.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., on Friday blasted the Republican
National Committee for sending out a fund-raising letter that
includes this description for the genesis of the catastrophic
package:
   ``Before President Bush was elected, the Democrats in Congress
passed legislation ... and placed a tax on senior citizens to pay
for Catastrophic Health Insurance.''
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said
the letter from GOP Chairman Lee Atwater was ``at best misleading
and at worst downright deceitful.''
   ``This monumental but failed effort was truly bipartisan,''
Pryor said. ``If we made a mistake, we made it together.''
   Pryor said that while Democrats controlled the Congress last
year, ``76 percent of the Republican senators and 61 percent of the
Republican representatives voted in favor of it.''
   Republican National Committee spokesman B.J. Cooper said the
letter was written by a independent vendor who neglected GOP
instructions to delete the section on the catastrophic law. Cooper
said it was deleted after the first mailing.
   The catastrophic package was signed into law at a Rose Garden
ceremony where then-President Reagan hailed its innovative
finanacing mechanisms _ which include the surtax that has generated
all the senior opposition.
   Beating a bipartisan and hasty retreat, the House last month
voted to scrap the program, and the Senate to preserve only limited
benefits and cancel the surtax. The two chambers have yet to take
final action to roll back all or part of the program.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration may
propose a requirement that children under 2 travel in separate
seats from their parents on commercial flights, an FAA official
said Friday at the close of a hearing on a fatal DC-10 crash.
   Guidelines from the FAA allow children of that age to sit for
free on an adult's lap, although the agency recommends they be
strapped in a child restraint device in a separate seat.
   Five children under 2 were doubled up with adults on board
United Flight 232, which crashed July 19. One was a 23-month-old
boy who died with 111 other people, United spokesman Robert Doughty
said. In all, 184 people survived the crash at Sioux City's airport.
   Donnell Pollard, the FAA's cabin safety specialist, said the
agency expects to recommend a new child safety policy to the U.S.
Department of Transportation by the end of the year. But she said
she is not sure the recommendation will go as far as requiring
separate seats for children under 2.
   ``We're considering a lot of factors,'' Ms. Pollard testified on
the last day of a four-day National Transportation Safety Board
hearing on the crash. ``I guess I could summarize it by saying
we're looking at practically every aspect that anybody could think
of.''
   The NTSB is expected to issue a ruling next summer on the
probable cause of the crash. Experts believe a faulty rear engine
fan disk split in two during flight, severing the plane's hydraulic
lines that are essential for pilot control.
   Safety board records show passenger Sylvia Tsao, 30, of
Albuquerque, N.M., was not injured in the crash but her
23-month-old son Evan was killed. Ms. Tsao lost her grip on the boy
during an emergency landing in which the plane cartwheeled across
the runway, split apart and burst into flames.
   ``Infants, toddlers, young children's safety should no longer be
ignored as if they do not count,'' Ms. Tsao told federal
investigators after the crash. ``If these kids need aircraft seats,
then parents must be warned that they should put kids in them.''
   The cause of the boy's death was listed as smoke inhalation.
   During questioning of Ms. Pollard on Friday, Fidel Gonzales of
the Association of Flight Attendants union pressed for a commitment
that the FAA toughen standards for infant seating.
   ``Isn't this a form of discrimination against those least able
to protect themselves?'' Gonzales asked.
   ``We don't consider that discrimination,'' Ms. Pollard
responded. ``There is the option of purchasing a seat and coming on
board with an infant child restraint system.''
   Ms. Pollard acknowledged there is danger in bringing an infant
aboard a plane without a separate seat and child restraint device,
but she and a vice president of an association representing major
airlines said many parents want to hold their children under 2
during flights.
   Most airlines allow parents who do not purchase tickets for ins
to put those infants in vacant seats, if available. Most airlines
do not provide child restraint seats, similar to seats that most
states require for automobiles.
   United allows adults to carry on child restraint seats for
youngsters, but if a seat on the plane is not available the
restraint device must be checked as baggage _ unless the adult buys
a separate seat. United offers discounted rates for infants.
   When asked if United would support a mandatory infant seating
policy, Doughty said, ``We don't have an official opinion on that
at this point.''

   Thosuands of toys and rattles sold nationwide
in 1987 and 1988 by the Kaybee Toy and Hobby Stores are being
recalled because of a potential choking hazard to young children,
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday.
   The items include wooden puzzles, a baby rattle set, a bathtub
toy, a toy piano and a set of dolls.
   The puzzles, made in Taiwan by the Lucky Star Enterprises, come
in six styles and labeled item number 6792 or 6793. ``All of the
puzzle pieces have pegs in them which may come off,'' and could
choke a small child, the commission said.
   Some 86,500 puzzles were sold in the United States between
November 1987 and December 1988.
   Forty thousand of the three-piece baby rattle sets _ item number
7387 _ were sold by Kaybee in two years.
   The agency said a child had gagged on the nose of the
bird-shaped rattle in the set. However, the commission said another
rattle _ one with small four balls connected to a red plastic
handle _ had failed the agency's small parts test.
   The blue or red plastic ``Swimming Hippo'' bathtub toy is
dangerous because flippers attached to the hippo's yellow feet may
come off and present a choking hazard, the commission said in a
statement.
   More than 15,000 of the toys _ item number 11744 _ were sold in
1988.
   The commission said hazards were identified in ``The Piano with
the Comic Choir'' and ``Baby Twins'' dolls set at the Port of Los
Angeles in a joint surveillance program with the U.S. Customs
Service.
   Bow ties that sit under multicolored duck heads on the pianos
and the arms and legs of the tiny four- to five-inch dolls can come
off, the commission said.
   The pianos are items number 6302 and 7595. The doll set is item
number 3507. More than 55,000 of these toys were sold.
   Consumers should take these toys away from children and return
them to the nearest Kaybee Toy and Hobby Store for a full refund.

   With controversy growing over a congressional
resolution condemning the genocide of Armenians in the early 1900s,
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole on Friday criticized reported
Israeli lobbying against the measure.
   ``I am disappointed that members of the Jewish community, who
have suffered such unspeakable horrors because of the Nazi
genocide, should fail to be sensitive to the similar feelings which
affect the Armenian-American community,'' the Kansas Republican
said in a Senate floor speech.
   The resolution, approved last month by the Senate Judiciary
Committee and awaiting floor action, commemorates the 1.5 million
Armenians killed in the final years of the Ottoman Empire in
Turkey. The resolution has become a bitter irritant in U.S.
relations with Turkey, an important NATO ally and host to U.S.
military bases.
   Turkey already has restricted privileges of some American
personnel at the bases.
   Dole said he was particularly concerned by reports that Israel's
embassy in Washington had actively lobbied against the resolution,
which could be a violation of the law barring foreign diplomats
from seeking to influence legislation.
   Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad assured him that ``no member of
the embassy staff has approached any Jewish organization'' to lobby
against the resolution, Dole said, but reports of lobbying activity
have persisted.
   Arad, in a letter to Dole, noted that Turkey is the only
non-Arab Moslem country in the world to have diplomatic relations
with Israel, and added, ``It is therefore only natural that issues
concerning Turkey are the subject of our attention. ...''
   Dole sent another letter this week to Arad asking further
assurances that no embassy official has approached any American
group or person offering views on the legislation.
   President Bush, who has been caught in a bind over the issue,
wrote to Dole on Friday opposing the resolution but acknowledging
the concerns of Armenians and asking to join in an effort to draft
a resolution that would be more acceptable to Turkey.
   Dole was scheduled to meet next week with White House chief of
staff John Sununu to work out some solution to the problem. Dole
remained confident that the resolution could pass on the Senate
floor, even though the number of sponsors of his bill has shrunk
from more than 60 to 47 under White House pressure.
   Bush, during the presidential campaign last year, acknowledged
that the United States ``must acknowledge the attempted genocide of
the Armenian people in the last years of the Ottoman Empire.''
   But he now faces international complications because of that
promise, and Turkish officials are threatening far more serious
consequences if Dole's resolution passes _ including cutting off
relations with the United States.

   State health officials headed here on Friday
to see if a hotel was harboring a rare bacteria after an elderly
high school reunion participant was diagnosed with Legionnaires'
disease, officials said.
   Sixteen people contracted pneumonia after attending the Lamar
High School reunion for 1941 and earlier graduates at the Best
Western Cow Palace Inn on Sept. 22-24. Three of the people died,
said Dr. Richard Hoffman of the Colorado Department of Health.
   Health officials confirmed on Thursday that one of the
individuals had Legionnaires' disease. The person is recovering.
Laboratory tests of the other 15 cases should be available next
week.
   Cow Palace owner Dave Edeleman agreed to close the 100-room inn
for a week beginning Monday to allow the health officials to gather
samples of air and water, and check ventilation, heating and
air-conditioning systems.
   Investigators will include epidemiologists Dan Rodrigue, Yvonne
Boudreaux, Jane McCannon, Jim Beebe and Lyle McKenzie, said Alice
Lykins, a spokesman for the health department.
   The team could begin work as early as Saturday, she said.
Investigators will be looking for signs of Legionnaires' disease,
Hoffman said.
   ``The only element the 16 cases had in common was attendance at
the reunion activities at the hotel,'' Hoffman said.
   ``Not only is a combination of environmental factors required,''
he said. ``There also must be a congregation of people who would be
at increased risk _ the elderly, those with compromised immune
systems, cancer or those with chronic heart or lung conditions.''
   Legionnaires' disease, first identified in an outbreak in 1976
in Philadelphia, primarily affects adults older than 50 years,
especially smokers or people with chronic illnesses, such as
cancer, health officials said.
   Symptoms include pneumonia, fever, headache, appetite loss,
muscle aches, coughs and abdominal pain.
   The outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at the Pennsylvania
American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in
Philadelphia killed 34 people.
   Since the Lamar pneumonia outbreak was reported, health
department employees have contacted nearly 250 people from 21
states who attended the reunion, to see if they had similar
symptoms. Those who reported symptoms were given blood and urine
samples, officials said.
   Hoffman said organizers of 12 other groups that stayed at the
hotel between Sept. 7 and Oct. 15 have been contacted, but no
illnesses were reported.
   The bacterium believed to be responsible is found in soil and
grows in water, including water left in air conditioning ducts,
storage tanks and rivers, health officials said.
   The disease is not passed from person to person and is treatable
with antibiotics. About 15 percent of cases in an outbreak are
fatal, Hoffman said.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates
25,000 people a year get the disease.

   The City Council unanimously approved a
resolution Friday censuring a councilman for a racist remark about
the renaming of an airport for the late U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland.
   The longtime Houston Democrat died in an Aug. 7 plane crash
while aiding famine victims in Africa.
   ``Jim Westmoreland, a member of this body, has seriously damaged
the well-earned dignity of the Houston City Council by making
racially inflammatory statements which incorrectly imply that
vestiges of bigotry exist within this diverse body,'' the
resolution said.
   Westmoreland voted for the resolution, which passed 14-0.
   The special afternoon session called by Mayor Kathy Whitmire
came two weeks after Westmoreland suggested to a reporter that
Houston Intercontinental Airport be renamed ``Nigger
International'' to satisfy council members wanting to rename the
airport for Leland, who was black.
   The resolution said the council ``finds the remarks of Jim
Westmoreland to be morally without character and do not in any way
represent the true feelings of any member of this council toward
any individuals or groups of individuals regardless of their race.''
   ``I think it makes a statement to the public that the statements
that I made do not reflect at all the feelings or the drive and
direction of the city council,'' Westmoreland said of the
resolution he moved to adopt.
   Westmoreland, a 16-year councilman, is seeking re-election to
his at-large seat Tuesday. He has apologized for his remarks, but
claims he actually said ``Negro International'' in joking about the
airport's renaming.
   The councilman also suggested to the reporter that the white
crosses erected at the site of fatal traffic accidents caused by
drunken drivers be painted black to please the black citizens and
those against drunken driving.
   During the council's regular weekly session Wednesday, hundreds
packed the council chambers to demand Westmoreland's resignation.
Westmoreland, however, has said he will not step down, but will
wait for the results of the election.

<TEXT>
   Cotton farmers in 1990 will have to idle only
half as much acreage as they did this year to qualify for federal
price support benefits, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced Friday.
   Yeutter said the 1990 cotton program ``strikes a balance between
the needs of the marketplace, budget considerations and producer
concerns about surpluses.''
   To be eligible for federal benefits, cotton farmers in 1990 will
be required to set aside from production 12.5 percent of their
acreage base, compared with a 1989 acreage reduction of 25 percent.
   Department analysts say global cotton supplies are the lowest in
at least five years, due to smaller harvests and greater use by
textile mills.
   The U.S. cotton crop this year is forecast at 12 million bales,
more than three million bales below the 1988 harvest. Domestic mill
use is expected to be eight million bales and exports 7.8 million,
the largest total use in 30 years.
   By the end of the 1989-90 cotton marketing year next Aug. 1, the
U.S. stockpile is expected to be about 3.3 million bales, down from
7.1 million bales this Aug. 1. That would be the smallest U.S.
inventory since 1983.
   Yeutter said the ``established target price'' for upland cotton
in 1990 will be 72.9 cents per pound, down from 73.4 cents this
year. The loan level will be 50.27 cents per pound for the base
quality cotton, up from 50 cents for the 1989 crop.
   The loan rate is how much USDA will advance farmers on their
crops, which are used as collateral. Target prices are used to
compute ``deficiency'' payments to make up the difference between
market prices or loan levels, whichever are higher.
   Yeutter said ``plan B'' of the cotton marketing program will
remain in effect for 1990. Under this plan, 1990-crop cotton
pledged as collateral for a price support loan may be repaid at the
original loan level or an adjusted world price, whichever is lower.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly Friday to
remove Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi as a judge of the U.S.
District Court in a case stemming from his conviction on perjury
charges.
   The softspoken, 61-year-old Nixon became the second judge
removed by the Senate by impeachment in two weeks.
   ``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Walter L.
Nixon Jr. be removed from office,'' declared Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., presiding over the Senate at the close of the proceedings.
   The Senate convicted Nixon, 89-8, of lying to a federal grand
jury when he said he never talked with a county prosecutor about a
marijuana smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy contractor.
   It quickly followed by convicting him, 78-19, of lying to the
grand jury in his 1984 appearance when he said he had nothing to do
with the marijuana case.
   However, the Senate acquitted Nixon on the third and final
charge, which alleged that he undermined confidence in the
judiciary by lying not only to the grand jury but to a Justice
Department attorney and an FBI agent.
   The lawmakers voted, 57-40, a majority for guilty but short of
the two-thirds needed to convict.
   ``We fought the fight for five and one half years because we
know we are not guilty of anything and don't feel like it,'' Nixon
told reporters outside the Capitol. ``We can hold our heads high
because we are innocent.''
   Defense attorney David Stewart put his arm around Nixon as the
secretary of the Senate read the list of lawmakers voting guilty.
The judge blinked repeatedly and then closed his eyes as the list
grew longer and longer.
   Nixon was convicted of two counts of perjury in 1986 and
sentenced to five years in prison. He began serving the term at
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in March 1988, moving to a New
Orleans halfway house in July. He is eligible for release this
month.
   ``We have to go home and talk about things and get on with our
lives,'' Nixon said, holding hands with his wife, Barbara, and
daughter, Courtney.
   Nixon had continued to collect his $89,500 judicial salary while
serving his sentence, and had expressed hope of returning to the
bench. The salary ends with removal from office.
   The Senate's action came exactly two weeks after it removed
Alcee L. Hastings from the U.S. District Court in Miami for
conspiracy to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lying about it to a jury
that acquitted him in 1983.
   Hastings became the first public official removed from the bench
after having been acquitted of the offense charged in a criminal
trial. Nixon was the seventh official, all of them judges, removed
from office through impeachment.
   Nixon was convicted on charges of lying when he told the federal
grand jury he didn't discuss the marijuana case with Paul Holmes,
then district attorney of Forrest County, Miss., and an old friend.
   A defendant in the case was Drew Fairchild, a manager of the
Hattiesburg, Miss., airport and the son of wealthy contractor Wylie
Fairchild.
   Investigators later found that the elder Fairchild had helped
Nixon obtain a highly lucrative oil and gas investment, but the
judge was acquitted of receiving an illegal gratuity.
   Nixon contends he was the victim of witnesses who lied and
overzealous prosecutors who held him to unreasonably high standards
of accuracy in his grand jury testimony. He admitted making a few
slips but put them down as honest forgetfulness.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., one of eight lawmakers who voted to
acquit on the first article, said in a statement he did so ``to
protest this criminal investigative device of failing to establish
a real crime and then searching around in the ashes for bits of
perjury.''
   Sanford said he voted to acquit because ``the false statements,
if made, were trivial matters not related to the actual crime, the
case against Judge Nixon was contrived and manufactured by the
Justice Department'' and based in part on testimony written for a
witness by department employees.
   Another lawmaker who voted to acquit, Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., said in a statement:
   ``I wasn't convinced by the evidence and the arguments presented
to the Senate that he had deliberately lied or commited perjury.''

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan Contras have been ordered to
evade contact with Sandinista army units who are waging ``very
serious offensive operations'' after President Daniel Ortega called
off a cease-fire, an administration official said Friday.
   But the official was unable to report on how much headway the
Sandinista forces had made since the attacks were launched late
Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Sandinistas are using elite batallions and heavy weapons in their
efforts to ``attack, isolate, drive out and wipe out'' the
resistance forces in Nicaragua.
   ``The resistance's orders, as I understand them, are to try to
evade contact as best as possible,'' the official said during a
briefing for reporters.
   Ortega called off the cease-fire, contending that the
U.S.-backed Contras have systematically engaged in terrorist
activities aimed at disrupting the election process in Nicaragua.
   At one point, Ortega indicated he might call off the elections
but Sandinista officials have given assurances that the Feb. 25
elections will go ahead as scheduled.
   U.S. officials have denied that the Contras have engaged in
offensive operations and said that the Sandinistas never abided by
the cease-fire in the first place.
   Meanwhile, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
called on the Sandinistas to end their offensive in advance of a
negotiating session in New York on Monday with the Contra military
leaders.
   The meeting will deal with agreements that call for the peaceful
reintegration of the rebels into Nicaraguan society as part of an
overall settlement of that country's seven-year old internal
conflict.
   There have been no direct contacts between Sandinista and Contra
officials in well over a year but Ortega proposed the talks on
Wednesday when he was announcing the suspension of the cease-fire.
   ``We believe that the Sandinistas should stop their offensive if
they really want to help this meeting to achieve positive
results,'' Boucher said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the U.N. talks
``a positive sign, something we've called for all along.''
   ``What we'd like to see is for these positive steps to lead to a
reinstatement of the cease-fire and to get President Ortega to
create a climate in Nicaragua for democracy and repatriation,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater's remarks were more upbeat than Boucher was on
Thursday, when he questioned Ortega's sincerity in calling for
talks on the same day when he was suspending the cease-fire.

<HEAD>Marina Shelter Closes And Legislators Hike Taxes For Quake Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>

   Nearly 100 people on Friday gathered their
belongings, some held in just pillow cases, and headed for shelters
and friends' homes as the Red Cross emergency shelter closed in the
earthquake-devastated Marina district.
   In Sacramento, an Assembly committee on Friday speedily approved
a quarter-cent sales tax increase to finance California's share of
earthquake relief efforts, as lawmakers convened in the Capitol in
a special legislative session.
   Ninety-four people, including four families, were moved out of
the Marina Middle School, where the homeless have occupied a
gymnasium and cafeteria since the Oct. 17 quake that leveled many
of the trendy neighborhood's apartment buildings by the bay.
   Many of the homeless have found new homes, moved to other cities
to take new jobs or were relocated to other shelters and the nearby
Army base at the Presidio, said Red Cross spokesman Kevin Irion.
   There were 384 people in Red Cross shelters throughout the city
on Friday, said spokesman Bob Page, and a total of 1,514 in the San
Francisco Bay area. At one point after the quake, 6,000 people were
living in emergency shelters.
   ``The American Red Cross will continue to provide food and
shelter to those affected by this disaster as long as these
services are needed,'' said relief director Allen Whear. ``In the
meantime, victims are being encouraged to report to one of our six
service centers where a Red Cross case worker will evaluate their
situation and meet other emergency needs ... ''
   As children frolicked on a sunny asphalt playground at the
Marina Middle School, buses loaded up people carrying boxes,
suitcases, black plastic bags and pillow cases holding their
belongings. Cots, portable toilets and other belongings also were
trucked away.
   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, toured
south bay homeless shelters and met briefly with San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos on Friday during the second day of her visit.
   The federal government has pledged to make $200 million
available for housing renovations in Northern California.
   Brad Paul, San Francisco's deputy mayor of housing, said that if
earthquake-damaged, low-income housing was not replaced or quickly
repaired, the city's homeless population would continue to increase.
   An estimated 80 percent of San Francisco's housing that was left
uninhabitable after the earthquake was housing for poor people, and
Paul calculated it would cost at least $152 million ``just to get
back where we were before.''
   He said 1,170 housing units were declared unsafe, and it would
cost $94 million to repair or replace. An additional 3,000 units
were found to need repairs totaling about $58 million before they
can be made liveable again.
   The neighborhoods hardest hit include South of Market,
Tenderloin, Haight and North Mission.
   In Sacramento, the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee
approved the bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias, which would raise
about $800 million from the 13-month tax increase beginning Dec. 1.
The bill was sent to the Ways and Means Committee on a 7-1 vote.
   The committee, along with a dozen other panels from both houses,
met in the Capitol as lawmakers scrambled from hearing to hearing
and considered hastily introduced bills.
   California lawmakers opened the special session Thursday at the
order of Gov. George Deukmejian, who proposed the quarter-cent
increase.
   Officials from the counties hardest hit by the temblor said they
seek a larger sales tax increase _ 1 cent for one year to raise
about $2.5 billion, a figure closer to the state contribution they
feel is needed for repairs.

   Johnson and Johnson Baby Products Co. is
voluntarily recalling more than 1 million ``Spin-A-Sound'' infant
toys because they present a choking and cutting hazard, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday.
   The rattle-like toy has two large yellow wheels on each end with
red plastic caps. A metal axle on which three red, blue and green
plastic paddles rotate, joins the two wheels.
   The red end caps can come loose from the toy, which is part of
the New Jersey-based company's child development series, the agency
said.
   The caps are small enough to be swallowed and could choke small
children. When they are removed, they expose the sharp points of
the metal axle, the commission said.
   The company said 1.3 million of the toys have been sold
natiowide since 1981. People may return the toys to the company for
a $10 refund.

   A 14-year-old boy helped his parents
and two stepbrothers escape through a window of their burning home
Friday but was overcome by smoke and died when he could not get out
himself.
   Firefighters recovered the body of Steven S. O'Neil from a
second-story bedroom.
   The early morning fire began on the first floor and awakened the
victim's older brother, Shawn O'Neil, according to state Public
Safety Department spokesman Stephen McCausland.
   Shawn and Steven roused the rest of the family: their
stepfather, Murton Hodgkin Jr., 34; their mother, Ersal Hodgkin,
39; and their two stepbrothers, Brian Hodgkin, 3; and Charles
Hodgkin, 2.
   ``With Shawn outside the building, Steven assisted the four
others to safety and then was overcome by smoke,'' McCausland said.
   Mrs. Hodgkin was hospitalized, in stable condition, for smoke
inhalation. Other family members were treated and released.
   McCausland said the house was destroyed and investigators still
were seeking to determine what caused the fire.

   President Bush campaigned for underdog
Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey
Friday, talking of crime, drugs and other ``challenges of
tomorrow'' but avoiding the lightning-rod issue of abortion as the
off-year election campaign entered its final weekend.
   Stumping for J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia and James Courter
in New Jersey, the president resurrected themes from his 1988
campaign book, including his pledge against raising taxes.
   ``If voters of New Jersey want to gamble, they go to Atlantic
City,'' Bush told a rally for Courter in Bloomfield, N.J. ``But
they know better than to risk their economy on the big-spending and
high-taxing policies of the Democrats.''
   Although dogged by pro-choice demonstrators at each of three
campaign stops, Bush steered clear of the abortion controversy.
   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder has made support for abortion rights
a central theme of his campaign for governor of Virginia, and
recent polls say he is leading Coleman by margins varying from four
to 15 points.
   Rep. James Florio is favored to return the governorship of New
Jersey to Democratic control after eight years in Republican hands.
Abortion also has been in the forefront of the campaign in that
state.
   Wilder campaigned Friday in Portsmouth, where he told students
at a high school that if he is elected they can expect to be
expelled from school if they get caught using drugs.
   Wilder, who also spoke at a northern Virginia senior citizens'
center Friday, will spend the weekend before the election in the
far southwest mountains of the state, where United Mine Workers
have been on strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   Barbara Bush, meanwhile, was in New York City campaigning for
GOP mayoral candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani in his race against
Democrat David N. Dinkins.
   The president's wife spoke at a fund-raiser that brought in
$360,000 for the underdog Giuliani campaign. She said the former
prosecutor ``knows that the New York City schools are our first and
best hope for the people and the future of this very great city.
With Rudy at Gracie Mansion, we have at last a real chance to turn
things around.''
   The two gubernatorial races and the contest to succeed Ed Koch
as mayor of New York were getting the most attention this light
political year. In addition to other election factors, Wilder would
be the nation's first black elected governor and Dinkins New York's
first black mayor.
   Elsewhere on Tuesday, Houston voters will fill the late Rep.
Mickey Leland's seat, and hundreds of contests for mayor also will
be decided, including in such major cities as Detroit, Cleveland
and Seattle.
   Coleman and Courter found themselves on the defensive this
summer and fall when their anti-abortion stands _ views similar to
those forcefully expressed by Bush in two recent vetoes _ became
central issues.
   Bush, speaking to several thousand Coleman supporters at Old
Dominion University, asked what were the state's problems,
``Virginia's challenges of tomorrow,'' and answered that ``they're
the same challenges we face in Washington'' _ educational reform,
environmental protection and a need to maintain a strong military.
   Earlier, he spoke at a rally in a park in downtown Richmond as
several dozen pro-choice demonstrators heckled from the back of the
crowd, some carrying signs that said ``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   Recycling themes from last year's presidential race, Bush
praised Coleman, a former state attorney general, for strong stands
on crime, drugs, education, the environment and no-new-taxes.
   ``With Marshall Coleman in the statehouse, taxpayers won't feel
like there's a bull's eye painted on their backs,'' Bush told the
rally.
   For his part, Coleman told Bush, ``I will seek to emulate you by
following the highest ethical standards.''
   Over the past few weeks, Bush has vetoed two spending bills over
a provision that would extend eligibility for federally funded
abortions for poor women to cases of rape and incest. Current law _
which Bush supports _ only permits the use of tax dollars to pay
for abortions when the woman's life is in danger.
   Coleman and Courter both have strong anti-abortion views, which
their Democratic opponents have actively sought to turn to their
advantage by trumpeting their own pro-choice positions.
   Public opinion polls have shown the abortion issue to be a major
factor in both states, especially among female voters.
   Coleman opposes abortion in all cases except where the life of
the mother is endangered, although he has said he would not propose
legislation to outlaw abortions in cases of rape or incest.
   In New Jersey, Florio has made an issue of Courter's history of
anti-abortion votes in the House. Courter has said that, if
elected, he will not seek to change st

<HEAD>Thousands Defy Rebel Strike, March for Peace in Downtown Lima</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people chanting ``Say Yes to
Democracy!'' marched through Lima on Friday, defying a strike
leftist guerrillas called in their campaign to disrupt the Nov. 12
municipal elections.
   Guerrillas designated it an ``armed strike,'' implying violence
against anyone who did not comply.
   Most schools closed and businessmen kept stores shuttered much
of the morning because of the strike declared by the Maoist
guerrillas of Shining Path, but shops opened later in the day and
the government declared the rebel action a failure.
   Clusters of leftists and rightists, many also shouting ``We Love
Peru!'' and ``Terrorism Will Not Pass!'' marched from separate
points of the city to Grau Plaza in downtown Lima.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said more than
10,000 people participated. Witnesses estimated the crowd at more
than 50,000.
   The government deployed thousands of police and army troops in
the city Friday and hundreds of police guarded the plaza.
   As an army helicopter hovered overhead, the crowd observed a
minute of silence for the victims of terrorist violence, then
dispersed.
   The march was organized by a broad spectrum of political parties.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, considered the leading candidate in
the April presidential election, said it was the first time such a
diverse group of parties had joined in a common effort.
   ``It is the paradoxical effect of the recent wave of rebel
violence that it has succeeded in accomplishing what was thought
absolutely impossible in the last few years,'' said Manuel
d'Ornellas, a columnist for the Lima daily Expreso.
   The rebels have mounted a violent campaign to sabotage the
nationwide amunicipal elections. The Shining Path has assassinated
more than 120 mayors, local officials and candidates this year,
mostly in rural provinces. Hundreds more have quit because of death
threats.
   A total of 330 people died in armed clashes and political
violence in October, one of the highest monthly death tolls since
the Shining Path insurgency in 1980.
   This is the third armed strike called by the rebels in Lima. The
first, in October 1988, was almost completely ignored. Another
strike called in July received some support in poorer districts of
the city.
   Police reported isolated incidents of rebel violence in the
capital Thursday night and early Friday morning, including attacks
against two movie theaters in outlying neighborhoods and the
dynamiting of an empty bus.
   Police said they killed one guerrilla after he and several
others attacked a police patrol car in Canto Grande, a poor
district east of Lima.
   Rebels blew up a power pylon 15 miles north of the city before
dawn Friday, causing blackouts in a few isolated sections of Lima,
according to police.
   The rebels staged a brief but violent surprise march near
downtown Lima Wednesday, battling with police. Three rebels were
killed and at least 14 wounded, government officials said.

<HEAD>Shelter Says Alabama Land Deal Is Last Hope For Life For 1,600 Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONYERS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A shelter for ``God's stray animals'' clung
to the hope Friday that a wealthy donor would buy land in Alabama
for more than 1,600 dogs and cats before the county shuts it down.
   ``We had our foot halfway out the gate when the county took
over,'' said Ronnie Denney, the son-in-law of owners Ann and Jerry
Fields. ``Now we're just trying to get the animals out before the
county kills them.''
   Officials at Life for God's Stray Animals have waged a 10-year
court battle over neighbors' charges of noise and odor. The
Fieldses went into hiding in July 1986 to avoid contempt of court
charges.
   The struggle has attracted national attention and prompted
donations from sources such as the Doris Day Pet Foundation in
California. A DeKalb County woman left her $65,000 home to the
Fieldses.
   Last week, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld Rockdale County's
right to remove the animals on the grounds that the shelter was a
public nuisance, violated zoning ordinances in this largely rural
area 20 miles east of Atlanta, and was registered illegally as a
non-profit organization.
   The Fieldses are believed to be out of state, but county
authorities and shelter officials say they still control the
shelter, sending money to feed the animals.
   On Friday, Denney announced that Nina Friedman, whose family
owns a chain of more than 100 jewelry stores in the Southeast, had
promised to buy 240 acres of land near Andalusia, Ala., to house
the shelter.
   A saleswoman with South Court Realty in Alabama, Sheila Adkison,
confirmed that Ms. Friedman had sent representatives to see the
land and said she expected her to return a signed copy of the
contract within a week. Ms. Adkison said Ms. Friedman was out of
the country Friday.
   Cheryl McAuliffe, president of the Georgia chapter of Fund for
Animals, pleaded with the county Friday to give the shelter 60 days
to move the animals to the new site.
   ``There is no reason for a mass execution except to rid the
county of this shelter,'' she said. ``Animals that are old, sick
and lame could be in the care of people who have loved them for
years instead of being extinguished like old rags.''
   Talk of a last-minute move was greeted with skepticism by county
officials, who would have to approve it.
   Nevertheless, B. Lee York, assistant to the county commission
chairman, promised Ms. McAuliffe that the county will not move in
before Nov. 10, and hopes to find homes for most of the animals. He
conceded that some will have to be destroyed, though.
   ``We will make every effort possible to see whether every animal
can be adopted,'' he said. ``We are not the bad guys here.''
   County officials plan to meet about the shelter next week, York
said, and Commission Chairman Randy Poynter has promised to look at
any plans shelter officials can present about moving to a new site.
   Shelter and county officials said there have been dozens of
calls about adopting the animals since the county announced it was
taking over Thursday.
   Linda Lewis, who has worked at the shelter for seven years, said
officials were likely to find homes for only 200 to 300 of the
animals. Francine, a mutt who is missing her two back legs, is one
of the hundreds who would have no home without the shelter, she
said.
   ``She's got a good home here and she's loved,'' Ms. Lewis said.

   New Communist Party leader Egon Krenz announced
Friday that five members of the ruling Politburo would step down,
and he made a dramatic appeal to East Germans to stay in the
country. ``We need you,'' he said.
   In an address broadcast on state TV, Krenz promised sweeping
political and economic reforms and urged that East Germany's
restive citizens trust the new leadership's resolve to change.
   But as he spoke, more than 80,000 people demonstrated for more
democracy in at least four cities around the country, the state
news agency ADN said.
   Another 4,500 East Germans who took refuge in West Germany's
embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia prepared to head West after East
Germany said they could leave.
   The five Politburo members stepping down were closely associated
with former party leader Erich Honecker, who was ousted on Oct. 18
and replaced by his protege Krenz.
   They included ideology chief Kurt Hager and security chief Erich
Mielke.
   The other three were Hermann Axen, Erich Mueckeberger and Alfred
Neumann.
   Krenz said the five had asked to be relieved of their duties. He
said they will step down at a meeting of the party's Central
Committee that will open Wednesday.
   The party chief also appealed to East Germans to stay in the
country.
   ``Trust our policy of renewal! Your place, dear fellow citizens,
is here. We need you,'' Krenz said.
   But he said those who still wanted to leave should address
themselves to authorities in East Germany. Tens of thousands of
people have fled their Communist homeland in recent months.
   In a 22-minute address, Krenz also announced new laws that would
allow draft resisters to serve in the civil service, the formation
of a constitutional court to protect citizens' rights and plans to
abolish special privileges of high-ranking party functionaries.
   He also said limits would be placed on the length of state and
party functions.
   Krenz said that independent, non-communist groups would have a
wide say in forging the course of reforms, but did not say if
opposition groups would be legalized.
   He also did not mention free elections, one of the major demands
made by the pro-democracy demonstators.
   ADN said 50,000 people rallied in Erfurt and called for
legalization of opposition groups Friday. Another 20,000 marched in
Karl-Marx-Stadt, 10,000 rallied in Dessau and 6,500 in Guestrow,
the agency said.
   Earlier Friday, the mayor of Leipzig resigned after hundreds of
thousands of residents of his city took to the streets in recent
weeks in the largest pro-democracy protests in East Germany's
history.
   Mayor Bernd Seidel, 40, stepped down after losing the confidence
of the city's citizens, ADN said.
   About 300,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig, a city of 650,000,
on Monday, and a similiar number protested the week before.
   The pro-democracy movement began in Leipzig several months ago
before spreading across the country and leading to the exodus of
tens of thousands of East Germans to the West.
   In January, witnesses reported that police used clubs and a
water cannon to break up a demonstration by human rights activists

   Dorothee Wilms, West Germany's minister for intra-German
relations, told reporters in West Berlin the number of East Germans
arriving in West Germany this year could reach 190,000. Earlier
this year, Bonn officials had estimated 100,000 arrivals.
   A senior East German health official said the departure of
skilled medical workers is seriously straining health services in
the country. A Leipzig newspaper said soldiers have been drafted to
drive ambulances and medical students have been sent to work in
hospitals.
   Also Friday, Communist authorities lifted a 38-year-old ban on
the Christian Science Church.
   Vice President Manfred Gerlach was quoted as predicting that
they will legalize New Forum, the largest opposition group.

   President Bush signed legislation Friday
appropriating funds for the Treasury Department, but told Congress
that several sections were unconstitutional.
   Bush raised objections over a section of the bill he said
limited his ability to require government employees in sensitive
positions to sign agreements promising not to divulge classified
information.
   He also complained about a provision preventing the Office of
Management and Budget from modifying agricultural marketing
reglations advanced by the Agriculture Department.
   Bush said his ability to supervise the executive branch had been
hampered in both cases and that he deemed both sections to be
unconstitutional.
   ``Accordingly, I direct that executive branch officials
implement the provisions ... in a manner consistent with the
Constitution,'' Bush said.
   The president also said that other parts of the legislation that
made spending on certain item contingent on later approval by
congressional committees appeared to resemble a ``legislative
veto'' already ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
   ``I will treat them as having no legal force,'' Bush said.
   The White House announced the bill-signing during a presidential
campaign trip to New Jersey and Virginia on behalf of Republican
candidates.

   By a slip of the tongue, President Bush
on Friday confused Election Day with the national observance whose
date seems to confuse him the most: the anniversary of the attack
on Pearl Harbor.
   He told a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Rep.
James Courter: ``On December 7, we need you to vote.''
   Election day in states like New Jersey holding elections in this
off-political year is next Tuesday, Nov. 7.
   Bush made a celebrated campaign gaffe on Sept. 7, 1988, when he
informed a startled American Legion audience in Louisville, Ky.,
that it was Pearl Harbor Day.
   Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on the
Hawaiian island of Oahu without warning on Dec. 7, 1941, killing
2,300 servicemen and blasting the United States into World War II.

   Every Lebanese president has been able to
count on one thing _ trouble, and plenty of it.
   Each of the eight presidents since independence from France in
1943 has been plagued by violence.
   Now, after 13 months without a president, Parliament is trying
to approve a peace agreement aimed at ending the 14-year-old
sectarian civil war and elect a new head of state under its terms.
   Under an unwritten covenant accepted in 1943, when Lebanon
gained independence from France, presidents have been Christians,
prime ministers Sunni Moslems and Parliament speakers Shiite Moslem.
   The first president was Bishara Khoury, a French-educated lawyer
and leader of the Christian-Moslem national resistance against the
French, who had governed under a League of Nations mandate since
1920.
   He was in a French prison in southeast Lebanon _ Rachaya Castle,
built by Crusaders _ when Parliament elected him on Sept. 21, 1943,
and was driven from his cell to the presidential palace in Beirut.
   Five years later, Parliament approved a new constitution under
which he was elected for a second term, of six years.
   In 1950, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party staged an armed
revolt aimed at making Lebanon part of a ``greater Syria.'' The
leftist party advocates union of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, pre-1948
Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait and Cyprus.
   Khoury and his Sunni prime minister, Riyad Solh, suppressed the
revolt in two weeks and party leader Antoine Saadeh was executed. A
year later, three members of the party assassinated Solh while he
was visiting Jordan.
   In 1952, Khoury sought to amend the constitution so he could
serve another term, but was unsuccessful and relinquished power to
a transitional military government under Gen. Fuad Chehab, the army
commander.
   Parliament elected Camille Chamoun, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, as president Sept. 22, 1952.
   Chamoun faced a Moslem revolt in 1958 inspired by the radical
teachings of Gamal Abdul Nasser, then Egypt's leader. He asked for
U.S. help and President Eisenhower sent 10,000 Marines.
   During a long political career, Chamoun survived at least four
attempted assassinations. He died of natural causes in 1988, as had
Khoury in 1962.
   Chehab, still army commander, was elected by Parliament
unanimously to succeed Chamoun. In 1959, his powerful military
intelligence branch ruthlessly crushed a New Year's Eve coup
attempt by army officers who belonged to the Syrian Social
Nationalist Party.
   He was followed in 1964 by his protege Charles Helou, a lawyer,
during whose term Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas built
their power base in Lebanon.
   That led to the first major Israeli attack on Beirut.
Helicopter-borne paratroopers landed at the airport and blew up 10
jetliners of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, in
1968.
   In 1969, the Lebanese army fought Arafat's guerrillas in south
Beirut. Nasser of Egypt intervened on behalf of Arafat and the
guerrilla presence in Lebanon was secured.
   Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite Catholic warlord and close friend
of Syrian President Hafez Assad, succeeded Helou in 1972. His term
was marked by clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
started the civil war in April 1975.
   Franjieh asked for Syrian military intervention in 1976 to keep
the Palestinians and their leftist and Moslem allies from
overwhelming the Christians.
   Syria now has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and their presence has
frustrated many efforts to end a civil war that has cost more than
150,000 lives.
   Artillery shells were falling around Parliament when it chose
Syrian-backed Elias Sarkis, director of the central bank, was
elected with Syrian backing to succeed Franjien. During his term,
the Israelis invaded in 1978 and 1982.
   His successor was Bashir Gemayel, 34, who had Israeli support
and commanded the main Christian militia. He was assassinated Sept.
14, 1982, a week before the inauguration.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, Amin, who
signed a coexistence treaty with Israel in April 1983 but tore it
up a year later under Syrian pressure.
   Gemayel's term saw the beginning of terrorism by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems. Suicide truck bombers killed 241 American
servicemen and 58 French paratroopers, part of a multnational
peacekeeping force, on Oct. 23, 1983.
   On Sept. 22, 1988, Gemayel stepped down after naming Gen. Michel
Aoun as head of a caretaker Christian administration when
Parliament could not agree on a successor.
   Moslems formed a rival government led by Salim Hoss, the prime
minister under Gemayel.

   Shaken by anonymous letters containing
racial slurs and threats against blacks, students at a small
liberal arts college said Friday they plan a campus march of
solidarity against racism.
   Hand-written letters addressed to MacMurray College's 35 to 40
black students and the school's only black faculty member were
found Thursday in their campus mailboxes.
   The letters included racial epithets such as ``Uncle Tom'' and
made personal slurs tailored specifically to recipients. One letter
threatened: ``Watch your back, nigger.''
   Edward Mitchell, president of the 620-student college, called
the acts ``intolerable'' and promised to expel any student
responsible. At a news conference held by college officials,
students said they would march Monday from the campus center to the
college chapel, where white, black and Hispanic students would
speak against racism.
   ``We have decided that we won't talk about who is to blame,''
said Ricky Bragg, a black sophomore majoring in political science.
``That's useless. We have simply decided we are going to come
together and we are going to fight this as MacMurray students.''
   The city's police chief, Tom Weeks, said investigators
interviewed students and staff at the college, but had no suspects.
The letters were being examined for fingerprints, Weeks said.
   ``Just having the fingerprints isn't going to tell us much
unless we have a suspect,'' he said.
   The letters apparently were left at a mailroom at the campus
center, where employees unwittingly placed them in mailboxes,
school officials said.
   Jacksonville is a city of 20,000 people in western Illinois,
about 85 miles north of St. Louis.
   Only a few students actually saw the letters before they were
removed from mailboxes, the officials said. Black students who saw
the letters said they were addressed to students by name and campus
mailbox number.
   ``If you were overweight, he called you a fat bitch and stuff
like this,'' said Desmond Williams, a junior majoring in business
administration.
   ``Each note had something that pertained to you personally. So
obviously, there was a great deal of time and effort put into
preparing these,'' he said.
   Williams said his envelope contained letters cut from a magazine
or newspaper to spell the word ``nigger.''
   Black students met Thursday night.
   ``We have some (students) that have obviously experienced racism
elsewhere and are very defensive about the issue and are ready to
take action, but I think the level-headed students are trying to
keep them in line as much as possible,'' said Laura Jordan, a black
senior majoring in music education.
   The college's only black faculty member, assistant football
coach Gerald Young, also received one of the letters. He said the
incident doesn't reflect broader racism on campus.
   ``I think that is the work of a small group of individuals, if
not one person,'' he said. ``I think we did the right thing by
immediately addressing the problem and bringing it out to the
public.

<HEAD>British Hint They Might Talk with IRA's Political Front</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most senior British official in Northern
Ireland hinted on Friday that Britain may be prepared to talk with
the Irish Republican Army's political wing if the IRA ceased its
campaign of violence in the province.
   In an interview with Press Association, the British domestic
news agency, to mark 100 days in his new post as Northern Ireland
secretary, Peter Brooke raised the prospect of direct government
talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political front, for the
first time in 14 years.
   Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland reacted angrily and
Britain's opposition Labor Party said Brooke's comments would only
help the extremist paramilitary organizations there.
   Acknowledging that it was ``difficult to envisage'' a military
defeat of the IRA, Brooke said he hoped a British government
``would be imaginative in how it responded'' if the IRA agreed to
stop its guerrilla activities.
   ``If in fact the terrorists were to decide the moment had come
when they wished to withdraw from their activities, then I think
government would need to be imaginative in those circumstances as
to how that process should be managed,'' Brooke said.
   ``There has to be a possibility that, at some stage, that debate
might start within the terrorist community, and that moment might
come.''
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams welcomed what he called the
``conciliatory tone'' of Brooke's comments but said no discussions
could materialize if Britain laid down preconditions.
   The last direct talks between IRA representatives and British
officials in 1975 led to a brief cease-fire.
   The IRA, outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to oust
the British from Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Roman Catholic Irish
Republic under a leftist administration. More than 2,700 people
have been killed in 20 years of political and sectarian strife.
   In Dublin, the Irish government said it discussed the
implications of Brooke's comments at a regular Cabinet meeting
Friday, but made no immediate response.
   Northern Ireland's Protestant leaders tore into Brooke.
Legislator Ken Maginnis said that before any talks, Protestants
``would want more than a cease-fire, we would want a declaration
that the IRA as a military organization had ceased to exist.''
   Kevin McNamara, Labor's spokesman on Northern Ireland, said,
``His comments can only assist the `one last push' mentality of the
paramilitaries on both sides. ... Mr. Brooke has conveyed the wrong
message. He has to make it clear that no one can force their way to
the negotiating table by violence or the threat of violence.''
   Brooke reiterated comments by his predecessor, Tom King, and
senior British military officials that it might not be possible to
defeat the IRA militarily.
   ``It is difficult to envisage a military defeat of such a force,
because of the circumstances in which they operate, though the
security forces can exercise a policy of containment to enable,
broadly speaking, normal life to go on within the province,'' he
said.
   The Northern Ireland Office, which is responsible for
administering the province, said in a statement that Brooke's
comments ``reflect no change in government policy on terrorism.''
   ``Sinn Fein supports violence and ministers will have no
dealings with it,'' it said.
   ``The government maintains its determination to defeat terrorism
in whatever form and from whatever source it comes. Ministers
continue to seek constructive discussions with and between
political parties who reject violence.''

   Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph
Giuliani entered the final weekend of the mayoral race wooing the
Jewish vote and preparing for their first face-to-face debate.
   Giuliani, trailing his rival in polls by 8 to 11 percentage
points, raised $360,000 at a luncheon attended by first lady
Barbara Bush, who praised his ``sense of honesty and integrity.''
   Big guns may be wheeled in for the weekend: Aides said it was
possible President Bush could stump for Giuliani while Jesse
Jackson may do the same for Dinkins.
   The two major candidates and Right-to-Life candidate Henry Hewes
are scheduled to meet in a one-hour debate Saturday on WABC-TV. All
three will again appear together on television Sunday during
questioning on WNBC-TV.
   ``This will give the people of this city an opportunity to
evaluate the two choices that they have,'' said Giuliani, who
fought for weeks against allowing Hewes to appear. ``There's going
to be a lot of distraction because we have someone involved who has
no chance of being mayor.''
   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, laughed off the
suggestion that he needs a ``knockout punch'' in the face-to-face
meetings. ``I hope to be able to explain to the people of this city
that I'm the one who offers fundamental change,'' he said.
   Giuliani would not say whether he would focus on Dinkins'
financial irregularities, as his television advertisements have.
   ``I don't know how he's gonna behave,'' said Dinkins. ``I think
there ought be a discussion of the issues.''
   At the Waldorf-Astoria, Mrs. Bush played up Giuliani's
crime-fighting image.
   ``Rudy Giuliani is tough enough and smart enough and caring
enough to rid our streets of corrupt officials and vicious hoodlums
who are robbing our children of this city of their future,'' she
said at the luncheon.
   Campaign finance reports turned in Friday show that Dinkins
raised $754,106 from Oct. 24 to Oct. 30, while spending $765,106.
He has raised a total of $3,085,175 and spent $2,982,175.
   Giuliani raised $539,336 during the same week and spent
$441,118. He has raised a total of $1,989,573 and spent $2,035,662.
   Both candidates received endorsements Friday from leaders of the
Jewish community _ Dinkins from a coalition of 92 rabbis whom he
dubbed his ``rabbinic cabinet'' and Giuliani from 70 leaders of
Jewish organizations.
   Giuliani had held a 12-point lead two weeks ago among Jewish
voters, according to a New York Newsday poll, but the two men were
even among Jews in polls released last week. Jews make up about 18
percent of the voting public in the city.

   Laurence Olivier, who died in July at age 82, left
1.3 million pounds ($2.1 million) in a will published Friday and
bequeathed personal items to friends in the theater.
   His early edition of Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' went to Sir John
Gielgud, a friend of many years. Other personal items were left to
Sir John Mills, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Lady Redgrave (actress Rachel
Kempson) and Lady Meriel Richardson, widow of Sir Ralph Richardson.
   Lord Olivier's collection of theatrical books and memorabilia is
to be given in his name to several public exhibitions and
collections. The will directed that a donation of 1,000 pounds
($1,600) be made to the Actors Benevolent Fund.
   Royalties from Olivier's 1982 autobiography ``Confessions of an
Actor'' were bequeathed to Gawn Grainger, ``who wrote the book with
me.''
   A painting of Olivier in the part of Romeo will go to The
National Theater, of which he was director in 1962-1973.
   Much of his estate is to be divided among his widow, actress
Joan Plowright, and his four children.
   Olivier was widely regarded as the foremost actor of his
generation.

   The leader of a leftist guerrilla group
that signed a peace agreement with the government said Friday his
fighters will surrender their weapons in Cali next month.
   Carlos Pizarro Leongomez, commander of the April 19 Movement,
said the rebels will give up the weapons Dec. 16 to the
International Red Cross at the main square in Cali, 175 miles
southwest of Bogota.
   The April 19 Movement, also known as M-19, is the only one of
Colombia's six left-wing guerrilla groups to sign a truce with the
government. It takes its name from the date of the 1970
presidential election that the rebels claim was fraudulent.
   Pizarro made the statement in a televised interview on the
Channel 9 news program.
   The initial truce was signed last month at the guerrilla base
camp, about 50 miles south of Cali.
   There was a ceremonial signing of the peace agreement Thursday
night at the Congress building in Bogota. On Monday there will be
another ceremonial signing at the guerrilla camp.
   The government has agreed to give the M-19 guerrillas amnesty
and promises to assure them of up to 16 seats in Colombia's 315
member Congress in future elections.
   M-19 has claimed to have up to 5,000 combatants, but it
apparently has been decimated by fighting with the army and by
recruiting problems.
   When an Associated Press reporter interviewed Pizarro at the
guerrillas' base during the talks that led to last month's
agreement there were no more than 500 guerrillas at the camp. Rebel
leaders said all of the guerrillas had been summoned to the camp
for the negotiations.
   There were a few veterans, including ones who said they had been
trained in Cuba and Nicaragua, and there were dozens of boys and
girls in their teens.
   M-19 and the government had tried to negotiate a truce in 1983.
The talks failed but some guerrillas were given amnesty and the
government allowed them and sympathizers to form the Patriotic
Union Party.
   Since the party was organized in 1984, right-wing death squads
have killed 737 party members, including the president.
   M-19 leaders have said they would form another party, separate
from the Patriotic Union.

   A National Academy of Sciences study raised
new questions Friday about oil drilling off the California and
Florida coasts, concluding that existing studies give no assurance
the environment can be protected.
   The report was presented to a presidential task force that must
make a recommendation to President Bush by the end of the year on
whether he should issue leases for oil and gas exploration at three
controversial sites.
   A panel of the Academy's National Research Council said the
technical and scientific data available on environmental impacts of
oil drilling at the three sites was found to be insufficient to
warrant leases being issued now.
   Robert Kallman, the task force director, told reporters the
findings would be taken into account, but he said he wasn't
prepared to call the report a setback for drilling nor to rule out
a possible recommendation that leases should be issued.
   The report ``clarifies some of the issues that need to be
addressed,'' Kallman said, suggesting the task force might submit a
series of recommendations to Bush that includes one calling for
additional environmental studies.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, chairman of the task force, has
been a strong proponent of offshore oil development.
   Lujan spokesman Steve Goldstein said Friday that the Academy's
report doesn't change the fact that offshore oil development is
needed to reduce the country's dependence on oil imports.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., called the report ``a major blow''
to the offshore oil drilling program.
   ``It shows when you put three controversial lease sales together
under a microscope you find out that the Interior Department didn't
have enough information to safely go ahead with them, but they did
anyway,'' Miller said.
   The science panel's findings immediately were embraced by other
critics of drilling.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said in a statement that the report
``clearly recognizes the risks to the Florida Keys and other
sensitive resources'' if drilling were allowed.
   ``The administration is now on clear notice. New (oil drilling)
leasing could lead to untold damage to the environment and people
of California,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   The sites off Northern and Southern California and in the Gulf
of Mexico near the Florida Everglades are among the most
controversial government leases sought by the oil industry.
Environmentalists and many local residents oppose opening the
offshore tracts because of environmental concerns.
   Bush put a hold on issuing the leases in February, directing the
special task force to examine the environmental concerns and asking
the National Academy of Sciences to examine the technical and
scientific issues involved.
   The scientific panel concluded that the available technical and
scientific data from each of the three lease sites ``is currently
inadequate for decisions (to be made) about development and
production'' of oil and gas resources.
   The panel, which included experts in marine science,
oceanography and a variety of other disciplines, was critical of
past studies of the lease sites by the Interior Department and
raised particular concern about the lack of in-depth examinations
on the effects on local communities.
   In some cases, information was out of date and at other times
``significant ... social and economic impacts (to communities) have
been ignored,'' the panel said.
   Among its findings were:
   _An oil spill in the Florida site likely would result in oil
reaching the coastline within hours and polluting some state
beaches.
   _More information is needed to assess the effect of oil
development on corals, seagrasses and other elements of the coastal
ecosystems near the Florida site.
   _The impact on nearby communities, including potential damage to
tourism, has been given too little attention.
   John Harrington of the University of Massachusetts, chairman of
the study group, said additional studies could take three to four
years before adequate information is available to accurately
determine the impact of exploration and drilling.
   The leases involve potential oil and gas drilling on 1.1 million
acres of ocean off Southern California, 6.7 million acres off
Northern California and 14 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico near
the Florida Everglades.

   Troops used water cannons and tear
gas Saturday to drive off thousands of Ferdinand Marcos supporters
who massed at national police headquarters to demand that his body
be brought home for burial.
   Marcos, president for 20 years, was forced into exile in
February 1986 and died in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72. President
Corazon Aquino has refused to allow his body to be brought to the
Philippines.
   The demonstrators had permission for an all-night rally outside
Camp Crame, but would not honor an agreement made by their leaders
to disperse at dawn.
   As the sun rose, the remaining loyalists locked arms and jeered
when military officers reminded them of the agreement and shouted
``Go home! Go home!''
   Two water cannons emerged from the main gate at about 6 a.m. and
sprayed the Marcos loyalists. Soldiers and police chased groups of
them down side streets and the fleeing protesters responded with
stones.
   No arrests were reported. Three news photographers suffered
minor injuries when they were struck by flying stones.
   An estimated 15,000 protesters assembled late Friday at Camp
Crame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, the military
national police. The crowd had dwindled to a few thousand when the
confrontation began.
   Demonstrators moved to Camp Crame after a day-long rally Friday
by more than 25,000 people capping a 250-mile march by Marcos
supporters from Ilocos Norte, his native province, that took 11
days.
   It was the largest show of support for Marcos since 1986 and
occurred on the eve of Mrs. Aquino's departure for Canada and the
United States, where she hopes to convince businessmen the
Philippines is a stable place to invest.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel told reporters at the rally that
Mrs. Aquino's refusal to allow Marcos to be buried in the
Philippines was the ``worst mistake'' of her administration.
   Marcos had lived in Hawaii since a civilian-military uprising
drove him from office. Mrs. Aquino has refused, on national
security grounds, to allow the return of his body or of his widow
Imelda and their three children.
   During the rally, the crowd cheered wildly when Laurel asked:
``Do you agree that Marcos' body must be allowed home?''
   ``It is now very clear what the people want,'' he declared.
``You are a very powerful force. The government must follow the
peoples' will. If not, you know what to do.''
   Police gave permission for the rally to be held at a traffic
circle in suburban Quezon City, but refused to let the protesters
march to military garrisons.
   After the rally, marchers defied the order and headed toward
Camp Crame, across a major highway from armed forces headquarters
and the Defense Department.
   About 200 police blocked the street leading to the camp, but
protesters pushed through police lines and swarmed around the gates.
   Reporters saw some riot police raising fingers in the ``V''
sign, symbol of the Marcos movement. Marcos supporters chanted
``Thank you! Thank you!'' to the officers.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the Manila regional defense
command, agreed to let the protesters remain there until midnight.
   Laurel and leaders of the New Society Movement, the Marcos
political party, later negotiated a formal agreement with Biazon
and Local Governments Secretary Luis Santos to let the protesters
stay until 5:30 a.m.
   In a statement broadcast by pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, the
late president's son, Ferdinand Jr., said the demonstration was a
reaction to the ``arrogance of the Aquino administration.''
   ``I congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageous
actions,'' the statement said. ``You show to the world although we
are a moderate, patient people, we Filipinos will not compromise
principles.''
   Camp Crame was the scene last week of protests by Constabulary
troopers angered by government plans to replace the military
national police with a civilian force.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, claimed opposition groups were recruiting troopers
for a new coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino.
   The military went on full alert Tuesday and is to remain in a
state of heightened readiness until she returns Nov. 13 from visits
to Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, New York, Dallas and Los Angeles.
   Several coups have been attempted since Mrs. Aquino took office,
but none has occurred during her frequent trips abroad.
   Aides said Mrs. Aquino would seek increased investment, trade
and relief from the country's $28 billion foreign debt on the trip
to Canada and the United States.

   The northern reaches of Michigan and Wisconsin were pestered by
persistent snow Friday, while thunderstorms doused parts of South
Carolina.
   Low pressure continued to produce snow in the Lake Superior
region, where 35 inches has fallen on Hurley, Wis., since Wednesday.
   Warm, moist air ahead of a cold front was responsible for
scattered rainshowers in the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic coastal
states. Thunderstorms moved into eastern South Carolina and the
east coast of Florida.
   During the six-hour period that ended at 7 p.m. EST, Goldsboro,
N.C., received 1.5 inches of rain, while Homestead, Fla., got 1.15
inches.
   Cloudy skies prevailed east of the Mississippi River and in the
north-central and northwestern United States.
   The warm spot in the Lower 48 states was Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
with a reading of 90 degrees. Miami set a city record with a high
of 88 degrees. The high broke the old mark of 87 degrees, set in
1986.
   Highs elsewhere ranged from the 20s in the Dakotas and upper
Mississippi Valley to the 60s and 70s in the central Gulf Coast
region and the 70s and 80s across most of California.

   Timoci Bavadra, who was prime minister for one
month in 1987 before being ousted in the South Pacific's first army
coup, died Friday after a year-long battle with spinal cancer. He
was 55.
   Family members said Bavadra was taken from his home to Lautoka
Hospital in western Fiji after complaining of chest and abdominal
pains, and was pronounced dead on arrival.
   He died two days after returning to Fiji from six weeks of
treatment in New Zealand. Surgeons in Auckland removed a growth
from his spine in April.
   Fiji gained independence from Britain in 1970. In 1987, Sitiveni
Rabuka, then a lieutenant colonel and now a major general, stormed
Parliament with a small band of masked soldiers, capturing Bavadra
and his ministers.
   They were taken away in army trucks and spent several days under
house arrest.
   Rabuka said he seized the government to protect the political
rights of native Fijians against ethnic Indians, a majority in the
archipelago's population of 715,000.
   When Rabuka had the country under military control, he released
Bavadra.
   Surviving are Bavadra's second wife, Adi Kuini, and 11 children.

<HEAD>`Prague Spring' Leader Interviewed on Soviet Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the leader of Czechoslovakia's
1968 ``Prague Spring'' liberalization that was crushed by Soviet
tanks, has appeared for the first time on Soviet TV and defended
his reforms.
   Clips of an interview with Dubcek, who is now retired and living
in the Slovak capital Bratislava, were shown on the Leningrad
television program ``Fifth Wheel'' on Monday. The Foreign Ministry
commented on the program at a news briefing Friday.
   The clips were taken for a documentary that filmmaker A.
Ruderman is making.
   Dubcek, describing for Ruderman the Aug. 21, 1968, invasion of
his country by troops of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance, said,
``The army came and took the (Communist Party) Central Committee
with tanks and guns. Of course that's a very sad recollection.''
   Dubcek said he picked up his office telephone to call
then-Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev but was confronted by armed
soldiers who ripped out the telephone wires.
   One of several Czechoslovaks who had gathered outside the party
headquarters was shot and fell to the sidewalk, he recalled.
   Interspersed in the film were comments by Prague citizens who
denounced the Warsaw Pact intervention that ousted Dubcek and
installed a hard-line Communist regime.
   Dubcek's comments were shown on Soviet television at a time when
two other Warsaw Pact members, Hungary and Poland, are going much
further than Czechoslovakia's reforms 21 years ago without Kremlin
interference.
   Czechoslovakia's conservative leadership has blocked the reform
efforts championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Dubcek said the 1968 reforms sought to create a society in which
many different opinions could be expressed freely.
   ``Radio, television and the papers did not say just what the
government wanted. There were other points of view, and some of
them were extreme,'' he said. ``Pluralism was written into our
program.''
   Dubcek described how he and other Czechoslovak leaders were
summoned to Moscow where he was stripped of the party's leadership
in 1969 and subsequently ousted from the party.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters Friday
that Soviet officials did not know ahead of time about the ``Fifth
Wheel'' program.
   ``It's quite evident that this interview you're talking about
was not in any way authorized officially and this program was not
known to the authorities before it was aired,'' he said.
   ``Appearances of such programs in an impromptu way provoke some
surprise with us because important political issues are
concerned,'' he added.
   Ruderman said Dubcek had been reluctant to be interviewed
because Czechoslovak authorities still do not approve of his views.

   The government acted Friday to fill Canada's
legislative void on abortion, introducing a bill that would allow a
woman to end pregnancy with a doctor's consent, but stopping short
of abortion on demand.
   ``We must not turn back the clock to a time when women's lives
were threatened because they could not obtain a legal abortion,''
Justice Minister Doug Lewis told a news conference.
   The bill proposed in Parliament in Ottawa puts abortion in the
criminal code. It allows the procedure only with one doctor's
consent when a woman's physical, mental or psychological health is
considered threatened.
   ``Health will be the grounds,'' Lewis said in Ottawa. ``This is
a matter between a woman and her doctor.''
   A doctor who violates the law could face up to two years in
prison. The same penalty could apply to the woman in certain
limited circumstances, such as performing an abortion on herself.
   The Conservative Party official said the fetus' right, which had
not been included previously, ``has to be gauged and balanced with
a woman's right to security of her person.''
   The Conservative bill places no time limits on when abortions
could be performed during pregnancy, nor would they be limited to
hospitals.
   Officials described the bill as a compromise that takes into
account the rights of a woman and the fetus, but it was widely
expected that if passed it will face legal challenges which will
again place the abortion issue before the Supreme Court.
   Pro-abortion groups and opposition parliamentarians objected to
placing the procedure in the criminal code. Dawn Black, a
spokeswoman for the opposition New Democratic Party, said the bill
does nothing to improve access and doctors may be reluctant to
perform abortions because they could face a prison term.
   Judy Kazimirski, chairman of the Canadian Medical Association,
said she did not think ``it will change the way physicians
practice.''
   Liberal Party spokeswoman Mary Clancy said she preferred a law
that allows easy access to abortion early in pregnancy and
restricts the procedure in later stages. ``This bill is a case of
the government speaking with forked tongue,'' she said.
   Anti-abortion organizations complained that the measure gives in
to pro-choice demands and promised to continue their protests.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since January 1988, when
the Supreme Court ruled that the existing law's stringent
requirements for approval infringed on a woman's rights. The House
of Commons failed to approve any of six options before it in July
1988.
   The outcome practically left abortion as a matter between a
woman and her doctor, but dramatic cases in provincial courts last
summer highlighted the legislative vacuum.
   In the most publicized case, the Supreme Court in August struck
down an injunction obtained by a Quebec man to prevent his former
lover, 21-year-old Chantal Daigle, from having an abortion.
   The bill introduced Friday, which could pass the House of
Commons by the end of the year, represents the first time Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's government has proposed an abortion law.
   Mulroney, who personally opposes abortion under almost all
circumstances, told reporters Thursday, ``Like all members of the
caucus, I obviously put water in my wine, too. We're trying to
evolve a common position that is in the national interest.''
   Paul Dodds, a lawyer for the Campaign Life Coalition, said
Friday, ``It's positively outrageous for the Mulroney government to
pretend that this is any kind of compromise.''
   Norma Scarborough of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League
told the Globe and Mail newspaper of Toronto, ``We're still kind of
surprised that they feel there is any need for a bill at all.''
   In the United States, the abortion debate heated up after a
ruling by the Supreme Court on July 3 cut back abortion rights and
allowed states to make abortions harder to obtain. Foes of abortion
have proposed new bills or plan to do so in a number of state
legislatures.

<HEAD>The Secret Is Out: Zsa Zsa is 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over Zsa Zsa Gabor's age need rage no
more, says a former finishing school classmate who claims to have
proof the Hungarian-born entertainer is 72.
   Elizabeth Nussbaum also said the teen-age Zsa Zsa displayed the
same talkative nature that marked her recent trial on various
charges, including slapping a police officer.
   ``Oh, boy, she had a temperament. She had a good personality but
her mouth was always open,'' she said in an interview in Friday's
edition of The Seattle Times.
   Mrs. Nussbaum, who is 73 and lives in Seattle with her retired
husband, has a memory book from Madame Subillia's School for Young
Ladies in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   In it is a photograph of her classmates, including a young Zsa
Zsa. As was the custom in those days, the girls wrote down their
birthdays under their names.
   The date under Zsa Zsa's name: Feb. 6, 1917.
   Miss Gabor's age has long been a subject of speculation, even
before she appeared in a Beverly Hills, Calif., court.
   She was convicted and sentenced to serve three days in jail,
perform 120 hours of community service and pay almost $13,000 in
fines and restitution. She has said she will serve the jail time
but still plans to appeal.
   Her driver's license listed her birthdate as Feb. 6, 1928, but
it had been written in ink. Miss Gabor explained that ``Mexicans''
had stolen and altered the license.
   Mrs. Nussbaum said she and Zsa Zsa roomed with another girl at
the Swiss finishing school when she was 17 and the future Hungarian
beauty queen was 15.
   ``She was fat in those days,'' Mrs. Nussbaum remembered. ``She
was not some small little girl.''
   The only picture missing from her memory book was one of Zsa Zsa
in a bathing suit. Her brother took that picture long ago, Mrs.
Nussbaum said.

   Dorothy Fuldheim, who helped pioneer the way
for women in broadcast journalism and was still doing nightly
television commentaries at age 91, died Friday of complications
from a stroke. She was 96.
   During her career, Ms. Fuldheim interviewed every U.S. president
from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and was the first woman
news commentator on the ABC radio network.
   ``She was probably the first woman to be taken seriously doing
the news,'' said Barbara Walters of ABC News. ``She had verve,
courage and personality. She showed that age need not be a factor
when you have the expertise and the energy. I knew Dorothy
Fuldheim, and she made us all proud.''
   Ms. Fuldheim died at 3:07 a.m. at Mt. Sinai Medical Center,
according to hospital spokeswoman Mary Beth Schotzinger. She had
been living in a Cleveland nursing home until she was admitted to
the hospital Oct. 19.
   Ms. Fuldheim began her television career in 1947, when she was
54 years old, as the news anchorwoman for WEWS-TV in Cleveland. She
had nearly 37 unbroken years with the station.
   Ms. Fuldheim's manner of presentation was sometimes poetic and
usually feisty.
   ``Dorothy was truly a great lady,'' said James H. Knight,
general manager of WEWS and a vice president of Scripps Howard
Broadcasting. ``Her energy and compassion were an inspiration to
all of us who worked with her at WEWS and really to everyone who
knew her.
   ``Her determination and success paved the way for women in the
broadcasting industry. There will not be another person like her.''
   Ms. Fuldheim was both a news reporter and commentator at WEWS in
the 1950s and early 1960s. She then hosted an afternoon interview
program before doing interviews on a daily noon newscast and news
commentary on 6 p.m. newscasts toward the end of her career.
   Apart from presidents, she interviewed Adolf Hitler, the Duke of
Windsor and the Shah of Iran.
   Ms. Fuldheim conducted an interview with Reagan by satellite
hookup on July 27, 1984. A few hours later, she suffered a stroke
that ended her career.
   Ms. Fuldheim had said Albert Einstein was her most memorable
interview.
   ``I was so awed,'' she said. ``It confirmed for me my belief
that man has just begun to develop a brain.''
   Perhaps her most poignant news commentary came May 4, 1970, a
few hours after four students were killed and nine wounded as Ohio
National Guardsmen opened fire during an anti-war protest at Kent
State University. In her tearful comments, she said the incident
amounted to murder.
   Ms. Fuldheim was born Dorothy Violet Snell in Passaic, N.J., in
1893, but grew up in Milwaukee. She graduated from Milwaukee Normal
College, now part of the University of Wisconsin, in 1912.
   She taught elementary school, then joined the Milwaukee Little
Theater. During a performance in Chicago, she met social activist
Jane Addams, who recruited her to become a lecturer on social
causes. She married lawyer Milton Fuldheim in 1918.
   Ms. Fuldheim also authored four books: ``I Laughed, I Cried, I
Loved,'' ``Where Were The Arabs?'' ``A Thousand Friends'' and
``Aunt Molly.''
   She survived two husbands and a daughter, Dorothy Fuldheim
Urman, who died in 1980.

<HEAD>Daniel Ortega, The Man Who Makes Bush See Red</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush ridiculed him as a
``little man in a military uniform,'' but Nicaraguan leader Daniel
Ortega is a far cry from the image of the average, bemedaled Latin
American general.
   Bush was upset because Ortega had announced at a summit called
to celebrate 100 years of Costa Rican democracy that he would end
Nicaragua's 19-month cease-fire with U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Ortega ruined President Oscar Arias' party, said Bush.
   But the lean 43-year-old president who made Bush see red is a
survivor and a tough fighter for his cause.
   ``He commands the respect of the others members of the
(Sandinista party) Directorate,'' says Carlos Guadamuz, director of
the national television station and a former guerrilla companion in
the Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   Ortega was organizing urban and jungle guerrilla groups in his
teens, participating in bank robberies to buy guns and food. He
spent seven years in the late dictator's Anastasio Somoza Debayle's
prisons.
   Personally, he displays a seriousness that those close to him
say hides shyness. He is a solid 5-feet-11, far from a ``little
man'' by Central American standards. He wears a simple, olive-green
uniform with a red-and-black Sandinista bandana, does not smoke or
drink, jogs five miles a day.
   One of his heroes was Rigoberto Lopez, a university student who
in 1956 assassinated dictator Anastasio Somoza Garcia _ the father
of Somoza Debayle _ before dying in a hail of bullets himself. The
other is Cesar Augusto Sandino, who fought the U.S. Marines in the
1930s and was killed by Somoza Garcia.
   The Somozas ruled Nicaragua for 43 years. Ortega has never
forgotten the Marines' role in installing them or the support they
had from the United States.
   He was first among equals when the Sandinistas, in 1979,
overthrew Somoza Debayle. He became head of the junta that took
over and in 1984 was elected president.
   Bush calls Ortega's government a threat to national security and
U.S. foreign policy, and some Nicaraguan politicians agree.
   ``War is his only vocation,'' said Virgilio Godoy, vice
presidential candidate for an opposition coalition in the February
1990 elections. ``He has a deep resentment of Nicaraguan society
that reflects his revolutionary youth.''
   Ortega was born Nov. 11, 1945, in La Libertad, in the
south-central mountain province of Chontales; he comes from a
middle-class family and attended schools run by the Roman Catholic
Church.
   ``I knew most of the future Sandinista leaders then,'' a priest
and school principal told The Associated Press earlier this year.
``The Ortega brothers were not necessarily good students, but they
were leaders and good athletes.''
   He grew up influenced by the romantic and heroic verses of
Nicaraguan poet Ruben Dario. The Sandinistas were the young rebels
who wrote and recited poems and read Marx in the mountains hiding
from Somoza's National Guard.
   One brother, Camilo, died a guerrilla. The other, Humberto, is
the defense minister.
   Ortega's opponents see him as a tough, pragmatic man who can sit
down for talks and will compromise when necessary, who is not a
radical revolutionary tied to Marxist ideology.
   Opposition leader and presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro
got a promise that her newspaper, La Prensa, would be allowed to
reopen without censorship. Ortega has kept that promise.
   He and Humberto are believed to exercise a moderating influence
in the Directorate of the ruling Sandinista party, reining in
Marxist ideologues who want to do away with all signs of a
capitalist economy in Nicaragua.
   As the war with the Contras sapped the government's resources
and the economy, Ortega convinced others in the Sandinista
Directorate to participate in peace talks sponsored by other
Central American presidents.
   The results were agreements calling for dismantling the Contras
in exchange for free elections in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas are
confident they will win but the whole process has been thrown into
doubt by Contra defiance.
   Ortega denies that his government's decision to end the
cease-fire is an excuse to cancel voting set for Feb. 25, but he
maintains that U.S. refusal to disband the Contras and its economic
assistance to the opposition are a bigger threat to free elections.
   ``We were tired of turning the other cheek every time,'' he
said, referring to attacks he said were made by Contra groups in
recent weeks.

<HEAD>Soviet Miners Block Coal Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region
are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments,
the Soviet news media reported Friday.
   The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of
improved living and job conditions.
   Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel
rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that
would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade
benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a
sympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirle
coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for
months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the
horizon in the winter.
   A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round of
strikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties. The miners's
unions said the decision will be appealed.
   Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for
two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament
passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social
and economic conditions. The miners say the government has renedged
on its promises.
   The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes:
   Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest
mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth
day, according to Tass.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out at
three mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were still
working but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside the
region.
   In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major
coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another
strike. Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for two
hours Wednesday.
   Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the
House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for
implementing reforms.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Computer Worm Case Can Go to Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Friday that the case
of a former graduate student accused of unleashing a ``worm''
program into thousands of computers nationwide can go to trial.
   A federal judge rejected pleas from the lawyer of Robert T.
Morris to dismiss a felony computer fraud charge because
information leaked by the Justice Department would prevent him from
receiving a fair trial.
   Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, contended the Justice
Department improperly revealed to a reporter before Morris was
indicted in July that Morris had given a statement to prosecutors
and that the department was considering whether he should be
allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson said no concrete proof was
offered to show that Morris suffered from the Justice Department
disclosures. The judge scheduled the trial for Nov. 29.
   In November 1988, a ``worm'' program that prosecutors said
Morris created clogged a network of about 6,000 computers shared by
colleges, research centers and the military.
   It took several days to cleanse the network of the program,
which multiplied out of control, overloading memories at such
places as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
Moffett Field, Calif., and Air Force Logistics Command at Wright
Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.
   Computer industry experts estimated the down time and working
hours needed to combat the program cost from $5 million to $12
million.
   Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md., became the first person in the
country to be charged criminally under the 1986 Computer Fraud and

   Sister Diana Mae Ortiz, a 31-year-old
American nun who disappeared from a retreat house in Guatemala
after receiving threatening letters, was freed on Friday, church
officials said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Dickmeyer said church officials
were treating the incident as a kidnapping, and added, ``We're very
concerned to get to the bottom of this.''
   ``Thanks be to God, everything turned out well,'' said Monsignor
Oriano Quilici, the papal nuncio.
   He and Archbishop Prospero Penados de Barrios said Ms. Ortiz, a
member of the Ursuline order, was freed Friday morning in downtown
Guatemala City and taken to the house of the Maryknoll order.
   They declined to give details of her disappearance and U.S.
consular officials were not allowed to see her.
   ``They said she was resting,'' Dickmeyer said.
   The archbishop had said Ms. Ortiz, a native of Grants, N.M.,
disappeared on Thursday from the garden of the Belene Sisters
Retreat House, a former convent in Antigua where she was taking
classes.
   Ms. Ortiz, who had been teaching kindergarten for more than a
year in the town of San Miguel Acatan in Huehuetenango province,
received several threats warning her to leave the country, he
reported.
   Penados de Barrios said another nun, Sister Patricia Denny, 54,
of the Maryknoll order, left Guatemala last month after receiving
repeated death threats.
   Ms. Ortiz taught school in Owensboro and Hawesville, Ky., before
coming to Guatemala two years ago.
   Neither the national police in Guatemala City or in Antigua, 28
miles west of the capital, would comment on the case.
   Since mid-July, Guatemala has been suffering from a resurgence
of assassinations, disappearances and other violence like that
which claimed tens of thousands of lives in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
   Huehuetenango was the scene of some of the worst human rights
violations of that era and remains a zone of conflict between
leftist guerrillas and the military.
   Many observers blame ultrarightists with links to the military
for most of renewed violence.
   Church workers active in poor communities have traditionally
been targets of rightist violence in Guatemala.
   In Louisville, Ky., The Courier-Journal said Sister Mary
Elizabeth Ballard of the Mount St. Joseph Ursuline Sisters of Maple
Mount, Ky., worked with Ms. Ortiz. Ms. Ballard returned to Kentucky
because her father died and planned to return to Guatemala on
Saturday. The paper quoted her as giving this account:
   Ms. Ortiz received at least seven letters since January telling
her to leave the country.
   She did leave for a time after an incident in Guatemala City in
mid-July.
   ``A man she didn't know called her by name, took her arm and
sort of forced her to walk with him while he talked. He knew where
she worked and told her to leave.''
   A stronger threat came on Oct. 12, about a month after Ms. Ortiz
returned to Guatemala.
   ``Violent words, such as `decapitated,' `assassinated' and
`rape,' were cut out of the paper and pasted on a paper.''
   The paper was put under the door of her room at a convent in
Guatemala City.
   Ms. Ortiz asked her to keep the letters in case they were ever
needed as evidence.
   The archbishop, who led a peace march of 15,000 children last
Saturday, had said earlier he would ask the government to try to
locate Ms. Ortiz.
   In Grants, fifth-grade teacher Rosella Vigil, a longtime friend
and former classmate of Ms. Ortiz, expressed joy and gratitude on
hearing of Ms. Ortiz's release.
   She said Ms. Ortiz returned to Grants for two months this past
summer and at that time discussed her dedication to the people,
especially her pupils.
   ``She was determined to go back ... She called them her
people,'' Ms. Vigil said.

<HEAD>Artists Rally at Capitol to Save House Murals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two murals condemned by some state
legislators as pornographic or unsuitable for the capitol won a
reprieve Friday, prompting the artist to ``Thank God for Jesse
Helms'' for arousing support for the arts.
   But the man hailed as the real hero by arts buffs was House
Speaker Joe King, who told reporters he would try to prevent a vote
on his decision to save the murals.
   ``Some things you don't put to a majority vote,'' he said.
   King said he was angered by attacks by Helms, the Republican
senator from North Carolina, on controversial art financed by
taxpayers.
   A pair of giant abstract panels titled ``Twelve Labors of
Hercules'' hanging on opposite sides of the House chamber have
inspired controversy since they were installed in 1981.
   Some opponents have claimed to see a depiction of a couple
engaging in sexual intercourse in one of the scenes. Others have
questioned whether the stark, black-and-white murals belonged in
the ornate, baroque House chambers.
   The House voted in 1982 to hide the murals behind curtains.
Earlier this year, King ordered the drapes removed but also voted
to take the artwork down.
   But last month, the speaker reversed himself and persuaded the
House Executive Rules Committee to halt the dismantling process
that had been scheduled to begin in a few weeks.
   Republican leader Clyde Ballard and other critics said they'll
press for a full House vote when lawmakers convene in January.
   King's foes suggested he was was trying to curry favor with the
wealthy Seattle arts community for a possible run for governor in
1992.
   King conceded many House members oppose the panels, perhaps even
a majority, but he insisted that if the arts community is ``given
enough time to do an education job,'' lawmakers will be won over as
he was.
   ``Educate the legislature. We need gentle encouragement, not
stridency,'' King told a rally of several dozen artists and
supporters sponsored by the Artist Trust and Allied Arts of Seattle.
   Michael Spafford, the Seattle artist who painted the $100,000
work, told the protesters he wasn't interested in controversy.
   ``I think they are quite beautiful in this building,'' he said.
``But I also appreciate the feelings of people who don't like them.
That's OK.''
   He and others paid wry tribute to Helms, saying he helped turn
public opinion against banning works of art.
   ``Thank God for Jesse Helms,'' Spafford said. ``Talk about a
Greek drama. If he hadn't existed, he would have been invented.''
   Reacting to a federally supported exhibit that included
photographs of homosexuals, Helms tried to get the U.S. Senate to
bar federal arts spending on anything that might be considered
offensive. A watered-down House-Senate compromise was reached that
would establish a panel to oversee federal arts endowment policy.
   Richard Andrews, director of the Henry Art Gallery at the
University of Washington, said Helms ``put the fear of government
censorship in the minds of people who wouldn't have given a fig
about art ordinarily.''
   Andrews said people who claim to see acts of intercourse,
violence against women or racial strife in the work are merely
projecting their own fears and preoccupations.

<HEAD>Poland Cuts Subsidies to Communists, Other Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led government announced
Friday it is cutting off public funds to the Communist Party by
Jan. 1, ending subsidies and tax exemptions that totaled $27.1
million in 1989.
   State money to the United Peasants Party and the Democratic
Party and to other social organizations also will end Jan. 1, but
the government said it will not try to recover past payouts.
   The Peasant and Democratic parties this year ended a long and
docile alliance with the communists to form a majority coalition
with Solidarity.
   Officials told a news conference the cutoffs underline
government determination to stop granting advantages to certain
political parties and start treating each equally.
   Communist party spokesman Janusz Bisztyga was not available to
comment on the decision, his office said.
   ``The strength of political parties and social and political
organizations should grow out of social support and dues, and not
from any system of privileges,'' said Aleksander Hall, the minister
in charge of relations with political parties.
   He said the Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki recognizes as ``obvious'' the right to form new
political parties and will support constitutional changes to make
that right explicit in the constitution.
   The position marked a sharp departure from the attitude of past
communist governments, which held that all parties were illegal
except for the three mentioned in the constitution: the Communists,
the Peasants and the Democrats.
   Hall said his office plans to call a meeting of the established
parties and the scores of new ones that sprang up this year during
Poland's sharp turn toward democracy to work out remaining problems.
   Controversial points include whether a law should be passed to
regulate the activities of political parties, as favored by
communist legislators, and whether political parties should be
allowed to be active at factories and other workplaces, and in the
army, police, government offices and courts, Hall said.
   The communist party now has offices at most state enterprises,
functioning in many cases as a shadow management, and in recent
months several instances have arisen in which workers demanded
eviction of party officials.
   Direct government subsidies to political parties have been
blocked for the rest of 1989 and no more subsidies will be granted,
Marian Dabrowski, a deputy finance minister, told reporters.
   He said tax exemptions to the communist party-owned publishing
and news kiosk cooperative RSW Prasa, which has a virtual monopoly
on newspaper and magazine publishing and sales, also will end Jan.
1.
   Subsidies to the communist party in 1989 totaled $5.4 million
and tax exemptions given RSW Prasa equaled $21.7 million, said
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska.

   A 72-year-old nursing home resident was
shot and killed by four young men who robbed him of the
cheeseburger and fries he had picked up at a fast-food restaurant,
police said.
   ``What can you say about people who rob someone of a
cheeseburger and french fries?'' said Capt. Gary VanBuskirk of the
city's homicide unit. ``There aren't enough adjectives to describe
those kinds of people.''
   John Gardner of Kansas City was shot once in the head about

said. In his hand, Gardner still clutched a dollar bill and coins.
   Witnesses told police they heard a shot and saw four young men
run from the area. No descriptions of the robbers were available.
   Gardner had been returning to the Harvest Home Estates nursing
home when he was killed, police said.

<TEXT>
   Court employees crippled the judicial
system Friday with their third strike of the anti-drug war, led by
judges who want guns and bulletproof cars for protection from
assassins hired by cocaine barons.
   A union of judges and court workers said this strike had no time
limit. The first strike lasted a week and the second three days.
   Also on Friday, all 42 of Medellin's federal judges announced
they were resigning, according to the Colombian radio network RCN.
They had begun an indefinite strike Thursday, demanding more
protection from drug traffickers.
   The resignations are not effective unless accepted by the
Supreme Court, which usually does not accept such en masse actions.
   Drug traffickers have killed three federal judges in three
months, one just before President Virgilio Barco declared war on
the cocaine cartels in August. They have shown no sign of easing a
terror campaign aimed at forcing the government to end extraditions
to the United States.
   A car bomb exploded in Bogota shortly before midnight Thursday,
killing four people, including a child. Three other small bombs
went off Thursday night and a fourth was deactivated, Bogota police
reported.
   On Friday afternoon, two men on a motorcycle threw a homemade
bomb at a clothing store in Medellin and a woman and child were cut
by glass from windows shattered by the explosion, police reported.
They said the terrorists escaped and the victims were hospitalized
in stable condition.
   No one claimed responsibility, but security forces assume the
scores of explosions that began in August are the work of the drug
gangs. The 186 bombings reported have killed 29 people and wounded
at least 228.
   The court strike began in stages Thursday after federal judge
Mariela Espinoza was shot down with automatic weapons Wednesday
night in front of her home in Medellin, headquarters of the most
notorious cocaine cartel.
   Forty-three judges and 179 other court employees have been
killed in Colombia during the past eight years, many of them by
drug traffickers.
   On Oct. 28, the bodies of two court workers were found in a
river in Cali, hands tied behind them, police in the western city
told The Associated Press on Friday. Cali is the base of another
major drug gang.
   A police spokesman said the victims had been tortured. The
spokesman would not give his name or additional details.
   For the first time in the three strikes, court workers took
their protest to the streets Friday. Several dozen blocked busy
19th Street in downtown Bogota and some exchanged blows with about
50 riot policemen who tried to clear the street.
   No one was arrested and the street was not cleared.
   Strike banners hung from windows of the downtown building where
scores of judges have offices.
   Even the Supreme Court, which never goes on strike, said the
government had been remiss in not giving judges and their helpers
more protection.
   ``We consider that it is exceptionally difficult to administer
quick and complete justice under the current working conditions,''
the president of the 24-member court, Fabio Moron Diaz, said in a
statement.
   Although not involved in the strike, low pay is another frequent
complaint in the court system. Federal appellate judges earn the
equivalent of about $500 a month, municipal judges $400 and court
employees $150 to $200.
   The National Association of Court Workers, which declared the
strike, began months ago demanding bulletpoof vests and cars, guns,
weapons training, bodyguards, metal detectors for offices and even
devices that detect fumes emitted by dynamite.
   Union President Helmut Romero said last month the membership was
14,000 members, but news reports said 19,000 people were on strike.
Many of Colombia's 9,000 non-union court workers usually join the
strikes.
   Court workers were found to be working Friday in Risaralda,
central Colombia, one of 23 states in this nation of 30 million
people.
   Judges have been relieved of hearing cases for extradition of
people charged with narcotics offenses in the United Sates, which
now are handled by the government's National Security Council.
   Five Colombians have been extradited to the United States to
face charges of money laundering, conspiracy and drug trafficking
since the crackdown began.
   In November 1985, guerrillas of the M-19 movement seized the
Palace of Justice in Bogota and held Supreme Court justices and
court employees hostage. The army stormed the palace and 109
people, including 12 justices, were killed.
   M-19 now has signed a peace agreement with the government and
M-19 commander Carlos Pizarro Leongomez said on Friday that his
fighters will surrender their weapons in Cali on Dec. 16.

   The two major parties wrapped up their
election campaigns with speeches and music Friday, two days before
they face off in national elections.
   The conservative New Democracy Party staged a concert of popular
Greek music at Olympic Stadium in Athens, and former socialist
Premier Andreas Papandreou addressed a rally of his party's
supporters in the northern city of Salonica.
   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis expressed confidence
that his party would win an outright majority Sunday. His party
advocates closer ties with the West.
   ``A bright victory lies ahead, not only for us but for Greece,''
Mitsotakis said before the concert, which featured three of the
most popular Greek composers.
   The 71-year-old conservative leader said this week that if his
party did not win a clear majority it would move to hold new
elections rather than cooperate with any other party.
   In June, New Democracy defeated Papandreou's socialists but
failed to gain a majority of the 300 seats in Parliament. It teamed
with the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress to end
Papandreou's eight-year administration and investigate charges of
corruption in that government.
   The unusual conservative-communist governing alliance had
Papandreou and five former ministers indicted by Parliament in
September for alleged complicity in scandals.
   Papandreou, 70, has appeared unfazed by his indictment on
charges of authorizing the widespread telephone wiretaps while in
office and charges of complicity in the embezzling of $210 million
from a bank.
   Special high courts are expected to try him and his ministers
early next year.
   ``Hands off Andreas,'' his supporters chanted throughout his
speech in a central square in Salonica.
   Papandreou has promised to increase private and public
investment, fight unemployment, and boost farmers' income if
elected.
   The communist coalition has refused to cooperate with the
socialists so long as it is led by Papandreou. They also say that
it is impossible to govern with New Democracy because their
programs are incompatible.

   Police arrested several teen-age girls Friday in
connection with 39 attacks in which women on Manhattan's Upper West
Side were jabbed with pins.
   Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman, said the suspects were all
under 16 years old and their identities would not be revealed
because of their ages. He would not immediately say how many were
in custody.
   Police believe the attacks were racially motivated. The last
occurred on or prior to Oct. 27, the day the first television
reports about the incidents aired.
   In most of the attacks, as many as eight black teen-agers,
mostly girls, approached a white woman from behind and jabbed her
once. In some instances, the attackers giggled or laughed loudly at
their victims.
   Some victims had voiced fears that they might have been jabbed
with an AIDS-infected hypodermic needle.
   Police, however, have determined the weapon used was a common
pin, Burns said.

   Former Gov. Fernando Collor de
Mello is leading all 22 candidates in the race for the presidency
two weeks before the elections, according to a public opinion poll
released Friday.
   The poll by the DataFolha institute showed Collor de Mello, who
has served as governor of Alagoas state, was the choice of 21
percent of voters questioned nationwide.
   Only four candidates are given a chance to win the Nov. 15
election and the DataFolha poll gave these figures for the three
others:
   Millionaire businessman Silvio Santos and Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party were in tied for
second with 14 percent each. Leonel Brizola of the center-left
Democratic Labor Party had 13 percent.
   A nationwide poll released Thursday by the Gallup Institute gave
Santos a 29.3 percent rating. Right-centrist Collor de Mello
received 18.6 percent, Da Silva 10.6 percent and Brizola 9.9
percent, according to Gallup.
   Santos, a conservative, had only declared his candidacy Tuesday
and the Gallup results surprised many Brazilians. Collor de Mello
had held a two-to-one advantage over his nearest opponent for the
past five months.
   The DataFolha poll was carried by Globo TV, Brazil's largest
network. It said 5,250 people in 141 cities were questioned between
Wednesday and Friday. The network did not report the margin of
error.
   The Gallup poll was reported by the newspaper O Estado de Sao
Paulo and it said 4,722 people were interviewed between Oct. 26 and
Nov. 1. It said the margin of error was three percent.
   Globo TV said that in the DataFhola poll people were chosen at
random and asked to choose from one of the 22 candidates listed on
a circular disc.
   The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper questioned the Gallup results.
   It said poll takers first asked those interviewed who they
preferred without mentioning the names of the other candidates.
They were then asked if they would vote for Santos if he were to
run, according to the newspaper.
   Santos heads the second-largest private television network in
this country, which has a population of 145 million.

   Thousands of East Germans crammed
into the West German Embassy cheered ``Freiheit!'' _ Freedom! _
when they heard late Friday that their communist homeland was
allowing them to go directly to West Germany, and some immediately
headed west.
   The estimated 5,000 refugees jammed in the embassy building and
in 30 tents hurriedly thrown up on its elegant grounds shouted in
joy and flashed V-for-victory with their fingers as they got the
first word on West German radio.
   They burst into cheers again when West German diplomats later
announced the East Germans could leave legally by any means they
liked, by simply showing their East German identity documents.
   The first private cars and two West German tour buses with about
100 refugees on board headed toward the West German border at
midnight Friday, about an hour after the announcement.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters no time limit was set on the exodus. It was not clear if
this meant the effective removal of barriers on travel to West
Germany for East Germans, who may visit Czechoslovakia without
permission from their government.
   West German officials said many of those in the embassy would
depart on special trains from Prague's Liben station Saturday
morning.
   West Germany said the agreement was reached with East Germany,
permitting the third such exodus from the West German mission in
Prague in six weeks.
   Scores of East Germans arriving fresh from their homes turned up
at the embassy astonished and happy to discover they could already
leave.
   More than 12,000 East Germans had swarmed across the border into
Czechoslovakia in the three days since their government lifted a
month-old ban on travel to the country, the only land East Germans
may visit without prior permission.
   More than 2,000 East Germans flooded into the Prague mission on
Friday alone, many voicing bitter disappointment with promises of
reform from a new Communist leader at home.
   Harried diplomats tried to process the refugees. Tents were
erected and staircases filled with people to try to accommodate the
influx.
   The overcrowding apparently forced the latest East German
agreement to an exodus. Last month, two waves of East German
emigres left last month on special trains from Prague through East
Germany to West Germany.
   The arrangement announced Friday apparently allows the East
Germans to go West without waiting for the cumbersome bureaucratic
procedure of renouncing their East German citizenship through the
East German Embassy in Prague.
   This would avoid clashes that ensued in October when thousands
of East Germans tried to board the rail cars going west as they
passed through their Communist nation.
   East Germany's new leader Egon Krenz, who announced sweeping
reforms and the resignation of five aging Politburo members in a
national television address Friday night, apparently was anxious to
avoid more clashes.
   Krenz also appealed to his citizens to stay in their Communist
homeland, which has lost more than 70,000 citizens fleeing through
eastern Europe since August. Another 101,000 East Germans have
emigrated legally to West Germany this year.
   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, had banned travel to
Czechoslovakia to stop an earlier exodus of mostly young, skilled
workers from the Communist country.
   Honecker's ouster and indications Krenz might be open to some
reforms did not sway some of the refugees.
   ``It's just the same hard-headed idiots as before,'' said a
bricklayer from Karl-Marx-Stadt. ``What's going to change? The
corrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes,
that's all.''
   ``You've just got to use an open barn door to the West while you
can,'' said a 25-year-old from Leipzig.
   Some blamed Krenz himself for their decision to leave, citing
his comments during a visit to Moscow this week that ii is ``not
possible'' to reunite East and West Germany.
   ``When he buried any hope of reunification, I knew I've got to
get out,'' said a young father from Dresden.

   An oil drilling ship capsized during a
typhoon in the Gulf of Thailand and rescuers sought to learn if any
of the 97 people aboard were alive, a spokesman for the owner,
Unocal, said Friday.
   No signs of life were apparent, although rescue efforts were
hampered by 6-foot waves and 15 mph winds, said Barry Lane, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles-based oil company.
   Ships and aircraft had been searching for the 351-foot Seacrest,
a Panamanian-registered vessel, following a severe typhoon that
swept through the area with 100-mph winds and 35-foot waves.
   The ship was spotted with its bottom up by a Unocal vessel
Saturday morning, or about 5:20 p.m. PST, said Lane, who had
received news of the sighting from Unocal Thailand Ltd. officials
in Bangkok.
   ``They're in constant radio contact with our ships, planes and
helicopters in the area,'' Lane said.
   The Unocal subsidiary had aircraft and ships searching the area,
which were joined by ships and aircraft of the Thai navy and air
force.
   A drilling rig mounted in the center of the ship, reaching 60
feet or higher, was stacked with equipment and there was concern
the ship might have been too top-heavy to weather such a fierce
storm, Lane said.
   ``We expect to be putting some divers in the water to be looking
at it, but I think they're a little leery of that because of the
weather conditions,'' Lane said.
   Unocal officials said the crew included 67 Thai nationals and 30
people from other nations.
   Just before the typhoon hit, the Seacrest was in the Platong
field, located about 270 miles south of Bangkok, and the crew was
preparing to run casing into a recently drilled well, a statement
from Unocal said. The well was secured as the storm formed.
   Unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12 hours after the
storm struck Thursday.
   The typhoon developed suddenly and the crew of the Seacrest had
relatively short notice, Lane said.
   ``This actually was a small storm, a squall, and it escalated
very quickly into a tropical storm, and then a typhoon,'' Lane said.
   The Seacrest is owned by a Unocal subsidiary and operated by
Great Eastern Drilling and Engineering Co. of Singapore. Of those
on board, 77 were Great Eastern employees, one was a Unocal worker
and 19 were from various other oilfield companies.
   Unocal Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier said other company
facilities in the gulf suffered only minor damage and there were no
reported injuries. Unocal had more than 1,100 workers offshore on
46 platforms and 18 vessels at the time the storm struck.
   Unocal operates five natural gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand
that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of natural gas
daily. The Seacrest first went into service in 1978.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Launch Offensive Against Contra Bands</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Contra leader saying rebels
will not attend meeting next week, Ortega offering another meeting date.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista troops were airlifted into
remote mountains and jungles in a sweeping offensive against the
Contras, and a rebel source said Friday hundreds of Contra fighters
were retreating into Honduras.
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, a Contra leader said Friday that the
U.S.-backed rebels would not meet next week at the United Nations
with Sandinista representatives and proposed the meeting be delayed
a week.
   President Daniel Ortega on Friday instead proposed a shorter
delay in hopes that Honduran government officials also would attend.
   Defense Ministry sources in Managua, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said fighting was going on in the mountains that run
from the northern border with Honduras to the southeast.
   They said the army struck in eight provinces where an estimated
3,000 guerrillas were holed up in small bands. The Sandinista
soldiers were flown in by Soviet-built helicopters.
   No information on casualties was forthcoming.
   In Costa Rica, a well-placed Contra source said hundreds of
rebel fighters were fleeing Nicaragua and returning to base camps
in Honduras.
   ``Our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and can't confront
an army as powerful as the Sandinistas that is using all of its
force to annihilate us,'' he said, speaking on the condition of not
being identified.
   He said the fighters who have opted to remain on Nicaraguan
territory are under orders to take refuge in the most inaccessible
areas possible.
   The offensive coincided with Ortega's announcement that he was
ending a 19-month truce. He said he took the action because the
Contras had begun returning to Nicaragua from base camps to which
they retreated in 1988.
   One Sandinista field commander, Col. Roberto Calderon, told
government radio on Friday that more troops were deployed in the
present offensive than for a 1988 campaign that helped bring about
the truce.
   A force of 4,000 Sandinista soldiers were deployed along the
frontier with Honduras in the 1988 push.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada said Friday that troops
backed by helicopter gunships attacked about 500 Contras in central
Chontales province. It said helicopter troop carriers were being
used to ``persecute the criminals'' in La Pinuela and La Cusuca,
170 miles east of the capital.
   A Defense Ministry communique said Thursday that three rebels
were killed in El Guapote, 120 miles northeast of the capital in
Matagalpa province. It said fighting in Pantasma and Plan de Grama
in Jinotega wounded seven soldiers.
   Government forces were reorganizing in northern Nueva Segovia,
Madriz and Esteli provinces, Radio Sandino said.
   Contra military commander Enrique Bermudez has said his troops,
cut off from U.S. military aid for 21 months, will take only
evasive action.
   The Contras began returning to Nicaragua after Ortega and the
other Central American presidents signed an agreement to disband
and relocate the rebels. The Contras have not agreed to being
disbanded.
   Bermudez says about 6,000 of the 12,000 fighters in Honduras
have crossed the border. U.S. officials put the number of Contras
in Nicaragua at about 4,000.
   The Contras will not attend a meeting with Sandinista officials
proposed for Monday and Tuesday at the United Nations, said
Wilfredo Montalvan, a director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, in San
Jose. The meeting should be held Nov. 13 ``to be able to prepare
ourselves,'' he said.
   Later Friday, Ortega said the meeting should be delayed until
Thursday in hopes that Honduran officials would attend. The
Honduran government has said existing peace accords are sufficient
and declined to send representatives to Ortega's proposed meeting.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said the meeting at U.N.
headquarters will be mediated by officials from the Organization of
American States and the United Nations.
   A senior U.N. official said privately the agenda will include
the agreement on disbanding the Contras as well as Sandinista
promises for free and fair presidential elections on Feb. 25.
   He said the Contras are expected to insist on resumption of the
cease-fire.

<HEAD>LSU Suspends Medical Research In Which Cats Are Shot In The Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army-funded research project in which cats
are shot in the head to study brain wounds was suspended Friday by
Louisiana State University Medical Center amid a congressional
investigation.
   Dr. Perry Rigby, chancellor of the medical center, said the
General Accounting Office study of the program was requested last
spring by U.S. Rep. Robert Livingston of New Orleans.
   He said the suspension was not related to strident protests
against the project by animal rights groups.
   Dr. Robert Daniels, dean of the School of Medicine at LSU-New
Orleans, said a panel of top scientists from LSU would be assembled
to conduct its own internal review of the program.
   Although reviews of all research projects at LSU are conducted
periodically, Rigby said, suspending the project and conducting a
more intense internal review could make LSU better able to respond
to any GAO findings.
   The report by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, should
be released no sooner than December, perhaps not until sometime in
1990, Rigby said. The school's internal review should take six to
eight weeks, Daniels said.
   ``As an institution, we take our responsibilities seriously, and
we all feel that any questions about this project should be
answered to the satisfaction of the scientific community and the
appropriate government agencies,'' Rigby said.
   Project director Dr. Michael Carey didn't attend Friday's news
conference announcing the suspension of the project and the
internal LSU review.
   In the experiment, a cat is anesthetized, a portion of the front
of its skull is removed and it is locked into a vise. A
helium-powered gun then fires a small steel sphere into the cat's
brain from about 31 inches.
   The object, Carey has said, is to determine the best treatment
for brain-wounded soldiers.
   In a television interview last May, he said the experiment has
shown that a bullet wound to the brain stops respiration, but if
respiration is supported artificially, the animal will begin
breathing again on its own.
   The project has brought an estimated $2 million to LSU Medical
Center over about the past six years, Rigby and Daniels said.
   Critics, including The Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, have said the research is superfluous and have asked
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to end funding for it.
   At Friday's news conference neither Rigby nor Daniels would
discuss specific findings of the research. Daniels said he expects
an article on Carey's findings to be published soon in ``The
Journal of Neurosurgery.''
   The two men estimated that about 700 cats have been subjected to
the experiments. All are routinely euthanized, but one that
survived the experiment particularly well was not put to sleep,
Rigby said.
   A spokesperson for a New Orleans animal protection group known
as Animal Peace could not be reached immediately Friday to comment
on LSU's decision. The group and others have harshly criticized the
experiments.

<TEXT>
   A published report about Barney the
talking dog left some Charlotte Observer employees speechless when
callers eager to hear the voluble canine overloaded telephone lines
at the newspaper.
   ``We certainly underestimated the public's appetite to hear a
talking dog,'' said Tom Tozer, Observer features editor, after the
newspaper ran a story that included a phone number readers could
call to hear a taped message from the 6-year-old dachshund in
nearby Valdese.
   The dog's owner, Mable Wiles, says the dog has a vocabulary that
includes, ``I'm hungry,'' ``Mama,'' ``Yes,'' ``No,'' and
``Huh-unnh.''
   When calls overloaded The Observer's phone lines, the paper
discontinued the call-in late Thursday.
   ``The sheer volume of people trying to call Barney is filling up
the trunk lines coming into The Observer building,'' said Southern
Bell spokesman Clifton Metcalf on Thursday afternoon.
   Some of the overflow went to Mercy Hospital's nursing school,
which has two lines with the same prefix as the Barney line.
   ``For awhile this morning, it was rather frustrating,'' said Kim
Rickwood, public relations director for the hospital. ``Calls were
coming into our instructors' offices. They would answer the phone,
`Mercy School of Nursing,' and people would hang up. Finally, one
instructor said, `Who are you trying to reach?' and the caller
said, `I'm calling the talking dog.'''
   Tozer said the paper had made copies of the Barney tape
available to local television and radio stations so people can hear
it.
   Mike Burney of WSOC-TV said it was ``a fun thing to air, but I
don't think any of us were overwhelmed by the dog's ability. It's
unique, but it's still a little hard to make a case that the dog's
actually talking.''
   Ms. Wiles said the tape doesn't do her dog justice, ``Especially
when he gets down to his bass voice.''

<TEXT>
   Six weeks after Hurricane Hugo pounded
ashore with 135 mph winds, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. on Friday
pronounced this historic seaport ``is back, it's alive and it's
growing stronger.''
   As proof, Riley said 72,000 truckloads of debris _ more than
two-thirds of the wreckage left by Hugo _ have been moved out of
the city since the deadly hurricane swept ashore on Sept. 21.
   ``We haven't consulted with Ripley's, but maybe for a community
of our size it could be a world record,'' the mayor said at a news
conference.
   During an average year, the city produces only 17,000 truckloads
of debris such as tree limbs and grass clippings, the mayor said.
   Although one debris contractor is running behind schedule, Riley
said all areas of the city will have received at least one sweep by
cleanup crews by Tuesday. He said an estimated 30,000 truckloads of
debris remain to be cleared.
   For that and other reasons, visitors to Charleston's historic
sites may find traveling around town takes a little longer than
usual.
   One of the casualties of the storm was Charleston's computerized
traffic signal system. It could be another two months before the
system is operational, Riley said.
   After debris removal, the biggest challenge facing the community
is repairing housing and roofs, the mayor said.
   In addition, repairs need to be made to a number of parks and
playgrounds and the city marina.
   The Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, scene of major operas and
concerts staged by the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., was heavily damaged
in the storm. Repairs are scheduled to be made by March 1, Riley
said.
   Work on the city's new Waterfront Park on the Cooper River also
was slowed by the storm. Two fountain pumps were destroyed and the
company that manufactures the pumps suffered heavy damage in the
Oct. 17 earthquake in Northern California, Riley said.

<HEAD>Security Council Slams South Africa for Namibian ``False Alarm''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Friday assailed
``the false alarm by South Africa'' that accused Namibian
guerrillas of invading Namibia just before national elections.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Wednesday that
U.N. peacekeepers radioed each other about more than 600 fighters
of the South-West Africa People's Organization infiltrating from
Oct. 23 to Tuesday.
   U.N. officials in Namibia examined transcripts of the radio
messages provided by South Africa and pronounced them ``forgeries''
that did not conform to the style or content of radio transmissions
by U.N. peacekeepers.
   ``The Security Council deplores the false alarm by South Africa
on Nov. 1 concerning the alleged movement of SWAPO forces across
the Angola-Namibia border,'' said the statement, adopted
unanimously by the 15 council members.
   ``The Council expresses its profound concern about this incident
as well as the potential implications for the elections of the
initial South African reaction to it.''
   Botha had put South Africa put troops on alert and said his
nation was prepared to take action even if such action delayed the
U.N.-supervised elections scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   The Security Council said it ``calls on South Africa to desist
from any such further actions.''
   An estimated 1,600 SWAPO guerrillas did cross into Namibia on
April 1, apparently intending to surrender their weapons to U.N.
peacekeepers and be confined to base, like 1,500 South African
soldiers confined to barracks under U.N. supervision.
   However, that action violated the southern Africa peace
agreement that called for all SWAPO fighters to be in bases well
north of the Namibian border.
   U.N. officials allowed South African-led Namibian police and
South African troops to meet the SWAPO fighters, leading to off
clashes that killed at least 273 guerrillas and 23 South African
security force members.
   Between April and November, South Africa raised at least two
false alarms about impending guerrilla incursions, according to
news reports and U.N. officials.
   On Tuesday through Nov. 11, Namibians are to vote for a
constituent assembly that will adopt a constitution for the
territory of over 1.3 million, leading it to independence with a
black majority-ruled government next year.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I,
and has governed it since. In 1966, the General Assembly canceled a
mandate from the League of Nations allowing South Africa to
administer Namibia, but South Africa continued its rule.
   Last year, South Africa agreed to cooperate with the U.N. plan
for Namibia's transition to independence when Cuba agreed
simultaneously to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from neighboring
Angola.

   Former television evangelist Jim Bakker
was transferred Friday to a federal prison here to serve a 45-year
sentence for fraud and conspiracy.
   Prison officials and police kept onlookers away from the
entrance to the Federal Medical Center when a van brought the
49-year-old Bakker to prison just before noon.
   Earlier, Bakker left the Federal Correctional Institution at
Talladega, Ala., in handcuffs and leg shackles, said Dana Newell of
the prison's information office. Bakker had been held in Alabama
since Oct. 24, when a judge in Charlotte, N.C., sentenced him to 45
years and fined him $500,000 for defrauding his PTL followers.
   Unless his appeal is successful, authorities have said, Bakker
will serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole.
   At the medium-security prison in Rochester, Bakker will be
placed in the 310-man general population unit rather than the
section that handles patients with physical or mental illnesses.
   He will stay in a room without bars and have access to
basketball courts, a baseball field, game rooms, television rooms
and telephones, prison officials said.
   Bakker could be assigned work ranging from food services to
general plumbing and sanitation detail.
   Other prisoners at Rochester include Lyndon LaRouche, the former
fringe presidential candidate who is serving a 15-year sentence for
mail fraud and conspiracy.

<TEXT>
   U.S. federal agents said Friday they
arrested seven suspected members of a drug ring responsible for
much of the cocaine and marijuana shipped through Puerto Rico to
the United States.
   Jaime Echevarria, director of the Puerto Rican office of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, said the DEA is looking for 13
other people believed to be members of the ring.
   Echevarria said one of the seven arrested in this west coast
town was rancher Luis Hiram Ortiz. He said Ortiz's property worth
$2 million and several hundred heads of cattle were confiscated by
federal auhorities.
   The DEA director said Ortiz, 32, is suspected of being
responsible for collecting drugs from air drops from Colombian
planes.
   He identified the other suspects arrested in separate raids in
Arecibo as John de Jesus Clemente, 24; Pedro Medina Vazquez, 38;
Luis Ortiz, 29; Angel Luis Torres, 28; Ernesto Cirilo Otero, 40,
and Noel Cintron Rodriguez, 30.
   Echevarria said the ring was involved in transshipping
U.S.-bound Colombian drugs from planes and ships.
   He said the seven arrested and 13 suspects are Puerto Ricans and
face charges of conspiracy and possession of narcotics with intent
to distribute.
   He did not give any figure on the amount of drugs the group is
accused of handling.
   If convicted the suspects could be sentenced to life and a $4
million fine each, Echevarria said.

   Rescue teams from the Coast Guard, Navy and Air
Force joined the Customs Service Friday to search for the missing
co-pilot of a drug-chasing helicopter that crashed while pursuing a
suspicious boat.
   The Blackhawk UH-60 helicopter plunged into rough seas Thursday
night off the Florida Keys about 55 miles southeast of Marathon.
   Five of the six people aboard were pulled out of the water
quickly by rescuers.
   The missing man, identified as co-pilot George Saenz, was
believed to be wearing a lifejacket.
   Speculating that the Gulf Stream may have picked up the missing
man, searchers combed a 500-square-mile area with jets, helicopters
and a C-130 search plane as well as Coast Guard patrol boats and a
Navy hydrofoil. They also kept a worried eye on an advancing storm
front.
   ``The weather seems not that great out there,'' Coast Guard
spokesman Luis Diaz said. ``There are scattered thunderstorms, and
visibility is two to three miles in haze.''
   The crew included four Customs agents and two Bahamian police
officers. The five rescued by a Navy hydrofoil suffered no serious
injuries.
   The speedboat was chased down later by a Navy hydrofoil, but
Customs would not say if any arrests were made or drugs seized.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet officials said Friday that
they have sponsored a General Assembly resolution that they hope
will put an end to superpower rivalry in the United Nations.
   The resolution urges nations to settle conflicts peacefully and
respect human rights, the officials said in a joint news conference.
   ``At least one thing is clear _ today, it is an end to
confrontation,'' said Vladimir Petrovsky, the Soviet deputy foreign
minister.
   The resolution urges all nations to obey the U.N. Charter and
use U.N. bodies to settle disputes, but offered no specific
proposals to end conflicts in Central America, Afghanistan,
Cambodia or elsewhere.
   ``The intent of the resolution and our discussions now has been
to establish some general principles of agreement, not to come to
resolution of each and every single issue outstanding in the world
today,'' said Assistant Secretary of State John Bolton.
   The resolution calls on all nations to ``respect the principles
of sovereign equality, political independence and territorial
integrity of states, and non-intervention in foreign affairs.''
   It also calls on nations to ``refrain from the threat or use of
force inconsistent with the Charter,'' which permits only
self-defense, and to ``peacefully settle disputes.''
   Nations should ``adhere to the principles of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms, cooperation among states.''
   General Assembly resolutions have no binding effect on nations,
but the superpowers have the ability to persuade their allies to
resolve disputes peacefully when they wish.
   ``Perhaps the most important thing about this resolution is not
its specific language, but what it symbolizes as a new beginning at
the United Nations _ a new spirit of constructive cooperation,''
said a U.S.-Soviet statement.
   Bolton said the resolution won support from all nations the
Soviet and United States consulted while drafting it. ``Several of
the governments used word like `historic ' to describe it,'' he
said.
   Bolton and Petrovsky began meeting in summer to start working on
the resolution, and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III approved it during their
meeting in Wyoming in September.
   The resolution will go directly to the whole General Assembly,
where passage is certain, Bolton said.

   Dorothy Fuldheim, who helped pioneer the way
for women in broadcast journalism and was still doing nightly
television commentaries at age 91, died Friday of complications
from a stroke at age 96.
   During her career, Ms. Fuldheim interviewed every U.S. president
from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and was the first woman
news commentator on the ABC radio network. Apart from presidents,
she interviewed Adolf Hitler, the Duke of Windsor and the Shah of
Iran.
   Ms. Fuldheim began her television career in 1947, when she was
54 years old, as the news anchorwoman for WEWS-TV in Cleveland. She
had nearly 37 unbroken years with the station.
   Ms. Fuldheim was both a news reporter and commentator at WEWS in
the 1950s and early 1960s. She then hosted an afternoon interview
program before doing interviews on a daily noon newscast and news
commentary on 6 p.m. newscasts toward the end of her career.
   Perhaps her most poignant news commentary came May 4, 1970, a
few hours after four students were killed and nine wounded as Ohio
National Guardsmen opened fire during an anti-war protest at Kent
State University. In her tearful comments, she said the incident
amounted to murder.
   She survived two husbands and a daughter, Dorothy Fuldheim
Urman, who died in 1980.

   Andrew C. Lang, widely known feature writer on
homes and home improvements, died Thursday of heart disease. He was
82.
   Lang, a one-time amateur boxer and semiprofessional baseball
player, began his career as a copy boy at the old Brooklyn Times
and worked at the Brooklyn Standard-Union, the New York Morning
Telegraph and Transradio Press, all defunct.
   He also was a sports and news broadcaster for several radio
stations before joining The Associated Press in 1942, first as day
editor in the Broadcast Department, and later as head of AP's
Promotion Department.
   For many years, Lang wrote two weekly columns for AP
Newsfeatures, ``On the House'' and ``Here's the Answer,'' which
appeared in hundreds of newspapers, and supervised the production
of the APN syndicated feature, ``House of the Week.'' He also was
the author of several handbooks and brochures on homes and home
improvements.
   Lang is survived by three sons, Ronald, Bruce and Andrew Jr.

<HEAD>Parents to March To Protest Klan Halloween Costumes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 people marched to the Board of
Education building in this southwest Ohio town Friday to urge
racial harmony after two teen-agers wore Ku Klux Klan robes to
school on Halloween.
   The predominantly white crowd of parents and civil rights
activists asked the board to establish more classes in human
relations in the Talawanda school district, about 35 miles
northwest of Cincinnati.
   ``There are prejudices that exist. We should do everything we
can to get rid of this,'' Superintendent Dennis Leone said.
   The march from the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church was
planned after two students at Talawanda High School boarded a
school bus Tuesday wearing Klan robes as Halloween costumes. They
shouted a racial epithet, witnesses said.
   When they entered the school, other students made racially
derogatory remarks, students and school officials said.
   The students were suspended pending a Nov. 13 hearing, Principal
Lee Schmitt said. The school has refused to identify the students.
   Schmitt said he would consider revising the school's curriculum
to include more human relations courses. About 50 of the high
school's 1,100 students are black.
   Victoria Nash, a march organizer who has a son in the district's
elementary school, complained that the school does not offer
courses in black history and that field trips do not include
cultural or ethnic events.
   Derek Rohrkamper, a senior, said he believed wearing the Klan
outfits was a mistake but that the demonstrators overreacted.
   The students ``were going too far. But they apologized for it
and said it was a joke,'' Rohrkamper said.
   Other students said racial tensions have worsened at the high
school since the costume incident and a separate incident on
Thursday, in which students tore down posters announcing the racial
unity march.
   Three students were sent home Thursday for tearing down the
posters, Schmitt said. One was suspended for two days, he said.

   Leftist guerrillas suspended
peace talks with the rightist government after accusing the
president of complicity in the bombing of a union hall. Thousands
of unionists buried slain companions and vowed revenge.
   ``Because the color of blood is never forgotten, our slain
companions will be avenged!'' the unionists shouted Thursday as
they marched through thedowntown area.
   Many carried wreaths and banners denouncing President Alfredo
Cristiani's government.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said Thursday it
had ``suspended our participation'' in peace talks. Rebel and
government representatives were scheduled to meet Nov. 20 in
Caracas, Venezuela, in the third round of talks that began in
Mexico in September.
   The suspension came in a week of rapidly escalating violence and
two days after a terrorist bomb killed 10 people and wounded 29
others at a leftist labor federation.

   Although the superpowers profess to
have no fear of a reunited Germany, Europeans on both sides of the
East-West divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect
of a German giant in their midst.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact lawmakers who met here this week to discuss
political changes indicated that Europeans, afraid of the rise of a
new dominant power on the continent, may be more comfortable with
the status quo of two Germanys.
   East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, quashed the prospect of a
reunited Germany in the near future when he told reporters in
Moscow that ``division is an element of our European security.''
   But West German officials and scholars say the mass
demonstrations sweeping the Communist state could lead some day to
the kinds of reforms that would allow East Germans to reconsider
their separate status.

   President Bush's offer to halt his drive for a

deadlock over must-pass fiscal legislation, a minimum wage bill and
other measures.
   Bush and Senate Republicans offered Thursday to stop trying to
add the capital gains provision to debt-limit legislation that must
be approved by next week.
   ``I deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered the
economic policy debate,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``Now,
the stalemate must be broken.''

   The House must decide whether to go along with
a Senate vote to reinstate Oliver North's $23,000 annual pension,
revoked after he was sentenced for illegally shredding documents in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Let the vendetta end,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whose
bill to restore North's pension was approved by the Senate late
Thursday on a 78-17 vote. ``Ollie North has been punished enough.''
   But despite that plea, the debate over whether to give North
back his retirement pay dredged up bitter partisan feelings
stemming from President Reagan's efforts _ with North in a key role
_ to evade congressional restrictions and fund the Contra war in
Nicaragua.
   ``We are asked to bend the law for someone who broke the law,''
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``North's defense was that he was
just following orders. But we settled that issue at Nuremberg,'' a
reference to trials of Nazis involved in World War II atrocities.

<HEAD>Tough Treatment For Problem Juveniles Under Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE CARTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matt Woolston's five weeks of drug
treatment were spent mostly in a windowless room on a blue plastic
chair.
   ``They wouldn't let you lean back. You had to sit forward with
your back straight,'' often for up to 15 hours at a time, six days
a week, and ``rap'' about personal problems, he said. He didn't see
the sun for days at a time.
   Woolston, 20, was held for 38 days after his parents placed him
in KIDS of Greater Salt Lake, a drug and alcohol treatment program.
He said he was coerced into going and was rescued only after
friends followed a van heading to the ``host home'' where he was
being held and called police.
   Woolston's 19-year-old sister, Jennifer, has filed a $6.5
million lawsuit against KIDS, claiming she was held against her
will. She says she escaped once by climbing down knotted bedsheets,
was returned by her parents and a man with a badge who claimed to
be a policeman, and broke an arm and a leg falling in a second
attempt.
   Police are investigating allegations of false imprisonment,
unlawful detention and assault. The allegations are similar to
those that closed KIDS of Southern California and KIDS of El Paso,
Texas, early this year.
   W. Kimball DeLaMare, director of the Utah KIDS, acknowledges
that treatment can be severe. But so are the ravages of compulsive
behaviors, he says.
   ``We're not in the business to make money. We invite people to
come in here. Our motive is to help kids get straight and live
successful lives and develop coping skills. ... We want to give
kids back to their parents.''
   KIDS is the third Utah ``tough love'' program to be investigated
in a year. State officials worry Utah is becoming a mecca for
unorthodox treatment centers that prey on desperate parents and use
poorly trained ``peer counselors.''
   ``The parents want an answer and prevention, even an inoculation
for these behaviors,'' said Wayne Holland, a Division of Youth
Corrections investigator who believes Utah's religious and cultural
background ``tend to allow these non-traditional groups to fill
that need.''
   It isn't unusual for parents to place children in a long-term
program, which may take 18 months or more, for smoking cigarettes
or having sex. Without proper admitting procedures involving
professionals, too often kids who don't really need the treatment
end up there, Holland said.
   ``A lot of times these kinds of programs promise miracles, and
when they can't deliver they turn abusive,'' said Patricia Kreher,
director of licensing for the Department of Social Services.
   Another group, the Challenger Foundation, is fighting for its
license after 17-year-old Elizabeth Zasso claimed she was kidnapped
into a 63-day wilderness experience aimed at character-building. A
judge ruled that her constitutional rights were violated and she
filed a $20 million lawsuit. The Garfield County Attorney has filed
misdemeanor child abuse and witness-tampering charges.
   And Proctor Advocate founder Layne Meacham faces charges he
permitted the abuse of a 16-year-old girl by peer counselors.
Meacham has testified he based his program partly on the teachings
of the founder of KIDS.
   KIDS in Utah is the non-profit progeny of KIDS of Bergen County,
N.J., the subject of abuse allegations since it opened in 1984.
KIDS now operates only in New Jersey, which has no licensing
requirements, and Utah.
   The 3-month-old Utah program's conditional license has been
extended to Jan. 31, and the state is awaiting the outcome of
Jennifer Woolston's lawsuit and others contemplated by former
patients, said Social Services' Ken Stettler.
   Jennifer and Matt Woolston were put into KIDS by their parents.
Jennifer and her attorney, Mary Corporon, say the reasons for her
placement are unknown. Matt was placed in the 18-month program for
drug treatment.
   Because of the litigation, Marilyn Woolston, their mother, had
no other comment but: ``We feel real positive about it, and feel it
is very beneficial to the kids. Even Matt would tell you how he
benefited.''
   DeLaMare said patients don't always know what's best and that
parents have the right to intervene in a life out of control, even
an adult child's. Adult patients sign a contract and can leave on
24 hours' written notice, he said.
   Matt Woolston claims he was coerced into signing a contract,
spent hours a day in ``rap'' sessions, slept on the floor of a
locked room with five other patients, and was under constant
surveillance.
   DeLaMare said the first weeks are difficult. Newcomers are
``belt-looped'' _ required to constantly lock fingers through the
belt or belt loops of an older, experienced patient when moving
about in the main compound.
   They aren't allowed to go to school or to see or speak to anyone
outside, except under the strictest supervision. It is a phase, he
said, that can last for as long as the patient refuses to
acknowledge a problem.
   Jennifer contends she saw patients beaten. Matt never saw
beatings, but said ``restraining'' _ counselors holding his arms
and legs while another sat on his chest _ was common.
   DeLaMare said restraining is used only when a patient is in
danger of hurting himself or others.
   Matt said it happened when patients didn't do what they were
told.
   Then there was ``the honesty machine.'' ``Four or five of the
counselors would stand around and scream at you, call you a liar,
if they doubted you,'' he said. It could go on for more than an
hour and it ``didn't matter if you told the truth. Pretty soon
you'd tell them whatever they wanted to hear.''
   Peer counselors, the mainstay of both KIDS of Greater Salt Lake
and Proctor Advocate, can see through deceptions they once used,
DeLaMare said. KIDS has 10 full-time staff for about 75 patients.
Eight of those are ``paraprofessional'' peer counselors who have
graduated from the KIDS program in New Jersey.
   Kreher said the young counselors often are unsupervised and may
be overzealous; their tactics can become abuse when they are
confronted with behavior or illnesses they may not understand.
``The thing that distinguishes these programs from others is
training, or more accurately the lack of it.''
   These young adults often wielde authority with a heavy hand,
Holland said. Many of the complaints in California and Texas
involved counselors who were patients assaulting patients in a
lower phase, investigators said.
   Attorney Mike Mohrman, who sued Challenger for Zasso, has been
retained by several former KIDS patients considering action.
Mohrman believes parents are often blinded by real or imagined
concerns, and said the programs rarely turn anyone away since they
need the business.
   Corporon is concerned her suit might focus more on whether
Jennifer needed help than the basic issue: freedom. ``She was an
adult and in our country she is supposed to have the right to
freedom as long as she hasn't committed a crime. It is not a crime
not to live the way somebody else wants you to.''

   It's 7:16 a.m. on Tuesday, March 19, 1996.
   You've finished a light breakfast and head toward the garage.
You fish out a key chain from your pocket as you walk, push a
button on a poker-chip size disk.
   The garage door opens.
   Inside sits the vehicle you bought two months ago for about
$24,000. There is no discernible joint between any of the windows
and the plastic body parts. The car is a pastel blue, and sleek.
   Like the minivans of the last decade, the car can be used to
haul dozens of bags of groceries, a Little League team or baggage
for a family vacation.
   Unlike the popular vehicles of the mid- and late 1980s, it is
much more powerful, cleaner-running and more fuel-efficient.

   America's wheels in the 1990s probably won't be the stuff of
cartoons and designers' dreams. The changes may come more in the
materials they are made of and in what powers them than in what
they look like.
   Automakers are working hard to shrink the time it takes to bring
a car from a drawing board to the end of the assembly line.
Consumers will find changes coming faster than ever as companies
react more quickly to the marketplace.
   Auto industry executives and observers predict the line between
trucks and cars will almost disappear as the designs for each
converge and the government moves toward standardizing safety
requirements for both classes of vehicles.

   Advanced features in the cars of the 1990s will be limited
mostly by the pocketbook. The technology is available today, and
will be refined in the next few years, to make many things possible
in a vehicle.
   But one of the main factors in owning a car _ price _ will come
into play.
   ``Is it feasible? Yes,'' said Tom Gale, vice president for
design at Chrysler Corp. ``Is it there for the masses? I think you
have to step back and take a look at cost, market trends and
regions of the country.
   ``I don't think we're going to see the explosion in the number
of gadgets we've had,'' Gale said. ``I don't think all the
electronic stuff is going to follow along because people aren't
going to pay for it.''
   Still, on concept cars displayed this year on the auto-show
circuit, the ``gee-whiz'' stuff was there.
   The Chrysler Millennium, out of Gale's own design studios,
offers an array of electronic wizardry, including forward-looking
infrared cameras, rain-sensitive wipers, a navigation system and
collision-warning radar.

   You push the button again. The driver's side door opens.
   Air bags in the steering column and in front of the passenger's

   Full-color dashboard instruments come to life, showing there's

   A heater on the driver's side begins warming the air to a

   Safety is high in the minds of today's engineers for tomorrow's
cars. The government insists on it. Beginning with the current
model year, cars must have driver-side air bags or automatic seat
belts for front-seat passengers.
   More passive systems will be due for front-seat riders in cars
for the 1994 model year and later. Cars also are likely to be more
resistant to side impacts.
   One major change likely in the '90s is in how automobiles are
powered. President Bush has laid out a plan to reduce the country's
dependence on gasoline as a fuel for cars and trucks.
   Dwindling oil reserves and concern about the environment are
prompting research into alternative fuels, such as methanol,
ethanol and others, and reformulated gasoline.
   Problems that must be resolved include: how to get the same
power out of a gallon of an alternative fuel as out of a gallon of
gasoline; how to store the fuel in the vehicle; what effects the
new fuels will have on engine and body design.

   You slide into the driver's seat, push another button on the
disk and the vehicle's door closes.
   As you insert the key, a scanner reads a tiny electronic chip
embedded in the metal and confirms it's the right one for your car.
You turn it and the transmission is ready to be shifted.
   On the console, an electronic map appears, ready for you to plot
your course to work. A little growl in the pit of your stomach
tells you a stop by the deli for a cup of coffee. And a doughnut
may be in order, too.
   The car of the '90s may be able to hold your cup of coffee, but
it won't make it.

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network, which never has been short on
ambition, is getting the global audience it wants by finding room
at the inns.
   While the Atlanta-based news channel now is seen in 84
countries, the best chance of catching CNN overseas is in a hotel
room. It still is rarity to see CNN in an average person's home
outside the United States.
   Transmitting CNN around the world was one of Ted Turner's goals
when his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. launched the 24-hour cable
network in 1980. The network has gradually increased its audience
potential and made its latest stride over the summer when it
arranged to use a Soviet satellite for transmissions in that corner
of the world.
   CNN is available in about 600 hotels _ more than 1 million rooms
_ worldwide. Other major international clients for CNN include
embassies, government offices, foreign news services and, to a
lesser extent, local cable television systems. CNN programming also
is shown on eight airlines, which excerpt segments to show
passengers on intercontinental flights.
   Network officials add that CNN is widely pirated and overall is
available to about 200 million people around the world.
   ``All of the populated areas of the world have the capability of
getting CNN,'' said Bob Ross, managing director of CNN
International Sales Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of TBS based in
London.
   ``With the exception of Antarctica and the western tip of
Australia ... the whole world gets it,'' Ross said.
   Though CNN is available domestically in 51.1 million U.S.
households, the target audience overseas is not the average TV
viewer, Ross said in a recent interview.
   Instead, CNN wants to be seen overseas by the wealthy and the
powerful _ heads of government, business leaders, Americans who are
traveling and other assorted VIPs, he said.
   ``What we're doing is making CNN the first global real-time news
medium, which will make CNN the network of record for major
decision-makers all over the world,'' Ross said. ``We will become a
primary news source for the world's decision-makers.''
   There are numerous obstacles to getting CNN to the world's
masses, Ross said. Most international transmissions are in English,
the necessary satellite reception equipment is too expensive for
many people, and in many places the government doesn't want its
people to have easy access to Western news reporting.
   ``We're not a mass entertainment network,'' Ross said. ``We
don't expect to be watched by a welder who is only fluent in his
native language.''
   It's easy to imagine, though, that Turner, a globe-trotting
champion of peace among nations, would want ultimately to make his
programming available to the widest audience possible.
   ``I think that's Ted's goal, to get CNN to everyone,'' said Russ
Barry, the Los Angeles-based president of Turner Program Services,
TBS' syndication arm.
   Barry said TBS is getting inquiries from areas that receive CNN
which also are interested in receiving other Turner programming,
such as the shows on the TBS ``SuperStation'' and Turner Network
Television's all-day schedule of vintage movies.
   ``The international market is quite active,'' he said.
   CNN's first international markets were in Canada and Australia
in 1983. The network broke into Europe in 1985, Japan the following
year, South America in 1988 and Asia and Africa this year, Ross
said.
   The version of CNN seen overseas has some modifications from the
U.S. presentation _ for example, in many places it is not available
24 hours a day _ but Ross said it is fundamentally the same.
   ``It is an American news product and it does reflect an American
perception of events _ as objectively as we can, but some intrinsic
perception is American,'' he said.
   Ralph Wenge, who anchors CNN's daily ``International Hour'' and
weekend ``World Report'' from Atlanta, said the network's global
view reflects a growing public awareness of how events thousands of
miles apart are interrelated.
   He said the international elements of CNN's programming also
have contributed to the network's increased respect here and abroad.
   The network's increased presence cuts both ways, however, Wenge
said. While most of the response to CNN's international work is
positive, some people overseas resent the strong presence of a U.S.
news operation.
   ``The other side is, `Why should a broadcast network originating
in the United States come into our countries and tell us what's
happening in our country?''' Wenge said. ``They'd like their own
CNN.''

   Sam McCloud is back, he's now a U.S. senator,
but he still has a knack for getting into trouble.
   After an absence of 12 years, Dennis Weaver is reprising his
role in a ``McCloud'' movie for CBS.
   Weaver played the deputy marshal from Taos, N.M., for seven
years in the 1970s. McCloud was on temporary duty with the New York
City police and he drove them batty with his unorthodox ways.
   ``We'd been talking about a `McCloud' movie for three or four
years,'' Weaver said. ``I was doing a new series, `Buck James,' and
we couldn't find a story that appealed to me. It had to have
relevance to today. McCloud couldn't still be in an exchange
program.
   ``We made him a senator from New Mexico. I wanted something to
parallel my own growth and that's with the environment. McCloud's
pushing an ecology bill. If people don't see any other part of the
picture I hope they see this. It's a speech I wrote myself. Of
course, I want people to see the rest of the show. It has all of
the `McCloud' ingredients.''
   J.D. Cannon, Terry Carter and Diana Muldaur are all back in
``The Return of Sam McCloud,'' which CBS will telecast on Sunday.
It was filmed on location in England. Guest stars include Patrick
McNee, David McCallum and Roger Rees.
   Muldaur plays McCloud's girlfriend and in the movie they move a
little closer to the altar.
   ``In the first script we get married,'' said Weaver. ``But that
was kind of stuck on the end with nothing leading up to it. I said,
`Let's keep this string going.' Just from a practical standpoint,
if the show gets a good rating, I'd like to have the freedom to do
more.''
   What brings McCloud to London is the murder of his niece, who
had been working for a chemical company.
   ``All the old instincts come back,'' Weaver said. ``I go for the
funeral. We think at first it (the death) is an accident. So
McCloud starts to investigate and he learns certain people are
willing to sacrifice lives for profit. What happened was my niece
had stumbled upon something and was murdered. Then the chief
suspect is murdered and McCloud becomes a suspect in his killing.
   ``This is our first time to film overseas. In the past, if
McCloud went anywhere we went to the back lot. I ride a horse in
London. I wanted to get a horse from the guard at Buckingham
Palace, but they said no. So I got a horse from a London mounted
policeman.''
   ``McCloud'' was Weaver's most successful starring role in a
series, and the one that really marked his transition for a
supporting player to leading man.
   His first role was in ``Gunsmoke,'' as James Arness' deputy
Chester Goode, from 1955 to '64. Chester walked with a limp and
talked with a twang (``Mis-ter Dill-lon!''). He won an Emmy for the
role in 1959.
   In 1964 he briefly starred in ``Kentucky Jones,'' in which he
played a veterinarian. Next, he was a wildlife officer who looked
after a huge black bear in ``Gentle Ben.''
   Three short-lived series followed ``McCloud.'' They were
``Stone,'' ``Emerald Point N.A.S.'' and ``Buck James.''
   Weaver also starred in numerous TV movies and such miniseries as
``Pearl'' and ``Centennial.''
   His son Robby Weaver is on CBS' ``Top of the Hill,'' son Rick
produces ABC's ``B.L. Stryker'' and son Rusty is a singer and
songwriter.
   Weaver has been spending part of his time lately building an
``ecologically balanced'' house in Colorado and filming a
documentary about it. He's building the house on a 20-acre site
overlooking a stream with mountains in the background.
   ``We're building it out of old tires packed with dirt,'' he
said, noting the three-foot thick walls will be covered with adobe.
   ``The electricity will come from solar cells and all water will
be heated by the sun. It's built on the principal of a cave. It'll
be cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The architect calls
it a huge thermal battery.''

   Song titles can come from anywhere _ newspaper
clippings, billboards, figures of speech.
   ``The Spin,'' the title track of the Yellowjackets' eighth
album, evolved from a conversation between bassist Jimmy Haslip and
keyboardist Russell Ferrante.
   In the beginning, it was just a word, one suggesting a web of
meanings: records spinning, spinning your dance partner, the world
spinning on its axis. ``The Spin'' soon had musical significance as
well and was rewarded with a song of its own.
   ``We were working on this piece that the bass was in 3-4 and the
rest of the band was in 4-4, and because of the motion of those two
rhythms, it had kind of a spinning spiraling effect,'' Haslip said.
``We all just decided to call it `Spin.'''
   ``It's a metaphor for the Earth,'' Ferrante said. ``This music
has particulary grown out of a lot of our experiences touring the
previous year, Europe and South America, and observing a lot of
disturbing things.''
   For a group that calls one of its new songs ``Enigma,'' labeling
their music is another challenge, trickier than the most intricate
rhythm.
   Grammy voters have given them awards for rhythm and blues
instrumental and jazz-fusion performance. The Yellowjackets reject
both categories, especially fusion, which Haslip dismisses as
outdated.
   They're not straight jazz, either, much to the anger of purists
such as trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who has attacked groups that
deviate from the New Orleans tradition of King Oliver and Louis
Armstrong.
   ``The thinking is if it's not traditional, it's no good, even
though you're being truthful about it,'' Haslip said. ``I never
understood the principle behind it. I look at art as an open field,
let's go out and see what we can create here.''
   ``World music'' is more like it. They see ``The Spin'' as a
reflection of sounds as well as sights from their travels over the
past year.
   ``The globe is shrinking with the communication possibilities
and technology,'' Ferrante said. ``Every place we go, in the
restuarants, everywhere, they're hearing Western music. It's
becoming one community.
   ``The challenge is for everyone to see the world as one place.
Not this person against that, this music against that. Just seeing
ourselves as one entity.''
   Unity starts at home for the Yellowjackets, who have made just
two changes in personnel since Ferrante, Haslip and drummer Ricky
Lawson formed a backing group for guitarist Robben Ford in 1978.
   Former Tower of Power saxophonist Marc Russo joined in 1985 and
William Kennedy took over on drums the following year when Lawson
left to record with Lionel Ritchie.
   ``William joined the band prior to the `Four Corners' album,''
Haslip said. ``This is when we changed directions. That year, we
were traveling a lot, more than we had in the past. All that
traveling and motion. So `Four Corners,' like the four corners of
the world came out.''
   A ``trilogy'' may sound too pretentious for the Yellowjackets,
but ``Four Corners,'' ``Politics'' and ``Spin'' are tied by the
group's impressions of national and international events.
``Politics,'' Haslip said, grew out of his frustration with the
1988 presidential election.
   ``For some reason that year opened up a can of worms about all
political situations,'' he said. ``It didn't just have to do with
the elections. There's the business with the record label, the
manager, other musicians. Everything has some political entendre.
   ```Spin came out from paying attention to what was happening to
us as we traveled around the world _ focusing in the lens a little
more.''
   Time spent in South Africa also had an impact.
   ``To see the conditions there, just see how turned upside down
everything has gotten, economically and enviromentally,'' Ferrante
said. ``You can see things in news or on television, but when you
stare in somebody's eyes, it's a pretty powerful thing. Just utter
hopelessness.''
   Recorded in Norway, ``Spin'' combines emotions suggested by the
colors on the album's cover: yellow, which Haslip noted is used in
hospitals as a soothing effect; red, for anger; and blue, meaning
sadness. The songs were written in the garage of Ferrante's
California home.
   ``It's a sanctuary,'' he said. ``There's trees around and a
little Japanese garden sort of out one window. We'll be writing and
all of a sudden Jim won't be around the keyboard or piano. I look
up and Jim's staring out the window. Then a moment later he's got
his inspiration.''
   ``When Russell finds me staring out the window while we're
recording,'' Haslip said, ``that's more like daydreaming. That's
what I do. I start daydreaming about stuff and things and how the
music is affected by that. Ninety percent of the time I come up
with images.''

   Ron Howard's ``Parenthood,'' one of the hit
American movies of the summer, will open the 33rd London Film
Festival this month in what organizers say is the British capital's
biggest such festival ever.
   The closing-night film will be Italian director Ettore Scola's
``What Time Is It,'' which won the best actor prizes at this year's
Venice Film Festival for stars Marcello Mastroianni and Massimo
Troisi.
   The festival, which runs Nov. 10 to Nov. 26, will feature 170
films from over 40 countries, a significant increase from the 15
films it screened its first year, or the 140 or so entries of 1987.
   ``If there are good films, they should be screened, and this is
a good year,'' said Festival Director Sheila Whitaker. ``I hope
we've made sensible choices.''
   The American entries run toward the popular.
   Besides ``Parenthood,'' other mainstream American films
receiving British premieres at the festival are Rob Reiner's ``When
Harry Met Sally ...''; ``Field of Dreams,'' Phil Alden Robinson's
movie about baseball, starring Kevin Costner; and ``Earth Girls Are
Easy,'' with Geena Davis (``The Accidental Tourist'').
   Also featured are the critically acclaimed ``A Dry White
Season,'' Euzhan Palcy's film about apartheid starring Marlon
Brando; ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' with Michelle Pfeiffer and
Jeff and Beau Bridges; and ``Casualties of War'' and ``Back to the
Future II,'' both starring Michael J. Fox.
   In addition, the festival is screening 23 independent American
films, and will have a seminar on the topic ``America, the State of
the Independents (How Low Can You Get),'' organized by the
Association of Independent Producers.
   Films in this section include ``Let's Get Lost,'' Bruce Weber's
film about jazz musician Chet Baker, and ``James Baldwin: The Price
of the Ticket,'' about the late writer and activist.
   Among the 18 British films on view, special attention is being
given to ``Venus Peter,'' with David Hayman and the late Ray
McAnally. The film, already much-travelled on the festival circuit,
is set in the Orkney Islands off Scotland in the late 1940s and
marks the directing debut of Ian Sellar.
   A strong French section is headed by Bertrand Blier's ``Trop
Belle Pour Toi!'' (``Too Beautiful for You!''), last month's
opening-night film at the New York Film Festival, and Coline
Serreau's ``Romuald and Juliette,'' from the director of ``Three
Men and a Baby.'' Daniel Auteil, from ``Manon des Sources,'' is the
star.
   From South Africa come three films two of which, ``The Stick''
and ``Quest for Love,'' have been banned in their home country. The
third, ``Jobman,'' is receiving its first screening outside South
Africa.
   Africa is elsewhere represented with feature films from Algeria,
Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea Bissau and the Ivory Coast, and the
Asian offerings are dominated by ``A City of Sadness,'' from
Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien. The film won the Golden Lion at
last month's Venice Film Festival.
   Among the celebrities expected to attend are Ron Howard,
one-time actor and director of such movies as ``Cocoon'' and
``Parenthood,'' and French actress Fanny Ardant, who will accompany
her new film ``Australia,'' in which she stars with Jeremy Irons.

   At a pace that quickens daily, the world is
plunging into the ``information age.'' The following article, a
sneak preview of the computers of the coming decade, is one of a
periodic series, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and
peril of the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine,
technology and society.

   Imagine what would happen if thousands of bright
but bored Nintendo fanatics, Walkman freaks and TV channel flippers
went to college and studied computer science.
   What would happen is the personal computer of the 1990s _ a
blend of 3-D television and quadraphonic stereo with the hand
controls of a video game machine and more speed than car-sized
mainframes of the 1980s.
   Silicon chips burning through a billion instructions a second
will be able to surround the user with the sights and sounds of an
early morning in Paris or an erupting Hawaiian volcano.
   ``Multimedia'' computers will rival television for attention on
a Tuesday night. More importantly, experts say, they will help
educate the next generation of video-hungry schoolchildren.
   A computer is the most patient teacher, which is why many
students blossom when they practice math or spelling on it.
Computers of the '90s will simulate a four-lane highway for
driver's ed or a flask of hydrochloric acid for chemistry.
   ``You could have a tremendous explosion of human knowledge over
the next decade. This could not only accelerate people's learning
process but make a boatload of money,'' said William Zachmann,
president of Canopus Research in Duxbury, Mass.
   ``Infotainment'' and other trends in computers are being
propelled by a ceaseless decline in the price of computing power, a
decline that opens up previously unimaginable possibilities.
   Cheaper chips will add smarts to things people use every day,
from toasters to the telephone system. They will become so common
that people will stop remarking on them, the way people stopped
talking about ``transistor'' radios once all radios had transistors.
   In contrast to electricity, which is a powerful force of nature,
computing is an abstraction. No one ever was killed on a golf
course by a bolt of computing. But computers add capability to
machinery, and in the 1990s they will extend the human reach in
every field from weather forecasting to sex therapy.
   ``We increasingly call them people amplifiers,'' said Earl
Joseph, a futurist who heads Anticipatory Sciences Inc. in St.
Paul, Minn.
   Any dependence can be dangerous, and the dangers from computers
range from power failures and accidental bugs in the software to
maliciously planted viruses and the ever-present threat of Big
Brotherism.
   Computer viruses are the social disease of technology and will
be combated by limiting things that made computing fun in the
1980s, like sharing software and communicating in networks.
   As for Big Brotherism, Los Alamos National Laboratory is
exploring using brain-like ``neural networks'' for voice
identification. That could allow computers to monitor phone
networks and locate people by the calls they make, although that's
not Los Alamos' intention.
   Harvard University researchers are experimenting with similar
machines that recognize faces. Theoretically they could be used in
airports and bus terminals to search for enemies of the state _
again, not Harvard's intention.
   Along with the threat of cold efficiency comes the threat of
computer-aided blunders, as with the Michigan man who was arrested
five times after a murder suspect stole his wallet and used his
identification.
   ``There are two broad dangers,'' Massachusetts Institute of
Technology sociologist Gary Marx has said. ``One is that the
technologies work and the other is that they don't work.''
   Stanford University's Terry Winograd tells the parable of a man
who climbs out on a long limb that starts to shake. He has two
choices: to invent an intricate, computer-controlled,
limb-stabilizing system, or to wise up and get off the branch.
   Too often, Winograd says, people fall in love with technology
and forget the second option. Still, computers are here to stay.
They will change life, mostly for the better, in the coming decade:
   _Machine translation of language will help put Americans in
touch with the rest of the world. Computers already can crudely
translate printed material, and automatic translation of live
speech is on the way. But beware: One system in Europe translated
the French ``nous avions'' (we were having) as ``us airplanes.''
   _Telerobots with human guidance will clean up crippled nuclear
reactors and scour sclerotic arteries. Unlike their crude
ancestors, they will be able to go about their work without
moment-to-moment instructions. One unnerving possibility is
military robots _ ``telegladiators'' _ that would lower the
threshold of war by removing people from the battle scene.
   _Artificial intelligence is not going to create a human brain in
silicon by the end of the 20th century. That dubious achievement
may lie another century off. But spinoffs will be everywhere, such
as an ``agent'' that scans data to assemble an electronic newspaper
tailored to its boss's interests.
   Computers will continue to take over unskilled jobs; society's
challenge is to retrain those who are displaced to do more creative
work. Joseph, the Minnesota futurist, is optimistic:
   ``The short-term displacement will be horrible. But the key word
is cooperation, to make humanistic use of people. I think it's
going to be one of the greatest decades.''

<HEAD>Question for the 1990s: Do You Trust Your Computer? ^With AM-The
'90s-Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   How far can computers be trusted?
   The question will become critical in the 1990s as society comes
to depend even more on computers to monitor nuclear power plants,
fly passenger aircraft, count ballots, move money around and watch
out for nuclear attack.
   It used to be said that computers do only what people tell them
to do, but that is no longer the case.
   The European-built Airbus A320, which will fly and land itself,
is a safe plane that depends on computers for its safety.
   Pilots can override the automatic pilot, but the computer will
prevent any extreme maneuver that could damage the plane. Some
veteran pilots worry the limitation could prevent them from taking
heroic action to save lives. Others say the automatic pilot is so
good that pilots would be unprepared if it ever malfunctioned.
   Computers contain the most sensitive information about people's
lives _ from diseases to arrest records _ but they are notoriously
susceptible to snooping.
   A murder suspect was captured in California this year when Wells
Fargo Bank helped police track him through the locations where he
withdrew money from cash machines. In theory anyone could be
tracked the same way.
   ``Everyone who uses a credit card, goes to the bank, visits a
doctor, or owes money, depends on the personal integrity of data
entry clerks, programmers, and systems personnel,'' Jane Robinett
of Polytechnic University in New York wrote recently in Information
Week.
   Computer viruses are the latest scourge, but old-fashioned
computer theft has not gone away. Election computers are
unacceptably easy to break into, according to a study by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   Things have gone so far that reducing dependence on computers
would be difficult if not impossible.
   In a serious accident at a modern nuclear power plant, more than
100 alarms can go off in the control room at once while dozens of
red lights flash simultaneously indicating problems with pressures,
temperatures and water levels.
   Utilities are trying to cope with the ``Christmas tree problem''
with computer systems that will filter out low-priority alarms and
identify what they figure to be the heart of a problem.
   Operators will not have to take the computer's diagnosis for a
fact: They can probe deeper to find out the data and assumptions
that went into it. But in a red alert, with seconds ticking away
and catastrophe possibly at hand, the person at the control panel
may well just take the computer's word.
   And pray that the computer is right.

<HEAD>Some Israelis Dodge Military Duty in Occupied Lands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More and more Israeli army reservists are
coming up with a wide variety of excuses to avoid duty in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to put down the Palestinian uprising known as
the intefadah.
   One reservist, identifying himself as Joshua, a 25-year-old
architecture student, said he invented ``psychological problems''
to get out of serving.
   ``There is a limit to what I will do,'' he said. ``If I killed a
Palestinian kid, I don't think I could live with it.''
   Others called up arrive at induction centers on crutches or with
letters from employers saying they are too essential to the
business to be let go. Some claim illness.
   It is what Israelis call a ``gray refusal'' _ getting out of
duty without directly refusing to serve, which would challenge the
pride that Israelis hold for their army.
   Some have legitimate excuses. Others feel their previous combat
training is wasted on what they view as essentially police work.
Still others believe the uprising is not a real military threat to
Israel.
   Most reservists interviewed said they would not hesitate to
serve if Israel faced a war or some other serious threat.
   ``But nobody feels threatened by the intefadeh,'' said Andre
Dreszin, a spokesman for the conscientious objectors' group Yesh
Gvul. ``It's not like the Egyptian and Syrian tanks in 1973 where
if we didn't stop them they would have made it to Tel Aviv.''
   Brig. Gen. Ehud Gross, the army's chief education officer, said
61 soldiers had been tried for refusing to serve in the occupied
territories and he called it ``an ignorable number.''
   ``I do believe that today there is no problem with the
mission,'' he added. ``There are some refuseniks, who decline to
serve in the territories. Those are the minority. The vast
consensus is against them.''
   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot recently quoted senior army
officers as estimating the number who avoid service in the
territories has grown into the ``thousands.''
   ``What is significant about this new phenomena is that it
includes those who don't usually try to evade service, like senior
officers and guys from elite units,'' said Ariela Hoffman, a
reporter on military affairs for the newspaper.
   Virtually all Israeli men and women serve two to three years of
mandatory service starting at age 18. Men continue in the reserve
until age 56, and it is estimated the army can triple its size by
calling up 370,000 reservists within a few days.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed, including a 28-year-old reservist whose
skull was crushed by a stone dropped from a roof by a Palestinian.
At least 600 Arabs have been killed by soldiers or Israeli
civilians, and 33 Israeli civilians also have been slain.
   Dreszin, the conscientious objector who has not been called up
during the uprising but served 63 days in jail for refusing service
in the Lebanon war, said some reservists avoid service by using
minor illnesses that they would disregard if called up for a real
war.
   ``They exploit their illness,'' he said. ``They say to
themselves, `Why should I ignore my medical problems if they help
me stay out of the territories?'''
   Reservists usually receive their call-up notices in the mail
weeks in advance, so they have plenty of time to work out excuses.
Letters from professors telling of upcoming exams are plentiful on
call-up day, as well as those from employers and doctors.
   ``If you cry enough in the army they will say, `Go home,' just
to get rid of you; you are demoralizing,'' said a 32-year-old
lawyer and father of three identifying himself only as Motti.
   There are other ways to get out of duty in the territories.
   One officer was indicted for accepting bribes from reservists to
assign them to an ``easy posting.''
   Yediot Ahronot also reported that one man called to duty fired a
few rounds into the air and shouted, ``We're going to kill Arabs!''
His intent was to have officers declare him too unstable.
   Among soldiers who do serve in the territories, despite
misgivings, some have found their own ways to protect their ideals.
   Paul, 29, a soft-spoken immigrant from England, recently served
16 days in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, but said he
ignored orders to fire at stone throwers.
   ``Some of the guys were shooting at the kids as they got off the
truck,'' he said. ``I shot at a garbage can.''

<TEXT>
   Children draw sketches of their homes so
they'll remember them later. Their parents no longer repair their
huts. Traders don't bother to drum up new business.
   Harsud is one of 573 communities destined to be flooded in a
giant dam project that pits environmental concerns against India's
attempts at modernization.
   The government says the $15 billion project on central India's
Narmada River will irrigate drought-stricken farmland and provide
electrical power.
   Critics say it will displace a million people and destroy the
ecology.
   ``What is the use of the dam that will be our doom?'' said
Naginchand Sand, a local businessman.
   In September, leading environmentalists and 35,000 villagers
descended on Harsud, a town of 15,000, in a demonstration to
denounce the dam project as a ``human and environmental tragedy.''
   A man who runs a grocery store near Sand's fertilizer store said
he had planned to expand his business but after the dam project was
announced in 1987 ``all my dreams ended.''
   ``A sort of gloom descended on the village,'' he added. ``But
now with the massive protest there is fresh hope.''
   The Narmada dam project in Madhya Pradesh state is the largest
ever planned in the world. It envisages 30 major, 135 medium and
3,000 minor dams along the 805-mile river and its 41 tributaries.
So far three dams have been built.
   The river is one of the holiest to Hindus. According ancient
belief, it was formed by the tears of Shiva, one of the gods of the
Hindu trinity.
   The river originates in a pond 335 miles to the east of Harsud
and courses through lush forests, farmland and narrow rocky gorges
in a series of falls and twists before reaching the Arabian Sea on
India's western coast.
   About 21 million people, 80 percent of them tribespeople and
villagers, live in the Narmada basin, which is bounded on three
sides by mountains and on the fourth by the sea.
   If the river is dammed, 2,410 square miles of forests and
farmland _ an area slightly larger than Delaware _ will be
submerged and about 1 million people will be displaced, said Ashish
Kothari of Kalpavriksh, an independent environmental group. Other
independent groups agree with those figures, but no official
estimates have been made available.
   Harsud will disappear under 50 feet of water when one of the
major dams of the project, the Indira Sagar, is built 15 miles away.
   The government says the dams are necessary to bring ``an era of
prosperity'' to the valley because they will irrigate 20,000 square
miles of land in drought-prone areas of Madhya Pradesh and
adjoining Gujarat state.
   The project is also supposed to generate 2,700 megawatts of
electricity.
   As for the people who will have to move, the government says it
has prepared extensive rehabilitation plans, including monetary
compensation.
   ``Who wants money? I want my land. Will you feel nice if the
land that gives you food is drowned?'' said farmer Bhure Singh, who
traveled 155 miles on the roof of a crowded bus to demonstrate in
Harsud.
   Kothari of the environmental group said there won't be enough
land left in the area for so many people to live on if the dams are
built.
   To compensate for forest loss, the government plans to plant new
forests. Kothari maintained, however, they could not replace the
hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals that may
have evolved over millions of years.
   Another objection is the project's $15 billion price tag, which
some economists say is a gross underestimate. The World Bank has
promised to lend India $450 million for the project.
   Gerald Fauss, a senior irrigation engineer with the World Bank,
said a project of Narmada's size is bound to create ``some
environmental disturbances.''
   ``But the trade-off is that thousands and thousands of people
benefit from it. We still feel that the project is technically and
economically feasible.'' However, Vijay Paranjpye, an economist
with the governing body of Indian universities, concluded in a
study of the project that it is ``economically not viable.''

   On the hurricane-battered
island of Vieques, a practice site for U.S. Navy bombing off Puerto
Rico, residents link their destiny to a century-old tamarind tree
on a barren hill.
   ``If the tree survives, so will Vieques,'' said engineer Sixto
Perez after a ceremony to replant the tree, which was uprooted by
Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 18.
   ``It has been silent witness to our history,'' Nana Ortiz de
Castano, a retired teacher, told schoolchildren gathered around the
tree.
   The U.S. Navy has been part of Vieques' history since World War
II.
   It owns two-thirds of the island and uses it for practice
bombings and maneuvers. In the 1970s, Vieques was rocked by violent
anti-Navy protests. Similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the Navy
off its sister island, Culebra. Although the Navy says relations
have improved in recent years, many Viequenses, as the 8,000
residents are called, say Hurricane Hugo has made matters worse.
Vieques was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm.
   Hugo pounded Vieques for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to
200 mph, demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3,000 homes.
Trees were either knocked downed or defoliated, leaving the
once-verdant, sun-splashed island with little shade.
   ``It will take 10 years to recover,'' said Luiz Davila, manager
of a General Electric plant that makes electric switches and is the
island's largest employer, with 132 workers.
   ``Now we are seeing the devastation,'' Davila added. ``In six
months, a year, we will see the lack of income people will have.''
   With their homes and possessions gone and their future
livelihood in doubt, some residents despair. Officials say two
people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after
the storm. No one in Vieques died in the hurricane itself.
   ``There is lot of depression, a lot of suicide attempts,'' said
Dr. Eva Almodovar, who is in charge of the emergency room at the
Vieques Hospital. ``It's people who have lost everything. ... They
don't see a way out.''
   The Navy is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water.
   The day after the hurricane, the Navy put up a roadblock to
prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had
set up shacks and burned two Navy vehicles in April.
   Robert Ravin, a high school history teacher, charged that the
Navy acted ``like thieves in the night,'' taking advantage of the
hurricane crisis.
   But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Richard Boyle, said the roadblock was
put up because the squatters were ``unauthorized people on Navy
property. The shacks had been blown down and were completely
demolished.''
   The Navy bought Vieques land for training during World War II,
resettling residents in the center of the island, which is 20 miles
long and six miles across. Most of the Navy property is unused and
hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year.
   Rear Adm. John A. Moriarty, commander of Caribbean naval forces,
said relations with Vieques residents have been ``very, very good.''
   But squatter organizer Antonio Figueroa, a carpenter who says
his movement is ``rescuing land,'' believes the Navy ``has a master
plan'' to stifle development to keep the island to itself.
   Many Viequenses complain that the Navy's presence has kept the
island underdeveloped, underpopulated and poverty-stricken.
   Vieques has a severe housing shortage, an unemployment rate of
70 percent, and an annual per capita income of $5,281, as opposed
to the Puerto Rico average of $8,721. The majority of the islanders
are on welfare.
   Although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for
several movies, most recently ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' with Clint
Eastwood about the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada, Vieques has
seen little tourism.
   ``The Navy occupies two-thirds of the island and this prevents
it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best
beaches, the best land,'' said Mayor Manuela Santiago Collazo.
   Vieques has been losing population for years, and is expected to
lose 2,000 of its 8,000 inhabitants by the year 2000.
   ``A young Viequense who becomes an engineer, a doctor or a
lawyer can't come back because there is nothing to do here,'' said
Figueroa.

   President Bush is paying a nostalgic visit to
Andover, the Massachusetts prep school where he stood out half a
century ago in athletics and student life and forged friendships
that have lasted a lifetime.
   Bruce Gelb recalls his own arrival at Andover in 1941 as a
freshman, and swiftly found himself ordered by a campus bully to
lug a big, overstuffed chair across the campus.
   Gelb managed to heft the chair down a flight of stairs and to
the lawn outside, but then ``I just couldn't move it anymore.''
   ``He put my hand behind my back in that typical kind of
hammerlock,'' Gelb recalled last week in an interview. Just then
``a guy walked by and very simply made the statement, `Leave the
kid alone.' He (the bully) dropped me like a hot potato and snarled
something and picked up the chair and walked off.
   ``I asked somebody, `Who was that guy?' and they replied, `That
was Poppy Bush.'
   ``I never met him. I never said a word to him,'' Gelb said, but
``naturally, he became my hero.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, will take part in a convocation
Sunday marking the 200th anniversary of the day the first
president, George Washington, paid a brief visit to Phillips
Academy, the formal name for the prestigious school known to
generations as Andover.
   The ceremony on the school's Great Lawn will have a religious
and international cast, starting with a procession of students
bearing flags from the more than 50 nations represented in
Andover's student body of 1,217. It also will include ecumenical
readings by students in several languages, including a Soviet boy
and a black South African girl.
   The president and his wife will read from the 24th and 33rd
Psalms as they take their place with the others on the campus that
was so familiar to Bush nearly five decades ago.
   In Bush's day, the school in Andover, Mass., was among the
oldest and most elite of New England's boarding schools, a way
station to Yale and other Ivy League colleges and alma mater to
such famous Americans as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Samuel Morse.
   The school was all-male and almost all white then. Now, nearly
half the students are women and 13 percent are black or Hispanic.
   The boy everyone called ``Poppy'' is still remembered by
old-timers for his prowess on the playing fields and the leadership
qualities that made him senior class president, captain of the
baseball and soccer teams and chairman of the student deacons at
chapel services.
   ``He was not a very good English student,'' recalls retired
teacher Hart Leavitt.
   ``But in the school itself he was quite a figure, what was known
in those days as a BMOC _ Big Man on Campus,'' said Leavitt, who
taught for 37 years at Andover before retiring.
   Bush's credits in the 1942 Andover yearbook, ``Pot Pourri,''
list more than two dozen activites. In the senior class poll, he
was rated as having the second-most ``drag,'' or pull with the
faculty, and third in five categories: best all-around fellow, most
respected, most popular, best athlete and handsomest.
   He didn't place in the listings for class ``politician.''
   Headmaster Donald W. McNemar will not disclose Bush's grades,
but said, ``He did fine.''
   Tough discipline was a hallmark of the old regime. For instance,
Bruce Gelb was tossed out as a junior for an infraction.
   Never mind, he went on to become a top executive of Bristol
Myers Corp., and a major fund-raiser for Bush's political
campaigns. This year, Bush made Gelb director of the U.S.
Information Agency.
   Bush spent five years at Andover, entering with the Class of '41
but finishing with '42 because of an infection that left him
hospitalized.
   The United States was at war when Bush graduated, and he
enlisted the day he turned 18. The futrure president ignored
commencement advice from Secretary of War Henry Stimson, the head
of Andover's trustees, who said the war could be a long one and
graduates could better serve their country by getting more
education.
   Bush, the Navy's youngest pilot, flew 58 combat missions and
survived being shot down. Records show that 143 Andover alumni were
killed in World War II.

<HEAD>A Superpower Meeting Is a Summit, With All Its Expectations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, Bush already ... Soviet Union., to delete extraneous
word.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Bush envisions it, his floating
chat with Mikhail S. Gorbachev will carry a built-in guarantee:
With no agenda to be met and no deals to be settled, the meeting
can hardly be judged anything but a success unless somebody jumps
ship.
   While both leaders are supposed to be committed to staying
aboard with an informal, free-form format, the Soviet side does
seem to have some bigger ideas, suggesting the meetings Dec. 2-3
might end the Cold War.
   That's rhetoric, but it collides with the White House effort to
keep the profile of the ``non-summit summit'' just above the water
line. Bush and his spokesman want expectations held to a minimum.
   At the last superpower meeting comparable to this one, Gorbachev
startled Ronald Reagan by proposing drastic cuts in nuclear
weapons. The administration doesn't want a replay.
   Bush, who issued the handwritten invitation as he flew home from
Eastern Europe on July 18, said that he thinks the meetings will be
productive but that nobody expects substantial decisions or
agreements to emerge.
   By those ground rules, both leaders could go ashore declaring
they have met their objectives, done what they came to do. For
both, that would help at home.
   Bush already is using the meeting he initiated in rebuttal to
the critics who say he has faltered in dealing with the political
and economic upheavals in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev is grappling with economic crises at home and with the
drastic changes that are turning what were satellite states toward
democracy and freer enterprise. Even a general assurance of
economic cooperation, and a hint that trade restrictions could be
relaxed, would be a lift as he heads into a difficult winter. So
will the stress on foreign affairs and superpower relations, strong
points in contrast to the budget woes, food shortages, unemployment
and strikes besetting the Soviet economy.
   Bush said he expects a lot of discussion of the dramatic changes
in Eastern Europe, in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and most
recently, East Germany. In a way, that is a breakthrough. For
nearly 45 years, Soviet leaders considered Eastern Europe their
business, not a topic for a summit discussion. Now Gorbachev may
want some assurance that the West will not push too hard, or seek
strategic military advantage in what is happening there.
   Indeed, Bush said the rapidity of change in Eastern Europe was
one of the things that led him to change his mind about the right
time and format for his first presidential meeting with Gorbachev.
``... I just didn't want to, in this time of dynamic change, miss
something, something that I might get better first hand from Mr.
Gorbachev,'' he said Tuesday as he announced the meetings.
   Nevertheless, there are risks in an unstructured meeting of
superpower leaders, even to get acquainted.
   There are those who hold that the Soviet miscalculations behind
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took root when Nikita S. Khrushchev
and President John F. Kennedy met in Vienna, Austria, in 1961.
   Bush and Gorbachev have met before, most recently when Bush was
president-elect. But since then, and until the surprise
announcement last Tuesday, Bush had said he wasn't going to rush to
the summit, and didn't want to meet for the sake of meeting. Next
year's arms control summit was arranged in September.
   When Reagan met with Gorbachev at Reykjavik, Iceland, just over
three years ago, in what was supposed to be a preliminary meeting
to an arms control summit, the two leaders wound up talking about
elimination of all nuclear weapons, then quit in discord over the
U.S. space defense program.
   Bush dismissed any comparison with Iceland, saying this isn't to
be an arms control meeting, or a summit at all. That comes next
spring or summer, in the United States.
   But when the superpower leaders meet it is a parley at the
summit, in Winston Churchill's phrase, no matter what anyone wants
it called. And such a meeting creates, unavoidably, the pressure of
expectations that the two presidents will come away having
accomplished something more than a meeting.
   ``Summits take on a definition, an expectation of grand design
and grand agreements, and that's not what this is,'' Bush said. He
said the shipboard setting will cut down on the fanfare, the
pressures, the crush of people.
   But all those trappings go with a summit, and this one will have
them, no matter what it's called. They'll just be a little farther
away, in port while the two presidents are talking during their
weekend at sea.
   That's as inevitable as the expectation of measurable progress,
at least of momentum toward grand agreements at the summer summit
next year.

<HEAD>Contests Watched for Shifting Sentiment on Abortion, Race Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia bids to become
the nation's first elected black governor and David Dinkins seeks
distinction as New York's first black mayor in off-year voting
Tuesday that will be watched for shifting sentiment on abortion as
well as race.
   In another abortion-tinged contest, Democratic Rep. James Florio
is heavily favored to break an eight-year Republican hold on the
governor's office in New Jersey.
   The heightened concern over abortion stems from a Supreme Court
ruling last summer permitting states to impose greater restrictions
on women seeking to terminate their pregnancies, and already the
two parties are debating the political fallout.
   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic Party, said abortion has
had an impact on the Virginia, New Jersey and New York races and
added that Democratic candidates with their pro-choice views ``are
on the right side of the issue.''
   ``I think (President) Bush has dug himself a big hole that he's
going to be unable to extricate himself from. He is taking a lot of
Republicans down with him,'' Brown said.
   Countered GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, without referring to any
individual GOP candidate, ``Where you get into trouble on abortion
is when you do not clearly define your position, when you appear to
be all over the lot on it.''
   Atwater, who managed Bush's successful 1988 campaign, noted that
Bush's opposition to abortion did not damage him last year.
   In other balloting Tuesday, 11 candidates are vying to replace
Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas, killed last summer in a plane crash in
Ethiopia.
   The line-up of big city elections includes Detroit, where
71-year-old Democrat Coleman Young seeks a fifth term, and
Cleveland, where Democrats George Forbes and Michael White are
staging a bare-knuckled political brawl for city hall.
   John C. Daniels is favored to win office as the first black
mayor in mostly white New Haven, Conn., while Norm Rice is out for
the same honor in Seattle against Republican Norm Jewett.
   Dozens of referendums dot election ballots, including in San
Francisco, where voters will decide whether to spend $115 million
to replace the city's windswept baseball and football stadium,
Candlestick Park.
   In a campaign prelude to 1990 elections with 34 Senate seats, 36
governorships and 435 House seats, abortion has become a prominent
issue.
   ``The issue was cooler before'' the Supreme Court's ruling,
Atwater said, but added: ``I maintain it is not going to be a
national driving issue in 1990. It's going to be an issue on a
race-by-race basis.''
   Bush has campaigned personally for GOP candidates J. Marshall
Coleman in Virginia, Rudolph Giuliani in New York and Rep. James
Courter in New Jersey, including a swing into New Jersey and
Virginia on Friday. He talked of drugs, crime and other
``challenges of tomorrow,'' but steered clear of abortion.
   But a sweep by Democrats Wilder, Dinkins and Florio _ leaders in
late, pre-election polls _ would give their party plenty to cheer
about one year after Bush's 40-state landslide victory.
   Nowhere is abortion more clearly _ or more surprisingly _ an
issue than Virginia, where race was scarcely a factor until the
campaign's final days.
   Wilder challenged a decade of political wisdom by taking the
offensive with commercials on abortion on television, where
pro-choice and right-to-life groups have both spent heavily on
commercials as well. The issue has spilled over to at least one
other race.
   Wilder launched television commercials more than a month ago
telling women that Coleman wanted to ``take away your right to
choose. ... He wants to go back to outlawing abortion, even in
cases of rape and incest.''
   Larry Sabato, University of Virginia political scientist, said
Wilder's approach permitted him to gain support from voters who
oppose government intervention in their lives and combine ``the
anti-government conservatism with his liberal base, and it's a
potent combination.''
   Coleman declined to respond at first, instead charging his
Democratic rival with trying to ``spread fear.''
   But Wilder surged to a lead in public opinion polls within a few
weeks, leaving Coleman, a former attorney general who lost a
gubernatorial bid eight years ago, to play catch-up in the final
weeks of the race. He hit back with commercials questioning
Wilder's suitability to serve, and on Friday, raised the issue of
race by implication when he said Wilder was benefiting from a
``double standard'' in press coverage.
   Abortion has surfaced in greater and smaller degrees in other
races:
   _Courter has softened his anti-abortion position in New Jersey
and thus alienated the National Right to Life Committee, which
hasn't given him its backing. ``Courter has made so many different
statements on abortion I would like to know what his position is,''
says spokeswoman Nancy Myers. Democrat Florio has a solid
pro-choice position.
   _Giuliani softened his position as well in the New York race,
arousing the ire of Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor. The GOP
candidate issued a clarification last summer that said he accepted
a woman's right to choose and would oppose making abortion illegal.
   _The issue spilled over to the lieutenant governor's race in
Virginia, where Republican Edy Dalton aired a television commercial
saying she was in favor of a woman's right to choose _ in cases of
rape and incest. Democrat Don Beyer said that misrepresented her
true anti-abortion colors.
   _The National Abortion Rights Action League is investing more
than $300,000 in television and newspaper advertisements in
Virginia, hoping to help Wilder.
   _The National Right to Life Committee says it's spending about
$150,000 on its own Virginia ads touting Coleman but complained
Friday that about half of the stations in the state had refused to
accept them.
   And even before the 1989 returns are read, the 1990 handicapping
has begun.
   ``If we're able to frame the debate in terms of who decides
(about abortions) _ that is, the politicians or the women _ then
we'll win,'' said Tony Podesta, whose company has prepared the
television and newspaper commercials being used by NARAL.
   But Sabato, the political scientist, believes the importance of
abortion has been overrated in Virginia and said, ``It's wrong to
assume this is easily translatable.''
   He said Virginia had a relatively small number of Catholic and
ethnic voters _ the groups who might be offended by Wilder's
position on abortion _ and that candidates in other states risked
greater damage by following his example.

   Investor Saul Steinberg is unlikely to lead a
takeover bid for UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, but he could
play a big supporting role in the next act of the UAL buyout saga,
industry analysts said.
   Steinberg, who is said to be a close friend of UAL Chairman
Stephen Wolf, took center stage Wednesday when his Reliance Group
Holdings Inc. filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy more
than 15 percent but less than 25 percent of UAL's stock.
   Such a request often signals that the petitioner seeks an active
role in the target company and usually a measure of control. But
because of his association with Wolf, analysts said Thursday that
Steinberg probably was positioning himself to help UAL's chairman
attempt another buyout or a restructuring.

   Entrepreneurs were reportedly getting as much as $20 a copy for

   A Bush administration plan to raise more than
the $50 billion Congress approved for the savings and loan bailout
and keep it out of the budget deficit is running into opposition
from key Democrats.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
Banking Committee, say the administration plan would ``put an
unnecessary cost burden on the taxpayers'' and ``deeply offend
existing concepts of sound budgeting.''

<HEAD>Time Warner Prepared to Invest Up to $150 Million in Entertainment
Weekly</HEAD>

   Time Warner Inc. is prepared to spend $100
million to $150 million on its launch in February of Entertainment
Weekly magazine, and hopes to make foreign adaptations of it if it
proves successful, President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. says.
   The Time Warner executive, who has been designated to eventually
become the lone chief executive of the media and entertainment
company, also said Thursday he expects there will be an unspecified
amount of sales of non-core assets over the next few years.
   Nicholas made the comments in an appearance Thursday evening
before about 100 people at the Columbia University Graduate School
of Journalism, where he had been invited to discuss Time Inc.'s $14
billion takeover of Warner Communications Inc.
   Earlier this summer, Time purchased a controlling interest in
Warner for $70 a share and changed its name to Time Warner. It
plans to acquire the rest of Warner's stock in exchange for
preferred stock and Warner's stake in a television company
controlled by Chris Craft Industries Inc.
   Also on Thursday, Time Warner said 38 commercial banks have
agreed to lend it $11 billion for the acquisition of Warner. The
permanent bank financing, replacing temporary ``bridge'' financing,
will go into place when the deal is closed, which is expected by
the end of the year.
   In reponse to questions from an audience of about 100 people at
Columbia, Nicholas cited his company's plans to launch
Entertainment Weekly as an example of the broad financial
capability and global reach that media companies will need in the
1990s and beyond.
   He said it costs $100 million to $150 million to introduce a new
mass-market magazine such as Entertainment Weekly in the United
States.
   Nicholas added that if the U.S. version of the magazine proves
successful, versions could be adapted for publication in other
countries.
   Time announced in July plan to start the new magazine, its first
major mass-market magazine launch since it stopped publication of
TV-Cable Week in 1983 after losing $47 million.
   Entertainment Weekly will contain reviews and reporting on
television, movies, video, music and books.
   Nicholas also said the company was interested in pursuing
possible joint ventures and partnerships of unspecified types in
Europe.
   Asked whether Time Warner planned to sell assets, he replied,
``I expect there will be some trimming over the next couple of
years.'' But he said assets that may be sold would not come from
the company's core businesses of magazine, music, filmed
entertainment, cable television and pay television.
   He declined to identify any speific assets that might be sold.
   In the announcement on the $11 billion in bank lending, the
company said managing agents are Bankers Trust Co. and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Co-agent banks include Bank of
Boston, Bank of New York, Chemical Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust
Co.

<HEAD>Jaguar Has Had Ups and Downs Since 1922 Founding</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Ford-Jaguar, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC has gone through ups and downs since it
was launched in 1922 as the Swallow Sidecar Co. in Blackpool.
   Swallow introduced its first car in 1927, and a year later moved
to Coventry, the center of the British car industry, 95 miles
northwest of London.
   It produced a line of cars under the SS brand in the 1930s and
changed its name to Jaguar Cars Ltd. at the end of World War II. In
1968, it became a part of the state-owned automaker British Leyland.
   Jaguar fared badly under state stewardship. It suffered an
after-tax loss of $84 million in 1980 and developed a poor
reputation for quality control.
   Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan, who took over nine years ago,
largely is credited with turning Jaguar around by cutting costs,
more than tripling production per worker and expanding sales in
Europe and the Far East.
   The government sold Jaguar to the public in 1984 and Jaguar soon
was hailed as a prime example of a successful privatization, along
with British Airways PLC and British Steel PLC.
   But Jaguar remained overly dependent on the extremely
competitive U.S. market, where it still sells 40 percent of its
cars, and it was clobbered when the dollar and U.S. luxury car
sales slumped.
   Jaguar's after-tax profit peaked at $141 million in 1985. It
sank to $99 million in 1987 and then to $46 million in 1988 on
revenue of $1.07 billion. Analysts are expecting Jaguar to lose
money in 1989.
   Jaguar has a small product range _ it produces 50,000 XJ6 and
Series III sedans, XJS sports cars and limousines a year. Its
cheapest model is $39,700.
   The company has four plants, all in Britain, and 12,500
employees.

   The cheapest model costs nearly $40,000, and
customer satisfaction isn't part of the allure. But the curvaceous
Jaguar, decked out in leather and walnut, has a mystique that sells.
   The announcement Thursday of Ford Motor Co.'s $2.5 billion deal
to buy the British automaker puts an ironic twist on the story of
Jaguar, whose owners traditionally have eschewed dependability for
the guaranteed style of the leaping cat logo.
   ``Jaguar is the Burberry of the car industry,'' said John
Lawson, a London auto analyst.
   Despite nagging criticisms about how well the cars actually run,
Jaguar retains a certain cachet that symbolizes British elegance
and the lifestyles of the rich and famous.
   ``People buy them for sentimental reasons,'' said Paul Horrell
at Britain's Car Magazine. ``They are as quiet as you can buy,
including Rolls Royces, and it is very traditional British. You
feel like you're walking into a gentlemen's club.''
   Prince Charles has owned a Jaguar, and in the golden age of
Hollywood, Clark Gable had at least one.
   In the United States, Jaguar's biggest market with sales of
20,000 annually, the affluent image was fostered by glitzy
prime-time soap opera stars behind the wheel.
   The nasty Cliff Barnes drove an SJ6 along the road to Southfork
in ``Dallas.'' Others followed suit with Jaguars driving through
``Dynasty,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' ``Knot's Landing'' and ``L.A. Law''
episodes.
   Britain's National Motor Museum displays three Jaguars, and
curator Michael Ware said much of the company's prestige hinges on
racing successes, especially at the French Le Mans race where the
company's most recent win was in 1988.
   That was the first time Jaguar had come out on top of the
24-hour endurance race in 31 years and Britain's Daily Telegraph
newspaper noted the significance: ``If the rise and fall of the Jag
was a microcosm of British industry, then the symbolism of the
comeback is writ large.''
   British car industry experts, who pronounce the word with three
syllables (jag'-yoo-ahr), advised Ford not to tamper with the
company's refined image.
   But in a recent survey of U.S. customer satisfaction by J.D.
Power and Associates, Jaguar failed to make the top 15. Two years
ago, in a similar study the company ranked eighth.
   Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst with the London investment firm
UBS Phillips and Drew, said Jaguar is not as technically advanced
as Japanese luxury car makers.
   ``This is not a problem to do with the car. It has to do with
manufacturing problems,'' Reitman said. ``People give it very high
marks for appearance and styling, for ride, for its interior. Where
it fails maybe is on assembly and some basic faults in some certain
systems, sometimes it's very small things, a light doesn't work,
detail things.''
   Anthony Parkinson, a New Yorker and Jaguar owner who runs a
British coachbuilding company, predicted Jaguar would prosper under
Ford just as another British takeover target, Aston-Martin, has.
   ``Ford is a progressive company and understands what Jaguar is
all about. Jaguar is fortunate to have a pretty decent partner and
Ford will pull up the good people in Jaguar and raise them above
50,000 cars a year,'' Parkinson said.
   Like many Jaguar owners, Parkinson is hooked.
   ``I love my Jaguars because of their beauty, their rounded
shapes and because they are not Mercedes or BMWs,'' he said,
stressing the individuality of the Jaguar as opposed to the
computer-like precision of the German cars.
   Another owner, Miles Morris, who works at Christie's
international car department, said he loves his dark, British
racing green, 1954 XK-120 which runs flawlessly and looks even
better.
   Morris said it is the classic styling that attracts collectors
willing to pay prices that have ``gone up incredibly.''
   ``Two years ago you could have bought a nice 120 for 12,000
pounds ($19,000),'' Morris said. ``Now it's up to 50,000 pounds
($80,000) if not a little more.''
   The world record price for Jaguars was set Oct. 26 at the London
Motorfair when a Swedish consortium paid 1.2 million pounds ($1.9
million) for a 1955 D-type.

<HEAD>Retailers Post Small to Middling October Gains; Holidays Seen Difficult</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The peak Christmas shopping season might be merry for bargain
hunters but ho-hum for retailers.
   Judging by last month's uneven results at the nation's major
retailers, the holidays could be a difficult time for some store
owners. Large national chain stores on Thursday reported modest to
good October sales.
   Clothing retailers rang up better results than general
merchandisers, such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., that have a large
proportion of their business devoted to ``big-ticket'' durable
items, ranging from refrigerators to sofas.
   But even apparel stores suffered in some parts of the country
where unusually mild weather discouraged shopping for fall and
winter clothes.
   Walter Loeb, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said he
has detected signs that consumers are becoming more cautious
spenders given the weakness in the economy, particularly on the
manufacturing side.
   Retailers' results are watched closely for clues about consumer
spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of total U.S.
economic output.
   Loeb said sales of mens wear and automobiles are among the
categories performing poorly. He said those categories are early
indicators of the national spending mood.
   ``I'm looking for a slowdown in consumer spending in the
Christmas season,'' Loeb said, noting that retail sales gains will
be ``meager.''
   Store owners might have to slash prices to entice reluctant
consumers _ which would be good news for shoppers hunting for
bargains on gifts.
   ``I look for a very promotional Christmas,'' said Loeb.
   On a positive note from a merchant's standpoint, other analysts
said sales this month and next might get a boost as consumers shop
for winter things that they didn't feel like buying during
October's Indian Summer days.
   Last month's results varied widely among the types of retailers,
and for this reason analysts said it was difficult to generalize.
   Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said general merchandise sales rose an average of 4.3 percent
in October for stores open at least a year, compared with
September's 5.9 percent increase.
   Sears, the largest U.S. retailer, said its sales edged up 0.7
percent in the four weeks ended Oct. 28, but sales at Sears stores
open at least a year, called same-store or comparable-store sales,
were flat.
   Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better
measure of a company's performance than tallies that include newly
opened stores.
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears Merchandise
Group, said revenue has been hurt by a decline in demand for
durables and by the shift in the company's pricing and
merchandising strategy.
   The shift to ``everyday low prices'' that began in March and the
discontinuation of major sales promotions, such as ``Super
Saturdays,'' has made comparisons between sales this year and last
year difficult, he said.
   But, he told financial analysts in New York, Sears is in good
shape for Christmas. Inventories are in line to meet expected
demand.
   ``Everyday low pricing is a Christmas shopper's dream come
true,'' said Bozic.
   Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan said: ``We're not terribly
nervous about the fourth quarter. We should have an acceptable
performance.''
   Among the other big retailers reporting Thursday were the
discounters:
   _K mart Corp., the second largest retailer, said its October
sales increased 5.3 percent from a year earlier while on a
comparable-store basis, sales were up 2.1 percent.
   _Third-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 22 percent
increase in October sales and an 8 percent pickup in same-store
results.
   Among chain stores oriented toward apparel:
   _J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a 9.6 percent October sales gain
helped by strength in its women's division. Penney's same-store
sales rose 8.2 percent.
   _Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, said its
sales rose 9 percent overall and 6 percent on a comparable-store
basis.
   _Dayton Hudson Corp. reported its overall October sales went up
16.2 percent and its same-store sales rose 8.5 percent.
   _May Department Stores Co. posted a 9.3 percent pickup in
overall October sales and a 6.7 percent gain in same-store results.
   _Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., a major West Coast department
store operator, said its October sales went up 1.6 percent overall
while same-store sales were up 4.6 percent. Carter Hawley said the
San Francisco Bay area earthquake substantially hurt sales.
   The figures reported by major general merchandise chains and
apparel retailers differ from the government's monthly retail sales
figures. The Commerce Department report is more comprehensive and
covers sales at auto dealers, supermarkets, restaurants and
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Help-Wanted Ads Level Off, Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The volume of help-wanted ads appearing in the
nation's newspapers is holding steady, an indication that job
growth is not likely to fall in the near future, the Conference
Board says.
   In September, the board's help-wanted adveritising index
registered 145, down 1 point from August and 8 points lower than
the year-earlier period.
   But while the labor market has cooled, Conference Board
economist Ken Goldstein noted Thursday that the leveling off of
want-ad volume suggests that ``job growth will not decline over the
next few months.''
   Despite his forecast, want-ad volume continued to decline _ at
times significantly _ in the Northeast, South Atlantic and East
North Central regions.
   The West South Central region posted a 17.9 percent gain in
advertising in September, but the upturn was concentrated almost
exclusively in the Houston area.
   The Conference Board tracks want-ad volume in 51 major
newspapers. The board contends that want ads are a proven barometer
of changes in the supply of jobs.

<HEAD>Kansas Widow Gets First Check In Experimental `Reverse Mortgage'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 79-year-old Kansas widow is the first
beneficiary of an experimental government program that allows the
nation's elderly to receive a monthly check by tapping their home
equity through a ``reverse mortgage.''
   Fannie Mae, a congressionally chartered company that finances
home buying, said Thursday the first check in the program was
presented to Majorie Mason of Fairway, Kan.
   In a reverse mortgage, homeowners who either own their property
or have only a minimal mortgage debt take out a new mortgage.
Instead of receiving a lump sum, they either draw on a line of
credit or get monthly payments. When they die or move, the loan is
repaid by selling the home.
   The program, designed to give people older than 62 the income
they need to pay property taxes and maintain their home, provides
that homeowners cannot be displaced even if the amount they owe
eventually exceeds the worth of their property.
   The mortgages are insured by the Federal Housing Administration,
an arm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
purchased by Fannie Mae from local lenders who originate the loans.
   A total of 2,500 reverse mortgages are being made available
through local HUD offices through Sept. 30, 1991.

<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. and a special committee of
Telerate Inc.'s board of directors have agreed to a merger under
which Dow Jones would pay $21 a share for the stock in the
financial information company it does not already own.
   Telerate's special board earlier rejected a Dow Jones offer of
$18 a share as inadequate. The new offer, announced late Thursday
by Dow Jones, is valued at about $672 million, compared with about
$576 million for the old one.
   Dow Jones already owns 67 percent of Telerate's outstanding
shares, said spokesman Roger May.
   Neil S. Hirsh, president and chief executive office of Telerate
and the owner of about 6 percent of the outstanding shares,
supports the agreement in principle, according to Dow Jones.
   Under the agreement, Dow Jones will buy Hirsh's shares as well
as the other outstanding shares in the open market, Dow Jones said
in a statement.
   The agreement is subject to the negotiation of a definitive
merger agreement and certain corporate approvals.
   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine and provides a variety of financial news services and data
bases. Telerate provides financial information via computer screens
that are used in brokerage houses and elsewhere.
   On Wednesday, Dow Jones announced it was extending until Nov. 9
its earlier offer. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Dow Jones said it made the extension because Telerate
had provided Dow Jones with a new forecast of financial performance
and Dow Jones wanted time to review it.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Telerate closed
unchanged at $19.50 a share. The merger agreement was announced
after the market closed.

<HEAD>New York Stock Exchange Approves Controls To Curb Volatility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange is limiting
computerized program trading in times of sharp market declines but
congressional officials want even stronger regulatory safeguards.
   The nation's biggest stock exchange reacted Thursday to a wave
of oppostion to a trading strategy blamed for roiling the financial
markets but stopped short of calling program trading the sole
culprit.
   ``If we don't curb some way or another, we are going to ruin the
functioning of the capital markets in this country,'' NYSE Chairman
John J. Phelan Jr. said.
   The exchange's board of directors approved a series of limits
that will be imposed when the stock market takes rapid dives, and
said it would appoint a commission to study long-term solutions to
market volatility.
   The controls follow a growing outcry against a strategy known as
index arbitrage, which involves the rapid trading of millions of
shares of stocks and stock futures, since the Dow Jones industrial
average sank 190 points in a few hours on Oct. 13.
   In Washington, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., pushed a call for
legislation to give the Securities and Exchange Commission
authority to halt program trading when prices swing wildly.
   Markey, chairman of a House subcommittee considering market
reform legislation, said the latest NYSE changes are not enough.
   ``The measures are well-meaning but they don't guarantee the
health of our capital formation system,'' Markey said in a
telephone interview.
   ``We can't rely on any one individual firm, institution,
individual caring about a market overall,'' he said. ``That's why
we need the SEC. They do have the responsibility to oversee the
market.''
   Under the new controls, when the Dow Jones average declines 30
points, all program trading orders that use the exchange's
automated delivery system will be delayed 15 minutes. After a drop
of 75 points, the delay will be 30 minutes.
   Program trading orders will be delayed for one hour when there
is a 12-point drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index futures
contract, which is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The
Merc already has a ``shock absorber'' trading limit after a
12-point decline, which is equivalent to a drop of nearly 100
points in the Dow Jones average.
   ``It slows the process down ... so everybody has a fair chance
to access the marketplace,'' Phelan said.
   Phelan said program trading was only one contributor to
volatility and that the exchange hoped to develop long-term
solutions. Wall Street professionals agreed.
   ``Program trading is basically the catalyst for a lot of
different concerns,'' said economist Laszlo Birinyi Jr., head of a
New York investment management firm. ``It's only a small portion of
the overall problem.''
   Major Wall Street brokerages have abandoned or curtailed index
arbitrage in recent days. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Wall Street's
fourth-largest program trader, said Thursday it would not execute
such orders for customers when the Dow average moves either up or
down 30 points.
   ``We have been and continue to be concerned about the
deterioration of liquidity and equity markets,'' the firm said in a
statement, calling on the NYSE also to study other trading
practices that may heighten volatility.
   Program trading also was blamed by many for accelerating the
1987 market crash. The NYSE implemented less dramatic curbs on
program trading following that debacle.
   Index arbitrage seeks to capitalize on brief and minute
differences in the prices of stocks and stock-index futures that
are based upon the same stocks. The trading tactic often is geared
to make short-term gains in excitable markets.
   Opponents claim index arbitrage causes large swings in stock
prices, preventing the nation's markets from pricing stocks
accurately based on demand or economic factors.
   They also say the turbulence has frightened individual investors
from the stock market and made it tougher for U.S. companies to
raise capital for expansion or research and development.
   As an interim measure, the exchange said it was asking all its
member firms to voluntarily refrain from executing program trades
for their own accounts.
   At the same time, the NYSE is asking member firms to ask their
customers to refrain from program trading that would destabilize
the market. Also, statistics on program trading will be released
weekly instead of monthly.

<TEXT>
   At Frank's Barber shop in the strike-torn
southwestern Virginia coalfields, you can get a haircut for $6 and
free opinions about the legislative race from just about everyone
who comes in the door.
   The race pits a United Mine Workers district president as a
write-in candidate against a veteran Democrat in the state House of
Delegates whose son, a judge, has fined the union $31 million for
illegal strike activities.
   Both candidates and constituents said Thursday that frustration
with the lengthy strike against the Pittston Coal Group, more than
the fines, had spurred the union campaign.
   But UMW spokesman Gene Carroll said, ``We can't ignore the fact
that he's got the same name as the judge.''
   Donald McGlothlin Jr. is a circuit judge in a neighboring county
outside the legislative district. He has issued court orders sought
by Pittston prohibiting the union from disrupting company
operations.
   Donald McGlothlin Sr. has represented Buchanan and part of
Tazewell counties in the House of Delegates since 1968 with the
support of organized labor.
   The 63-year-old attorney was rolling along unopposed when Jack
Stump, a UMW district president, announced Oct. 18 that he was
running as an independent candidate against him. The late start is
forcing both candidates to scramble with door-to-door campaigning.
   Barber Frank Pritchard said when people come into his shop in
Vansant the first topic _ even before the weather _ usually is the
race. ``They talk about a lot of things, who's pregnant, who's
running around with who and such, but basically it's the election
they get to first.''
   Pritchard and his barbering wife, Dana, said they asked 50
people when they sat down for a haircut or walked in to shoot the
breeze this week whether they were going to vote for Stump or
McGlothlin. Only one backed the incumbent.
   Despite the results of his poll, Pritchard said, ``I really
think Don will win. There are a lot of undecideds out there. What I
think will hurt Jack, though, is that people will have to write his
name on the ballot,'' Pritchard said. ``I've talked to a lot of
people who have never done that before.''
   Stump, a 41-year-old mountain of a man with a trim brown beard,
worked in the mines before he began holding union office 10 years
ago. Stump said he became a candidate because McGlothlin has been
silent since the strike involving Pittston's 1,695 union employees
began April 5. His campaign slogan is, ``Write In Jack Stump. He'll
Speak Up.''
   The labor dispute has become a rallying point for unions across
the country. They say Pittston is trying to break the UMW while
refusing to provide adequate medical benefits.
   ``It doesn't take a lot for people to speak up and say, `Hey,
this is not right.' We thought Don could have spoken up for us and
he didn't,'' Stump said, adding that UMW President Richard Trumka
and Vice President Cecil Roberts encouraged him to run.
   The amount of the fines imposed by the younger McGlothlin also
has drawn national attention.
   Stump, who is getting most of his campaign financing from the
union, said, ``We're not pleased with the fines, but I'm not
running against Judge McGlothlin. I didn't get into this thing just
to get back at Judge McGlothlin.''
   The elder McGlothlin, whose stockiness, thick white moustache
and slow manner of speaking bear resemblance to actor Wilfred
Brimley, said he is a neutral party in the dispute.
   ``I have not been at any trial,'' he said when asked whether he
felt targeted by the union because of his son's actions. ``I have
nothing to do with either side. I have no comment to make about my
son.''
   McGlothlin said he hopes the appointment of former Labor
Secretary Bill Usery as a super mediator will help settle the
strike, which he said has ``wreaked havoc on the communities here.''
   But he said, ``I'm not going to do anything about the coal
strike because that is not the function of government. If I had the
power I would have stopped it the first day. The government cannot
settle it. It has to be between labor and management.''

<HEAD>Two Computer Firms Warned After One-Yen Bids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has called in the presidents of two
of Japan's largest computer companies for warnings after the
disclosure of three cases where they bid just one yen, or about 0.7
cent, to win local government contracts, officials said.
   Officials expressed concern Thursday that the cases would damage
trust in Japanese companies' competitive ethics and become an issue
in current U.S.-Japan talks on ``structural barriers'' to trade,
such as business customs.
   A spokesman for the Fair Trade Commission said it is studying
how to proceed with an investigation into whether unfair
competition was involved. Press reports said the one-yen bidders
saw the projects as a way to get a head start on computer systems
expected to be linked up throughout the country.
   In two of the cases, the two companies _ Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC
Corp. _ were bidding against each other, said Atsushi Tajima of the
Electronics Policy Division of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry. Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, won
all three contracts.
   Tajima said NEC President Tadahiro Sekimoto was summoned
Thursday and Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto on Wednesday for
warnings by Kosuke Yamamoto, director of the ministry's Machinery
and Information Services Bureau, to review bidding practices.
   He said Sekimoto apologized for the commotion over the cases,
and explained that he has directed branch managers to consult with
headquarters on bidding.
   Meanwhile, Hikaru Matsunaga, the trade minister, described the
one-yen bids as strange from the viewpoint of common sense and
business ethics, a ministry spokesman said.
   Matsunaga suggested some minimum standards should be set for
such bidding, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama told a lower house Audit
Committee session Thursday that the government would be ready to
discuss the one-yen bid issue in the next round of U.S.-Japan
structural barrier talks, scheduled next week in Washington.
   ``The government has a big interest in the one-yen bid issue as
it would impair social and international trust in companies and the
order of sound competition. The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry and the Fair Trade Commission are dealing with this, and
we would like to discuss the matter even in the structural talks
with the United States.''
   In addition to structural issues, under legislation adopted last
year, the United States has said Japan may face retaliation if it
does not open its market wider to U.S. supercomputers, satellites
and lumber products.
   On Wednesday, Fujitsu said it was trying to withdraw from two of
the one-yen contracts, while work already has been completed on the
third.
   Akira Imagawa, spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo,
said company officials in the Nagano prefecture, or state, in
central Japan had asked Nagano authorities to cancel a one-yen
contract won last month.
   In the Nagano deal, Fujitu and NEC made identical one-yen bids
for a contract to design software for the prefectural library's
computer system, local officials said.
   The prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen, or
about $112,000, in its budget for the project, said the officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Front-line salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract ...
but lacked common sense,'' Imagawa said.
   Earlier, Hiroshima city officials refused to let Fujitsu out of
its one-yen contract to design software to map the Hiroshima city
water supply system, although they said their final decision would
depend on the outcome of a possible Fair Trade Commission
investigation.
   Fujitsu had said the bid represented a long-term investment. The
city had budgeted 11 million yen, or $78,000, for the project.
   The third case involved one-yen bids by both Fujitsu and NEC in
August 1987 for a contract to design in-house communication systems
in the Wakayama prefectural office building. Local officials said
Fujitsu won in a drawing of lots for the contract, worth an
estimated 525 million yen, or $3.7 million.
   Fujitsu said it already had completed the work, but failed in
bidding for a more expensive follow-up project in Wakayama.

<HEAD>Jaguar Could Thrive Under Ford, Analysts Say</HEAD>

   Although being taken over by Ford Motor Co. was
not Jaguar PLC's first choice, the ailing British luxury carmaker
could thrive under the world's second-largest automaker, analysts
say.
   Jaguar might be operated independently enough from the American
company to maintain its cachet as a maker of elegant, utterly
British cars, analysts said after the deal was announced Thursday.
   But ``a Jaguar is a Jaguar and a Ford is definitely not a
Jaguar,'' said Jaguar worker Linda Graham. Employees like Ms.
Graham, 30, as well as Jaguar dealers and collectors expressed
doubts that Jaguar could keep its unique, clubby image.
   However, analysts said the automaker might be able to use Ford's
financial and technological clout to expand its product line to
compete with cheaper BMW and Japanese luxury models.
   ``It will allow them to compete into the 1990s,'' said Stephen
Reitman, an auto analyst with the London investment firm UBS
Phillips and Drew.
   Jaguar has suffered from a slump in U.S. sales, on which it
depends heavily, and for 18 months it has been looking for a
partner to enable it to expand while remaining an independent
company.
   In a stunning about-face, Jaguar agreed Thursday to a $2.5
billion cash offer from Ford, which had been an unwanted suitor and
potential hostile bidder since Sept. 19. The U.S. company already
owns 13.2 percent of Jaguar's shares.
   General Motors Corp., the world's No. 1 automaker, had undergone
nine months of negotiations with Jaguar on a deal aimed at
preserving Jaguar's independence while boosting its prospects. GM
had planned to take only a minority stake of perhaps 30 percent.
   But, GM said, Jaguar, with its losses and need for a significant
cash injection, was not worth the equivalent of $13.35 a share Ford
agreed to pay.
   Jaguar's shares closed Thursday at $13.02, down $1.24, on
London's Stock Exchange. Investors apparently bid the stock down
because the possibility of a takeover war all but evaporated.
   Ford stock closed down 62{ cents a share at $46.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The government paved the way for Ford's bid when it said Tuesday
it was prepared to waive a ``golden share,'' which allowed it to
veto any takeover. The share was a legacy of Jaguar's former
government ownership. Dropping the golden share raised the
possibility of a bidding war, something Jaguar's directors
apparently could not stomach, leading to the deal with Ford.
   Jaguar's shareholders must approve the takeover by a 75 percent
majority at a meeting that is to be held at the end of the month.
   Sanjay Dabysing, an auto analyst with the economic forecasting
firm DRI Europe, said Ford wants to compete with Toyota's Lexus,
Nissan's Infinity and Honda's Acura, all luxury models.
   ``What Ford intends to do with Jaguar is to turn it into another
BMW,'' he said. ``We're looking at a big transformation here. They
need to develop new cars and engines as well as new plant.''
   BMW, the German luxury carmaker, produces 500,000 cars a year,
10 times Jaguar's output.
   Under the Ford deal, Jaguar will be run as a separate entity.
Jaguars will continue to be made by the British company's 12,500
workers at its four plants. Jaguar's independent dealer network
will be maintained.
   Jaguar will retain a board of directors that will include Ford
representatives and will be responsible for the use of the Jaguar
brand name. Chairman Sir John Egan is staying on, at least for the
immediate future. Jaguar will report to Ford of Europe, not Detroit
headquarters.
   ``Ford's having spent 1.6 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) and
making investments of at least half that amount again over the next
two or three years, they are not going to squander that by turning
Jaguar into another Ford unit,'' Reitman said.
   Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, said at a news
conference Thursday, ``It's not something we want to mix in with
the regular run of the Ford business.''
   Halstead said Ford has wanted to significantly develop its
presence in the growing world luxury auto market.
   He said there was considerable potential to increase sales
volume by the expansion of Jaguar's product line in Europe, the
United States and elsewhere.
   He said Ford would inject an unspecified amount of funds into
Jaguar to develop the existing line and boost its research and
development funding.
   Jaguar also will make use of Ford's worldwide engineering,
purchasing and manufacturing technologies. That will help Jaguar
reduce costs, Egan said.

   The securities industry needs to reemphasize the
long-term role of the financial markets while not excluding such
controversial practices as program trading, says the incoming
leader of the industry's main trade group.
   Robert N. Downey, a partner with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and a
former member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, also
said Thursday the industry needed to patrol itself harder in light
of congressional debate over government intervention during market
emergencies.
   ``A safe environment is very very difficult,'' Downey said at a
news conference. ``We're going to just try to work harder and
emphasize the strength of our industry and our very key role in
capital raising for the nation _ for its government-owned unit and
for its corporations,''
   Downey, 53, was nominated to succeed Hardwick Simmons as 1990
chairman of the Securities Industry Association, which represents
more than 625 securities brokerages and investment banking firms in
the United States and Canada.
   The SIA board will vote on the nomination at its annual meeting
on Nov. 29 in Florida. Simmons will continue as an officer and
director of SIA.
   In recent days, several major Wall Street brokerages have said
they would curb program trading, a computerized group of strategies
generally linked to activity in stock-index futures.
   Critics claim the strategy, which is used by big institutional
investors such as banks, mutual funds and pension funds to rapidly
trade millions of shares, is dangerously distorting the stock
market and scaring away small investors. Program trading has been
cited as a factor in the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Downey said the SIA at an upcoming board meeting would begin
formulating a policy to address such practices.
   Simmons, who is vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the industry must work to curtail such strategies and make the
market attractive to individual investors, whom he said have been
at a disadvantage.
   ``It's just that they feel disenfranchised. We have to tell them
that the franchise is still there,'' he said.
   Downey said practices such as program trading have tended to
focus the market's attention on short-term gains to the exclusion
of longer-term fundamentals such as companies' earnings and the
overall quality of their products. He said the industry needs to
reemphasize a longer-term view, although not to the exclusion of
diversification.
   Simmons said industry rules to manage index arbitrage, one of
the most controversial forms of program trading, likely would be
forthcoming but a complete ban of the practice is unlikely.
Nevertheless, the SIA could help curb the practice, he said.
   Index arbitrage involves the computerized trading of millions of
shares in an attempt to capitalize on brief and minute differences
in the prices of stocks and stock-index futures.
   ``What we have to do is let people know our position which is
that index arbitrage in and of itself may be harmful to the U.S.
market,'' Simmons said.
   Simmons dismissed suggestions that curbing index arbitrage would
send investors overseas, saying that equities trading has been
gradually moving offshore over the last 20 years as Japanese and
other markets have become prominent.
   Shearson recently halted its index arbitrage and Downey said
Goldman Sachs has not used the strategy for its own account since
1987.
   Simmons also said that market circuit-breakers _ automatic,
temporary trading halts during extreme market volatility _ have
helped, more must be done to safeguard the market, as evidenced by
the recent stock market gyrations that saw the Dow Jones industrial
average fall 190 points on Oct. 13.
   Congress currently is hearing testimony on proposed legislation
that could give federal regulators authority to halt trading in
future market emergencies.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady told Congress this week
called for federal intervention, while Richard C. Breeden, the
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that he
does not want such power.

<HEAD>Britain Issues Go-Slow Plan on European Monetary Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, divided over Britain's increasing
isolation in Europe, has unveiled an alternative go-slow approach
to plans for European monetary union.
   Earlier, rumors of an alleged insider-trading scandal involving
a Cabinet minister shook the London stock market. Transport
Secretary Cecil Parkinson denied speculation Thursday he was
involved and the markets steadied.
   But the jittery reaction reflected edginess about the
government, already shaken by last week's resignation of the top
treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. He
quit in a policy dispute with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over
Europe.
   The new chancellor, John Major, issued a government paper laying
down what he termed Britain's ``market-based'' approach to the
development of economic and monetary union among the 12 nations of
the EEC.
   The British plan said it was ``far too early'' to commit the EEC
to having a single currency and central bank envisioned in the
current plan, drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of the European
Commission at the Community's headquarters in Brussels.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, president of the 12-nation
EEC, is pressing the Delors plan.
   Last month, Mitterrand went further and said economic and
monetary union would be a decisive step toward ``achieving a
political unity of the community.''
   The British plan left open what may happen in the longer term
about economic and monetary union.
   It said London's approach was based on general principles that
market forces, not new Europe-wide institutions, should prevail,
and that decisions should be taken at European level only when they
cannot be taken by national governments.
   ``It is an excellent paper,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of
Commons.
   It ``shows you can achieve closer economic and monetary
cooperation much better and more rapidly by working with the grain
of market forces than by setting up new bureaucratic and highly
centralized institutions which are not accountable to anybody,''
she added.
   Mrs. Thatcher in June rejected the single central bank and
one-currency notions as removing from national governments
fundamental powers to decide on economic policy.
   Mrs. Thatcher agreed, however, on strict conditions that Britain
will in principle join the currency-stabilizing mechanism of the
European Monetary System that links nine of the EEC currencies.
   But she is unenthusiastic about the idea, while Lawson wanted to
join as soon as possible. He quit saying he could no longer carry
on while Mrs. Thatcher retained a personal economic adviser who
opposes British membership. The adviser then also resigned.
   London share prices tumbled in early trading after rumors swept
the market that another Cabinet minister was likely to resign in
the alleged insider-dealing scandal.
   After several hours of speculation that Parkinson was the
minister, he issued a statement through his lawyers saying he has
not ``engaged in any insider dealing nor in any share dealings.''
   The statement added that Parkinson transferred his funds to
stockbrokers after he joined the Cabinet in 1987 and had since
``played no part whatsoever'' in any investments the brokers made.
   The rumors began after The Scotsman, a newspaper based in
Edinburgh, Scotland, reported that Britain's Channel 4 television
network has investigated an insider-dealing group that allegedly
has at least one senior government member among its clients.
   Channel 4 confirmed it is working on an investigation but said
the program was ``as yet neither complete nor scheduled.''
   Insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and
selling stock based on inside information about a company, such as
takeover offers or profits prospects, which is not available to the
public.

<HEAD>Ford Could Buy Jaguar With Cash and Do It Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conceivably, Ford Motor Co. could write a check
to buy itself a fancy but financially troubled British auto company
and have enough left in the coffers to do it again.
   That explains in part why cash-rich Ford was willing to pay top
dollar for Jaguar PLC.
   The other major Jaguar suitor, General Motors Corp., bowed out,
saying Ford's $2.5 billion price wasn't financially wise.
   Ford officials said they weren't ready to announce how the
company would foot the bill. But the company had $5.8 billion in
cash on hand as of Sept. 30, making it possible for the No. 2 U.S.
automaker to complete the deal without borrowing a single quid.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, an
economic consulting firm, said it isn't in Ford's nature to sit on
money.
   ``They don't see themselves primarily in the business of
investing money,'' he said. ``So if there's money there, they feel
it should be used in productive interests.''
   Ford had a record $10.3 billion in cash as of June 30, 1988,
thanks to several profitable years. Since then, the company has
been whittling it down, mostly through a stock repurchase plan, a
dividend increase last January and an aggressive capital spending
program.
   Ford already is the biggest U.S. automaker in Europe and has
been seeking an even greater share.
   ``We have aimed for some to time to develop our presence in the
world luxury auto market,'' said Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford
of Europe, at the London news conference announcing the deal.
``It's a significant growth segment of the market that we want to
be in in a more significant way.''
   Ford earlier this year held unsuccessful talks with the Swedish
car and truck maker Saab-Scania AB, reportedly over Saab's heavy
truck business.
   Analysts have said the Saab discussions and interest in Jaguar
signaled the automaker's determination to position itself ahead of
the removal of trade barriers within the European Community in 1992.
   While Ford has been a successful mass-market producer in Europe
_ Ford of Europe makes 1.8 million vehicles a year _ it had not
been as well regarded for specialty vehicles.
   Ford's European operations date to 1903, when founder Henry Ford
began exporting cars to England from the United States.
   In its recent years of record profitability, the Continent has
been important to Ford not only as a car and truck market but as a
base for its earnings. During the past two years, profits from
Ford's European operations have risen while North American earnings
have declined.
   Furthermore, Ford rivals GM and Chrysler Corp. also have been
expanding their European presence.
   Chrysler, which sold its European plants more than a decade ago
when it encountered financial trouble that led to a U.S. government
bailout, announced in February it would return to European
production through a joint venture with France's Renault to build a
sport-utility vehicle.
   GM, which has made cars on the Continent since the early 1920s,
has seven assembly and 30 component plants in Europe, owns all of
luxury sports carmaker Group Lotus PLC of Britain and has a
European joint truck venture with Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan.
   Two weeks ago, Ford announced it was dropping its Merkur line of
West German-made luxury performance cars because of slow sales. The
two Merkur cars _ the Scorpio and XR4Ti _ had been sold through
Lincoln-Mercury dealerships.

<HEAD>Sears Resolving Plans for Chicago Tower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is in the final stages of
arranging a transaction that would allow the giant retailer to
realize some of the value of its headquarters tower, Sears'
chairman says.
   ``We're very close to a deal on the tower that will satisfy all
the objectives that we established one year ago,'' Edward A.
Brennan, Sears' chairman and chief executive officer, disclosed at
a meeting Thursday with financial analysts.
   Brennan said an announcement on the fate of the world's tallest
building was expected by the end of the year.
   Speaking with reporters after the meeting at a New York hotel,
Brennan wouldn't say whether the expected deal involved an outright
sale of Sears Tower or an alternative transaction, such as a new
mortgage.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that Sears is understood
to be negotiating with the Boston-based pension fund adviser
Aldrich, Eastman &amp; Waltch Inc. to mortgage the property for nearly
$850 million in a debt and equity deal.
   Sears' chief aim all along has been to get the appreciated value
out of its headquarters building, Brennan said.
   The funds realized from the 110-story Chicago landmark would be
used to repay money Sears borrowed to buy back some of its shares
under a stock repurchase program.
   Sears also intended to use proceeds from a transaction to reduce
its debt, placed at $2 billion in a July filing Sears submitted to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   A year ago, Sears announced its intentions concerning the tower
as part of a major restructuring program by the nation's largest
retailer. Analysts have estimated that Sears Tower could fetch $800
million to $1 billion.
   The restructuring included a switch in Sears' pricing and
merchandising strategy, the transfer of its retailing division
headquarters from the tower to a location in suburban Chicago and
the repurchase of 40 million shares, or about 10 percent, of Sears'
oustanding common stock.
   In September, reports circulated that a prospective sale of
Sears Tower to a Canadian developer had run into a hitch.
   Following the reported breakdown in talks with Toronto-based
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., Sears was said to be reviewing
its options and possibly reconsidering the idea of selling the
tower.
   Neither Sears nor Olympia &amp; York have ever commented on the
reports.

<HEAD>Senate Ag Committee Passes CFTC Reauthorization Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee has passed a bill to reform
the commodity futures industry, while reauthorizing the federal
agency that regulates it.
   But the committee chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he
wanted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to report on the
effects of the Oct. 13 stock market drop before legislation to
reauthorize the agency reaches the Senate floor.
   The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
voted Thursday to send the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989
for consideration to the full Senate.
   ``This will be the toughest futures reform package adopted by
this committee in more than a decade,'' said Leahy, who introduced
this bill last month along with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the
committee's ranking Republican.
   The bill, introduced in the wake of a series of fraud and
racketeering indictments at the nation's two largest futures
exchanges, seeks to impose a number of reforms including tougher
standards on exchanges for the reconstruction of transactions,
known as the audit trail.
   Audit trails enable regulators to determine the timing and
sequences of trades as a guard against fraud.
   But amendments to the bill will give the CFTC authority to
exempt very small exchanges from the new standards.
   The bill also would expand the CFTC's authority to collect
service fees to fund its surveillance of trading floors. Another
amendment, however, placed a cap on the size of those fees.
   The bill does not restrict computer-driven program trading in
the financial markets.
   A similar bill already has been passed by the House.
   But Leahy released a letter he wrote the CFTC Oct. 17, asking
the agency to evaluate the cooperation and communication between
exchanges and regulators in the securities and futures markets
during the 190-point market drop on Friday the 13th.
   Leahy sought a preliminary report before the Congress completes
work on the reauthorization bill so ``if the CFTC finds reforms are
needed, I want to be able to implement them quickly.''

   The technical rally which has pushed London shares

makers once again marking prices higher after early signals of
buying interest.
   The markup also was inspired by a strong opening of the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange futures contract.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 20.4 points, or 0.95 percent, at 2,174.5.

   Economic sanctions have cost
South Africa 500,000 jobs and billions of dollars since 1985, a
leading economist says.
   The study released Thursday by Chris van Wyk, chief executive of
the Bankorp banking group, was described by financial writers as
the most definitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctions
on South Africa.
   The study said sanctions and disinvestment measures since 1985
had cost a cumulative 40 billion rand in foreign exchange,
resulting in production losses of about 80 billion rand and a total
spending loss of 100 billion rand.
   Based on the average value of the rand during the period, the
cumulative foreign exchange loss would total about $16 billion, the
total production loss about $32 billion, and the spending loss
about $45 billion.
   Despite the sanctions, South Africa's economy still is
considered the strongest and most diversified on the continent.
   Van Wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to what
South Africa would have experienced had the price of gold, its
major export, averaged $200 an ounce instead of $400 over the past
five years.
   Interest rates and inflation have been higher, the rand weaker,
wages lower, and growth, employment and spending levels much lower
than they would have been without sanctions, he said.
   About 80 percent of new job-seekers were blacks, van Wyk said.
   ``The harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them,'' he
said. ``A continuation of existing trade and financial sanctions
throughout the 1990s would render a million more black people
jobless and 2 million more financially destitute.''
   Sanctions had impaired South Africa's ability to reach its full
export potential and had ``radicalized many young blacks to the
left and many white voters to the right,'' Van Wyk said. ``The
moderate center has been weakened, making a political settlement
much more difficult.''
   But there had also been some positive spinoffs, he said.
``Economic considerations began to assume their rightful place in
government decision-making, along with ... commitment to concepts
such as tax reform and privatization.''
   Since 1985, several hundred foreign companies have pulled out of
South Africa, generally citing either financial concerns or
pressure from anti-apartheid groups.
   In the same period, most Western countries have imposed some
type of trade sanctions on South Africa, affecting exports of major
products such as coal and steel even though some new markets have
been found in the Far East.

   The stock market was mixed today in an equivocal
response to a stronger-than-expect report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.87 to 2,634.43 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 391 up, 531 down and
504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.50 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment increased by 233,000 in October as the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a gain of not
much more than 150,000.
   That came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial
world that the Federal Reserve might take the employment data as a
cue to relax its credit policy further.
   However, analysts noted that details of the report continued to
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Some
observers said the chances of easing by the Fed did not appear to
be drastically changed.
   Compaq Computer rose 1\ to 90], rebounding from a 16~-point
slide Thursday that followed the company's projection of

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .05 to 187.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .14 at 371.62.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.34
points to 2,631.56.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the

<HEAD>Coniston Partners Has UAL Stake, Will Seek Control of Board</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES throughout with UAL no comment, stock price, Coniston
background, history; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York buyout firm of Coniston Partners
disclosed today that it has accumulated a 9.7 percent stake in UAL
Corp. and plans to seek control of the airline company's board.
   Coniston, which played a crucial role two years ago in the
breakup of travel conglomerate Allegis Corp., the former owner of
United Airlines, has spent roughly $333 million in recent months
amassing 2.12 million UAL shares, said Coniston principal Paul E.
Tierney.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Coniston said it plans to solicit consents from shareholders to
reduce UAL's board from 16 to five members, three of whom would be
Coniston principals.
   With control of the board, Coniston would be able to steer the
company toward a sale, restructuring or recapitalization.
   ``We would like to see an extraordinary transaction of some kind
take place that would bring stability to the company and be fair to
the various constituencies,'' Tierney said in a telephone interview.
   United Airlines would have no comment on Coniston's stake,
spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said from UAL's Chicago offices.
   Tierney noted that while Coniston has not proposed acquiring
UAL, ``it doesn't preclude our participating in some kind of
transaction.''
   The takeover battle for UAL began in August when billionaire
Marvin Davis offered to acquire the company for $240 a share. UAL
later accepted a $300-a-share, $6.75 billion buyout proposal from
an employee-management group, but the deal collapsed last month
when the bidders were unable to secure financing.
   The announcement of the collapse of the UAL deal on Oct. 13
helped trigger a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
and turmoil in stock markets worldwide.
   Earlier this week, investor Saul Steinberg stepped into the fray
when he filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy up to 25
percent of UAL's stock.
   Tierney said that Coniston has been in touch with UAL's unions
but said it is too early to characterize the unions' position.
   UAL stock has swung wildly since the battle over the airline
began, reaching a high of $294 before collapsing. In early trading
on the New York Stock Exchange today, UAL had jumped $8 a share to
$181.
   ``The shareholders have been hammered in the last few months,''
Tierney acknowledged, ``but we would like to strike a transaction
that is good for employees _ both union and non-union.''
   In a statement, Coniston said its team of directors would seek
to provide job security and `` if desired, an opportunity for
equity ownership'' for employees.
   Coniston has reaped millions by buying into companies,
pressuring for changes and then walking away with cash. It waged a
bitter and unsuccessful proxy fight over Gillette Co., pressed for
the leveraged buyout of Storer Communications and participated in
the merger of Viacom International and National Amusements.
   Only once has the partnership, run by principals Tierney, Keith
R. Gollust and Augustus K. Oliver, actually acquired a company.
Earlier this year Coniston took over TW Services Inc. after a
bitter nine-month battle.
   But a cold reception in the junk bond market last week forced
Coniston to postpone the sale of some $1.15 billion in junk bonds
needed to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares
of TW, which is comprised of the fast-food Hardee's and Denny's
restaurants, among others.
   In 1987, Coniston reaped about $460 million when Allegis bought
back shares after agreeing to sell its Westin and Hilton
International hotel chains and Hertz car rental business.
   Coniston also endorsed the selection of Stephen Wolf as UAL
chairman and John Pope as chief financial officer, both of whom
would remain on the board if Coniston is successful in its plan to
take over.
   Tierney said that although Coniston has retained some ownership
of UAL stock over the past two and a half years, the team sold
virtually all of its position before the purchase by the pilots was
disclosed. Coniston's current stake was built up since then, he
said.
   ``We believe this is a great franchise,'' Tierney said of
United. ``It's an airline which has taken meaningful strides
forward in last few years. There's no intention here to break up
the company or sell it through liquidation. We want to see it grow
and stabilize.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in quiet activity early today on the Chicago Board of Trade
as traders looked for new signs of foreign demand.
   The Agriculture Department's rejection overnight of a Soviet bid
for 200,000 metric tons of soybean meal was a disappointment to the
market.
   But Spain was known to be seeking soybeans while Pakistan and
Mexico are expected to tender next week for large shipments of
wheat and corn, analysts said.
   Crop futures rose moderately Thursday amid speculation that the
Soviet Union and China were shopping for more U.S. grain.
   Analysts said Thursday's sharply higher prices for precious
metals and a weaker dollar also helped the grain markets.

<HEAD>Market `Vigilantes' Out in Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For all the stock market's seemingly manic
behavior lately, some analysts see a message behind its madness.
   Amid the controversies over program trading and corporate
takeovers, stock traders sometimes appear to have veered off on a
through-the-looking glass digression from what is taking place
elsewhere in the economy.
   But at the same time, close followers of the financial scene
say, the market has taken on an increasingly powerful role, not
just in reacting to economic trends and government policies, but
also in helping to determine them.
   Ever since the Crash of 1987, these analysts note, the Federal
Reserve has been forced to give a lot of weight to the state of the
stock market in setting its credit policies.
   Legislators, too, have effectively been put on notice that they
can't start changing rules _ for instance, on taxes, corporate
takeovers or foreign investment in this country _ without taking
into account how stock investors might react.
   The implicit penalty for a misstep on any of these matters is a
sudden drop in stock prices that threatens far-reaching trouble for
the domestic and world economies, not to mention for any
policymakers who wind up taking the blame.
   This ``vigilante'' effect first gained wide attention in the
bond market in the early 1980s.
   In the view of many analysts, the large, amorphous group of
people who invest in bonds became increasingly fearful that the
Federal Reserve wasn't doing enough to restrain inflation.
   So they collectively refused to bid for bonds until interest
rates reached levels that restrained the growth of credit.
   ``Their market actions encouraged, or some would say compelled,
central banks to tighten to slow economic growth and prevent any
inflation resurgence,'' said Robert Barbera, economist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Today, we contend, it is stock market reaction to too-tight
monetary policy that at times influences monetary policy and that
reduces somewhat the risk of global recession.
   ``Thus, in the second half of the 1980s, stock market vigilantes
have replaced the bond market vigilantes of the first half.''
   Analysts say this shift was clearly demonstrated in the
aftermath of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. The Fed, which had been
tightening credit before stocks crashed, abruptly began to supply
assurances of plentiful amounts of money.
   In addition, a bill that had been taking shape in Congress to
discourage some forms of takeover activity was shelved.
   Another severe selloff on Friday, Oct. 13, of this year once
again drew signals from the Fed that it would provide whatever
liquidity was necessary to stave off a market collapse.
   As time passes, ``the Fed continues to watch the stock market,''
said Darwin Beck, economist at First Boston Corp.
   All this naturally raises several issues: Who appointed bond and
stock traders to these positions of power? Can they be trusted to
use it wisely, or even responsibly? If they don't, to whom do they
have to account?
   The answer to any of those questions depends to a great extent
on the respondent's point of view.
   Defenders of the vigilantes say they are unlikely ever to engage
in any sort of conspiracy, given their sheer diversity and the fact
that they compete against each other for their livelihoods.
   Skeptics, on the other hand, can cite the history of the 1980s
as conclusive evidence of the susceptibility of unfettered markets
to abuse of many kinds.
   On one point, however, most observers agree. The modern
financial vigilante is a product of an era when many governments
around the world have promoted free markets as the best means of
making societies and economies work.
   The activities of the stock-market vigilantes now promise to be
studied in the future as a test of whether that premise is right.

<HEAD>College Savings Bond Program Provides Tax-Free Tuition Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting Jan. 1, parents can take advantage of a
savings bond program that will allow them to put away money for
their children's college education tax-free.
   The program involves the U.S. Treasury's Series EE savings
bonds, which have been around for years. The difference is that
federal tax on the bonds' interest will be forgiven if the proceeds
are used for tuition. Savings bonds always are exempt from state
and local taxes.
   The program is limited to residents at least 24 years old who
meet certain income requirements: married couples with adjusted
gross incomes of $60,000 a year and under, and single people with
incomes of $40,000 and under.
   For those with higher incomes, the tax-deductibility is reduced
according to a scale. Married couples with incomes of $90,000 and
over and singles with incomes of $55,000 or more cannot participate.
   The bonds may only be bought by parents for their children;
other relatives may not participate.
   Using savings bonds to put away money for college education has
long been popular, but the 1986 federal tax code revision made it
less advantageous.
   Before the tax law changes, parents typically would buy bonds in
their child's name and declare the interest as income on tax forms
filed for their children. This way, the child usually would pay no
tax since the interest income would be lower than the child's
minimum taxable income.
   However, the revised code taxes children under age 14 at their
parents' marginal tax rate instead of at the children's rate. That
eliminated some of the tax advantage.
   The new program should restore the popularity of savings bonds
for college tuition funding, said Stephen Meyerhardt, a spokesman
for the Treasury's savings bond program.
   He said the new program is simpler than the traditional way of
putting away college funds in bonds because there is no need to
file annual tax forms for the children.
   Instead, the bonds will be bought in the parents' names and
interest will only be declared when a bond is cashed in to pay for
tuition. He said the Internal Revenue Service is still working on
rules for how this interest will be excluded from taxation.
   Series EE Treasury bonds sell for half their face value. The
face value is paid at maturity. They can be bought for as little as
$25 and are sold at most banks and savings and loans.
   Meyerhardt said the Treasury has been deluged with inquiries
about the program. ``Obviously, the potential audience is huge,''
he said last week.
   While university officials generally praise the savings plan,
they say they wish it had been extended to grandparents and
students as well.
   Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, agreed there should be great
demand for the program.
   ``It's simple and it's uncomplicated,'' he said. ``This may very
well become an important savings program for just taking it out of
your monthly wages. People have bought EE bonds for years through
payroll deductions.''
   This is not the first college bond program. Several states have
marketed some of their normal state revenue bonds as tuition
savings bonds.
   These bonds, like Treasury bonds, are zero-coupon bonds, meaning
there is no annual interest payment, or ``coupon.'' That's why
they're sold at a discount, with their face amount paid at maturity.
   In Washington state, a $50 million initial offering quickly sold
out last year, said Edward Palmer, a first vice president at
Security Pacific Bank Washington, the lead manager for the bonds.
   Though a $200 million issue this year was not a sellout, Palmer
said the state and the bank consider the program ``extremely
successful.''
   ``You really feel like you're doing something for people,''
Palmer said.
   Among other states that have issued college savings bonds are
Illinois and North Carolina.

<HEAD>Ford Places Costly Bet on Jaguar</HEAD>

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to update with Ford agreement to buy Jaguar.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., the world's second-largest
automaker, is placing a costly bet that it can profitably
mass-produce Jaguars without spoiling the luxury car's main selling
point: its snob appeal.
   With its upper-class English image, Jaguar is to cars what
Burberry is to expensive raincoats, Asprey is to jewelry, and
Wedgwood to china.
   The exclusive brand name is what made money-losing Jaguar PLC
worth $2.5 billion to Ford in a friendly takeover deal announced
Thursday.
   The risk is that the 67-year-old British company will be
tarnished by Ford's down-market image, and that a Jaguar simply
will never be a Jaguar again.
   Jaguar will be wholly owned by Ford if Jaguar's shareholders
agree by a 75 percent majority at a special meeting late this
month. But Jaguar will be operated as a separate entity, both
companies stressed.
   Ford's offering price is more than double the market price of
Jaguar's shares in mid-September, before Ford first declared its
intention to buy a stake in the British company.
   No. 1 automaker General Motors Corp., which had been Jaguar's
preferred suitor, dropped out of the contest Thursday, saying
Jaguar wasn't worth the price. For nine months it had tried to work
out a friendly deal that would have given it a minority stake in
the British company.
   Jaguar wasn't a bargain, analysts agreed.
   ``Ford is paying quite a high price,'' said Stephen Reitman, an
auto analyst at the London investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew.
   Said Sanjay Dabysing, a motor industry analyst with the private
forecasting firm DRI Europe: ``It seems like a lot of money to pay
for a company that is making losses at the moment.''
   Ford is going to have to spend another billion dollars or more
on Jaguar to fulfill the American company's dream of expanding in
the faster-growing luxury end of the market.
   Analysts stressed the takeover is part of an expensive long-term
strategy that at best will not reap rewards for years to come.
   Ford apparently believes that buying Jaguar at this price is a
cheaper, faster and less risky approach than starting from scratch.
   This is not Ford's first foray into luxury cars.
   Ford acquired Britain's Aston Martin Lagonda two years ago. In
1986, it failed to obtain a stake in Italian car maker Alfa Romeo.
Last month it abandoned negotiations with Swedish car maker
Saab-Scania, and it also dropped plans to sell its German-built
Merkur luxury cars in the United States.
   Analysts expect Jaguar to post a loss for 1989 after a slim $45
million in profit last year, which came on revenue of $1.07 billion.
   Jaguar has suffered in recent years from a slump in U.S. luxury
car sales and the weak dollar. It depends on the United States for
a whopping 40 percent of its sales.
   For 18 months, Jaguar had searched high and low for financial
and technological support. But Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan was
looking for a minority partner because, he insisted, Jaguar's
independence was crucial to its success.
   ``Our desire has always been to keep our destiny firmly in our
own hands,'' Egan said last month.
   But Jaguar's stock soared on speculation of a takeover contest
between the rival American auto makers.
   ``It became increasingly difficult to see how a partial deal
would succeed,'' Egan said at a Thursday news conference.
   Jaguar was compelled to recommend Ford's offer to its
shareholders because the U.S. automaker offered a good price and
made assurances that Jaguar would operate separately, Egan said.
   Ford probably will seek ultimately to multiply Jaguar's annual
production tenfold to half a million cars from the current 50,000
and add cheaper models to compete with West German luxury auto
maker BMW's line, and with the emerging Japanese luxury models,
analysts said.
   The cheapest Jaguar now costs $37,900. Its narrow product range
is made up of XJ6 and Series III sedans, XJS sports cars and
limousines a year.
   Lindsey Halstead, the chairman of Ford of Europe, said at the
news conference he believed Jaguar's product range could be
expanded in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.
   Specifics were still to be worked out, Halstead said, but Ford
was prepared to invest whatever was necessary in Jaguar. It also
would provide technological support, he said.
   Egan said, ``We will look at areas where we can make the biggest
and earliest gains.''
   The distinctive Jaguars still will be produced in Britain, by
Jaguar's 12,500 workers at four expanding plants. Headquarters will
be maintained in Coventry, 95 miles northwest of London.
   Jaguar's dealer network will be maintained. Jaguar will continue
to have a separate board of directors, including Ford directors,
who will have ``sole discretion in the application of the Jaguar
marque,'' or brand name, the companies said.
   The analyst Reitman said: ``They have to keep Jaguar at an arm's
length so that Jaguar is not too closely associated in the
customer's eyes with being just another Ford. Jaguar is very
unique, the cachet that is attached to the thing is very strong.''
   The tough and proud Egan will stay on at the company, for the
time being.
   The Jaguar chairman was knighted three years ago for his
successful turnaround of Jaguar during the 1980s from an ailing
state-owned automaker to a flourishing modern British company
hailed as a jewel of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's huge
privatization drive.
   Referring to his new boss Halstead, Egan joked at the news
conference: ``I've persuaded him to stop calling me `sir.' ''

<TEXT>
   With a boost from Saudi Arabia, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pushed oil production
in October well over its target to the highest level all year,
according to estimates released Friday.
   The surge in production came as key players staked out
bargaining positions in advance of a crucial meeting later this
month, analysts said.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that the cartel's output soared last month to 22.9 million
barrels a day, about 500,000 barrels more than in the previous
month.
   But some analysts put the figure even higher. OPEC's daily
target is 20.5 million barrels a day for the last quarter of 1989.
   ``The main OPEC production increase was registered in Saudi
Arabia where crude oil production rose to 5.3 million barrels a day
in October,'' said the report. Saudi Arabia's quota is about 5
million barrels a day.
   ``They've got the pedal to the metal,'' said Peter Gignoux,
international energy director at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London,
who believes the Saudis produced 5.6 million barrels a day or more.
   The Saudis, he said, are ``setting another bargaining chip on
the table for this month's meeting.''
   Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil newsletter, also puts Saudi
production at 5.6 million barrels a day and total OPEC output at
23.2 million barrels in the first half of October.
   ``There is now a real risk that the current strength of oil
prices could give way to a gradual slide over coming weeks,'' it
said. ``Although oil demand remains firm, it is insufficient to
absorb the high supply.''
   Oil prices have been fairly steady, although they remain under
the cartel's target of $18 a barrel. A basket of seven crudes
monitored by OPEC averaged $17.43 a barrel in late October.
   Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
have remained in the $19 to $20-a-barrel range in the last two
months. WTI normally is priced about $2 higher than the OPEC basket.
   Soaring demand by developing countries has helped soak up OPEC's
excess, but many analysts agree that prices could suffer if
production is not reined in soon.
   Demand for OPEC's oil in the first half of 1990 was estimated by
the energy agency at just under 21 million barrels a day.
Consumption by the United States, still the world's largest
consumer of oil, and other industrial nations is expected to shrink
in coming months due partly to seasonal factors.
   OPEC's oil ministers are scheduled to meet on Nov. 25 in Vienna,
Austria, to map strategy for the coming year. An eight-member
monitoring panel is due to gather a few days earlier.
   At the top of their agenda will be new production caps for the
first half of 1990.
   The ministers will have to weigh demand and prices before
deciding an overall supply target and then divvying up the sum
among the 13 nations.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been cheating on their
quotas in recent months to press their demands for a larger share
of the output total.
   At a September meeting in Geneva, the ministers agreed to lift
their production ceiling from 19.5 million barrels a day to 20.5
million barrels in the October-December period.
   They also discussed _ and will do so again at the upcoming
meeting _ an Iranian plan for passing out new production shares.
   The proposal called for raising the overall output cap to 21.5
million barrels a day to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates. Gabon and Ecuador also would get more.
   The shares of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Libya would stay the same.
Iran and Iraq would lose a little, and Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesia
and Venezuela would lose more.
   The agency is an arm of the 24-nation Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange finished
moderately higher Friday, boosted largely by technical factors
affecting the availability of selected blue-chip stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 19.0
points, or 0.88 percent, higher at 2,173.1 after it drifted off a
session high of 2,175.1 when early Wall Street activity became
extremely choppy.
   The key index had been strong during most of the session,
rebounding from a low of 2,152.9.
   Dealers noted that the index has shown some resilience since the
resignation last week of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson,
gaining 4.4 percent from last Friday's close of 2,082.1. Last
Friday's session was the first after Lawson's unexpected departure.
   Tight availabilities of blue chips, particularly those with
strong overseas earnings and proven returns, helped bolster the
index throughout the day. A relatively steady British pound also
helped keep the London market on a firmer footing, dealers added.
   The so-called squeeze in blue-chip shares has been a key factor
in the market throughout the week and underscores its reluctance to
deal outside traditionally recession-proof stocks, dealers said.
   The FT 30-share index closed 15.1 points higher at 1,746.4.
Volume was 377.0 million shares traded, little better than
Thursday's thin 352.8 million shares.
   The FT-500 index closed 8.37 points higher at 1,203.46.

   The stock market made little progress today in a
muted response to a stronger-than-expect report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.87 to 2,634.43 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 638 up, 687 down and 566
unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment increased by 233,000 in October as the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a gain of not
much more than 150,000.
   That came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial
world that the Federal Reserve might take the employment data as a
cue to relax its credit policy further.
   However, analysts noted that details of the report continued to
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Some
observers said the chances of easing by the Fed did not appear to
be drastically changed.
   UAL jumped 10 to 183. An investor group known as Condor Partners
said it had acquired a 9.7 percent interest in UAL and would seek
to gain control of the board of directors.
   UAL shares fell sharply last month after a labor-management
group couldn't get financing for a buyout it planned.
   Compaq Computer was unchanged at 89[ in active trading after
taking a 16~-point drop Thursday on the company's projection of
disappointing profits for the fourth quarter.
   Telerate gained 1\ to 20}. Dow Jones &amp; Co., which owns about
two-thirds of Telerate, reached an agreement to buy the rest for a
sweetened price of $21 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .08 to 187.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .04 at 371.44.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.47 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Unemployment held steady at 5.3 percent last
month as the economy added 233,000 jobs, the government said today
in a report that showed continued troubles in the industrial sector.
   The Labor Department said all of the non-farm payroll growth
came in the service-producing sector, with most of that coming as
schools and local governments continued to add jobs for the school
year.
   The department revised September payroll growth downward to
201,000 from the previously reported 209,000.
   The manufacturing sector, which lost a revised 88,000 jobs in
September, lost an additional 13,000 in October to post its fourth
consecutive monthly decline.
   Underscoring the weakness in that sector was new data showing
the average manufacturing workweek fell from 41.8 hours to 40.8
hours and overtime was virtually non-existent after averaging just
under four hours a week for several months. The automobile
manufacturing industry continued to struggle, losing 14,000 jobs
last month.
   The 233,000 jobs added to non-farm payrolls was more than most
analysts had predicted and likely will give pause to Federal
Reserve policymakers who had been seen as leaning toward a further
easing of credit, which in turn would lower interest rates.
   Analysts said the report showed the economy continued to expand,
although at a far slower pace than last year, and that the growth
was strong enough to prevent a further easing of credit by the
Federal Reserve. The Fed policymakers meet Nov. 14 to discuss
monetary policy.
   ``The economy is clearly slowing down but once again there's no
recession in these numbers,'' said Micheal Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting firm. ``There is, however, continued sign of
accelerating wages and the Fed is worried about that, so they
couldn't possibly ease as a result of this report.''
   The Labor Department determines unemployment through a household
survey and its job-growth totals through a separate business
survey. The two surveys often give conflicting data on employment
growth and today the department said it had determined why _ more
Americans are holding two or more jobs.
   ``Most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in the
business survey but are counted only once in the household
survey,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet Norwood said in
testimony she was giving Congress today. ``With the demand for
labor strengthening considerably in recent years, increasing
numbers of workers have taken on secnd jobs.''
   Also up at a rate higher than predictions were average hourly
earnings, which rose 0.7 percent in October, a sign that upward
pressure on wages persists. Most analysts had predicted an increase
of 0.4 percent.
   The October report showed that the civilian labor force grew by
65,000 Americans last month to 124 million and that 117.5 million
of them had jobs. The labor force consists of those who either have
jobs or are actively seeking work.
   While the manufacturing workweek declined, the overall workweek
in the private, non-farm sector edged up by 0.1 hour in October to
a seasonally adjusted 34.8 hours. The department attributed most of
the decline in manufacturing hours to the strike by Boeing workers.
They were not counted as being off payrolls, however, because their
strike began the same week the department took its monthly survey.
   While local government payrolls expanded because of the school
year, job growth in the health-services sector continued its steady
growth, adding 33,000 jobs in October. Job growth in business
services was just 1,000; employment in finance, insurance and real
estate was flat or up just slightly.
   Retail trade added 24,000 jobs last month while transportation
and public utilities added 27,000 jobs in October and wholesale
trade 6,000.
   But in manufacturing and other goods-producing industries the
news was less encouraging.
   Mining and construction posted modest gains, as did the
non-durable manufacturing sector. But the declining payrolls in
auto plants and electrical and metal plants continued.
   The unemployment rates among demographic groups changed
somewhat, with joblessness among white adult men falling from 4.8
percent to 4.5 percent and rising among white adult women rising
from 4.5 percent to 4.7 percent.
   Overall teen-age unemployment fell from 15.1 to 14.9 percent, a
figure influenced by the start of school.
   Among black adult men, unemployment rose from 10 percent to 10.3
percent. Joblessness among black adult women also rose, from 9.6
percent to 10 percent.
   Unemployment among black teens fell from 37.3 percent to 34.2
percent and among Hispanics the rate dropped from 8.3 percent to
7.9 percent.

   Unemployment held steady at 5.3 percent last
month as the economy added 233,000 jobs, the government said Friday
in a report that stifled talk of an imminent drop in interest rates.
   The surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter _
which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline in
manufacturing _ was largely attributed to continued local
government hiring for the school year.
   Automobile manufacturing led the overall decline in the
industrial sector.
   Analysts interpreted the data as proof no recession would come
this year although some said the economy would flirt with one early
next year if the manufacturing slump spills over into related
services industries.
   And they said the unexpected job growth and fresh evidence of
persistent wage inflation would keep the Federal Reserve
immediately from easing its hold on credit, which in turn would
have triggered lower interest rates for consumers.
   The Labor Department said average hourly earnings rose 0.7
percent in October. Most analysts had anticipated job-growth of
about 150,000 and a 0.4 percent boost in hourly earnings.
   ``The Fed will be in a no-change stance at least until the next
unemployment report,'' said Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic
Advisers. Others said it might relax its hold on credit when its
policy-makers meet next week, when the government will have issued
new inflation data.
   ``The economy is clearly slowing down but once again there's no
recession in these numbers,'' said Micheal Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting firm. ``There is, however, continued sign of
accelerating wages and the Fed is worried about that, so they
couldn't possibly ease as a result of this report.''
   Initial reaction in financial markets to the
stronger-than-expected report was muted; both the stock and bond
markets were little changed.
   The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent as the
civilian labor force grew by 65,000 Americans last month to 124
million and the number of them who had jobs rose to 117.5 million.
   Virtually all of the growth came in services.
   Local governments added 96,000 jobs, most of which the Labor
Department said were school-related, and state governments added
10,000 more.
   The booming health-services sector grew by 33,000 jobs last
month, while employment in business services, finance and real
estate was up slightly or flat.
   Retail trade added 24,000 jobs, transportation and public
utilities 27,000 and wholesale trade 6,000.
   The goods-producing sector reported an overall drop of 3,000
jobs, a decline that would have been worse had not modest gains in
mining and construction offset the 13,000 drop in manufacturing
employment. That followed a revised drop of 88,000 factory jobs in
September.
   The durable-goods sector of manufacturing has lost more than
150,000 jobs in the last five months.
   Layoffs in automobile manufacturing, which lost 14,000 jobs last
month and 29,000 in September, are fueling the decline. That
sector's slump appears likely to continue; Chrysler announced major
layoffs Friday.
   Underscoring manufacturing's weakness, the department said the
average factory workweek fell from 41.1 hours to 40.8 hours and
overtime was virtually non-existent after averaging just under four
hours a week for several months.
   The department said some of that decline was because of the
Machinists strike against Boeing Corp.
   ``We have a two-headed economy,'' said Sinai. ``Manufacturing is
in a recession but the service side is OK so the overall economy
can keep growing, so long as the service strength holds up.''
   The department said unemployment rates among major demographic
groups were:
   _Adult white men, 4.5 percent, down from 4.8 percent in
September.
   _Adult white women, 4.7 percent, up from 4.5 percent.
   _Black adult men, 10.3 percent, up from 10 percent.
   _Black adult women, 10 percent, up from 9.6 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.9 percent, down from 8.3 percent.
   _All teen-agers, 14.9 percent, down from 15.1 percent.
   _Black teens, 34.2 percent, down from 37.3 percent.
   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of
the armed services stationed in the United States was also
unchanged, at 5.2 percent.
   The Labor Department uses a monthly survey of businesses to
determine the payroll numbers while the unemployment rate is taken
from a separate household survey. The two surveys often give
conflicting data on employment growth and Friday the department
said it had confirmed its suspicion that the discrepancy occurs
because more Americans are holding two or more jobs.
   ``Most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in the
business survey but are counted only once in the household
survey,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet Norwood told
Congress. ``With demand for labor strengthening in recent years,
increasing numbers of workers have taken on second jobs.''

<HEAD>Program Trading Still Haunts the Stock Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A host of Wall Street investment houses have
stepped away from index arbitrage, but program trading detractors
say other, perhaps even more insidious trading strategies still
haunt the stock market.
   Designed to reduce risk and capable of moving massive numbers of
shares with the flick of a computer key, trading techniques with
militaristic names like ``tactical asset allocation'' are being
used and, some say, could trigger rampant volatility.
   Some $40 billion was invested in asset allocation strategies
eight months ago, according to estimates by the House subcommittee
on telecommunications and finance. And because the amount is
growing rapidly, asset allocation has captured the concern of
politicians and stock exchange officials alike.
   Pension and mutual funds have come to embrace the strategy,
which in its simplest form divides money among stocks, bonds and
cash. The most complex form of asset allocation expands to include
futures as well as foreign stocks and bonds.
   Using computer models that evaluate the fundamentals of each
market, money managers shift assets among the various asset
classes. If the stock market appears attractive, for example, money
managers might sell bonds to buy stocks.
   It is the rapid movement of large sums of money that can spook
the markets.
   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan on Friday voiced
his concern over asset allocation this way: ``The problem ... is
when you've got everybody following the same formula, it's like
everybody deciding to take a drive in the country on a nice day,
and you can't move because of the traffic on the roads.''
   On the political front, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman
of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, has asked the
stock exchange to examine tactical asset allocation as part of its
study of market volatility.
   ``It has potentially the same or even greater negative effect
than portfolio insurance had in 1987,'' he said, referring to a
strategy in which sophisticated investors sell options or futures
against the underlying stock in a portfolio in attempts to offset
price declines and enhance price increases.
   Portfolio insurance was drastically curtailed following the
Black Monday stock market crash two years ago.
   While acknowledging that asset allocators moving funds in the
same direction can have ``a snowballing effect'' on the market,
Jack Barbanel noted that the strategy relies on the basically sound
theory of ``not putting all of your eggs in the same basket.''
   Barbanel, president of the Princeton, N.J.-based First Global
Asset Management Inc., said he thinks the concern is overdone.
``It's the wisest thing to do.''
   While the asset allocation concept has been around for some
time, most money managers did not rely on it until after the 1987
crash, when they took a beating because they had too much money
invested in the stock market.
   In addition, pension funds typically had separate money managers
handling investments in the various markets. Barbanel said it is
only recently that money managers have developed the expertise to
work across the various markets. Yet critics are frightened by the
sheer amount of money involved.
   ``The danger is the more people who get involved in this
strategy, there's a rush to do it first,'' said a staff attorney
for Markey's committee. ``If interest rates move, you have the same
phenomenon of people rushing, firing off waves of selling, and the
market doesn't have the liquidity to sustain massive waves of
selling.''
   The attorney noted that at any given point index arbitrage, the
practice that involved buying or selling stocks with opposite,
offsetting trades in the futures market, involves no more than $10
billion to $15 billion, a fraction of the amount of money devoted
to asset allocation.
   Because of public outcry over index arbitrage's role in the
stock market's roller-coaster performance this fall, several major
investment houses suspended the practice, and the NYSE agreed to
limit computerized program trading in times of sharp market
declines.
   But just as index arbitrage has been blamed by some for helping
drive the market down at times, asset allocation recently was
credited with giving stock prices a boost.
   According to Barron's weekly financial newspaper, the move out
of bonds and into stocks by the Cincinnati money management firm
Renaissance Investment Management Inc. on Oct. 16 helped the Dow
Jones industrial average recoup nearly all the 190 points it shed
the previous Friday.
   The buying spree was dictated by the firm's asset allocation
model. It was rumored, according to Barron's, that Renaissance went
100 percent into stocks, buying some 44 million shares.
   ``It can save the day,'' said the House attorney. ``But what is
it going to do if it goes the other way?''

<HEAD>Outfit Whose Deal for MGM Collapsed Misses Key Payment in Land Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANA POINT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Qintex Australia Ltd. missed a payment
on land it had optioned for a major resort, 3{ weeks after its bid
for MGM-UA Communications Co. collapsed and two weeks after a U.S.
affiliate filed for protection from creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws.
   In missing the payment Thursday, the Australian resort and
entertainment conglomerate surrendered the right to buy 115 acres
known as the Strand and Headlands, among the last undeveloped major
sites on the Southern California coast.
   Qintex, which is in the middle of a major restructuring designed
to raise money, had said in July that it would build a $1 billion
resort on the property, owned by the Chandler Family Trust in this
small town in southern Orange County.
   The series of problems has prompted speculation by Wall Street
specialists that all Qintex's enterprises are on shaky footing.
   ``Skase's empire is a collapsing house of cards,'' Greg
Kieselmann, an analyst with L.H. Friend in Los Angeles, said
recently.
   Kieselmann had been one of those who credited Skase with the
financial clout to pull off the $1.4 billion purchase of MGM-UA,
which collapsed Oct. 10 when Qintex could not arrange financing.
   On Oct. 19, Los Angeles-based Qintex Entertainment Inc., a
television production and distribution company that is 43 percent
owned by Qintex Australia, filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.
   Qintex Entertainment's chief financial officer, John Lloyd, said
Qintex Australia had been ``unable or unwilling'' to help the
American company make an overdue $5.9 million payment that could
have triggered a landslide of further demands from creditors.
   Qintex Australia already had purchased a 170-acre Monarch Beach
parcel less than a mile north of the Strand and Headlands for $131
million from Hawaiian developer Chris Hemmeter.
   In a three-sentence news release Thursday, Qintex emphasized
that it would continue to own Monarch Beach and operate the Tennis
Club and Links golf course there. It did not mention the resort
project.
   Ross Palmer, a spokesman for Qintex in Los Angeles, said the
reference to the Monarch Beach parcel most likely was made to allay
fears that the other deal also would fall apart.
   On Oct. 23, Qintex Australia's chairman, Christopher Skase,
announced a major restructuring and a stepped-up plan to sell
assets. The strategy was designed to generate more than 600 million
Australian dollars in cash, reduce interest costs and eliminate
other financial liabilities, he said.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
muted response to a stronger-than-expect report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 1.03 to 2,630.53
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 612 up, 747 down and
553 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment increased by 233,000 in October as the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a gain of not
much more than 150,000.
   That came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial
world that the Federal Reserve might take the employment data as a
cue to relax its credit policy further.
   However, analysts noted that details of the report continued to
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Some
observers said the chances of easing by the Fed did not appear to
be drastically changed.
   UAL jumped 11 to 184. An investor group known as Condor Partners
said it had acquired a 9.7 percent interest in UAL and would seek

<HEAD>Ford Could Close Jaguar Deal by Year's End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. could complete its $2.5
billion acquisition of the British luxury car maker Jaguar by the
end of the year, the head of Ford's European arm said Friday.
   L. Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe Inc., said in a
video news conference from Britain that a Jaguar shareholders
meeting could be called by the end of this month. The transaction
could be completed within days after that if shareholders approved
the deal.
   Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker after General Motors Corp.,
announced Thursday its agreement to buy Jaguar, which has suffered
from declining earnings due to dropping sales in its important U.S.
market.
   The buyout must win approval from 75 percent of Jaguar's 182
million outstanding shares, which will vote whether to lift a
restriction barring anyone from owning more than 15 percent of
Jaguar. Ford owns a 13.2 percent stake in Jaguar.
   Halstead and Ford spokesman Bert Serre said financing for the
deal was undetermined. Technically, Ford could pay for Jaguar out
of its $5.8 billion in cash reserves, but that seemed unlikely for
tax reasons, analysts have said.
   Shortly after the announcement Thursday, Standard &amp; Poors put
some of Ford's securities on its CreditWatch negative list _ a
possible prelude to a slight downgrading of their credit ratings _
citing concern about the frenzied pace of Ford's acquisitions in
the face of a softening U.S. car market.
   Recent acquisitions have included last month's $3.35 billion
purchase of The Associates Corp. financial company from Paramount
Communications Inc.
   Because of the pending shareholders' vote, Halstead declined to
answer specific questions about how Jaguar production would be
affected by a possible merger with Ford. Shared components may be
the most likely place a consumer would notice the partnership.
   However, he said, ``We are looking for an opportunity to expand
volume substantially. One of the first items on the agenda is
defining how that will proceed.''
   Jaguar's factory in Coventry, England, makes about 50,000 cars
annually and can produce up to 80,000.
   There has been speculation that if Jaguar came up with a totally
new model under Ford ownership, the car would be priced near or
below the current Jaguar XJ6 four-door sedan, which has a base
price of $39,700.
   Ford's most expensive car is the Lincoln Town Car Cartier with a
base price of $33,364.
   Halstead turned aside a suggestion that with the Jaguar
acquisition, Lincoln no longer would be the company's luxury car
division. He said the character of the two cars, with Jaguar being
more of a performance vehicle than Lincoln, would keep them
separate.
   ``I don't ever expect to see Ford cars in Jaguar showrooms and
no Jaguars in Ford showrooms,'' Halstead said.
   Ford recently stopped importing the West German-made Merkur,
which was sold through the company's Lincoln-Mercury dealerships.
   There are about 140 Jaguar dealerships in the United States.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At an inner-city Baltimore intersection, six
billboards carrying alcohol and tobacco advertisements perch atop
store roofs.
   In one, an attractive black woman holds a giant ice cube to her
neck above an inscription that reads ``Salem _ The Refreshest.''
   On an adjacent sign, a handsome black man reaches for a striking
black woman with one hand and holds a can of Colt 45 malt liquor
with the other. ``Grab hold,'' the caption says. ``It's
power-brewed.''
   But the days of many of the billboards, located largely in
Baltimore's black neighborhoods, are numbered.
   Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke said last Monday that Boisclair
Advertising, a firm that owns many of the billboards, has agreed to
take down 450 of the signs by next summer.
   The mayor said the company also agreed to cut back the number of
billboards advertising tobacco and alcohol to no more than 10
percent of all the city's billboards.
   ``We don't want to be the city that reads whisky bottles,'' said
Schmoke, who has placed nearly 50 billboards around the city
proclaiming it as ``The City That Reads.''
   A study by the Abell Foundation showed that of 2,015 billboards
surveyed in Baltimore, about 70 percent were located in poor,
inner-city neighborhoods. Of those billboards, 76 percent were
advertising liquor and cigarettes.
   The statistics are not unique to Baltimore. Faced with slowing
consumption and declining sales, alcohol and tobacco industries
have been concentrating their billboard advertising in poorer urban
areas, many of them predominantly black.
   Now health officials, office holders, neighborhood groups and
consumer advocates are objecting, alarmed by the numbers of people
in those communities dying from smoking- and drinking-related
diseases.
   Industry representatives dismiss the charges. ``It must be silly
season again if those people are making emotional, hysterical
comments about beer advertising,'' said Jim Sanders, president of
the Beer Institute in Washington.
   However, a 1987 study by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a Washington health advocacy group, found that black men
have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver
than whites.
   The lung cancer rate has increased four times faster among
blacks than among whites in the past 30 years, according to reports
from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer
Institute.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., recently introduced legislation to
prohibit additional billboards on highways built with federal money.
   ``The control of billboards is an environmental and public
health issue,'' he said.
   ``This marketing strategy is outrageous and immoral,'' said
Harold P. Freeman, director of surgery at Harlem Hospital in New
York and national president of the American Cancer Society. ``The
cigarette industry just wants to make money because they know that
poor and uneducated people are their main customers. And black
people are disproportionately poor and uneducated.''
   According to the federal Department of Health and Human
Services, 40.6 percent of black men age 20 or older smoke, compared
with 31.8 percent of white men; 31.8 percent of black women smoke,
compared with 28.3 percent of white women.
   Tobacco companies say people who see their billboards can make
their own decisions about whether to light up.
   ``To suggest that somehow minorities ... are more susceptible to
our ads is horrible,'' said Steve Weiss, a spokesman for Philip
Morris Companies Inc. ``That argument is at best reprehensible and
at worst, racist. We advertise our cigarettes to anyone who smokes,
regardless of race or background. Adults who smoke in this country
are making an informed choice.''
   The Beer Institute's Sanders suggested that if the numbers of
beer ads in minority neighborhoods looked disproportionate, it was
because other industries do not advertise in such neighborhoods
with equal fervor.
   ``The beer industry was one of the first industries to respond
to calls by blacks to use black models when advertising in their
neighborhoods,'' Sanders said.
   Surveys across the country show black communities have much more
tobacco and alcohol advertising than white one.
   A survey this year by the Detroit Free Press found that
advertisements for cigarettes and alcohol accounted for nearly 43
percent of Detroit's inner-city billboards but only 25 percent of
billboards on the outskirts of the city.
   In St. Louis, more than 62 percent of billboards in black
neighborhoods advertisted cigarettes and alcohol. In white
neighborhoods, it was 36 percent. The 1987 survey prompted the city
council to ban the construction of new billboards.
   In the United States as a whole, consumption of tobacco, liquor
and wine is on the decline.
   According to Impact magazine, a trade publication for the
alcoholic beverage industry, consumption of liquor and wine fell 9
percent from 1980 to 1987, from 931 million gallons to 847 million
gallons.
   Cigarette consumption dropped 11 percent between 1980 and 1988,
to 562.5 billion cigarettes from 631.5 billion, according to the
Department of Agriculture.
   The decline is not for lack of trying on the advertisers' part.
Combined contracts from the alcohol and tobacco industries
accounted for 33.2 percent of outdoor advertising contracts in
1988, or $471.5 million, according to the Institute of Outdoor
Advertising.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise On Export Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose moderately Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting expectations for new export
sales of the grain.
   Corn and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in a day of
lackluster trading.
   Expectations are running high that the Agriculture Department
will soon offer U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices. The
Soviet Union is also rumored to be shopping for wheat.
   ``That kind of talk kept the wheat market bubbling around and
well supported,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The USDA's rejection overnight of a Soviet bid for 200,000
metric tons of soybean meal was a disappointment to the market. But
Spain was known to be seeking soybeans while Pakistan and Mexico
are expected to tender next week for large shipments of wheat and
corn, analysts said.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 4 cents
higher with December at $4.05{ a bushel; corn futures were 1 cent
lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.39{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to \ cent higher with December at $1.45{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with November at

<HEAD>Officials Announce More Vigorous Antitrust Enforcement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, saying it wants
to protect consumers by ensuring competition among businesses,
announced Friday it would toughen enforcement of federal antitrust
laws.
   As part of the administration's antitrust policy, officials will
pursue stiffer penalties for violators, will give more scrutiny to
business mergers and will expand efforts to see where companies
threaten to form cartels.
   ``The Federal Trade Commission is committed to promoting
consumer welfare, and where we can't, we will exercise the
appropriate self-restraint,'' said Janet Steiger, chairwoman of the
federal agency.
   ``But self-restraint is not a euphemism for comatose,'' she said.
   Ms. Steiger and James Rill, assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, presented their
views to a group of lawyers attending a conference at Harvard Law
School.
   Their speeches marked the first time the Bush administration has
outlined its antitrust policy to the public.
   Rill pointed to the health care and airline industries, in
particular, as areas that will receive more attention from the
antitrust division.
   ``The fact is that antitrust is critical to the well-being of
the American economy, and plays a vital role in the governing
process,'' Rill said. ``Policies may evolve ... but the voice of
competition cannot be quieted.''
   The Reagan administration _ which espoused free-market economic
and business policies _ was widely considered lax in enforcing
federal antitrust law, a stance critics say was a key factor in the
merger mania of the 1980s.
   ``Some might suggest that where government once bared its teeth
to business, it now buries its head in sand,'' Ms. Steiger said.
   While she said some of the criticism has been unjust, she also
said her agency will be increasingly vigilant in assessing proposed
mergers.
   ``I have no empirical evidence to suggest that the FTC is
bypassing good merger cases,'' Ms. Steiger said. ``Nevertheless, I
do not close the door on the possibility that the FTC may have been
overly cautious in its case selection efforts, and I think it
behooves us constantly to reassess our techniques and methods of
analysis.''
   Ms. Steiger said her agency would give special attention to
mergers within industries where a small number of companies control
a large part of the market.
   Also, the FTC plans to expand enforcement in non-merger
activities. This includes investigating whether trade associations
hurt competition by acting as cartels, and looking at ways
companies might try to force their rivals out of business, she said.
   Rill said the Justice Department would take similar measures.
   ``While I have no intention of a major revision of the (merger)
guidelines, I want to know if, in practice, the division's merger
standards are conducive to consistent and reliable results,'' he
said.
   A key part in the antitrust agenda will be supporting tougher
criminal penalties.
   Rill noted that antitrust fines cannot exceed $1 million for
corporate violators, but he supports proposed legislation that
would raise the maximum to $10 million.
   ``The current statutory maximum fines do not present a
sufficient deterrent to antitrust crime,'' he said.
   Rill also said no industries will be exempt from criminal
enforcement, and he singled out health care providers.
   ``Health care providers have always been subject to antitrust
jurisdiction and investigation, but they have rarely been
prosecuted,'' he said. ``This has led to a complacency within the
profession that cannot be permitted to persist.''
   ``It is critical that health care professionals conduct
themselves in a manner that allows maximum competition within the
industry,'' Rill said.
   The Justice Department also will pay increased attention to
recently deregulated industries, such as airlines, Rill said.
   Under new federal rules, airlines have become subject to
essentially the same antitrust laws that govern other industries,
he said.
   Rill said his office has already taken an active stance toward
proposed ventures between airline companies and, in some cases, the
plans were dropped. As an example, he noted that the Justice
Department opposed plans by Eastern Airlines to sell airport gates
in Philadelphia to USAir Group Inc., and consequently Eastern
abandoned the plan and sold the gates to Midway Airlines.

<TEXT>
   Combined sales of domestically built cars and
light trucks by the nation's Big Three automakers fell 5.9 percent
in late October compared with last year, a fall not nearly as steep
as earlier in the month, the companies said Friday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 32,302
during the Oct. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of
34,334 during the same time last year.
   Late-October car sales were 6.6 percent lower than last year and
light truck sales were down 4.89 percent.
   The companies' vehicle sales between Oct. 1, when the 1990 model
year technically started, and Oct. 31, ran 14.1 percent behind last
year's pace.
   An October decline had been anticipated, and there was
widespread speculation during the summer that much of the sales
slide would come from customers who had planned to buy cars in
October but instead bought their vehicles earlier to avoid
1990-model price increases.
   Also, incentives continued in October, but not at the same level
as during the two previous months.
   Through the first 10 months of this year, car and truck sales by
the Big Three averaged 34,867 a day, 3.9 percent lower than the
daily rate of 36,265 during the same period last year. Car sales
were down 5.6 percent and truck sales were off 0.7 percent.
   Ford's car sales suffered the most in late October, falling 11.9
percent from last year. Light truck sales during the period at Ford
ran 6.9 lower than last year's level. For the first 10 months,
Ford's car sales were 1 percent lower than during the same time
last year and light truck sales were off 2.9 percent.
   Chrysler said its late-October car sales were down 6.5 percent
compared with last year while truck sales were up 4.2 percent.
Chrysler's year-to-date car sales were down 11.3 percent, the
largest of the Big Three, and the company's light truck sales for
the year were off 0.3 percent compared with the first 10 months of
last year.
   GM said its car sales were down 3.1 percent during the period
and truck sales fell 8.2 percent. For the year, GM's car sales were
down 6.7 percent and truck sales were up 1 percent.

<HEAD>Lodestar Proposes Buyout of Kinder-Care Learning Centers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment banking firm on
Friday acquired a majority stake in Kinder-Care Learning Centers
Inc. and said it has offered to buy out the nation's largest
day-care center operator.
   In a proposal made Thursday, Lodestar Group offered $6 per
share, or $114 million, for the Kinder-Care Learning Centers stock
it didn't already own.
   The total cost of acquiring Kinder-Care Learning Centers would
come to $273 million after adding the $159 million Lodestar already
spent to amass 63 percent of the company's outstanding common stock.
   The company's board of directors will hold its regular meeting
Wednesday and could consider the Lodestar offer at that time, said
Sharon Rives, director of investor relations for Kinder-Care
Learning Centers.
   Two Lodestar executives, Ken Miller and Tull Gearreald, are
expected to be given seats on the board at next week's meeting.
Miller is the investment banking firm's president and chief
executive officer, and Gearreald is Lodestar's vice chairman.
   Ms. Rives said Lodestar began buying stock in the day-care
company after it was spun off from Kinder-Care Inc. of Montgomery
in a corporate restructuring in May.
   Prior to the restructuring, she said, Kinder-Care Inc. owned 87
percent of the common stock in the learning centers.
   ``Kinder-Care decided to liquidate its interest in the learning
centers so the two companies could go their separate ways,'' Ms.
Rives said.
   Lodestar, as part of the corporate restructuring, was allowed to
purchase all outstanding stock in Kinder-Care Learning Centers that
was not bought by Kinder-Care Inc. stockholders.
   The investment banking firm on Friday obtained more than 26
million shares of outstanding stock, bringing its holding in the
company to 63 percent of the common stock outstanding.
   However, Lodestar will need the board's approval to purchase
additional stock. If the offer is approved, Kinder-Care Learning
Centers would be taken private.
   ``They must go to the board in order to purchase any other
stock,'' Ms. Rives said of Lodestar. ``That was a part of the
(restructuring) agreement up front.''
   ``If the shareholders don't want that, then we'll keep our 63
plus percent and everybody will go on,'' Gearreald said in a
telephone interview from New York City.
   The proposed sale would include Sylvan Learning Centers, which
became part of Kinder-Care Learning Centers under the restructuring.
   Kinder-Care Learning Centers consists of 1,260 day-care centers
in 40 states and Canada. Sylvan Learning Centers operates 418
franchise and 27 company-owned facilities that offer additional
instruction in reading and math to school-aged children and adults.

   The stock market drifted aimlessly today in a
muted response to a stronger-than-expect report on employment.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment increased by 233,000 in October as the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a gain of not
much more than 150,000.
   That came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial
world that the Federal Reserve might take the employment data as a
cue to relax its credit policy further.
   However, analysts noted that details of the report continued to
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Some
observers said the chances of easing by the Fed did not appear to
be drastically changed.

   Chrysler Corp. announced the layoffs of 4,000
workers Friday in a series of moves that included ending production
of two subcompact cars in Detroit, eliminating a shift at a
carmaking plant in St. Louis and closing a supply plant in
Wisconsin.
   The moves are part of a Chrysler plan announced earlier this
year to slash $1 billion of the company's annual $26 billion budget
by the end of 1990.
   ``I guess (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacocca was serious when he
said he saw a recession coming,'' independent auto analyst Dave
Healy said from New York City.
   Chrysler said it would:
   _Furlough 1,700 hourly workers at its Jefferson Avenue assembly
plant in Detroit when it ends production of its slow-selling
Omni-Horizon subcompact cars in February 1990. The fate of 250
salaried employees at the plant was undetermined, spokesman Doug
Nicoll said.
   _Eliminate one shift, about 1,900 hourly workers, at its St.
Louis No. 1 assembly plant, which makes the slow-selling LeBaron
and Daytona sports cars.
   _Close its parts subsidiary Acustar and a wire-harness operation
in Coleman, Wis., permanently laying off 400 hourly and salaried
workers.
   The work force in Detroit was stunned by the news.
   Many United Auto Workers' Local 7 members at the Jefferson plant
began working there after being laid off from other Chrysler
factories, jobs they obtained by bumping workers with less
seniority. Local leaders said they would talk with international
UAW officials this weekend about reversing the company's decision
to close the plant.
   Chrysler at first indicated it would close the Jefferson plant
in 1992, the same year a $1 billion replacement plant in Detroit is
to open. The new factory will make sport-utility vehicles, and many
of the Jefferson workers could be recalled for training to work
there beginning in fall 1991, Nicoll said. The new plant will
employ up to 3,000 people.
   Industry analysts said the greatest impact of Friday's moves
would be on the company's ability to meet corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) standards mandated by the federal government.
   The Omni-Horizon cars were not big moneymakers for Chrysler but
their average fuel economy of 26 miles per gallon in the city and
35 miles on the highway helped balance the No. 3 automaker's gas
guzzlers, some of which fell below the 1990 CAFE of 27.5 miles per
gallon.
   ``It raises the question of how they're going to meet the
government gas mileage requirements,'' Healy said. ``The
Omni-Horizon was getting long in the tooth. It had been around for
a long time, so for today, it probably wasn't a bad business
decision.''
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York said he thinks Chrysler may try to reclaim some of that lost
fuel economy by making a version of its compact Dodge
Shadow-Plymouth Sundance models.
   Chrysler said Friday it would shift its marketing emphasis to
the Shadow-Sundance line but Nicoll offered no details of what was
planned by way of incentives on the cars or new offerings.
   The St. Louis shift elimination followed the UAW rejection this
week of a four-day, 40-hour work week at St. Louis No. 2, where
Chrysler's popular minivans are assembled. Chrysler wanted to
eliminate overtime in its minivan production and said 1,000 to
1,300 of the workers facing layoff at St. Louis No. 1 could have
been absorbed into the minivan production under the rejected
scheduling proposal.
   ``The UAW guys voted with their pocketbooks. They didn't want to
give up the overtime,'' Phillippi said.
   The closing of the Acustar plant comes nearly two years after
Chrysler tried to sell its parts subsidiary. UAW outrage at the
time led Chrysler to abandon the attempts to dump Acustar and move
to outside sources for its parts.
   The closing of the wire-harness production plant will force
Chrysler to buy electronic wiring for its vehicles either from
competitors or from another outside source. Electronic wiring is
among the most labor-intensive jobs in automaking.

<HEAD>Report: Many Banks May Opt to Reduce Principal On Mexico's Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of Mexico's foreign creditors are opting
to reduce their outstanding loans to the nation rather than make
new ones, the government newspaper El Nacional said Friday.
   Mexico is awaiting responses from about 500 private foreign
banks to a debt reduction plan that offers the banks several
options, including accepting cuts in interest or principal or
making new loans.
   The agreement, reached in July, deals with the $52.7 billion of
the $107 billion debt Mexico owes to foreign private banks.
   The El Nacional report, attributed to banking sources, said most
of the major Japanese creditors will opt for cutting principal by
35 percent on Mexican debt.
   Mexico's agreement in principle with the steering committee of
15 creditor banks, reached July 24, was seen as a test of Bush
administration policy for reducing Third World debt and as a
milestone for other debtor countries waiting to renegotiate.
   Under the agreement, each bank has three options: a 35 percent
reduction in principle, reduction of the interest rate on its loans
to 6.25 percent from the current average of about 10 percent, or
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what Mexico owes the
bank.
   Those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interest
charged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt from
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the two
multinational lending agencies that are backing the
administration's debt strategy.
   When the agreement was reached with the New York-based bank
committee, Mexican negotiators said they expected about 80 percent
of the banks to accept a reduction in principal or interest rather
than provide new funds.
   El Nacional said an analysis of replies from 120 banks showed
most picking the reduction options rather than increasing their
loans to Mexico, but gave no breakdown.
   The deadline for the banks to choose their options under the
agreement was Friday night, El Nacional said.
   In New York, one banker said many banks have not decided what to
do yet because the Mexican deal ``is very complicated and requires
careful analysis. Some need more time, others have to get a
decision approved at a board of directors' meeting.''
   But the banking source said, ``we should have a pretty good
reading by late next week. The feeling is that the deal will get
done.''
   He commented that ``as expected, there seems to be increased
interest in banks wanting to take debt principal reduction bonds
rather than the interest reduction option. This helps because to
the extent that this happens it means Mexico needs less new money.''

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance Friday,
finishing slightly higher in domestic foreign-exchange trading
after falling overseas.
   Gold prices fell in New York after rising overseas. Republic
National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at $377.70 a troy ounce as
of 4 p.m. EST, down $1.10 from Thursday's late bid.
   The dollar rose on foreign-exchange markets worldwide after the
Labor Department reported stronger-than-expected U.S. employment
figures for October.
   The report that nonfarm payroll employment rose 233,000 last
month when economists forecast growth of only about 150,000
suggested that the economy has unexpected strength and that there
will be no imminent move by the Federal Reserve to encourage lower
interest rates.
   ``The market was sort of stunned,'' said Robert Ryan, vice
president of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of New York.
   But after about an hour of frantic dollar buying, activity
slowed and the dollar began backtracking slowly, finishing Europe's
trading day at levels mostly lower than had been reached late
Thursday.
   ``The market's initial reaction to the jobs data was positive,
but once the market analyzed the data we realized it still
indicated a weak economy,'' said a London currency dealer.
   Ryan said there also were rumors that Japanese authorities may
raise interest rates in Japan in support of the yen, and that
speculation hurt the dollar as well as other currencies.
   The dollar posted some late gains in New York, Ryan said, as
traders balanced their positions in advance of the weekend.
   Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday. In London, the
dollar fell to 143.25 Japanese yen from 143.75 yen at Thursday's
close in Tokyo. Later in New York, the dollar slipped to 143.25 yen
from 143.425 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound rose to $1.5705 in London from $1.5660 late
Thursday. In New York, the dollar gained ground as the pound fell
to $1.5685 from $1.5695.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.8467 West German marks, up from 1.8423;
6.2630 French francs, up from 6.2490; 1.6205 Swiss francs, up from
1.6162; 1,356.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.75; and 1.1723
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1732.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday,
included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8485; 1.6210 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6140; 6.2620 French francs, down from 6.2670;
2.0825 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0860; 1,356.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,356.00, and 1.1723 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1725.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
slipped $1.90 a troy ounce to $378.50.
   Earlier, gold bullion jumped in London to $378.85 a troy ounce,
up from $375.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
rose to a late bid of $380.75 an ounce from $375 late Thursday. In
Hong Kong, gold rose $4.67 to close at $378.71 an ounce.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell 2.8 cents
an ounce to $5.227. Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of
$5.28 a troy ounce from $5.17 late Thursday.

   Coniston Partners always has had a soft spot for
United Airlines.
   The aggressive New York investment partnership scored its
biggest hit in 1987, when the airline's former parent, Allegis
Corp., decided to restructure, selling its non-airline businesses,
paying a special dividend and buying back its shares more than two
years ago.
   Allegis undertook the restructuring largely because the partners
_ Paul E. Tierney, Keith Gollust and Augustus Oliver _ acquired a
big block of its shares and threatened to fight for control of the
board of directors to force a breakup of the company.
   Coniston pocketed $460 million for themselves and their
well-heeled clients as a result of the restructuring.
   So should not have been necessarily surprising that the trio
surfaced Friday with a 9.7 percent stake in takeover target UAL
Corp., United's current parent, and said it would attempt to take
over the company's board to engineer a profitable takeover or
restructuring.
   Historically, however, Coniston has not sought out companies
that others have already put into play. The trio prefers to
identify undervalued companies, quietly amass enough stock to twist
some arms and then press for changes that will boost the share
price and the value of Coniston's investment.
   The tactic, called ``strategic block investing,'' netted
Coniston $44 million when Gillette Co. agreed last year to buy back
Coniston's 16 million shares after the partners narrowly lost a
proxy fight for four seats on the company's board.
   Besides Gillette, their successes have included Storer
Communications, where Coniston made about $39 million in a 1985
leveraged buyout. The partnership also made a quick $60 million by
selling its 12 percent stake in Viacom International when the
company was acquired by National Amusements in 1987.
   This year Coniston went so far out of character as to actually
acquire one of its targets. In June the partners took over TW
Services Inc., which controls thousands of Denny's and Hardee's
fast food restaurants, among others, for $1.65 billion.
   But the deal ran into serious difficulties last week when the
junk bond market gave it the cold shoulder. Investors weren't
lining up to buy some $1.15 billion in high-risk junk bonds needed
to finance the deal.
   Although the restaurants are growing, investors were concerned
over how they would fare in a recession. Coniston and its
investment bankers were forced back to the drawing board to
restructure the terms.
   The three partners aren't the only ones to win when Coniston
sells out at a profit. Coniston operates a handful of investment
funds and requires interested parties to put up a minimum $5
million to participate.
   Last year's estimates pegged the average return at more than 35
percent a year and put Coniston's warchest at roughly $700 million.
   In addition to making money, the trio has been highly publicized
for its unconventional, casual style and ability to corral greed.
One principal might sport jeans around the office while another
spends his lunch hour on his 10-speed bicycle racing around nearby
Central Park.
   And unlike the stereotypical investment banker, at least one of
the partners supported a Democratic presidential candidate, Michael
Dukakis.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. has agreed to pay about
$672 million for the one-third interest in Telerate Inc. it does
not already own.
   Dow Jones said late Thursday that it has agreed to boost its
tender offer to $21 a share from $18 for the approximately 32
million Telerate shares that it does not already own.
   Its earlier offer for New York-based Telerate, a financial
information company, had been valued at about $576 million.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate was
up $1.25 a share at $20.75.
   A special committee of Telerate's board of directors had
rejected the $18-a-share offer from Dow Jones as inadequate, but
Telerate and Dow Jones have been conducting private talks on the
offer over the past few days.
   Late Thursday, Dow Jones said that it and the special committee
had reached an agreement in principle on the new offer.
   Neil S. Hirsch, president and chief executive office of Telerate
and the owner of about 6 percent of the outstanding shares, said he
supports the deal.
   On Friday, Dow Jones and Telerate said they had approved a
definitive merger agreement and said the new tender offer would
expire Nov. 20.
   Peter Skinner, a vice president and general counsel for Dow
Jones, said he expects the deal will probably be completed in early
1990.
   Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine and provides a variety of financial news services and data
bases. Telerate provides financial information via computer screens
that are used in brokerage houses and elsewhere.
   Warren Phillips, chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones, had
said in launching the offer that integrating the companies would
mean operational efficiencies, and permit closer and more efficient
working relationships in marketing, customer service and the
management of their related businesses.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. accepted an undisclosed cash sum to
settle its two-year legal battle with Home Shopping Network Inc.,
with both sides saying Friday it was too expensive to keep fighting
over a $100 million jury award.
   GTE's GTE Florida and GTE Communications units won the libel and
slander award in August after a Circuit Court jury rejected HSN's
$1.5 billion suit claiming GTE provided ineffective telephone
equipment and service.
   Under terms of the settlement, the companies agreed to end all
litigation and release claims against each other. HSN had been
mounting an appeal of the jury award, a process company officials
say could have taken up to five years to resolve.
   ``It's already been two years now that we've been knocking each
other's brains out, and I think both companies realized it's time
to put this behind us,'' said Nando DiFillippo, HSN vice president
and executive counsel. ``To take it through the appeal and possible
retrial would have continued to tie up our top management and could
have cost us $1 million to $1.5 million.''
   James V. Cariedo, GTE Florida vice president and general
counsel, said the company had made its point and it was time to
move on.
   ``This matter has been concluded with the integrity and
reputation of GTE and its employees reaffirmed. Our vindication is
complete,'' he said. ``GTE believes it is in the company's best
interest to eliminate any further expense and use of resources with
respect this litigation.''
   While the amount of the settement was not disclosed, company
officials did say it was negligible compared to the $100 million
jury award.
   ``Remember this began with HSN seeking $1 billion, and it became
a matter of quibbling over a relatively small amount,'' said Larry
Gerbrant, an analyst who has followed the case for the media
research concern Paul Kagan &amp; Associates in Carmel, Calif.
   ``All that really matters to GTE is the fact that they won a
huge moral victory,'' he said. ``The verdict in this case came as a
stunning surprise.''
   HSN had claimed it lost millions of calls and $500 million in
potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because the GTE telephone
equipment it contracted for couldn't handle the volume of calls.
   HSN merchandise may be bought by home television viewers only
while the item is being dispayed on the screen. HSN said it lost 42
million calls when as many as half of its incoming calls never
reached waiting sales operators.
   The jury rejected HSN's claims and agreed with GTE's countersuit
that the video retailer was blaming the phone company for financial
problems that were actually caused by mismanagement.
   In another development Friday, Clearwater-based HSN reported it
lost $26.1 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug.
31 compared with net income of $3.3 million, or 4 cents a share, a
year ago.
   Its fourth-quarter revenue rose 11.5 percent to $187.4 million
from $168.1 million a year ago.
   For the year, HSN lost $14.9 million, or 17 cents per share, in
contrast to net income of $18 million, or 21 cents a share, in the
previous year.
   Revenue for the year rose 6.1 percent to $774.3 million from
$730.1 million a year ago.
   HSN Chairman Roy Speer attributed the loss to reducing or
eliminating subsidiaries to focus on video retailing.

<HEAD>Braniff Announces More Layoffs, Plans to File Salary Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. cut about 100 jobs Friday in
further cost-cutting measures as the carrier struggles to emerge
from bankruptcy for a second time.
   The layoffs, mostly affecting administrative positions in
Braniff's Orlando headquarters, come about five weeks after the
carrier filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors
and announced plans to cut about 2,900 workers.
   Braniff, which claimed weekly losses of about $1.5 million
before filing for bankruptcy Sept. 28, lost $31.8 million on
revenue of $293 million in the first six months of the year.
   ``These layoffs were anticipated and are not very dramatic
company-wide,'' said Braniff spokeswoman Sandy Smith. ``But here in
Orlando it's very emotional.''
   Ms. Smith said the layoffs are effective immediately and leave
about 1,800 Braniff employees, including 750 in Kansas City, Mo.;
550 in Dallas and 250 in Orlando, where the carrier relocated its
headquarters from Dallas in May.
   There are no immediate plans for additional layoffs, said Ms.
Smith.
   Braniff, which operated 46 of its 256 pre-bankruptcy flights
Friday, was the first major carrier to file for bankruptcy
following airline deregulation in the early 1980s. It emerged as a
smaller carrier in 1984.
   Meanwhile, Braniff is preparing to submit salary plans in
bankruptcy court for its 22 top executives.
   A hearing is scheduled Nov. 17 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Orlando, and Ms. Smith said the carrier will likely submit reduced
pay plans for the executives, which earned a total of nearly $3
million last year.
   The highest pre-bankruptcy annual salary was $442,000 for
William McGee, Braniff's president and chief executive officer. He
is among 14 company officials who earned more than $100,000 a year.
   ``How can they afford to pay $400,000 to McGee when they owe
people three weeks worth of pay?'' said Rebecca Guardado, the wife
of a laid-off Braniff mechanic. ``Eight families could live off of
that very well.''
   Many of the laid-off employees are owed several weeks of pay for
work performed before the bankruptcy filing and are considered
unsecured creditors. Under bankruptcy provisions, they could
receive a portion of what they are owed.
   ``The argument could be made that the top officials are working
harder now that they're in bankruptcy than before, that if they
didn't receive what they were worth, they would leave,'' said David
McFarlin, an Orlando lawyer representing several corporate
creditors. ``I'm not buying that argument, but it could be made.''
   McFarlin said most creditors will await the revised salary
figures before deciding whether to challenge the pay plan.
   Ms. Smith said it has not been determined how much the
executives' annual pay will be decreased. ``They will come up with
reduced figures by Nov. 17,'' she said.
   Scott Hamilton, editor of the Dallas-based Commercial Aviation
Report, said Braniff needs $50 million to $100 million to operate
on a long-term basis and could run out of cash sometime this month.
   ``I think executive salaries will all be a moot point very
shortly,'' he said. ``Frankly, I'm surprised Braniff is still
flying.''

<HEAD>Gold Market Dips But Still Looks Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold gave back some of its recent gains Friday but analysts said
the market did not appear to be significantly weakened by the dip.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures prices rallied;
pork-belly futures rose for the fifth straight day; and grain and
soybean futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $1.90 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $381 a troy
ounce. Silver finished 2.5 cents to 3 cents lower with December at
$5.26 a troy ounce.
   Gold was trading below $365 a month ago and has strengthened
substantially since the Oct. 13 stock market collapse.
   Analysts have attributed gold's climb to jittery investors
seeking a safe haven for their dollars. But the stock market was
quiet Friday and gold prices stalled early in the day after rising
above $385.
   ``I don't know if it was profit-taking or what but it's acting a
little toppish,'' said Scott Hinton, a metals analyst with Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   The Labor Department's report that unemployment held steady at
5.3 percent last month indicated a stronger economy than some
traders had expected and helped to support the dollar, which may
have prompted some gold sales.
   But analysts said the market's fundamentals remained bullish
overall, with the dollar still in a downward trend and the Federal
Reserve unlikely to tighten interest rates in the near future.
   Dips in the market do not necessarily signal an end to the
rally, they said, although a drop below $375 an ounce in the
December gold contract would probably trigger a big wave of selling.
   ``As long as it holds above $375, it has a bullish bias,'' said
Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
New York.
   Most oil futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange
led by crude oil's rebound late in the session from Thursday's
moderate losses.
   Recent reports indicate that members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries are continuing to produce crude in
excess of their self-imposed limits, but Friday's estimates
suggested the overproduction was not as extreme as had previously
been thought.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 11 cents to 20 cents
higher with December at $20.21 a barrel; heating oil was .09 cent
to .17 cent higher with December at 60.12 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .07 cent lower to .60 cent higher with December at
52.13 cents a gallon.
   Pork-belly futures continued their sharp ascent on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, bolstered by strong demand and expectations
for more export business. The United States and Poland signed an
agreement Friday that will send up to $10 million worth of pork
bellies to Poland.
   Cattle futures gained on book balancing ahead of the weekend.
   Live cattle futures finished unchanged to .45 cent higher with
December at 74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with November at 82.85 cents a pound; live hogs
were .22 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 46.95 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to .88 cent higher
with February at 59.60 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting expectations for new export sales of the grain. Corn and
soybean futures were narrowly mixed.
   Expectations are running high that the Agriculture Department
will soon offer U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices. The
Soviet Union is also rumored to be shopping for wheat.
   Wheat was 1} cents to 3} cents higher with December at $4.05\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at
$2.40 a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent higher with December
at $1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2{ cents higher
with November at $5.69 a bushel.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. announced Friday it will build a
$50 million cellular-telephone facility in Chicago's northern
suburbs, creating about 3,000 new jobs by 1993.
   The facility to make miniaturized telephone equipment for Asian
markets is to include a factory in Libertyville and renovation of
an existing plant in Grayslake, company officials said at a news
conference.
   ``It is fitting that we establish this new world-class facility
in Illinois, where Motorola was founded 61 years ago,'' said George
Fisher, Motorola president and chief executive officer.
   ``We have demonstrated that products built here in Illinois can
compete against those made anywhere else in the world and win.''
   State officials said they're providing Motorola and the village
of Libertyville with grants totaling nearly $7.5 million to assist
with the project.
   State tax breaks are expected to save the company an additional
$5 million dollars over a 20-year period.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall on Stronger-Than-Expected Jobs Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell sharply Friday after the
government reported stronger-than-expected job growth for October.
   Traders felt the report dimmed chances for a relaxation anytime
soon in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 11-16 points, or
$6.88 for every $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when
prices fall, climbed to 7.93 percent from 7.87 percent late
Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported that while unemployment held
steady at 5.3 percent last month, the economy added 233,000 nonfarm
jobs, up from a revised 201,000 in September.
   Many bond analysts were expecting job growth of closer to
150,000, and the larger figure indicated the economy may be
stronger than expected.
   Also up at a rate higher than predictions were average hourly
earnings, which rose 0.7 percent in October, a sign of persistent
upward pressure on wages _ a possible precursor of inflation
problems. Most analysts had predicted an earnings increase of 0.4
percent.
   ``This fits with the Fed not easing monetary policy right
away,'' said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``It's much too strong to suggest a recession is unfolding at
this point,'' said Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica
Capital Markets Group in San Francisco. ``The market has to give up
some ground.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments fell from ] point to 17-32 point,
intermediate maturities were off 15-32 point to 9-16 point and
long-term issues dropped as much } point, according to Telerate
Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 5.66 to 1,189.09.
   In corporate trading, industrials were down. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 1.88 to 336.19.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell [ point to 929-32. The average yield to
maturity was 7.37 percent, up from 7.36 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08 percent as the
discount climbed 10 basis points to 7.82 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.09 percent as the discount rose 17 basis
points to 7.68 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.01
percent as the discount climbed 19 basis points to 7.47 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 811-16 percent, down from 8} percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Ends Week on Positive Note</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures finished mixed Friday after a
lackluster week, as analysts said sluggish demand pushed gasoline
lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
rose 20 cents to end at $20.21 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The contract gained 44 cents on the week, up from $19.77 a week
earlier.
   ``The market continues to mark time prior to the upcoming OPEC
meeting, now three weeks away,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker
with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, heating oil also
closed the week stronger. The December contract rose 0.13 cent to
60.12 cents a gallon, while the January contract advanced 0.11 cent
to 59.76 cents.
   Meanwhile, wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery
lost 0.07 cent to 52.13 cents a gallon.
   ``Gasoline is squarely on the defensive because we have come out
of the gasoline season with ample gasoline supplies and sluggish
demand,'' Lebow said.
   A report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
is continuing to produce oil at a brisk rate might have added a
bullish slant to the crude market, said Peter Beutel, energy
analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   The International Energy Agency, in a report released Friday,
estimated that OPEC produced 22.9 million barrels a day last month,
up from a revised 22.4 million barrels in September.
   Although the estimate put OPEC production at well above its
current self-imposed ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day, Beutel
said other estimates had put OPEC production even higher.
   The 13 OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet Nov. 25 in Vienna,
Austria, to discuss strategy for 1990, including new production
limits.

<TEXT>
   Late-October sales of domestically made cars and
light trucks fell 2.8 percent compared with last year, slowing a
sales skid during the first month of the 1990 model year,
automakers said Friday.
   The eight major automakers with plants in the United States
reported they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 36,096
during the Oct. 21-31 period this year, compared with a daily rate
of 37,138 during the same time last year.
   Car sales for the period were down 2.5 percent while light truck
sales fell 3.4 percent.
   The decline in domestic vehicle sales was more modest than the
rapid drop earlier in the month. For all of October, car and truck
sales were down 11.6 percent for the domestic carmakers.
   During the summer, analysts warned sales would fall sharply
during October because of consumers' fears of price increases
coming with the 1990 model year, which began Oct. 1, and a
reduction in the level of incentives being offered to buyers.
   ``I think the first two selling periods in October bore the
brunt of the paybacks,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch
Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``I wouldn't be surprised if it
slipped over into the first quarter of '90.''
   Imported cars and trucks were selling at a rate 7.6 percent
below last year for the entire month.
   During the first two 10-day periods of October, car and truck
sales by the U.S. automakers were 18.6 percent behind last year's
pace. For the first 10 months of the year, car and truck sales were
2.1 percent behind last year's pace.
   ``It was very slow at the first of the month,'' said Alan
Helfman, general manager of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in
Houston. ``It started picking up a little toward the end and I had
a decent finish.''
   In combined car and truck sales, Ford Motor Co. reported a 9.9
percent slip in late October sales compared with last year. For the
entire year, Ford's vehicle sales were running 1.7 percent behind
last year's pace.
   General Motors Corp. said its car and light truck sales for the
period were down 4.9 percent and off 4.3 percent for the first 10
months of the year.
   Chrysler Corp.'s late-October vehicle sales were down just 1.4
percent, as a 4.2-percent rise in truck sales helped dilute a 6.5
decline in car sales. Chrysler's vehicle sales year-to-date were
running 6.1 percent behind last year's pace.

   Speculation about an imminent drop in interest
rates faded as the government reported the economy added 233,000
jobs even as the unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last
month.
   The surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter _
which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline in
manufacturing _ was largely attributed to continued local
government hiring for the school year.
   Analysts interpreted Friday's data as proof no recession would
come this year although some said the economy would flirt with one
early next year.

$1.5 billion suit claiming GTE provided ineffective telephone
equipment and service.
   Under terms of the settlement Friday, the companies agreed to
end all litigation and release claims against each other.

   Five Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
stockholders filed a lawsuit Friday alleging the company's officers
intend to fight a takeover by Georgia-Pacific Corp. to save their
high-paying jobs.
   The lawsuit in U.S. District Court asks that Great Northern be
forced to negotiate with Georgia-Pacific or any other potential
buyers who could increase the value of the company's stock.
   ``Great Northern's board is not seeking to maximize shareholder
value, as is its duty, but rather is taking steps to entrench
existing management and the existing board,'' the lawsuit states.
   Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern, which has not commented on
Georgia-Pacific's $3.13 billion buyout offer, had no comment on the
lawsuit, which was filed as a class action.
   Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta, announced Tuesday it was
seeking to buy Great Northern for $58 per share, almost $20 per
share more than it has traded recently.
   The Great Northern shareholders said the deal would greatly
enhance the value of their stock and a combination with
Georgia-Pacific would make the paper company more competitive
because of cost savings.
   Named as defendants are the company; William R. Laidig,
president, chairman and chief executive officer; James C. Crump
Jr., executive vice president and chief operating officer; and six
directors.
   The lawsuit says the Great Northern executives are seeking to
preserve jobs that earned Laidig $707,500 last year and Crump
$412,500. The directors receive $20,000 per year, plus $1,000 for
each board meeting they attend and $1,000 for each committee
meeting they attend, the lawsuit says.

<HEAD>Morita Concerned About `Japan Bashing' After Columbia Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita said Friday he is
concerned about ``Japan bashing'' in the afternmath of Sony's
takeover of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and other Japanese
acquisitions in the United States.
   Morita told business leaders that some U.S. officials are using
the $3.4 billion deal as an excuse to paint the Japanese as
villains trying to buy America's soul.
   ``I have a very serious concern over this,'' Morita said.
   Earlier this week, Mitsubishi Estate Co. acquired 51 percent of
Rockefeller Group Inc., which owned the symbolic business and
tourist center in the heart of Manhattan, for $846 million.
   In a speech to the Japan America Society of Georgia and later at
a meeting with reporters, Morita asked why Japanese investments in
the America are regarded as ``sensational'' while U.S. business
deals involving other nations are accepted.
   He said the Columbia acquisition, as well as Sony's $2 billion
buyout of CBS Records in 1988, should be considered simply as good
business deals. He said Sony did not buy the companies to make a
quick buck.
   Morita said Japanese companies want to be good citizens when
they invest in America. He said he hoped such efforts would end an
apparent feeling among some politicians that criticizing Japanese
businesses can win votes.
   ``If Japan is regarded as a real friend ... if somebody bashes
Japan, he will lose popularity,'' Morita said.
   Morita said Sony's interest in Columbia and CBS was based on the
belief that producing software such as records and movies would
enhance its electronics hardware business.
   He said the entertainment companies will remain largely run by
Americans. Morita also said Sony does not intend to interfere with
the creative process in the entertainment business.
   Morita said that any loss in competitiveness the United States
has experienced in global trade has less to do with Japanese
investments than shortsightedness by U.S. industry.
   ``At times we see some American corporate executives more
interested in quick profits. Busily trying to make the bottom line
of quarterly reports, their concern is for the amount of profit
they can set aside for return to the shareholders,'' he said.
   ``Although this concern should not altogether be criticized, an
excessive emphasis on short-term orientation is dangerous,'' Morita
said.

   A federal jury Friday awarded $10 million to a
former service station operation that claimed Union Oil Co. of
California violated its franchise pact.
   The U.S. District Court jury deliberated about eight hours
before deciding in favor of Barkett Oil Co., which claimed it
suffered financial hardships when Union canceled its franchise
agreement in 1985.
   The suit alleged Los Angeles-based Union Oil, now called Unocal
Corp., violated a federal act governing oil company franchises and
the distribution of petroleum products.
   Union filed a counterclaim alleging Barkett broke the agreement
by selling competitors' products at approximately 75 stations from
Vero Beach to Key West bearing Union Oil signs.
   ``They made us take down our Union Oil signs and give back the
credit cards,'' said Sidney Pertnoy, an attorney for Barkett.
   Barkett, formerly based in Miami, closed shortly after the Union
franchise agreement was withdrawn, Barkett attorney T.J. McKenna
said. The company now is liquidating its holdings, he said.
   Unocal spokesman Art Bentley would not say if the company will
appeal the award, which followed an eight-week trial.
   A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13 in Miami concerning punitive
damages.
   Unocal reported 1988 earnings of $480 million on revenue of
$10.1 billion.

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it would stop
production temporarily at car and truck assembly plants in
Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky because of a shortage of dealer orders.
   Ford said it was shutting down its Dearborn assembly plant,
where the Ford Mustang is made, for two weeks beginning Monday,
affecting about 2,100 hourly workers.
   The afternoon shift of its truck assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio,
is to be idled for a week starting Monday and the morning shift is
to idled the week of Nov. 13.
   Lorain has about 2,900 workers on two shifts. The plant makes
Ford Econoline and Club Wagon vans.
   Ford said its truck plant near Louisville, where medium and
heavy-duty trucks are made, will stop production for the week of
Nov. 13. That plant employs about 2,000 hourly workers.

   The stock market drifted to a small loss Friday
in a muted response to a stronger-than-expected report on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.05 to
2,629.51, closing out the week with a net gain of 32.79 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
643 up, 794 down and 516 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that nonfarm
payroll employment increased by 233,000 in October as the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a gain of not
much more than 150,000.
   That came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial
world that the Federal Reserve might take the employment data as a
cue to relax its credit policy further.
   However, analysts noted that details of the report continued to
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Some
observers said the chances of easing by the Fed did not appear to
be drastically changed.
   UAL jumped 11} to 184}. An investor group known as Coniston

   The investment group Coniston Partners entered
the buyout fray for UAL Corp. on Friday, announcing plans to fight
for control of the airline company in a strategy that mirrored its
successful 1987 bustup of UAL's former parent.
   A group led by the New York-based Coniston said it had acquired
a 9.7 percent stake in UAL, the beleaguered parent of United
Airlines, and intended to seek control of the board of directors in
order to possibly force a sale, restructuring or other transaction
to boost UAL's stock price.
   UAL stock, buffeted in recent weeks by takeover winds, finished
up $11.75 at $184.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Airline industry analysts have been waiting for the next move in
the protracted battle for UAL, which they predict could take months
to resolve.
   ``This is no big surprise,'' said Edward Starkman, airline
analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``It was just a matter of
who was going to carry the flag to do it.''
   Coniston, which has spent roughly $333 million for 2.12 million
UAL shares, wants to cut UAL's board from 16 to five members, three
of whom would be Coniston principals, it said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   If successful in swaying shareholders to its plan, Coniston
would be able to steer the company toward a sale, restructuring or
recapitalization.
   ``We would like to see an extraordinary transaction of some kind
take place that would bring stability to the company and be fair to
various constituencies,'' Coniston principal Paul Tierney said.
   Tierney said UAL's unions had been approached and that ``we
would like to strike a transaction that is good for employees _
both union and non-union.''
   The union representing United's pilots has been unhappy with its
parent since 1986, when UAL attempted to become a total travel
conglomerate. The pilots have been trying to buy the airline ever
since.
   Leaders of the United pilots' union local said Coniston's goals
appeared to be consistent with their own. But they said no
ownership change or financial restructuring of UAL would occur
without their support.
   ``Interested investors should clearly understand ... that the
pilots intend to achieve majority ownership of United,'' Frederick
Dubinsky, chairman of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said in a statement.
   The Coniston disclosure follows a move Wednesday by another
player, New York investor Saul Steinberg, who sought federal
antitrust clearance to buy more than 15 percent and less than 25
percent of UAL. A spokesman for Steinberg said Friday that
Steinberg would have no comment on Coniston's action.
   ``There's no way of giving odds as to whether they'll succeed,''
Robert Joedicke, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
of Coniston's move. ``The question is how much support they'll get
from stockholders and arbitrageurs.''
   UAL did not comment Friday on the latest news in the takeover
battle, which began in August when billionaire oilman Marvin Davis
offered $240 a share for the company.
   A group of UAL pilots and top managers then offered $300 a share
in a $6.75 billion buyout proposal, which was accepted by the
company's board but collapsed when the group was unable to obtain
financing.
   News of that collapse helped send stock prices tumbling Oct. 13,
when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190 points.
   UAL stock has gyrated wildly since the battle began, reaching a
high of $294.
   Coniston, which has made its money buying into companies,
instigating changes and then selling its shares, played a key role
two years ago in the breakup of travel conglomerate Allegis Corp.,
former parent of United.
   Coniston reaped about $460 million when Allegis bought back
shares after agreeing to sell its Westin and Hilton International
hotel chains and Hertz car rental business.
   ``We believe this is a great franchise,'' Tierney said of United
Friday. ``It's an airline which has taken meaningful strides
forward in the last few years. There's no intention here to break
up the company or sell it through liquidation. We want to see it
grow and stabilize.''
