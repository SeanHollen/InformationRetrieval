<HEAD>Bush Administration Would Accept Higher Payroll Levy WIth Same Tax
Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration is willing to accept an
increase in the wage ceiling on which the hospitalization part of
Social Security taxes is levied _ a way to raise taxes with raising
tax rates, a congressional source said Monday night.
   The extra revenue would be aimed at easing, but not completely
eliminating, the income surtax on elderly Americans with high
incomes that finances catastrophic health insurance coverage for
Medicare recipients.
   In a closed session with the House Ways and Means Committee,
administration tax experts said one option in a package of changes
proposed by Rep. Fortney H. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the
committe's health subcommittee, would be ``generally acceptable,''
according to this source, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified.
   That option would increase the wage base on which the 2.9 percent
payroll tax for Medicare coverage is levied from $50,700 to $60,000
in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and make state and local
government employees subject to the tax for the first time. No
Medicare tax is paid on income earned over the ceiling.
   The tax is split by employer and employee, each paying half or
1.45 percent.
   Someone making less than $50,700 would see no increase in the
Medicare portion of the Social Security tax paid. Someone making
$60,000 or more would pay $269.70 a year more.
   Stark's package included an alternative: leave state and local
government employees out and raise the ceiling to $90,000. The
administration does not favor this, the source said.
   The surtax _ 15 percent of the underlying tax liability _ has
prompted many protests to Congress, especially from people who have
arranged duplicating private insurance coverage. It can range up to
$800 for about 5 percent of the 33 million people eligible for
Medicare.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee and a major architect of the catastrophic health insurance
program that took effect in January 1988, had been backing a
reduction in the surtax, with no reduction in benefits, on the
grounds that it was too heavy and would build unneeded surpluses of
$2 billion to $4 billion in a few years in the trust fund for
catastrophic coverage.
   But on July 12, Bentsen said new figures from the Congressional
Budget Office showed there would be no surpluses after all. That set
off informal discussions on Capitol Hill and with the administration
on some other way to ease the surtax burden.

<HEAD>Review Says Gander Crash Probe Was Sufficient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial review of the Canadian Aviation Safety
Board investigation into the 1985 crash that killed 256 Americans at
Gander, Newfoundland, has found no need for more public inquiry, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
   Sources at the safety board and Department of Transport said the
review, ordered in March by Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard,
generally exonerates the board's professional staff investigators,
the Toronto Globe and Mail reported.
   The investigators found that a thin layer of ice reduced the
lifting capacity of the wings of the Arrow Air jet, causing it to
crash on takeoff on Dec. 12, 1985.
   The newspaper said the review was written by Justice Willard
Estey, a former Supreme Court of Canada judge, and is due to be
released Friday.
   It quoted sources as saying the report gives no credence to the
bomb theory that has been widely promoted by four dissenting members
of the nine-member board, the newspaper says.
   The dissenters had accused the board's investigators of
withholding evidence. They suggested a coverup by Canadian and U.S.
agencies had sought to hide what they argued was a terrorist attack
on the aging DC-8, which was ferrying U.S. troops home for Christmas
after a peacekeeping tour in the Middle East.
   The Globe and Mail quoted sources as saying Estey rejected the
dissenters' allegations as being gossip and innuendo, and that he
concluded no useful purpose would be served by a public inquiry.
   No evidence of a bomb has ever been presented, although the
dissenters say its absence demonstrates the wide-ranging nature of
the coverup.
   Safety board chairman Ken Thorneycraft refused Monday to discuss
Estey's review. He said he was unaware of its findings, but he added
he had always been confident that any independent assessment of the
agency's investigation would conclude it had been conducted
thoroughly and had reached reasonable conclusions.
   ``There are always some things that could have been done
better,'' Thorneycraft said. ``But it will be nice when it (Estey's
report) does come out.''
   Critics of the icing finding, most recently the U.S. Airline
Pilots Association, have accused the board of fabricating evidence
in an effort to blame the pilots of the plane. Both pilots, six
other crew members and all 248 U.S. servicemen on board the jet died
in the Dec. 12, 1985, crash _ the worst ever in Canada.
   The Globe and Mail also reported that Les Filotas, one of the
dissenters who wrote a minority report rejecting the icing finding,
tried to get in touch with Estey during his review.
   It said Filotas sent a five-page letter to Estey in which he
postulated that Arrow Air may have been involved in
``arms-for-hostages exchanges conducted secretly on behalf of highly
placed individuals in the American administration (and that) if so,
there would have been strong motivation for attempts to confound
aspects of the investigation.''
   The letter, obtained through the Access to Information Act,
suggests the unsubstantiated link could also have been a motive for
targeting Air Arrow for a terrorist attack, the paper said.
   It said Estey returned the letter, dated April 2, unread to
Filotas.
   Estey, due to return from vacation Thursday, is expected to be
present at the news conference at which his report will be formally
released.

<TEXT>
   The federal government agreed Monday to examine
the results of the upcoming 1990 census and adjust them if necessary
to correct a historical undercount of minorities and inner-city
residents.
   Under a settlement worked out over the past 10 days and announced
in U.S. District Court, the Commerce Department and the Census
Bureau agreed to create an eight-person panel to review census
methods and advise the secretary of commerce whether blacks and
other minorities are accurately counted.
   The agreement was reached in a lawsuit brought last November by
New York City and joined by two states and several cities with large
minority populations.
   It has potentially far-reaching implications, and could influence
how federal money is distributed, as well as the boundaries of
congressional districts which are determined by population.
   ``This is a civil-rights issue, not a money issue,'' said city
Corporation Counsel Peter L. Zimroth. ``The money is secondary, what
we want is the most accurate count. There are people in this country
who are not brought into account. They are losing representation.''
   Under the arrangement accepted by U.S. District Judge Joseph M.
McLaughlin, the panel of statisticians and demographers will examine
the results of the 1990 census and recommend to the commerce
secretary whether the numbers need to be adjusted.
   Following the nationwide head count, the Census Bureau will
conduct a massive follow-up survey sampling 150,000 households
nationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted.
   In a suit joined by New York state, California, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil-rights
organizations, New York City charged that the counting methods of
the Census Bureau commonly undercounts blacks, Hispanics, the
homeless and illegal aliens.
   Zimroth said the agreement potentially means ``many millions of
dollars'' for the city in federal funds lost because of the
undercounting.
   According to the city, the 1980 census missed as many as 500,000
people, or 6 percent of the city's population. The city estimates it
has lost as much as $52 million annually in federal funds beginning
in 1980.
   Stephen Hart, a Justice Department lawyer, said the 1990 census
``is going to be taken in the normal fashion'' and the commerce
secretary will then hear the advisory panel's recommendations and
decide by July 15, 1991, if adjustment is needed.
   While 99 percent of everyone living in the country is counted, as
many as 7 percent of the nation's blacks are overlooked, said Hart.
The Census Bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount,
caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperating
with neighborhood canvassers.
   ``The problem is that the initial census is very flawed,''
Zimroth said.
   Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Mayor Edward I. Koch
said the agreement was ``a great victory'' for the city and added
``the impact is money.''
   Monday's agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminary
injunction that could have stopped the 1990 census. However, a
motion for a permanent injunction that could prevent the Census
Bureau from using the 1990 count should the federal government not
abide to the terms of the agreement remained in place.
   The agreement essentially reverses a position taken earlier by
the Commerce Department, parent agency of the Census Bureau.
   Census officials, aware of criticism that they missed 1 percent
to 2 percent of Americans in 1980, and as many as 5 percent of
minorities, had been studying methods of making an adjustment in
1990, including a post-census survey to be used to evaluate the
count itself.
   The Commerce Department, however, announced last fall that no
adjustment would be made in 1990. That agency cited concerns that no
survey could be as accurate as the actual head count and said that
it was worried that adjusting the figures would lead to even more
lawsuits and jeopardize public confidence in the results of the
count.
   At that time Barbara Bailer, who had been in charge of the Census
program studying the undercount, resigned in protest of the
decision. Bailer, who now heads the American Statistical
Association, could not be reached for comment on the new agreement.

   A landslide on a seaside road in western Japan
crushed a bus carrying vacationers home from a hot springs resort,
killing all 15 people aboard, police said today.
   Rescuers today recovered the last seven bodies from the bus,
which was buried by large rocks and dirt from an overhanging cliff
Saturday afternoon, police in Fukui prefecture said.
   The bus was traveling along the coast of the Sea of Japan, 200
miles west of Tokyo, Fukui Prefectural Police spokesman Noboru
Tsujioka said.
   An estimated 1,500 tons of rocks and dirt, 100 feet high and 175
feet wide, fell into the road, crushing a 3-foot-thick concrete
protection ledge and smothering the bus, Tsujioka said.
   He said police believed the landslide was triggered by recent
heavy rains.

<HEAD>French Bask in Glow Left by Bicentennial Weekend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The market for bicentennial trinkets is slack and
the streets are clean again, but France and its leaders are still
basking in the glow of their wild bicentennial weekend.
   Until the final moment, the plans to mark the French Revolution's
200th birthday brought waves of criticism.
   The skeptics said Paris would be a nightmare of gridlock, a
whacky parade Friday night would be a disaster and the entire show
constituted an attempt to glorify Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand.
   On Sunday, Mitterrand entoned royally: ``What counts is the
result.''
   Parades and fireworks in the center of Paris attracted the
capital's biggest crowds since the city was liberated from the Nazis.
   ``More than a million Parisians, tens of millions of French
people, and hundreds of millions of television viewers in the entire
world saw on this occasion an image of France particularly rich in
symbols,'' Premier Michel Rocard said in a message to the chief of
the country's Bicentennial Mission, historian Jean-Noel Jeanneney.
   Also watching were more than 30 world leaders, including
President Bush. They came to Paris for the annual summit of the
world's seven richest countries and to attend the bicentennial
festivities.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac and other conservative leaders snubbed the
parades, but even rightist newspapers usually hostile to Mitterrand
saluted the commemorations in rapturous style.
   ``The Triumph of the Revolution,'' the conservative daily Le
Figaro said in a banner headline. In a front-page editorial, it
described Friday night's show as ``colossal, superb and solemn. With
humor as well.''
   The parade along the Champs-Elysees, a flight of imagination
created by advertising specialist Jean-Paul Goude, offered
everything from African drummers to Scottish pipers to the Florida
A&amp;M marching band moonwalking in the style of singer Michael Jackson.
   In a reminder of the price of freedom, hundreds of Chinese
studying in the West marched to solemn music, with headbands showing
the Chinese characters for the French Revolution's watchwords:
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''
   By Sunday, as festivities grew old, the crowds on the
Champs-Elysees also thinned and slowed down.
   ``Everybody's worn out,'' said Maguelone Fallot, who wasn't
having much luck selling her bicentennial keepsakes on the famous
avenue.
   ``These things are expensive,'' she said, pointing to her $23 wig
in the blue, white, and red of the French flag and a $15
bicentennial tie.
   The capital's street cleaners, in their bright green suits, were
out early Sunday morning to clean up the confetti and other trash.
   The bicentennial ceremonies began Thursday with dramatic readings
from the Declaration of the Rights of Man with the visiting
presidents and prime ministers in attendance.
   That evening, the leaders joined Mitterrand for an inaugural
concert at the new Opera Bastille, built where a revolutionary mob
stormed the royal Bastille prison on July 14, 1789.
   The attack is viewed as the beginning of the French Revolution.
   Friday morning saw France's traditional military parade, showing
more might than ever this year with screeching fighter planes,
rumbling mobile missiles and ranks of military academy graduates.
   Saturday's fireworks were Chirac's contribution, a 45-minute
display with 170,000 rockets.
   However, the most distinctive part of the weekend binge was
Goude's parade, named ``The Marseillaise'' after France's national
anthem but offered as a salute to the ``tribes of the globe.''
   ``The gamble was without doubt a little crazy, but it was won,''
the daily Le Monde wrote in an editorial Saturday. It said the
``surprising and original'' parade ``did not give the idea _ to say
the least _ of a chauvinistic and xenophobic France.''
   Goude's after-parade commentary was simpler: ``I'll try to do
better next time.''

   Historic St. Mark's Square was awash in
trash and many Venetians were miffed after rock fans more than
doubled the canal city's population for a performance by the group
Pink Floyd.
   ``Venice has been desecrated: excrement on the streets, filth
everywhere, violence, and drugs. Venetians can take no more of
this,'' said Augusto Salvadori, president of the Committee for the
Defense of Venice.
   Saturday's show on a floating stage near St. Mark's drew an
estimated 200,000 people to this city of 83,000, among them
actor-director Woody Allen and movie star Tom Cruise.
   On Sunday, the square was a sea of trash.
   Fans at the concert had complained of lack of services, saying
the city provided no toilets or emergency vehicles. A 24-hour
transport strike exacerbated problems, causing chaos for inhabitants
and tourists alike. Many concert-goers slept in the streets.
   Police said 80 people suffered minor injuries in a scuffle in the
square shortly before the concert began, when a group of fans broke
through a barrier. Scattered cases of vandalism also were reported.
   The 90-minute show with laser lights was broadcast live in Italy
and 23 other countries, reaching a total audience of 100 million
people, according to the state-run RAI network. It was not broadcast
in the United States.
   The concert set an attendance record as Italy's largest rock
event and attracted more visitors to Venice than does the annual
Carnival festival.
   City preservation officials had threatened to deny permission for
the concert. But on Thursday, they dropped their objections when
concert organizers agreed to pull the stage farther from shore and
reduce volume to a maximum of 60 decibels instead of 105.
   Italy's vice premier, Gianni De Michelis, spoke out in favor of
the concert.
   ``Venice must give space to all cultural languages, including
that of rock music,'' he said.

   Former President Nixon says his autobiography due
this spring will be the most personal book he has ever written and
will describe in detail his experiences in resigning the presidency.
   Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher, would not disclose terms of the
contract, but said it plans a first printing of at least 200,000 and
a major marketing campaign.
   It will contain accounts of Nixon's meetings with world leaders
and advice about running for office, winning and governing. It also
will discuss the drug crisis and education, the publisher said.
   ``The book contains reflections and conclusions based on my
entire life, from private, political, foreign policy and
philosophical standpoints,'' the 76-year-old Nixon said in a
statement.
   He has pledged his income from the book to the Nixon Library and
Birthplace, scheduled to open next year at Yorba Linda, Calif.

   Aphelion has a nose for the likes of Princess
Diana, Queen Sofia of Spain, Ivana Trump and Abigail Van Buren.
   The 48-year-old is a master parfumeur, creating customized
perfumes that get splashed on the rich and famous around the world.
   ``Every human being smells differently,'' Aphelion, who goes by
that name only, said in this week's People magazine.
   From his headquarters in England, he determines a person's ``odor
signature'' by examining their personalities and habits. He also
insists they wrap a clean piece of cloth around their arms
overnight. The textile is then tested for scents by his lab in
France.
   The work of his nostrils _ they are reportedly insured with
Lloyd's of London for $5 million _ isn't cheap: from $10,000 to
$80,000 a batch.
   One of his fondest successes is a fragrance he created for diva
Maria Callas for her 1967 return to Milan's La Scala Opera. ``The
more she sang, the warmer she became and the more the fragrance I
created for her wafted through the entire opera house. By the end of
the third act everyone there could smell it.''
   One failure: a scent made for Brigitte Bardot turned orange when
the actress took a bath.

   Guitarist-singer Tom Petty was 7 years old when
he laid eyes on Elvis Presley and was smitten with rock 'n' roll.
   ``Elvis didn't look like the people I'd known. He had a real glow
around him, like a full-body halo. He looked like a god to me,''
Petty, now 35, said in an interview in August's Spin magazine.
   Petty, along with several thousand others, watched Presley being
filmed for a scene in the film ``Follow That Dream,'' which was shot
30 miles away from Petty's home in Gainesville, Fla.
   ``After I saw Elvis that one time, I became obsessed,'' said
Petty.
   Petty traded a Wham-O slingshot to a friend for a pile of old
records that included 30 Presley albums, and ``for the next two
years all I did was sit in my room and listen to those records.''
   ``I can't tell you how much rock 'n' roll consumed me,'' he
added. ``It wasn't a matter of choice. It was something that came
over me like a disease.''
   Petty's latest record is ``Full Moon Fever.'' He's earned six
platinum and two gold records, has led the group the Heartbreakers
for 13 years, and was one of the Traveling Wilburys, which included
Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and the late Roy Orbison.

   Jose Canseco's troubles with the law
aren't just with highway cops. Now he's in hot water with the head
of the California Police Chiefs Association, who says the Oakland
Athletics star should grow up.
   Bill Eastman wrote a letter to Canseco blasting him for not
taking responsibility for his actions, including recent speeding
tickets and an arrest for allegedly having a loaded handgun in his
car.
   `You have blamed your cars, the police and even your celebrity
status. You are apparently a victim in your own mind,'' Eastman,
police chief in this city about 40 miles east of San Francisco Bay,
wrote Canseco.
   The open letter was dated Friday, and was sent to Canseco and
team and league officials.
   ``I don't know where (Eastman is) coming from,'' Canseco said
Saturday night in Toronto, where the A's were playing the Blue Jays.
``If that's all the police have to do with their time, worrying
about major league ballplayers.''
   On Tuesday Canseco, received his fourth speeding ticket since
last season.
   He complained that the officer who gave him the ticket ``has an
attitude problem.''
   Eastman said Saturday that Canseco has the attitude problem, and
added that criticizing police officers for doing their jobs ``is
ludicrous and immature.''

<HEAD>Turkey Welcomes Bulgarian Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VEDAT ERDAMAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic Turks fleeing Bulgaria are daily
arriving by the thousands and though offers of housing, jobs and
marriage await the immigrants authorities fear a prolonged exodus
may prove overwhelming.
   Since May, when Bulgaria first started deporting ethnic Turks and
then gave passports to others who wanted to leave, 135,000 have
crossed into Turkey, according to officials in this border city.
   So far, a wave of ethnic solidarity has allwed Turkey to smoothly
absorb the influx.
   The 1-million-strong Turkish minority in Bulgarian has been
subjected to a government assimilation campaign that forces them to
adopt Slavic names, bans the use of Turkish in public and restricts
their Moslem religious rites.
   Each day about 3,500 people pour in and within a few days most
leave for jobs and new homes or move in with relatives who emigrated
several decades ago, said the provincial governor, Unal Erkan.
   A refugee camp of white conical tents, set up on a treeless plot
next to the railroad station, has become a way station. There,
representatives of employers from around the country meet with
immigrants seeking work.
   Hayrettin Aydin came from the Black Sea port city of Giresun to
hire 10 workers for his mining company. ``We saw these people
arriving with their few belongings on the TV news. We were moved, we
wanted to help,'' he said.
   He struck a deal with two young men in their 20's. One of them,
Ercan Kurtulus, said: ``as long as we have a job and a place to stay
we don't care what or where. There is no going back to Bulgaria.''
   Companies offering jobs to the immigrants say most of them are
skilled workers and that ethnic Turks who settled here before
established a reputation for hard work.
   Turkey, with a population of 55 million, has a 16 percent
unemployment rate but in most areas there is a shortage of skilled
workers. Welders, fork lift operators and electricians are in demand.
   But there is a dark side to the hiring story. Some companies have
fired native workers to replace them with labor from Bulgaria
thinking they can get them cheaper, union leaders say. The
government has pledged to stop the practice by fining the companies
involved.
   ``This is a very sensitive matter,'' said Necdet Kilic, a leader
of the Bulgarian immigrant community. ``We don't want resentments
and bad blood between the people here and the immigrants.''
   Aid to the refugees comes in many forms. On a bulletin board at
the Edirne camp there are letters offering to marry widowed or
single women among the immigrants. One recent offer came from Hasan
Camci, 75, who was looking for a ``suitable mate.''
   At one corner of the camp, next to the water fountains, a local
barber gives free haircuts to new arrivals. Boys get free
circumcision, an Islamic practice banned by the Bulgarians.
   Turkey's workers in Europe, home for the Feast of Sacrifice, one
of Islam's two major holidays, have contributed the equivalent of
$187,000, officials said.
   ``Some people bring a crate of tomatoes, others a few freshly
baked pies,'' said Gov. Erkan.
   Some 400 trucks transport immigrants and their belongings from
the border to other parts of the country. Taking advantage of the
summer season, local authorities have thrown open boarding schools
and university dormitories to arrivals as temporary shelter.
   But ethnic Turks who immigrated earlier and settled mainly in
western parts of the country play the biggest part in the aid effort.
   In the low income Sefakoy district of Istanbul _ where earlier
arrivals from Bulgaria number 9,000 out of a total population of
17,000 _ some families have taken in as many as 40 immigrants.
   Zulkar Ozturk, a 50-year-old retired bus driver, has 14 guests in
his three-room apartment. His retirement salary, equivalent to $110
monthly, barely buys enough bread and potatoes for the group.
   The exodus is expected to continue until Bulgaria closes the
border to protect its economy from labor shortages.
   Turkey is demanding that Bulgaria agree to talks for an
immigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose of
their property and get compensation for benefits such as accumulated
social security. So far, Turkey says, there has been no positive
response from Sofia.
   Turkish officials believe the exodus will keep up until Bulgaria
closes the border to protect its economy from labor shortages.
   ``The moment the harm they are causing us is less than the harm
they are causing themselves economically, the border will be
closed,'' said a Foreign Ministry official on condition of anonymity.
   Western diplomats and journalists say many towns and villages
where ethnic Turks have lived are nearly empty and fields remain
unharvested. Earlier this month Bulgaria issued a decree empowering
authorities to conscript civilians to work in ``emergencies''
threatening the economy.

   Randall Dale Adams refuses to let bitterness
spoil his enjoyment of freedom, even though he served 12{ years in
prison and came within three days of being executed for a murder he
didn't commit.
   ``I hate what happened,'' said Adams, 40, freed in March from a
Texas prison after an appeals court set aside his conviction. ``But
each day is like being granted another day to walk upon the Earth
and bring peace to my family.
   ``If I did hold feelings of bitterness or revenge, I will ruin
whatever future I do have. If you come within three days of being
executed, you better know who you are and you better throw your
animosities out the window.''
   Adams was convicted in the 1976 shooting death of a Dallas police
officer. The case was documented in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which questioned the testimony of prosecution witnesses including
David Ray Harris, who is on death row in Texas for another killing.
In the film, Harris virtually confessed to the 1976 shooting.
   Adams bears no hatred toward Harris, saying: ``I wish him no
harm, but I wish him no luck in life.''
   After the movie was released, a state appeals court overturned
the conviction and Texas authorities dropped the murder charge
instead of retrying Adams, who moved to Columbus, Ohio.
   ``The film proves beyond a shadow of a doubt I did not receive a
fair trial,'' he said. ``It's like watching a bad dream or the last
chapter of `The Twilight Zone.'''
   In his 3{ months of freedom, Adams has lectured and appeared on
television shows such as ``60 Minutes,'' ``Donahue'' and
``Geraldo.'' He is planning a speaking tour on college campuses this
fall while he mulls job offers.
   ``This is a case and a story that must be held before the public.
I want to live my life one day at a time and take the hurt out of my
family's eyes as much as possible,'' Adams said in New York on
Thursday. The same day, he addressed a Cincinnati seminar on the
death penalty.
   Despite his experience, Adams favors capital punishment, although
he thinks lethal injection is more humane than the electric chair he
faced. ``I would not want to look like yesterday's bacon,'' he said.
   Any future books or movies hinge on the outcome of a lawsuit he
filed in June against Errol Morris, the producer of the ``The Thin
Blue Line.''
   While he was in prison and the movie was being made, Adams
accepted a nominal fee of $10 and would have received payments
Morris said would have been ``in the neighborhood of six figures''
if a TV movie or book were forthcoming.
   Adams' suit, which he called an injunction, asked the courts to
declare that he owns his story. His attorney, Randy Schaeffer, said
a settlement has been reached but the papers have not been signed.
   ``I'm perfectly happy to discharge him from the agreement and
give him the rights back if that's what he wishes,'' Morris said
from his Cambridge, Mass., home. ``To say that the rights to his
life story were purchased lock, stock and barrel for $10 is not
true. I didn't become involved in this movie to make money. I wanted
to right a terrible injustice in the courts.''
   Morris said no one was paid to appear in the $1 million movie. He
has appeared at a benefit for Adams in Ohio, and has donated the
film for screenings. He still has $100,000 in debt from the film.
   ``They talk about it like it's `Batman' or `Ghostbusters II.' I
think it's unfortunate this happened,'' Morris said of the lawsuit.
   For his part, Adams said he didn't want to appear ungrateful for
Morris' part in freeing him from prison. But he wanted a legal
declaration so there would be no dispute about who owns the story
rights.
   ``It got blown out of proportion. ... Just let my family have the
right to say yea or nay on any future project. I'm not suing Errol
Morris.
   ``I still consider him a friend and a basic part of my family. I
am not asking for any money or royalties. I am asking him to stand
still until we have this issue settled.''

<TEXT>
   The world's seven industrial giants agree on broad
plans to clean up the global environment, fight drug trafficking and
ease the debt burden of poor nations, but they are leaving it to
others to fill in the details.
   President Bush and the other leaders Sunday ended their two-day
summit earlier than expected and congratulated themselves on how
well they had worked together.
   ``The summit, in my view, was a clear success,'' Bush told
reporters at a news conference on the manicured grounds of the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Paris.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, attending his fifth
conference, said it was ``the one that achieved the largest degree
of consensus.''
   ``It was a splendid summit,'' gushed first-time participant
Sousuke Uno, Japan's embattled prime minister.
   And Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, dismissed
reports she had been snubbed by the French whose birthday bash for
the 200th anniversary of their revolution coincided with the summit.
   ``Indeed, I have received every attention,'' she insisted.
   The leaders' talks, held annually since 1975 to examine the
economies' health, were nearly overshadowed by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who sent a surprise letter urging more
East-West cooperation on economic issues.
   Bush said the letter, addressed to French President Francois
Mitterrand, caught the leaders' attention. ``It was just one more
manifestation of the changing world we're living in,'' Bush said.
   He and others, however, brushed aside suggestions Gorbachev would
find a seat at the summit table next year. ``That's a little
premature,'' Bush said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was pleased the
Kremlin chief recognized ``the responsibility of the Soviet Union in
resolving world economic problems.''
   The summiteers _ representing the United States, Canada, France,
Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan _ picked up on growing public
worries about polluted air, water and land and devoted about a third
of their final 22-page statement to the environment.
   ``Decisive action,'' they said, ``is urgently needed to
understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''
   They condemned dumping wastes in the oceans, spilling oil in the
seas and stripping forests of trees. They worried that excessive
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases could change the world's
climate.
   To arrest the deterioration, they called for more scientific
research to come up with innovative solutions, urged industry to
play its part and supported international efforts to save tropical
rain forests.
   ``This summit marked a watershed in the environment,'' Bush said.
   Environmental groups welcomed the high profile given the
pollution fight but complained about the lack of specific details.
   ``The heads of state have failed to propose the decisive actions
necessary to confront the deteriorating trends,'' said Rafe
Pomerance, senior associate at the World Resources Institute in
Washington.
   The leaders also appealed for ``decisive action'' to stem the
production and demand for illegal narcotics and backed Mrs.
Thatcher's call for a conference next year on the problem.
   They also agreed to set up a task force to come up with ways by
April 1990 to keep drug traffickers from using private banks to
launder, or hide the origin, of their illicit profits.
   Turning to economic issues, they embraced the latest efforts to
help the developing nations in their struggle with $1.3 trillion in
foreign debts. The new strategy, unveiled last March by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness
for those countries.
   ``Our approach to the debt problems has produced significant
results,'' they said, ``but serious challenges remain.''
   They urged bankers to take ``realistic and constructive
approaches'' in negotiations with poorer countries and ``move
promptly'' to wind up those talks on new debt-reduction programs.
   Mexico, the developing world's No. 2 debtor after Brazil, is
expected soon to reach an agreement with its bankers for a new debt
plan. When it does, it will become the first to take advantage of
the Brady plan.
   The ``Summit Seven'' said they saw no recession in sight but
issued a cautionary note about rising inflation in some countries.
   They singled out the United States, Canada and Italy for more
work on reducing their governments' red ink. Japan and Germany, they
said, should take additional steps to reduce their large trade
surpluses.
   The United States will host next year's summit. No place has yet
been picked but Bush hinted his home state of Texas would be a
``distinct possibility.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh, Congress Headed for Power Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is headed
toward a confrontation with Congress over lawmakers' insistence that
they can disapprove plans to reorganize Justice Department offices.
   The dispute was sparked by the FBI's decision this spring to
downgrade its Butte, Mont., field office despite lawmakers'
objections. Congress then banned any further reorganizations in the
department before Sept. 30.
   The disagreement reflects traditional efforts by lawmakers to
preserve federal facilities in their jurisdictions as well as
concern in the executive branch over what Thornburgh regards as a
serious separation-of-powers issue.
   The Justice Department is refusing to promise lawmakers it will
abide by their objections to reorganization plans. That, in turn, is
drawing threats by Congress to extend the prohibition into the next
fiscal year.
   Such a move could further delay Thornburgh's plan to merge 14
organized crime strike forces into local U.S. attorneys' offices, an
idea that is opposed by a number of lawmakers.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday the House
and Senate appropriations subcommittees' insistence on the power to
disapprove reorganization runs afoul of a 1983 Supreme Court ruling
that one-house congressional vetoes were unconstitutional.
   ``It is our intention to work things out with the Congress and
not have things come to a stalemate,'' Runkel said. ``But there are
certain prerogatives of the executive branch. There is concern that
if we are not diligent enough these prerogatives will be eroded.''
   Rep. Neal Smith, an Iowa Democrat who chairs the House
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Justice Department
spending, said Congress will tie Thornburgh's hands unless he heeds
lawmakers' objections to reorganization plans.
   ``There isn't anything to work out,'' Smith said. ``Either they
are going to follow the custom or we will write in language when we
pass appropriation legislation that they can't do anything.''
   Under an informal procedure worked out after the 1983 Supreme
Court decision, administrative agencies give congressional
committees 15 days' notice of any reorganization plans.
   Smith said his subcommittee only rarely disapproves of such
plans, but government agencies have by and large abided by those
legislative decisions.
   But recently, Congress has objected to FBI plans to downgrade the
Butte, Mont., field office to a satellite office and merge the
Savannah, Ga., field office with the agency's Atlanta field office.
   The FBI says it will save $1.2 million over five years by
transferring many of the 50 employees stationed in Butte to Salt
Lake City.
   The Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Justice
Department disapproved the plan to close the Butte field office
after objections were raised by Montana's two senators, Democrat Max
Baucus and Republican Conrad Burns.
   But the FBI went ahead with its plans in Butte.
   Not only were lawmakers enraged by the breach of a custom, but
some legislative feathers were ruffled when first word of the
decision was received by a Republican member of the subcommittee,
Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, instead of its chairman, Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said congressional staffers who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Congress then voted the ban on further reorganization this year.
   Thornburgh, in a recent speech to the American Bar Association,
accused Congress of attempting ``micro management'' of executive
departments.
   He said the temporary reorganization ban ``illustrates at its
worst the kind of difficulty'' that occurs from such attempts, he
said.
   Meanwhile, opponents of Thornburgh's plan to close 14 organized
crime strike forces are eyeing the dispute as a possible opportunity
to tie the attorney general's hand, according to one congressional
source.
   Opponents contend that closing the strike forces will make the
Justice Department less effective in fighting organized crime.
   ``If they are going to play hard ball,'' says one congressional
staffer, ``we have the final way. we can play harder ball.''

   The president of the American Cancer Society
today called for a ``guerrilla war'' to extend cancer therapies to
the poor and minorities, who have the highest death rates in the
country from the disease.
   Though survival rates for many cancers have increased
dramatically, the poor and minorities are not reaping the benefits
``because they are too poor to get early and adequate cancer
treatment,'' said Harold P. Freeman, cancer society president.
   ``For these Americans, a diagnosis of cancer is most often a
needless death sentence,'' Freeman said in introducing a report
based on hearings the society held along with the National Cancer
Institute and the Centers for Disease Control in May and June.
   The cancer society says that in general, half of cancer patients
are expected to survive their disease. However, Americans living
below the poverty line have a cancer survival rate 10 to 15 percent
below that for other Americans, Freeman said.
   The society estimates that 178,000 people with cancer who might
be saved through early diagnosis and treatment will die this year.
   The regional hearings found that poor Americans are forced to
accept substandard health care services and make extraordinary
sacrifices to obtain and pay for the care, the report said.
   ``Based on the findings of this report, we need to declare a new
kind of war on cancer _ a guerrilla war _ that will tear down the
economic and cultural barriers to early and adequate cancer
prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and dramatically increase
cancer survival rates for all Americans,'' Freeman said.
   The society distributed its report to President Bush,
congressional leaders and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan.
   The cancer society also said it is committing $2.8 million for
national demonstration programs in Harlem, Miami and Oakland,
Calif., to develop cancer education and detection programs for the
poor. The funds also will be used to support local education and
research activities targeted to the poor nationwide.
   ``Poor people endure greater pain and suffering from cancer than
other Americans,'' the report said.
   Because they lack access to quality health care, their cancer is
more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stages when treatment
options are more limited and survival rates are lowest, it said.
   The poor also are less aware of the warning signs of cancer and
the medical system discourages preventive health care, which means
patients often wait until their health problems are unbearable
before they seek treatment, the report said.
   For the 37 million people who have no health insurance and do not
qualify for Medicaid, the emergency room becomes their entry to the
health care system. They are often referred to hospital outpatient
clinics oriented more to teaching than to caring for patients, the
report said.
   Fewer than 45 percent of those living below the federal poverty
level are eligible for Medicaid, the report said. Patients are often
driven into poverty to get treatment for their disease, but for many
poor and near-poor people, a stigma against public assistance
prevents them from applying for benefits, it said.
   The poor are also ``dumped'' in public hospitals that serve the
medically indigent and seldom have any continuity of care, a major
problem with cancer since the disease often requires long-term
treatment, the report said.

<HEAD>Lobbyist Linked to Sex Scandal Had Lucrative Foreign Consulting Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lucrative consulting business as a registered
foreign agent helped fuel the lavish lifestyle of Craig J. Spence,
the flamboyant lobbyist now under investigation in Washington's male
prostitution scandal.
   Justice Department records show that Spence, a former television
reporter with political connections in the Orient, was paid
thousands of dollars by Japanese business and political interests in
the 1980s to open the right doors in Washington for his clients.
   Spence, 48, has been linked by The Washington Times to a
homosexual prostitution ring that is under investigation by U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens and the Secret Service.
   The Times, citing credit card records, reported that Spence spent
as much as $20,000 a month on male escort services run by the ring,
which was raided by police in February. It also quoted unidentified
male prostitutes and others as saying Spence had his house bugged.
   While Spence has been unavailable for comment on the allegations
_ repeated calls to his home have gone unanswered _ Justice
Department records reveal that he earned fat fees from the Japanese
for arranging seminars and hosting luncheons and dinners.
   During the early years of the Reagan administration, in
particular, Spence cultivated top political appointees, leading
academics, military officials, journalists and members of Congress,
often entertaining them at the expense of the Japanese.
   Spence's major client was The Policy Study Group, a non-profit
research and information group based in Tokyo and headed by Motoo
Shiina, a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
   The study group, financed by Japanese business interests and
affiliated with the party, agreed in July 1979 to pay Spence roughly
$8,000 a month for an unlimited period, plus travel and other
business expenses.
   In a six-month period in 1982, for instance, Spence received
$48,000 from the group.
   In exchange, Spence agreed to ``conduct research projects on
political economic issues,'' and ``arrange meetings and seminars to
discuss ... issues as requested by the foreign principal.''
   From all accounts, Spence did his job for his handsome salary,
hosting lavish parties and arranging seminars on serious topics such
as trade and economics.
   Spence's seminars at local universities frequently featured
well-known speakers. James Lilley, now the U.S. ambassador to China,
delivered two speeches in 1980, one entitled ``Problems of Off-Shore
China Oil.''
   Others attending Spence's seminars included Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio; Gaston Sigur, a former assistant secretary of state; Dimitri
Simes, a respected academic and Soviet expert; Philip Geyelin,
former editorial page editor of The Washington Post and now a
columnist for the newspaper; and Victor Kamber, a political
consultant.
   Spence also arranged trips to Japan for a number of well-known
people, including television correspondent Eric Sevareid, who spoke
on the ``Mood in America''; former Ambassador Robert Neumann, and
Karl Inderfurth, former deputy staff director of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and now an ABC television correspondent in
Moscow. Spence himself had worked for ABC in the 1960s before
developing his consulting business.
   Not everyone was keen on Spence's association with the Japanese,
although many believed they might benefit from having him provide an
entree into Japanese business and political circles. Former U.S.
Attorney Joseph diGenova, for example, went to Japan with Spence in
hopes of attracting business as a private attorney in Tokyo.
   But veteran journalist Sarah McClendon, who was paid $400 by
Spence to write a profile of an administration official, said she
was upset in January 1982 when she learned Spence had listed her on
his foreign agents' form.
   She said in a letter to the Standing Committee of Correspondents
in the Senate that she decided not to write more profiles after
learning one she had completed had been forwarded to Tokyo.
   That was not the end of Spence's association with the Japanese.
In 1986, Spence provided services to the Japan External Trade
Organization. He was paid $2,000 in May 1986 for drafting and
editing a speech, documents show.
   But that relationship ended and by July 1987, Spence was no
longer a registered foreign agent.

<HEAD>Spotlight Brings Mixed Reviews for HUD's Inspector General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Adams says he has James Watt to thank _ or
blame _ for the spotlight the low-key inspector general at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development finds himself under
these days.
   ``News is driven by personalities,'' Adams said last week. ``I
think absent Jim Watt this thing would have been quickly forgotten.
He's such a controversial individual, a lightning rod.''
   Adams finds himself ensnarled in controversy as the problems at
the multibillion-dollar agency during the Reagan administration come
under scrutiny by Congress, the Justice Department and new HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Adams and his investigators and auditors reported several years
ago on many of the abuses now under investigation. Some of those
doing the investigating, particularly members of Congress, say Adams
should have done more to bring attention to the problems.
   He dismisses such criticism and implicitly blames members of
Congress for ignoring his semiannual reports to the House and
Senate, which summarized the findings of the major audits.
   ``In hindsight people can say you should have been screaming and
beating on the table,'' Adams said in an interview. ``We don't have
crystal balls. We're not Solomons in this process ... I have to
develop the facts and present them and let other people make the
decisions. That's how the process was designed to work.''
   It took a voluminous report on a rehabilitation program
administered by HUD to get the work of Adams and his staff noticed.
   The April report said inflated rents were costing HUD millions of
dollars and that former department officials and influential
Republicans _ like former Interior Secretary Watt _ were able to win
much of the funding for projects.
   Since then virtually all of the department's major programs have
come under scrutiny and many have been found to have been
mismanaged, defrauded or seemingly affected by influence-peddling.
   Adams has been a busy man, appearing before Congress, meeting
with Kemp's staff to suggest reforms and dealing with a deluge of
media requests for his time and reports.
   Suddenly the scores of reports compiled in his four years as the
agency's inspector general are being taken seriously.
   ``I think what is occurring today is bearing out our position,''
he said when asked whether the attention had brought him any
satisfaction. ``I'm not sure I would refer to it as a personal
satisfaction but I think there is certainly an organizational
satisfaction and a recognition of the hard work the staff has done.''
   He credits Kemp for revived morale at HUD, which suffered funding
and staff cuts in the Reagan years.
   And he blames the laissez-faire style of former Secretary Samuel
Pierce for poor agency management and accounting that allowed the
abuses and is likely to cost the government $2 billion or more.
   One fear Adams has about the current focus on HUD is that the
role of influence-peddling will obscure what he believes is the
greater issue _ ``the money that's out there.''
   In the audit of the moderate rehabilitation program, auditors
found HUD was in many cases paying developers too much in rent
subsidies.
   The subsidies ``should be adjusted because over the life of those
subsidies, the 15-year life, is about a half-billion dollars in
overpayments,'' he said.
   At 51, Adams already has 33 years as a government worker under
his belt. He had planned to retire at the end of last year but
decided to stay on to complete the audit of the rehabilitation
program. He now plans to ride out the current controversy for a
while and retire at the end of this year.

<HEAD>Soviet Farms Dwarf US Family Enterprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major new reference by the Agriculture
Department shows that the Soviet Union has about 1.5 billion acres
of agricultural land spread among huge farms that dwarf most
American enterprises.
   For example, the average size of state-owned farms in the Soviet
Union is almost 40,000 acres. Collective farms operated
cooperatively by families average nearly 16,000 acres each.
   In all, the Soviet Union in 1985 _ the most recent figures
tabulated _ had 22,690 state farms and 26,660 collectives. No
figures were available for private plots.
   According to USDA estimates for last year, the United States had
999 million acres in about 2.16 million farms, virtually all
privately owned and operated as family enterprises. Those averaged
463 acres each.
   The new booklet published by the department's Economic Research
Service is the first revision of statistics for Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union since 1983, said Nancy J. Cochrane, who coordinated
the project.
   New tables have been added on farm structure for selected
countries, and these reflect some of the recent wave of reforms in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   No comparisons are made between those countries and the United
States, however, and many of the units are in the metric system. For
example, hectares are used for land area, with one hectare equal to
2.47 acres. Production is in metric tons of 2,205 pounds each, and
per capita consumption in kilograms of about 2.2 pounds each.
   Besides the Soviet Union, seven Eastern European countries are
included: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Romania and Yugoslavia. Albania was omitted.
   Official statistical sources of the countries were used as the
primary source of information, along with some supplemental sources.
However, Cochrane noted that ``data on Albania were too scarce to
include.''
   The 129-page booklet shows some of the many changes and
differences that have occurred in agriculture in the Soviet bloc
since 1965.
   In the past, it was a common practice for all the countries
except Yugoslavia to distinguish between two types of socialized
farms, state and collective, or cooperative.
   ``This system has been changing in many of the countries since
the early 1970s,'' Cochrane said in the booklet's introduction.
``Bulgaria has abolished the system altogether in favor of
agro-industrial complexes.''
   She added: ``Some of the distinctions between state and
cooperative farms have been blurred in all the countries. Wages, for
example, are increasingly linked to productivity, even on the state
farms.''
   In addition to the socialized agriculture, each country permits a
certain amount of private farming. Except for Yugoslavia and Poland,
it involves mostly small plots, usually half a hectare (about 1.25
acres), allotted to collective farm members, state farm employees
and certain other individuals.
   The private plots make up 2.7 percent of the arable land in the
Soviet Union, as much as 13 percent in Bulgaria and Hungary, and 14
percent in Romania.
   ``Despite its small share of the arable land, the private sector
in these countries can contribute as much as 25 percent to 35
percent of gross agricultural output,'' Cochrane said. ``Plotholders
tend to specialize in labor-intensive lines of production such as
livestock products and fruits and vegetables.''
   Agriculture in Yugoslavia and Poland is dominated by small,
privately owned farms. In 1985, those accounted for 77 percent of
the arable land in Poland and 80 percent in Yugoslavia, and their
shares of gross farm output were 78 percent and 69 percent,
respectively.
   Private farms in both countries are very small, averaging less
than 5 hectares, or about 12 acres, in Poland, and only 2.5
hectares, or a little more than six acres, in Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Concerns Raised Over Foreign Airlines Buying Into U.S. Carriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department and a
congressional committee are looking into the increasing sales of
U.S. airlines stock to foreign carriers.
   Foreign airlines already have gained minority interests in
America West, Hawaiian, Continental and Delta airlines, and KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines has a $400 million share in the planned
takeover of Northwest Airlines by a California investor.
   ``It's a phenomenon that's coming on like a train,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said Friday at a Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee hearing prompted by the Northwest takeover
bid. The committee is considering a bill by McCain and committee
chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., to require Transportation Department
approval for all airline acquisitions.
   The proposed takeover of Northwest's parent company, NWA Inc., by
Wings Holdings Inc., headed by Los Angeles businessman Alfred
Checchi, would be the first leveraged buyout in the airline
industry. Other investors, including the Dutch airlines, are
involved in the deal with Checchi.
   Ford said the trend of investors looking to take over healthy
airlines is ``very disturbing.'' He said it could lead to newly
acquired major carriers selling international routes, delaying
purchase of new aircraft, cutting corners on safety or forcing wage
reductions to meet the demands of new owners.
   He said foreign investments in airlines are developing without
any formal government policy review.
   Jeffrey N. Shane, assistant transportation secretary, said the
department already has sufficient power to head off undesirable
takeovers with its ``fitness review'' process. A takeover that
doesn't pass likely won't take place, Shane said, because investors
will back out.
   But Shane acknowledged growing concern in the department about
foreign investments in U.S. airlines. The department last week sent
a letter to Checchi asking several questions about the degree of
foreign involvement in his plans to take over Northwest.
   The law limits foreign ownership of airlines to 25 percent and
does not allow more than one-third of the board membership to be
foreigners.
   But Shane said control, not share of ownership, is the critical
issue.
   Ansett Airlines of Australia has a 20 percent interest in America
West, a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines owns 20 percent of Hawaiian
Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System controls 9 percent of
Continental, and Swissair recently acquired 5 percent of Delta,
Shane said.
   ``There's nothing inherently wrong with these acquisitions,''
Shane said. ``But the worry is when foreign airlines exercise more
control than U.S. airlines.''
   Shane said the proposed KLM investment in Northwest has the
potential of giving the Dutch carrier, which is partly government
owned, a strong say in Northwest affairs, since it will hold 68
percent of the equity in the airline.
   Even though KLM's voting stock would only amount to 5 percent and
it would have only one member on the Northwest board, ``can we say
it won't be in control?'' Shane asked.
   He said foreign airlines could use their interest in U.S.
carriers to gain a foothold in U.S. markets.

<HEAD>Governor's Race, Legislative Sessions Preview Abortion Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A governor's race and a handful of legislative
sessions this fall are expected to give an early preview of the
state-level warfare predicted next year in the wake of the Supreme
Court's abortion decision.
   The high court's ruling this month handing states greater
authority to restrict abortions has thrust the emotionally charged
issue into the New Jersey statehouse race and promises to make it a
major factor in many of the 36 governor slots at stake next year.
   The ruling also has galvanized anti-abortion lawmakers across the
country, with the earliest battles expected in Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Florida and several other states with legislatures
scheduled to meet this fall.
   Burke Balch, state legislative coordinator for the National Right
To Life Committee, said a wide range of proposals to restrict
abortion will come before legislatures starting in September.
   ``What we've seen here is an unshackling of the state
legislatures,'' he said. ``But the assumption that ... you're
suddenly going to see all sorts of states automatically enacting
protective legislation is an oversimplification of the challenges we
face. There are not a lot of states that are locked up for either
side.''
   The National Abortion Rights Action League will try to stave off
anti-abortion offensives this year at the state level and will plan
a more aggressive strategy for 1990, said Nancy Broff, the group's
political and legislative director.
   In New Jersey, NARAL plans to make abortion a central factor in
the gubernatorial race between Reps. James Florio and Jim Courter.
Florio, a Democrat, has said he would veto Webster-like restrictions
while Courter, an anti-abortion Republican, has backed off and said
he would not lobby the Legislature for restrictions.
   New Jersey is among five states _ also including California,
Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont _ where state supreme courts
have ruled that abortion rights are guaranteed by the state
constitution. And in Florida, a doctor-legislator who performs
abortions has suggested amending that state's constitutional privacy
clause to add reproductive rights.
   But for the most part, the ball is in the anti-abortion court.
Lawmakers in Pennsylvania plan to have a series of bills ready when
the Legislature returns Sept. 18 from its summer recess.
   Rep. Stephen Freind, who has led abortion fights in the state for
a decade, said he intends to introduce measures to outlaw
sex-selection abortions, fetal tissue experimentation and fetal
transplants. Also, he wants to require spousal notification, require
waiting periods except in medical emergencies, and require extensive
informed consent that includes a description of fetal development.
   Other states are considering similar restrictions, Balch said.
   Some of the proposals have been struck down previously by the
Supreme Court or vetoed on grounds of earlier high court rulings.
   But Freind said, ``A lot of things will be coming back now. That
was the old court and this is the new court. The court is saying you
can regulate (abortion) and restrict it and in some cases outlaw it
as long as there is a rational basis for doing it.''
   The 1989 legislative outlook in other key states:
   _Florida: Gov. Bob Martinez says he will call a special session
this fall to deal with abortion. However, this does not guarantee a
change in law because the Legislature is considered about evenly
split.
   _Illinois: The Legislature returns in October to reconsider bills
vetoed by the governor. Anti-abortion lawmakers are planning an
offensive.
   _Minnesota: The Legislature returns in September for a special
session that Gov. Rudy Perpich wants to limit to a property tax
proposal. Committee leaders could thwart efforts by anti-abortion
forces, who are in the majority.
   _Louisiana: The state House overwhelmingly approved a resolution
asking prosecutors to enforce anti-abortion laws passed before the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The New Orleans
district attorney asked a federal judge to reinstate a law that
makes abortions illegal.
   _Texas: Gov. Bill Clements says if there is a special session
before the Legislature returns in January 1991, he would consider
adding abortion to the agenda. The body is in special session now
but is expected to leave this week without taking up abortion.

<HEAD>Biologists Hope to Unravel Mysteries of Lobster Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine lobstermen are laying three times as
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in
test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't
increased in 20 years.
   Marine biologists from the University of Maine and Bigelow
Laboratory in West Boothbay are conducting a 10-day research cruise
next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual
catch.
   The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist
biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation
will lead to bigger catches.
   Lobster production is vital to Maine's economy, not least because
of its contribution to tourism.
   ``We want to make sure that resource is around a thousand years
from now. It's so much a part of our income, our history and our
art, it's just incredibly important to us,'' said Dave Dow, director
of the Lobster Institute, a trade organization affiliated with the
University of Maine.
   The harvest of the ``bugs,'' as they are affectionately called by
lobstermen, has remained at about 21 million pounds per year during
the past two decades, despite legal, scientific, and practical
measures to increase it.
   Biologists at the Cutler Marine Hatchery have coaxed thousands of
lobster eggs to grow at a quickened rate in warm-water tanks and
then stocked coastal waters with the immature larvae.
   State legislators have gradually increased the minimum size
limit, hoping more females would mature and reproduce.
   And lobstermen have worked harder; they haul about triple the
number of traps they put out 20 years ago. But the lobsters have
refused to take the extra bait, according to the Lobster Institute.
   In next month's cruise, five scientists aboard the research
vessel Argo Maine will survey four major lobstering sites in the
Gulf of Maine.
   They will use sonar to determine the sea bottom's
characteristics; search for and count larval lobsters; scuba dive to
survey lobster densities, shelter sizes and abundance of predators;
and sample ocean bottom sediment for invertebrates.
   The investigation could affect where lobstermen set their traps,
as well as plans to stock coastal waters, said Dave Cousins, a
lobsterman from South Thomaston, 75 miles northeast of Portland.
   University of Maine marine biologist Robert Steneck, one of the
project leaders, has sought for eight years to explain the static
harvest.
   ``His theory operates on the premise that something in nature
limits our productivity out there,'' Dow said.
   The limiting factor could be the amount of suitable habitat the
lobsters can live in, the amount of food available for the
creatures, or the ecological balance of lobsters and their
predators, Dow said.
   The lobsters go through three planktonic, or swimming stages,
before they are ready to settle on the sea bottom, and the suitable
bottom habitat is distributed in patches along the shoreline.
   ``If Mother Nature, because of the way she works the tides and
currents, doesn't allow delivery to the appropriate habitats, that's
going to be important for the overall production,'' Dow said.
   The public's appetite for lobster is matched by the appetites of
various marine creatures, he said.
   ``There's a million lobster-seeking missiles waiting for those
little fellows to hit the bottom ... these little fellows are
subject to thousands of attacks a day.''
   Large codfish have been found to contain up to a dozen lobsters
when they are cut open, Dow said.

   Two Cuban-born women lead the crowded field of
candidates to succeed the late U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper, in an
election that is revealing how the district has changed since Pepper
began representing it in 1962.
   The Republican Party, enjoying an unprecedented 10-8 majority in
Florida's congressional delegation, wants to make it 11-8 by winning
the Aug. 29 special election. Democrats believe a victory could
start a comeback and boost their chances of unseating Republican
Gov. Bob Martinez in 1990.
   Pepper was an old-style liberal who won 14 terms in the House
district by emphasizing social programs benefitting the elderly, for
many years the dominant group in his electorate.
   While the district still includes many older people, half the
residents now are Hispanics, mostly refugees from Castro's Cuba and
their offspring. Pepper catered to their strong anti-communist
feelings while maintaining his liberal social program.
   Pepper died May 30 at age 88, and no single Democrat has emerged
from the balkanized local party to replace him. Two of the early
Democratic front-runners have dropped from the race.
   If current polls hold true, state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a
conservative Republican, would win the seat that includes most of
Miami and surrounding communities to become the first Cuban-American
in Congress.
   Both parties are holding primaries Aug. 1, with runoffs, if
necessary, on Aug. 15.
   ``We're very confident about the campaign,'' Ros-Lehtinen last
week. ``We're going to have a good solid victory in the primary and
we think the primary's going to be a very bitter one for the
Democrats.''
   Businessman Carlos Perez, a millionaire businessman and
fund-raiser for former National Security Council adviser Oliver
North, is her strongest rival. The field also includes insurance
broker David Fleischer and former North Miami Mayor John Stembridge.
   Ros-Lehtinen is starting the campaign with a $200,000 war chest
that she expects to grow to at least $650,000. Her television
commercials, the campaign's first, will begin airing this week.
   Miami City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy, also Cuban-born, is the
early favorite for the Democratic nomination, with strong labor
backing.
   Jo Ann Pepper, the late congressman's niece and a 17-year federal
probation officer, is running against Kennedy with a strong
law-and-order campaign that promises SWAT teams patrolling the
streets.
   Other Democratic candidates include former Florida Bar
Association president Gerald Richman, businessman Bernard Anscher,
black intellectual Marvin Dunn, realtor Sonny Wright, and Eastern
Airlines pilot John Paul Rosser.
   Nearly as notable as the Democrats who are running are those who
aren't.
   State Sen. Jack Gordon, a liberal from Miami Beach who was the
early leader when he announced his candidacy June 13, dropped out
the same week after claiming that comments by Republican National
Committee Chairman Lee Atwater were fueling ethnic tensions. Atwater
had said it was time to elect a Cuban-American to Congress.
   Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, another strong runner in the early
going, became angered by the party's inability to reduce the field.
He left, saying he would bypass the ``big mess.''
   Other dropouts include State Sen. Carrie Meek, Cuban-born banker
Raul Masvidal, and sports attorney Jeffrey Allen, who was forced to
leave the race when it was disclosed he is a registered Republican.

   Here are excerpts from the communique issued Sunday
by the seven leaders of the richest democracies at the end of the
15th economic summit.
   ``These summits have permitted effective consultations, offered
the opportunity to launch initiatives and to strengthen
international cooperation.
   ``Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving the
efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening our
cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the medium
term, the current buoyant investment seen during this period should
pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help
reduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however,
without risks.
   ``Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has been
contained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and
monetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required and
inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firm
policy response so that it will be put on a downward path.
   ``All our countries share the responsibility for the sound
development of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficit
countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their
external adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have to
contribute to sustaining global expansion trough policies providing
favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.
   ``It is important to continue, and where appropriate, to develop
this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning
and the stability of the International Monetary System in a manner
consistent with economic fundamentals.
   ``The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade
is a cause of concern. ... We recommend ... policies to encourage
saving and remove hindrances where they exist.
   ``World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionism
remains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to
fight it in all its forms.
   ``We shall help developing countries by opening the world trading
system and by supporting their structural adjustment.
   ``We urge developing countries to implement sound economic
policies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial and
fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth
and the return of flight capital.
   ``We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in
their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to
conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction,
debt service reduction and new money. We stress that official
creditors should not substitute for private lenders. Our governments
are prepared to consider as appropriate tax, regulatory and
accounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessary
obstacles to debt and debt service reductions.
   ``Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect
the Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve the
common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment
in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry
out obligations to future generations.
   ``Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade,
development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning.
Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into account
into economic decision-making.
   ``We encourage the World Bank and regional development banks to
integrate environmental considerations into their activities.
International organizations, such as the OECD and the United Nations
and its affiliated organizations, will be asked to develop further
techniques of analysis which would help governments assess
appropriate economic measures to promote the quality of the
environment.
   ``The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming and
calls for prompt action.
   ``We are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards
for nuclear power plants and to strengthening international
cooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management,
and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role in
limiting output of greenhouse gases.
   ``Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed.
   ``Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the world
as a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of developing
countries to make use of their natural resources, we encourage,
through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the protection of all
the species therein and the traditional rights to land and other
resources of local communities.
   ``Temperate forests, lakes and rivers must be protected against
the effects of acid pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides. It is necessary to pursue actively the bilateral and
multilateral efforts to this end.
   ``We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds for
polluting waste.
   ``We express our concern that national, regional and global
capabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritime
oil spills be improved. We urge all countries to make better use of
the latest monitoring and cleanup technologies.
   ``The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We stress
the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and an
international basis. We urge all countries, especially those where
drug production, trading and consumption are large, to join our
efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to carry
forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering
of its proceeds.
   ``Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures within
relevant fora:
   _Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programs
for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries.
   _Support the efforts of producing countries who ask for
assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.
   _Strengthen the role of the United Nations in the war against
drugs through an increase in its resources and through reinforced
effectiveness of its operation.
   _Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of
addiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.
   _Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine
and drug demand reduction.
   _Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual
assistance on these issues....
   _Convene a financial action task force from summit participants
and other countries interested in these problems.
   ``We have accepted the invitation of the president of the United
States to meet next year in the United States of America.''

   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony
Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   There, Bush will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.
   Bush said in Paris on Sunday he was weighing different ideas.
   At Cape Canaveral, Armstrong, told 6,000 flag-waving space
workers and their families Sunday that they should ``allow ourselves
just a touch of pride, a touch of satisfaction, that we were
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era.''
   He said historians in future centuries will identify the 20th
century ``as the time when the human species broke the bonds of
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet.''
   In brief remarks, Aldrin, who walked on the moon with Armstrong,
and Collins, who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship, looked
to future space exploration.
   ``One of these years, and I hope it won't be too long, this
country will decide to press on again far out into space, perhaps to
the planet Mars,'' Collins said.
   Aldrin said NASA's Freedom space station, to be assembled in
orbit in the mid-1990s, should serve as a stepping stone to a manned
lunar base and human flights to Mars.
   He called President John F. Kennedy's commitment to the moon
landing goal 28 years ago ``a starter's gun for our pioneering giant
leap for mankind.''
   ``We're not yet ready for that go again. But perhaps we are at
the starting line, prepared to take our marks or get set,'' Aldrin
said.
   Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a
20-mile-motorcade from the space center to Cocoa Beach, where they
attended a luncheon in their honor. An estimated 10,000 people lined
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures.
   For Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, the ceremony was the second
stop on a week-long sentimental journey that began Saturday with a
visit to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where
their Saturn 5 rocket was designed.
   In Huntsville on Sunday, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean had a more
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future.
   Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, said that until the
Soviet Union decides to put a man on the moon or take some other
such step, Americans will be complacent about their space
achievements.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   Bean, who walked on the moon on Nov. 19, 1969, and later flew
aboard Skylab 3 for 59 days in 1973, said he didn't want to see
another 1960s-style space race.
   ``I'd rather have space cooperation. I'd think that would be much
better for the Earth,'' he said.

   For the European Economic Community, the Paris
summit of the world's major industrialized nations is a coming of
age for a participant once viewed as a gate-crasher at these annual
events.
   The summit that ended Sunday asked the EEC to coordinate a
sustained Western effort to bring food to Poland and trade
opportunities to Hungary to reward these nations for pushing through
democratic and economic reforms.
   ``This is the recognition of the increased weight and importance
of the EEC in world affairs,'' said Claus Ehlermann, the spokesman
for EEC Commission President Jacques Delors, who represented the EEC
at the three-day summit.
   The EEC's executive commission has attended the annual meetings
of the leaders of the United States, Canada, France, Britain, West
Germany, Italy and Japan since 1977. But to date, the summits have
largely ignored the EEC's role as the world's largest trade bloc.
   Instead, they focused exclusively on ways to harmonize the
economic and monetary policies of the world's seven major
industrialized nations.
   But in a declaration on East-West relations issued Saturday, the
summit asked the EEC to organize, within weeks, a meeting of western
nations interested in helping Poland and Hungary.
   Sunday's final communique praised the European Monetary System
for having brought monetary stability to Europe, stressed that the
EEC's plan for a borderless EEC by 1992 will lead to more trade, and
welcomed the community's recent initiative to improve trade links
with the non-EEC nations in Europe.
   On all these points the EEC was mentioned by name.
   By comparison, the communique issued after the 1988 summit in
Toronto mentioned the EEC only once, in an annex paper.
   For the EEC, Paris in 1988 is a far cry from London, 1977, when
the EEC first joined the seven-nation summits as an observer,
despite objections by then-French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   The French leader felt the EEC was pushing its way onto the world
stage for no good reason. He boycotted the summit's opening dinner
to protest the presence at the table of then-EEC Commission
President Roy Jenkins.
   At later meals, Giscard d'Estaing rejoined his counterparts as
Jenkins was relegated to eat with the foreign ministers who always
meet in the margin of each summit.
   Referring to the EEC's growing economic clout in recent years,
``the psychological climate has changed,'' Delors told reporters of
the EEC's new stature at the summit.
   ``The EEC is no longer what it was five years ago. The seven
(summit nations) have paid tribute to the EMS (European Monetary
System) and its stability.''
   Delors is the key driving force behind the EEC's single market
project that is rapidly nearing its Dec. 31, 1992, implementation
date.
   He also is pushing for economic and monetary union among the 12
EEC states that would give them a central bank and, eventually, a
single currency.
   Delors told reporters it was only natural for the EEC to
coordinate western food aid for Poland and trade assistance to
Hungary, saying, ``As Europeans we have special duties to other
Europeans.''
   In 1988, the EEC signed a trade and cooperation agreement with
Hungary and Czechoslovakia and is negotiating similar accords with
other East European nations, including the Soviet Union.
   In the case of Hungary, Delors said, the focus of western aid
should be on more trade opportunities through joint ventures.
   The food aid program for Poland, called for by the Paris summit,
could last as long as two years, Delors said. And EEC External
Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen said it could be fully
underway as early as this autumn.
   Poland suffers from shortages, aggravated by a poor distribution
system that encourages hoarding, drives up prices and fuels
inflation.
   Delors said Poland will not get an emergency food aid package.
The plan will include food but will also show Polish officials how
to establish and maintain a distribution system ``to avoid food
deficiencies and control inflation.''
   ``There will be no manna from heaven coming down, but we do want
to help,'' Delors said.

   Conductor Herbert von Karajan, the
brilliant and revered maestro who stirred millions with his music
and inflamed passions with his stormy life, is dead at age 81.
   He was perhaps the world's most honored, prolific and well-known
conductor.
   Karajan, who resigned as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic on
April 24 after 34 years, died Sunday at his home in Anif near
Salzburg, said Albert Moser, the president of the Salzburg Festival.
   Austrian television said the cause of death was heart failure but
festival organizers could not confirm it.
   The conductor's membership in the Nazi Party during World War II
and his volatile temper made him a figure of controversy throughout
his life.
   But fellow musicians adored his artistry _ and his more than 800
recordings sold 150 million copies, the most by any conductor.
   Karajan resigned from the Berlin Philharmonic during a dispute
over his contract, but cited health reasons for his decision. He had
long been ill and severe back pain made it difficult for him to walk
unaided to the podium.
   Despite his illness, Karajan had regularly attended rehearsals
for the festival, Austria's largest cultural event, and was to have
conducted the opening opera on July 27, Moser said.
   A black flag hung from the festival building on Sunday, and
Austrian television said celebrations that were to follow the
premier had been canceled.
   American conductor Erich Leinsdorf, referring to Karajan's
resignation, said: ``I think he must have died from the frustration
of his recent experiences. He died a psychological death.''
   Karajan himself once said: ``When I can no longer make music,
then I no longer want to be.''
   His sometimes stormy ``marriage for life'' with the Berlin
Philharmonic was one of the most highly publicized, deeply analyzed
and perhaps least understood relationships in the music world.
   Salzburg's most famous son after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Karajan
was described by friends as a shy, introverted, somewhat solitary
man. Detractors called him arrogant and greedy.
   Karajan's membership in the Nazi Party in World War II caused him
to be banned from performing for two years and forever boycotted by
some Jewish musicians.
   Violent demonstrations marred his first U.S. tour with the Berlin
Philharmonic in the 1954-55 season.
   But nobody disputed his genius. Karajan, a 40-year devotee of
yoga and Zen Buddhism, often conducted with his piercing blue eyes
closed, insisting it helped him establish a psychic bond with the
orchestra.
   ``I am much more with the musicians if I have my eyes shut,''
Karajan was quoted as saying in Helena Matheopoulos' 1981 book,
``Maestro.''
   American singer Jessye Norman, in Paris for France's bicentennial
celebrations, said in a statement: ``Herbert von Karajan always
rolled out a magic carpet for us, the singers. It was enough for us
to take our place, and with him, our musical work took on another
dimension.''
   Born April 5, 1908, in Salzburg, the son of a doctor, Karajan
made his debut at age 5, when he played Mozart on the piano at a
charity concert.
   ``I set the goal for myself very early on not to fritter away one
minute of my life, and I've achieved that,'' Karajan said in 1983.
   A thirst for adventure often put Karajan at the controls of jets,
fast cars and racing yachts. He climbed mountains and skied down the
snowy summits near the Swiss resort of St. Moritz, where he kept one
of his three homes.
   Karajan, who considered Arturo Toscanini his idol, studied in
Vienna but forged his career in Germany, where his first engagement
was at the Stadttheater of Ulm.
   At 27, he went to Aachen and became Germany's youngest general
music director.
   Friends said Karajan joined the Nazi Party to avoid the wrath of
Adolf Hitler and his henchmen, who expected party membership of the
top cultural figures under their rule.
   But Karajan was among the celebrities accused of collaboration
after the war and was forced to submit to a two-year ban on
performing imposed by the Allies.
   In 1946, Karajan became conductor of the Vienna Symphony
Orchestra. In 1948, he began conducting at the Salzburg Festival.
   In 1955, he was appointed conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.
   Through the years, Karajan's temper led to a number of feuds with
leading singers and run-ins with the media, which he accused of
portraying him unfairly.
   In later years, Karajan had to fight off illness on several
occasions, and reportedly needed pain-killing injections between
pieces at some concerts because of displaced discs digging into his
spinal cord.
   Severe back pains increasingly reduced the number of Karajan's
appearances. However, Salzburg Festival officials said he had been
regularly attending rehearsals for Verdi's opera ``The Masked
Ball,'' with Placido Domingo.
   Karajan is survived by his third wife, the French-born Eliette
Mouret, and two daughters, Isabelle and Arabelle.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Suspended Priest Plans Second Church, School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest suspended for forming
the unauthorized African-American Catholic Congregation is
considering starting a second church as well as a school, day care
center and housing for the homeless.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr. was quoted in The Washington
Post today as saying the new church would be called the Umoja Temple.
   He said he is looking for a 25-acre site where he can build a
permanent facility for his new African-American church, known as the
Imani Temple.
   Stallings told the Post he plans to build a school, day care
center, administrative offices, temporary housing for the homeless
and permanent housing for senior citizens on the site.
   On Sunday, about 2,500 people attended services at the Imani
Temple, which Stallings contends is a brand of Catholicism that
better serves blacks.
   After the first services on July 2, Stallings was suspended by
the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Washington from leading mass or
performing Catholic sacraments.
   Stallings accuses the church of failing to address the needs of
its black parishioners. He wants to form an African-American
Catholic rite, which he says would still be part of the Catholic
church.
   Last week, 13 black Catholic bishops asked Stallings to abandon
his movement, saying they deplored his separation ``from the unity
of the church.''
   But Stallings told his congregation Sunday that he is following
God's direction, ``and God didn't tell me what bishop I should be
listening to.''

   Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most
same of them all?
   At the 25th Twin-O-Rama on Sunday in the southwestern Wisconsin
community, judges declared Darrell and Dennis Carlson as the most
identical of dozens of adult identical twins.
   ``We're both professional clowns. We both retired from the
telephone company after 31 years of service. We both had 23-year-old
sons. We both drive Ford Econoline vans,'' said Darrell Carlson, 51.
``Our interests are so much alike it's almost scary.''
   They beat out Lori and Lisa Erschenbarr, who used an elaborate
ruse. One sister injured an ankle, so her twin put on an identical
bandage and walked with an identical pair of crutches.
   The 24-year-old sisters, who have won the most-identical twins
prize five times, wore matching lavender blouses and skirts, the
same flowers in their hair and matching bandages on their left
ankles. Both carried a pair of aluminum crutches.
   About 250 pairs of identical twins competed in 14 different
categories, including babies, adults and twins who look the least
alike.
   In some cases, judges counted freckles.

   Sen. Jim Exon calls himself a ``soup nut,''
but a chili cook-off was a little out of his league.
   Exon said he makes a mean vegetable beef soup, but his debut as
chief judge at Saturday's Oregon Trail Days' chili cook-off had his
head spinning because of complex judging instructions and strict
guidelines.
   ``I'm not used to things this complicated. This is much more
complicated than the Strategic Defense Initiative or the B-2
Bomber,'' said Exon, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed

   ``Our national defense is simple compared to this,'' he said.
   The cook-off attracted cooks from as far away as Missouri and

   The fourth man to walk on the moon
doesn't expect more moon walks soon because of America's complacency
toward space discovery.
   Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean, 57, said Sunday he doubted that
bold space initiatives would arise out of the 20th anniversary of
the Apollo 11 mission, which put the first man on the moon.
   But Bean, speaking at Huntsville's Space Celebration '89, said
that doesn't bother him.
   ``It's Americans' way to go hard at a goal, then stand back and
savor that and not go hard at it all the time,'' he said. ``Back in
the days of Apollo, I thought we would have done much more by now.
But I didn't stop and think _ that is not the American way.''
   Bean, who walked on the moon on Nov. 19, 1969, flew aboard Skylab
3 for 59 days in 1973 and has trained astronauts, spoke a day after
Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin addressed the Huntsville
celebration.
   Aldrin had called for putting men on Mars within 20 years.
   ``I hope it's as fast as Buzz is talking about it,'' Bean said.
But he doubts it.
   ``People feel right now, that even though we are not No. 1 in the
world in space .. that if we really wanted to be and really made an
all-out effort like we did with Apollo, we could be No. 1,'' said
Bean, who noted specifically that Soviet endurance experiments in
space had far outstripped U.S. efforts.
   Until the Soviet Union decides to put a man on the moon or take
some other pride-threatening step, Bean expects little change in
Americans' attitudes.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   When that day comes, Bean hopes for space cooperation between the
United States and Soviet Union.
   ``I'd think that would be much better for the Earth,'' said Bean,
who is retired in Houston and spends his time painting space scenes.

   Following are the results of a 50-state survey by The Associated
Press of abortion-related activities since the Supreme Court's
ruling in the Missouri abortion law case. The list omits those
states where no significant activity has taken place or no major
change in laws is expected.
   ALABAMA: A newspaper survey of 106 of the 140 members of the
Legislature found that 61 percent would vote to ban abortion except
in cases of rape, incest or danger to a woman's life. Gov. Guy Hunt
said the issue will be addressed when the Legislature convenes in
January.
   CALIFORNIA: Pro-choice groups are challenging restrictions on
state-financed abortions for poor women. Although 11 similar
lawsuits in the past succeeded, the administration of Gov. George
Deukmejian plans to invoke the Missouri case in its defense of the
restrictions.
   CONNECTICUT: Activists on both sides are expected to pack a
legislative hearing Monday when the Assembly's Judiciary Committee
hears testimony from the state attorney general on the Missouri
decision. The committee is not expected to take any action. State
Rep. George Jepsen is leading a movement to repeal Connecticut's
1972 anti-abortion law and replace it with an unequivocal law giving
women the right to an abortion.
   FLORIDA: A bill filed after the Missouri ruling by state Rep. Tom
Banjanin would prohibit tax dollars from going to any
abortion-related activity, even counseling. The measure would define
human life as beginning at conception, and would prohibit abortions
in public hospitals or by public employees. Gov. Bob Martinez plans
to call a special fall session of the Legislature to take up the
issue.
   HAWAII: State Rep. Cam Cavasso plans to introduce bills that
would require parental consent and notification for minors'
abortions and would limit or ban state financing. A similar parental
consent proposal failed earlier this year.
   ILLINOIS: When the Legislature reconvenes in October,
anti-abortion lawmakers plan to seek legislation as restrictive as
possible under the Missouri ruling. A bill already pending would
require doctors to determine whether a 20-week-or-older fetus could
survive outside the womb.
   INDIANA: Anti-abortion legislators are prepaing bills that would
contain the same provisions as the Missouri law and go beyond it.
Gov. Evan Bayh said he would be willing to sign a measure requiring
fetal viability testing at 20 weeks, but was undecided about bans on
the use of public facilities and public employees in abortions.
   IOWA: Gov. Terry Branstad said he would ask the Legislature for
restrictions on abortion, but wanted to ``consult with a broad range
of Iowans'' before deciding which to seek.
   KANSAS: Senate Majority Leader Fred Kerr said his staff is
researching the Webster decision ``to see what we can and cannot
do,'' but he doesn't expect any movement for several months.
   KENTUCKY: State Rep. Bill Donnermeyer is having a bill drafted
for next January's legislative session that would include the same
provisions as the Missouri law and perhaps go further.
   LOUISIANA: New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick asked a
federal judge to lift a 1976 injunction prohibiting enforcement of a
state law making it a crime to perform an abortion. A hearing is
scheduled for Aug. 9.
   MAINE: House Minority Leader Mary Clark Webster named a
Republican committee to study the issue. House Speaker John Martin
doesn't want any abortion legislation passed during the next regular
session, in 1990.
   MICHIGAN: Four bills were introduced in the Senate on Wednesday.
They include measures modeled after the Missouri statute and other
bills that would require girls under 18 to obtain the consent of
both parents to get an abortion and would propose a state
constitutional amendment prohibiting state employees from receiving
abortions under their state health insurance plan.
   MINNESOTA: The Human Life Alliance of Minnesota started a
campaign to urge Gov. Rudy Perpich to call a special session solely
to enact abortion restrictions.
   MISSOURI: Gov. John Ashcroft announced plans for a task force to
study ways to make Missouri's abortion laws more restrictive. Any
proposal would have to wait until the Legislature returns in January.
   NEVADA: An anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue, targeted seven
Assembly members for ouster because of their pro-choice views.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: Pro-choice legislators want to try again to
overturn an unenforced, century-old law making abortion a crime.
Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a similar bill this year.
   NEW JERSEY: Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick intends to launch
``the great debate'' in September by convening a committee of the
entire 80-member Assembly to question witnesses and consider bills
on abortion. Abortion has become a major issue in the fall
governor's race.
   NORTH CAROLINA: A bill modeled after the Missouri law was
introduced months ago but is lying dormant in a House committee. The
sponsor, state Rep. Paul Stam, said he will wait until the 1990
session to push it.
   OHIO: House Speaker Vern Riffe said he is considering naming a
committee to study Ohio's abortion laws and the Missouri decision.
One bill introduced July 6 by state Rep. Joan Lawrence, a pro-choice
advocate, proposes that abortions be allowed up to the 25th week. At
least one anti-abortion bill is in the works.
   OKLAHOMA: Conservative legislators plan to introduce bills next
February to restrict abortion at least as much as in Missouri.
   PENNSYLVANIA: State Rep. Stephen Freind said he will introduce
legislation that would restrict abortions in line with the Missouri
ruling, but said he didn't have a timetable for introducing the bill.
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Members of the Legislature's Pro-Life Caucus said
they will propose legislation in the fall, when bills can be
pre-filed for next year's session, to graft some of the Missouri
laws onto existing statutes.
   SOUTH DAKOTA: Law already bars use of state funds to pay for
abortions not needed to save a woman's life, but legislative leaders
expect a bill next year that would impose a 20-week viability test
similar to Missouri's.
   TEXAS: Gov. Bill Clements, who is against abortion, said he
probably would ask the Legislature to consider abortion restrictions
if another special session is held later this year. House Speaker
Gib Lewis said he would prefer to wait until the next regular
session, in two years.
   VERMONT: Anti-abortion activsts are expected to pursue at least
two bills, one on parental notification for minors seeking an
abortion and another on banning the use of Medicaid funds for
abortions. However, the Legislature and Gov. Madeleine Kunin are
considered strongly pro-choice. So far, 46 of 150 lawmakers have
signed a statement supporting abortion rights.
   VIRGINIA: Abortion is an issue in the fall governor's race.
Democrat L. Douglas Wilder says current law shouldn't be changed
except to require that parents be notified when minors seek an
abortion. Republican J. Marshall Coleman supports a constitutional
amendment to ban abortions.
   WASHINGTON: The state attorney general is analyzing the Missouri
decision to determine whether it applies to a 1970 voter-approved
law that restricts abortions to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. The
state had been operating under the assumption that Roe v. Wade
superseded that law.
   WEST VIRGINIA: State Delegate David McKinley said he will
introduce a bill for the January legislative session that would
parallel Missouri's law.
   WISCONSIN: A bill is before the Legislature that would require
parental consent for minors' abortions. Another bill would allow
public financing of most abortions.

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in an extraordinary
entreaty to the host of the Western economic summit, came knocking
at the door just as capitalist club members were about to conclude
another harmonious session.
   They did not ask him in. Whatever the momentum of Gorbachev's
economic restructuring, President Bush said Western leaders
recognize that Moscow has a long way to go before it will sit at the
elite group's table.
   Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist patrician who is president of
France and host of the economic summit that ended this past weekend,
plans to write Gorbachev a polite reply to the Soviet leader's
suggestion that Moscow participate more directly in global economic
discussions.
   ``Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward
full and entire participation in the world economy,'' Gorbachev
wrote Mitterrand.
   The obstacles are enormous. It isn't only that the Soviet economy
is weak _ the Western nations have bad years, after all. Rather, it
is that the Soviet system lacks economic depth or maturity.
   Its currency, the ruble, is not traded internationally, a fact
which isolates the Soviet Union from foreign trade and monetary
relations that are the heart of the Western economic system. A
country that will not accept its own currency at hotel check-out is
not ready for membership in the G-7, the Western thinking goes.
   G-7, which stands for ``group of seven,'' is a club of
like-minded wealthy nations who speak the same monetary and trade
language. If anything, Gorbachev's letter seeking to link up the
Soviet economy with the United States, France, Britain, Canada,
Italy, Japan and West Germany is a plea for acceptance in the
economic arena.
   The Soviet Union belongs to the Second World of Communist nations
struggling to keep pace with rising consumer demands. Not a single
one of the Eastern bloc states can claim a vibrant economy.
   ``There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet
Union,'' before Moscow can claim a position in serious international
economic discussions, Bush said at a windup news conference on
Sunday. Yet he was encouraging toward Gorbachev.
   ``We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards
market-oriented or Western economies,'' he said. ``There's no
question about that. And there's nothing begrudging about our saying
that I don't expect Mr. Gorbachev to sit as a member at next year's
summit.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wished the Soviets
success in their reforms, ``But I don't see the time she (the Soviet
Union) will join us because of her (having become) a great
free-market economic success.''
   Others were equally skeptical.
   ``Their economy is a basket case,'' said a key Bush
administration analyst. ``They've never given aid to the Third
World. Their aid to the Third World comes on (military) tracks.''
   Reflecting a moment, and after being assured he would not be
identified, the official lowered his voice and opined: ``They don't
have any pricing system. It's just poignant.''
   Tanks and rockets are not the kind of aid the seven summit
members have in mind for Hungary and Poland as they strive to
transform their economies to something resembling the free market.
Another cornerstone of the weekend summit was a plan to help Third
World nations reduce their enormous debts. The analyst suggested
this was simply beyond the reach of the Soviet system.
   Gorbachev wrote that he saw ``points of convergence'' on how to
resolve the Third World debt crisis, but he offered no specifics.
   There was discussion among the Western leaders as to whether
Gorbachev was just mischief-making, seeking to grab a headline in
the midst of the summit. ``I can't say that never occurred to us,''
Bush acknowledged ruefully.
   Yet the leaders concluded that the Gorbachev note reflected an
honest interest in internationalizing the Soviet economy. For years,
Soviet leaders have been interested in obtaining hard currency from
the West for trading purposes, and in obtaining Western technology
not available from its communist trading partners.
   Nuclear arms, space technology and the Soviet Union's very size
long ago gave Moscow geopolitical status. Gorbachev's attempt to
extend his country's standing to the economic front is a long reach,
however, and not until he launched his perestroika campaign of
economic restructuring could discussions with the West be taken
seriously.
   Gorbachev's overture was the main topic of discussion when the
seven leaders had dinner Saturday night. So it was taken seriously
here.
   ``People concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the
changing world we're living in,'' Bush said.
   ``This marks the first time that the leader of a country that
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself as an
interlocutor, not as an opponent,'' Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco
De Mita told reporters Sunday.

<HEAD>`Miracle' Pilot Says He Doesn't Know What Caused Him to Pass Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington attorney Thomas Root said he
doesn't know how he passed out during his 800-mile flight down the
East coast, and blamed his bullet wound on a gun he said discharged
when his small plane crashed in the ocean.
   In an bedside interview published today in The Washington Post,
Root denied he had been attempting to commit suicide, and said he
has become the victim of innuendo as his story mushroomed.
   ``I'm shocked. I can't understand why this story has blown up,
beyond the admittedly unusual circumstances, to end up being a
front-page story like this,'' said Root, listed in stable condition
Sunday at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital.
   After the four-hour flight on autopilot Thursday, the crash into
Bahamian waters, and his rescue by Air Force parajumpers, Root's
survival was called miraculous. But the subsequent discovery of a
gunshot wound to his abdomen led to suspicion he hadn't meant to
survive.
   ``As I was swimming around out there, hurting a lot, I was
thinking about my family and that I wasn't going to see them
again,'' he told the Post. ``And I say that to say that I don't
think I have the ability, nerve or stupidity to take another life _
mine or anyone else's.''
   Root said he did not know what had caused him to pass out during
the flight but confirmed federal investigators' account of his
losing oxygen, possibly from carbon monoxide leaking into the cabin.
   Refuting reports that he was put on a list of suspected drug
smugglers by federal authorities after trips to the Caribbean, the
36-year-old Alexandria, Va., resident also said he had never dealt
in drugs and had never even taken his plane outside of the United
States.
   Root talked Saturday with a National Transportation Safety Board
air safety investigator and an FBI agent. NTSB investigator Andrew
Alston said he didn't have reason to dispute Root's version of
events, but that investigators in several places will try to
determine whether evidence matches Root's story.
   Alston said investigators were questioning Root's claim he
doesn't remember the gunshot, which initial tests indicate was at
very close range.
   Root has suggested that a .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver he
kept loaded in the glove compartment fell out and fired when his
single-engine Cessna ditched.
   Root said the gun could not have fired earlier in the flight
because he would have lost too much blood before the plane dived.
   But Capt. James Rahman, the Coast Guard flight surgeon who
treated him soon after the crash, said Root showed symptoms of
peritonits, which he said would prove he was shot at least two hours

<HEAD>National Teaching Credentials to be Offered in 29 Fields</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed for release 1:30 p.m. EDT; time set by source</HEAD>

   National teaching credentials will be offered
in 29 fields to qualifying educators, a national education group
said today in a move aimed at boosting professionalism in the
classroom.
   The guidelines released today are the first major step toward
achieving ``high and rigorous standards for what teachers should
know and be able to do,'' said James A. Kelly, president of the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
   The certificates will be given to teachers who qualify through
essays, interviews, performance and other means, the group said.
   ``No one has ever tried to do something like this in a profession
this size with so many built-in constraints,'' Kelly said.
   The 63-member board, chaired by former North Carolina Gov. James
Hunt, is scheduled to start awarding the voluntary certificates in
1993.
   The nation's 2.5 million teachers may apply for certification if
they have a bachelor of arts degree and at least three years of
experience.
   Teachers will be evaluated on their knowledge of their subject,
their competence in teaching techniques and their understanding of
child development, according to the guidelines released in Chicago.
Copies also were made available in Washington.
   The national board, proposed three years ago by the Carnegie
Forum on Education and the Economy, is made up of teachers,
government officials, business leaders and representatives of higher
education.
   Through the voluntary certificates, the board aims to increase
teacher professionalism, upgrade children's learning environments
and spur improvements in teacher training.
   The credential also is expected to make teaching a more
attractive career option and give teachers a chance to move into new
roles requiring particular expertise.
   Certified teachers may also command better salaries, but Kelly
said that will depend on local authorities.
   ``The board has always said we want our certificates to be
recognized,'' he said in an interview. ``But it's not the board's
business to say how each school district and private school should
recognize certified teachers.''
   Kelly said the board will not limit the number of teachers it
certifies and does not anticipate the credential being restricted to
an elite group. But he noted that ``not everyone who tries will
pass. This is not a matter of mailing a transcript to the state
capitol and getting a license back by return mail.''
   Evaluation methods may include multiple choice tests, essays,
interviews, simulated lesson plans and parent conferences and
observation of the teachers at work, the board report said.
   A typical evaluation could involve asking a music teacher to
bring a videotape of an orchestra rehearsal or asking a teacher to
come to an assessment center to defend his or her methods, Kelly
said.
   The board plans to issue certificates in 29 fields, including
early and middle childhood, music, art, foreign languages, physical
education, special education, vocational fields, and subject areas
such as math, science, social studies and English for different age
groups.
   It is unclear whether the board will eventually offer more than
one level of certification, a concept opposed by the National
Education Association.
   The 2-million-member NEA and its 700,000-member rival, the
American Federation of Teachers, each have seven seats on the
national board.
   AFT President Albert Shanker, a longtime backer of national
teacher certification, said the guidelines prove skeptics were wrong
when they said the task was impossible. ``We can be proud that we
have come so far,'' he said.

<NOTE>Turner's SuperStation to Broadcast Pro-Choice Video</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion rights advocates gain a platform on
national television this week when supporter Ted Turner broadcasts
their pro-choice video on his SuperStation TBS.
   Turner last week called abortion foes ``idiots'' and ``Bozos,''
raising the ire of pro-lifers and drawing attention to the coming
broadcast.
   ``Abortion: For Survival,'' produced for the Fund for the
Feminist Majority, is a half-hour program that depicts abortion as
an issue of public health, family planning, population control and
women's rights. It focuses on the effect of U.S. abortion policies
on American women and women in other countries.
   The program will be aired on Turner's TBS channel Thursday night,
and repeated Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. It will be
followed by a one-hour studio debate between two pro-choice
activists and two abortion foes moderated by journalist Martin
Agronsky.
   Jennifer Cole, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life
Committee, called Turner's decision to air the pro-choice program
but not a pro-life film ``very irresponsible journalism.''
   Right-to-life groups want Turner to balance his broadcast by
showing ``Eclipse of Reason,'' a film showing the results of a
24-week abortion.
   That film and its precursor, the better known ``Silent Scream,''
which uses a sonogram to show a fetus being aborted, have been aired
by local and regional cable TV systems in various parts of the
country.

<NOTE>Import Quotas Now Have Little Impact, GAO Says</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional research agency says the U.S.
steel industry has returned to ``normal levels of profitability''
and ending import quotas in place the past five years would have
little overall impact.
   ``The effect of the quotas has declined substantially and the
vast majority of them are now going unfilled,'' the General
Accounting Office said in a report released Sunday. ``While
expiration of the quotas might effect the market for a few
individual steel products ... it would likely have little impact on
the market as a whole.''
   Twenty separate quota agreements covering steel imports from 29
countries are due to expire Sept. 30. President Bush is expected to
announce a new steel policy soon after he returns from the Paris
economic summit.
   Senators from states with agricultural and other major exports
have been campaigning against the quotas. Those from steel-producing
states have been urging a five-year extension. The White House is
reportedly weighing proposed two- and four-year extensions.
   The GAO report said the major cause of the industry's plight when
the quotas were adopted in 1985 was the recession earlier in the
decade, a situation made worse by a surge in imports and the soaring
value of the dollar.

<HEAD>Dollar Shoots Higher; Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Currency traders, relieved from the anxiety of
possible interest rate hikes in the United States, actively bought
dollars today, sending the currency sharply higher against the
Japanese yen.
   Stock prices declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as volatile
interest rates and uncertainties in Japanese politics before this
weekend's parliamentary election sidelined many investors, dealers
said.
   The dollar closed at 141.53 yen, up 2.03 yen from last Friday's
close of 139.50 yen. It opened at 140.85 yen and moved in a range of
140.85-141.55 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which fell 56.39 points on Friday, shed another 118.55
points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 33,456.22.
   Traders said the dollar's strength followed its upward trend in
New York on Friday, but the renewed strength of the U.S. currency
was largely because of economic indicators released in Washington on
Friday.
   ``Players are buying back the dollar because last weekend's
economic indicators somewhat relieved the market from worrying that
U.S. interest rates would go down,'' said a dealer at a major
commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday the nation's retail
sales fell 0.4 percent in June, while the Labor Department said its
producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last
month.
   Another dealer said the fact that the leaders of seven major
democracies at the economic summit in Paris did not discuss currency
issues also motivated dollar-buying.
   ``It was as if saying they approved the current level of exchange
rates,'' said the dealer, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Securities dealers said uncertainties over the political
situation in Japan sidelined many investors.
   ``With this little trading, there is not much we can do about it
except wait for investors to come back,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a
dealer at Nikko Securities Co.
   Volume traded on the first section of the Tokyo exchange was
estimated at 260 million shares.
   Recent media polls show public support for Japan's governing
Liberal Democratic Party has fallen behind the Japan Socialist
Party, the second largest party. An election for half of the 252
seats in the Japanese parliament's upper house is scheduled Sunday.
   ``When an election, in which the ruling party is expected to lose
badly, is less than a week away, it's hard to buy stocks,'' said
another dealer at Nikko, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   A bomb exploded in the holy Moslem
city of Mecca early today, but authorities reported no casualties or
damage.
   An unnamed official, in a statement carried by the official
Riyadh Radio, said the blast occurred after 1 a.m. in an uninhabited
area on Mount Qubais, near the Grand Mosque.
   The official described the explosion as ``small' and said
security authorities were investigating the incident.
   He did not give other details, but other sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the blast was caused by a bomb.
   Two bomb blasts a week ago killed a Pakistani pilgrim and wounded
16 other worshippers at the height of the pilgrimage season. One
bombs went off on a road leading to the Grand Mosque, the other near
an overpass.
   Both explosions last week occurred during the night, while
pilgrims still were awake, offering prayers or visiting the Kaaba,
the holy shrine within the Grand Mosque in Mecca, birthplace of the
Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam.
   Some 2 million Moslems were gathered in Mecca for this year's
pilgrimage, which culminated Thursday with Eid al-Adha, or the Feast
of Sacrifice.
   Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were still in the holy city
today, when the latest explosion occurred, awaiting return flights
home.

<HEAD>Eight Candidates Vying For Wright's House Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARNIE STAPLETON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats who have only recently gotten
over the shock of the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright are
fighting to keep the congressional seat he held for more than 34
years.
   Three Republicans and one Libertarian are among the eight
candidates on the ballot for the Aug. 12 special election to fill
the House seat Wright first was elected to in 1955. No primaries
will be held.
   ``We're taking the attitude this is a new campaign,'' said David
Rucker, a spokesman for Republican candidate Laraine Bethke. ``As
Republicans, we think the playing field is very level.''
   The district that includes most of Fort Worth long has been a
Democratic stronghold, but Republicans have fared well in recent
elections. Last week, eight Democratic judges, citing a changing
political climate, defected to the Republican Party.
   Wright stepped down as speaker and resigned his House seat last
month amid an ethics investigation that turned up 69 instances of
alleged rules violations.
   The longtime congressman's popularity remained high in his
district even after he announced his resignation May 31, and all of
the candidates have been careful not to criticize Wright.
   Dennis Sheehan, the Tarrant County Democratic Party chairman,
says the Democrats are the only contenders because ``the voters of
District 12 don't like the way the Republican Party railroaded Jim
Wright out of office.''
   Republican leaders disagree.
   ``It was the Democrats who threw Jim Wright out of Congress,''
said Steve Hollern, the GOP county chief. ``If they had been willing
to put their neck on the line to save him, they could have kept him,
but the Democratic Congress was not willing to do that.''
   The special election is to fill the rest of Wright's term, ending
in January 1991. A runoff is expected in late August or September
because no candidate should win 50 percent of the vote.
   Wright and both party chairmen have declined to endorse a
candidate.
   Among the Democrats are three Fort Worth attorneys, George
Petrovich, Jim Lane and Pete Geren.
   Lane was endorsed by the Tarrant County Central Labor Council
AFL-CIO, which represents about 28,000 workers.
   Geren, a former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, has been endorsed by
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and enjoys the
backing of Martin Frost, the senior U.S. congressman from North
Texas.
   The other Democrat is Bill Turner, who owns a fence store.
   Sheehan said none of the Democrats are carbon copies of Wright.
   ``It's impossible for anyone to step into his shoes. They'll have
to establish their own credentials,'' Sheehan said.
   Republican candidate Dr. Bob Lanier, a physician whose syndicated
television show on health matters is broadcast in 40 markets, has
been endorsed by U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm and Texas Gov. Bill Clements.
   In addition to Lanier and Ms. Bethke, a former aide to U.S. Rep.
Dick Armey, private investigator Jim Hunter is running as a
Republican.
   Robert Buckingham Jr., manager of an oil-change garage, has filed
as a Libertarian candidate.
   ``The shock of the events involving Wright has worn off,'' said
Sheehan. ``Voters are now focusing on the reality that somebody must
go to Congress to represent this district, and they want somebody
who will work as hard for the district as Wright did for 34 years.''

<TEXT>
   Most Bastille Day-related events honored the
French Revolution, but at a funeral Mass in Manhattan for Louis XVI,
Marie Antoinette and other victims, celebrants deplored it.
   Instead of the Marseillaise, a Gregorian chant was heard Saturday
at St. Ann's Church, where 125 people prayed for the repose of the
souls of aristocrats and clerics.
   ``Let us pray to God that there will never be another French
Revolution,'' said the Rev. Karl A. Claver, who dwelt in his sermon
on the revolutionaries' ``fundamental and violent hostility towards
the Catholic Church,'' shown by the killing of Paris' archbishop,
the guillotining of nuns, the closing of churches and the
persecution of priests who refused to swear loyalty to the
revolutionary government.
   And he told the worshippers, some of whom called themselves
monarchists, that the French Revolution ushered in such dangerous
practices as ``civil marriage, secularized education and the
separation of church and state.''
   The memorial for the revolution's victims was held instead of the
traditional Latin Mass which is said every Saturday at St. Ann's.
   ``Out of all the voices extolling the virtues of the French
Revolution, there should be that Catholic voice saying, yes, there
may have been valuable things accomplished, but let's look at the
atrocities,'' said one of the Mass organizers, Joseph Patalano, 22,
a technical writer for Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   At least one of the organizers saw a direct link between the
French Revolution and the Latin Mass.
   ``We're here trying to preserve a tradition that many people in
the church are trying to suppress,'' said John Zmirak, a graduate
student at Louisiana State University.
   ``Modern secular ideology was born in bloodshed rather than in a
bloodless plebiscite,'' Zmirak said, declaring it ``a truth that the
culture is trying to suppress.''

<HEAD>Graham Urges South To Keep `Super Tuesday' Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are some cracks in the South's support for
another ``Super Tuesday'' regional primary in 1992, but most of the
southern legislators at their annual convention appeared ready to
give it one more try.
   The Southern Legislative Conference, meeting in Baltimore through
Wednesday, was instrumental in convincing state legislatures in 14
of the 15 states that make up the association to join a regional
primary held March 8, 1988. Only West Virginia refused to go along.
   Super Tuesday's architects had hoped it would result in the
nomination of a more conservative presidential candidate. But the
winner last year was Jesse Jackson, and Michael Dukakis eventually
held sway.
   Still, a majority of southern states appear to be ready to join
another regional vote in 1992.
   Rep. Robert C. Hunter of North Carolina has been named to head a
special panel charged with recommending whether a regional primary
should be held in 1992 and, if so, whether some alterations should
be made.
   Hunter said Sunday he favors another regional primary.
   ``Super Tuesday accomplished most of the goals we had in mind...
It was never designed to elect a Southerner; that was never the
primary purpose. I think what we have to do is look beyond 1988,''
he said.
   Hunter's view was shared by U.S. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who told the
legislative conference's executive committee Sunday that Super
Tuesday ``was the most constructive change that occurred in the
presidential process of 1988.''
   He said the regional primary forced presidential hopefuls to pay
attention to the South and its concerns as never before, and at the
same time boosted interest in the electoral process among southern
voters.
   Graham warned that to return to the region's hodgepodge of
primaries and caucuses stretching from March to June would be
disastrous for the region and the nation.
   Southern political opinion about the regional primary is not
unanimous, however.
   Already, Arkansas has tentatively decided not to participate in a
1992 regional primary. The primary has many opponents in Missouri,
and may be in some trouble in Alabama, Kentucky, Texas and Maryland.
   Virginia placed a ``sunset'' provision in its primary law that
automatically returned the state to its traditional caucus method of
selecting delegates to the nominating conventions.
   Lawmakers said that Georgia, Florida, Louisana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee still favor the regional
approach.
   Hunter said he was not especially concerned about possible
defections, adding ``if a few states dropped out it wouldn't kill
Super Tuesday.''
   Graham agreed. ``The one legitimate criticism (of Super Tuesday)
was there may have been too many states. Frankly, if the states that
leave are the border states ... I don't think that would be a bad
development.''

   Dr. Louis Sullivan, whose nomination as
Health and Human Services secretary was opposed by anti-abortion
activists, has said he supports the recent Supreme Court ruling that
limits the operation.
   Sullivan spoke Saturday to the annual conference of the
predominantly black National Medical Association, of which he is a
member.
   He did not mention the Supreme Court decision allowing states to
restrict abortion in his speech, which focused on the growing costs
of Medicare, but told reporters afterwards that he ``feels very
good'' about the ruling.
   Sullivan said of the ruling, ``by returning this question to the
states for their action, that is the position we wanted.''
   The National Medical Association previously has endorsed Roe vs.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The group
is expected to reaffirm its support of Roe vs. Wade later this week.
   Sullivan, the only black Cabinet member, stirred concern among
anti-abortionists in then-President-elect Bush's camp last December
for appearing to support women's right to choose abortion.
   The leader of the physicians' group, Dr. Frank Staggers, called
for increased attention to poverty health care, to control ailments
like AIDS and drug addiction that he said threatened to overpower
black communities.
   ``Why should we look at problems which are esoteric when we have
things that are disproportionately affecting blacks?'' he said.
   At least 5,000 physicians were attending the six-day conference
that began Friday.

<HEAD>Gandhi, Bhutto Discuss Nuclear Tensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
India's Rajiv Gandhi met for more than two hours today and discussed
the threat of a nuclear arms race between the south Asian rivals.
   The prime ministers told reporters there are obstacles to warm
relations between the traditionally hostile nations.
   Gandhi, who left Pakistan 17 hours after he arrived, said nuclear
weapons ``is one of the bigger problems between our two countries.''
   Since a predominately Moslem Pakistan was carved out of
Hindu-dominated India in 1947, the two nations have gone to war
three times.
   Although India has successfully tested a nuclear device, each
country denies widespread reports that it has nuclear weapons.
   Gandhi, 44, said a stumbling block to resolving the nuclear
tensions between the countries is the Pakistan army's control over
Pakistan's nuclear program, something Ms. Bhutto denied.
   Ms. Bhutto, 36, said ``we do not believe in nuclear proliferation
... We believe in peace, global peace, regional peace.''
   Both Gandhi and Bhutto are the offspring of past leaders of their
respective countries. The two met for the first time during a south
Asia summit hosted by Pakistan in December.
   During that summit, India and Pakistan signed an agreement not to
attack each others' nuclear facilities.
   Pakistan has offered to open its nuclear facilities to
international inspection, but Ms. Bhutto said her country will not
do so alone. India rejects the idea.
   Gandhi arrived in the Pakistani capital Sunday to colorful
10-foot banners and a ceremonial 19-gun salute. He was kept from
viewing about 300 protesters from the disputed Kashmir region _
India's only predominantly Moslem state. Kashmir is claimed by both
nations.
   ``We are not against India and Pakistan's rapprochement, but we
don't want their friendship at our cost,'' said one protester,
Sultan Mahmood Chowdry of the Azad Moslem conference.
   The protesters said they wanted the fate of the region resolved
through a plebiscite, in line with a 1949 United Nation's resolution.
   But the two leaders said they favored a 1972 agreement, signed by
Gandhi's mother, Indira, and Ms. Bhutto's father, calling for a
solution through bilateral talks.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed by an assassin in 1984 and Ms. Bhutto's
father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 after being
overthrown in a bloodless coup and found guilty by a court of
killing a political foe.
   ``We want a unified Kashmir whether it is part of Pakistan or an
independent state,'' said Chowdry.
   ``A plebiscite in the Kashmir is totally out for us,'' said
Gandhi.

<HEAD>Oil Samples Collected From Leaking Tanker</HEAD>

   Scientists aboard the Exxon Valdez are
collecting samples of the gooey blue substance still oozing from the
damaged ship's cargo tanks, preventing its passage through
California waters for repairs.
   The research team, which arrived Sunday after the Valdez was
moved into calmer seas off San Diego, is sampling the contents of
eight torn cargo tanks and several more torn ballast tanks at
various depths.
   The sampling and testing of the materials will take about a week,
said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg.
   A Coast Guard lab has concluded the material which has appeared
near the Valdez since its arrival off San Diego one week ago
consists of plankton and other micro-organic compounds mixed with
traces of Alaskan North Slope crude.
   The Valdez was towed 2,500 miles from Alaska, where it caused the
nation's worst oil spill in March. About 11 million gallons of crude
spilled into Prince William Sound when the tanker struck a reef
March 24.
   Though all of the discharges spotted near the crippled tanker
since Friday were small and dissapated quickly, state wildlife
officials disagreed with Exxon officials' assessement there was no
potential hazard to marine life posed by the spillage.
   Meanwhile, the Valdez was towed about 35 miles to calmer seas
Sunday to relieve ocean stress on the ship's increasingly exposed
steel framework.
   The tanker was about 43 miles northwest of Point Loma and 14
miles northeast of Pyramid Cove.
   Battered by heavy swells, two more steel plates wrenched off the
vessel's hull over the weekend, bringing to seven the number of
plates dangling from the ship's bottom.
   The plates need to be cut off so the Valdez can pass through San
Diego Harbor's 40-foot-deep channel en route to a dry dock at the
National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. for an estimated $25 million in
repairs.

   Troops today patrolled a tense region of the
republic of Georgia to prevent new outbreaks of ethnic violence
after rioting in which 14 people were killed at at least 127
injured, Soviet news reports said today.
   The fighting broke out Saturday night and lasted into early
Sunday in the Black Sea city of Sukhumi, capital of the Abkhazian
Autonomous Republic, Tass said. The region is administered by
Georgia.
   Said Tarkil, ideology secretary for Abkhazia, said Abkhazians
were protesting a decision by the Georgian government to restrict
the number of Abkhazians enrolled at the city's branch of Tbilisi
State University.
   Abkhazians, outnumbered by both Georgians and Russians in their
homeland, have protested alleged discriminiation in the past.
   Georgia also decided to separate the Sukhumi branch from the
other campuses, Tarkil said in a telephone interview from Sukhumi,
900 miles south of Moscow.
   ``The Abkhazian side is against this. It is inadmissable to
divide a university according to nationalities,'' Tarkil said,
adding that a commission from the national parliament also opposed
the division of the university.
   Tarkil said that the fighting raged over a large part of the city
and involved not only students, ``but all segments of the
population.''
   The Tass report said ``measures are being taken to render help to
those wounded, to restore public order and tranquility. The
situation is now being controlled by police and troops of the
Interior Ministry,'' which runs the national police force.
   Tass said Sunday that 11 people died and 127 were hurt in the
weekend fighting. It did not specify the nationalities of the
victims or give their names. The Georgian news agency Gruzinform
today said the death toll was at 14.
   ``In the clashes, stones, sticks, firearms and cold steel were
used,'' said a joint report by Tass and Grunzinform.
   Gruzinform said police and military units were patrolling the
city and adjoining areas. ``The situation is tense,'' an employee of
the news agency said in a telephone call.
   The senior official in Georgia, Communist Party First Secretary
Givi Gumaridze, rushed to Abkhazia along with law enforcement
officials seeking to restore order.
   Party and government officials ``appealed to the population to be
rational and responsible and assist law enforcement authorities in
stabilizing the situation,'' the report said.
   Abkhazia, a region of 535,000 people, lies along the Black Sea
coast in the Caucasus Mountains of the southern Soviet Union,
adjacent Turkey. Abkhazians in the region number 91,000.
   The weekend fighting is the latest in a series of ethnic disputes
and other unrest since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985,
bringing a greater tolerance of dissent.
   The ruling Communist Party's Central Committee is to meet
sometime this month to discuss the nationalist problems that have
accompanied Gorbachev's reforms.
   In March, demands by Abkhazians for independence sparked clashes
with Georgians and led to nationalist rallies by Georgians in the
republic's capital, Tbilisi.
   In April, 20 people were killed when troops armed with sharpened
shovels crushed a pro-independence rally in Tbilisi. That incident
is under investigation by a commission of the national parliament.
   The neighboring republic of Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh
Autonomous Republic also have been the scenes of bloody ethnic
clashes, as have the republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in
recent weeks.
   In Uzbekistan, Uzbeks attacked minority Meskhi Turks in late May
and early June, killing 100 people. The minority was resettled there
from Georgia during Stalin's rule.
   Native residents in Kazakhstan rioted against ethnic groups from
the Caucasus mountains in June. They complained the settlers
received preferential treatment in housing and other benefits.
   Like the largely Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, which
is seeking to be free of administrative control of Azerbaijan, the
Abkhazians have been seeking autonomy from Georgia.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been placed under the administrative control
of Moscow, but Abkhazia is still administered by Georgia.

<HEAD>Solzhenitsyn Says Critics Lie About Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his
first major American interview in 10 years, says he won't return to
his homeland until his new epic is available in every bookstore in
the Soviet Union.
   Since leaving the Soviet Union and arriving in Cavendish, Vt.,
with his family in 1976, Solzhenitsyn has written more than 5,000
printed pages in Russian of an epic, called ``The Red Wheel,''
covering the period surrounding the Russian Revolution of 1917.
   One of the novels of the series, ``August 1914,'' is being
published in English this week by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.
   He said in the July 24 edition of Time magazine that to return
home before ``The Red Wheel'' is available to Soviet citizens would
make him ``sort of mute.'' Time said he is now preparing the final
pages of the work.
   ``No one would know where I stood. I would have expressed
nothing. Once people read it, then we can talk,'' he said.
   But he noted that the major stumbling block to going home is the
pending charge of treason against him for his writings.
   On another topic, Solzhenitsyn said he was amazed when people
give him and his books labels such as anti-Semitic, chauvinistic,
xenophobic and nationalistic.
   ``It is quite extraordinary the extent to which I have been lied
about,'' he said. ``Some people distort things consciously, others
just don't take the trouble to check their sources,'' he said. ``It
is remarkable, and it makes me ashamed of journalists. No one ever
gives any quotes.''
   The 70-year-old Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1970, said public opinion about him is varied in
Europe, but monolithic in the Soviet Union and United States.
   ``In the Soviet Union I can understand it. It is due to the
Politburo,'' he said. ``But in the U.S. fashion is very important.
If the winds of fashion are blowing in one direction, everybody
writes one way and with perfect unanimity. It is perfectly
extraordinary.''
   He said he has chosen to remain silent about the major changes in
the Soviet Union and the Communist world because his focus has been
on his work.
   ``Was I going to interrupt my work and start acting as a
political commentator? I didn't want to do that. I had to finish my
work. I am over 70 years old, and age is pressing on me.''

<HEAD>Trans-Antarctica Team Begins Journey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sled dogs and a Soviet transport plane
seemed reluctant to take off, but Minnesota adventurer Will Steger
and a team of international explorers left for the first
trans-Antarctica dogsled trek.
   Steger and his five teammates from five countries, who hope to
begin the seven-month, 4,000-mile trek by Aug. 1, gave a last round
of hugs to well-wishers before departing Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport at 9:30 p.m. Sunday with 13,000 pounds of gear.
   Earlier Sunday, Soviet technicians repaired a faulty engine on
the four-engine cargo plane, a problem with a fuel flow device that
on Saturday threatened to ground the expedition for two days.
   The team's 42 sled dogs were the last cargo to be loaded,
sometimes with a struggle.
   The group plans several stops in Latin America before beginning
their trip across the bottom of the world. The team hopes the
grueling journey will rivet attention on international cooperation,
as well as the continent's stark fragility.
   ``Our mission is hope, hope in the strength and power of
international cooperation,'' Steger said at a news conference at the
College of St. Catherine.
   At the afternoon ceremony, Girl Scouts used scissors to slice
apart a painted tarp depicting the crew members' home countries _
Britain, Japan, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United
States _ and asked them to reassemble the mural at the end of their
expedition.
   At the same time, Steger, 44, wants to pursue a dream he says has
lurked inside him for years: to conquer the world's last untamed
frontier. He calls the Antarctica traverse ``the last of the big
firsts.''
   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow
tractors, but this will be the first unmechanized attempt.
   The venture has also drawn lots of publicity and money, with
corporations in the United States and France contributing nearly $10
million. A $3.5 million aluminum boat will serve as a floating
embassy and communications base.
   The team members are Steger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of
France, Soviet scientist Victor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers,
Keizo Funatsu of Japan, and Qin Dahe of China.
   Oceanographers Mustafa Omar Moammar and Ibrahim Abdulhamid Alam
of Saudi Arabia will travel with the team for a week on the
continent's interior, then will spend the second half of the
seven-month journey conducting experiments form the expedition's
ship.
   The trip south is to include stops in Havana; Lima, Peru; and
Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   Finally, from the tiny Argentine city of Rio Grande, the crew
will wait for the proper weather to fly to King George Island near
the tip of the Antarctic peninsula, where the Chinese will be
hosting the trek's launch at the Great Wall research base. The
arbitrary point of Seal Nunataks was chosen as the trek's launching
pad.

   Police arrested suspected terrorists in connection
with the summit conference of the seven major industrialized
nations, Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said today.
   But he gave no information about who was arrested, how many
people were detained or exactly when and where the arrests took
place. He told a news conference that details of the arrests would
be made public ``as soon as possible.''
   Under French law, police are not obliged to make such information
available. The Interior Ministry is in charge of the national
police, including anti-terrorist forces.
   The state-owned television network Antenne 2 reported that the
terrorists Joxe was referring to were three members of the Irish
Republican Army, which it said were arrested in the town of Ste.
Menehould in eastern France on the basis of information provided by
British authorities.
   The television said the IRA members were not planning any action
in connection with the bicentennial of the French Revolution or the
summit, but came to the attention of police as a result of the
intense pre-summit security investigations.
   Joxe said his services had received no indication of an
``individual threat'' concerning any of the 34 chiefs of state who
attended the bicentennial celebrations and the simultaneous summit.
   Referring to those arrested, Joxe said only that ``thanks to the
reinforced surveillance, which worked well, the national police were
able to make certain arrests.''
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push the British out
of the Protestant-dominated province of Northern Ireland, join it
with the Republic of Ireland and set up an a socialist state.

<TEXT>
   The 200 volunteers were out to count
dolphins, but the big marine mammals seemed to be as interested in
the people as the humans were in them.
   ``We had one come up so close to the boat I couldn't photograph
him with the telephoto,'' said Lisa E. Bowen of Tallahassee, Fla.
``He came right up, and looked at me, but I couldn't get him on
film.''
   She was among volunteers in 30 boats who spent the weekend
searching for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins along a 25-mile stretch
of Georgia coast, from the South Carolina line to St. Catherines
Island.
   They're trying to help scientists see if the population recovers
from an outbreak of a still-unidentified disease that killed about
half the dolphin population off the eastern United States in 1987
and 1988.
   The volunteers reported 1,100 sightings, but many animals may
have been counted more than once. The weekend effort was the first
of 40 such surveys planned over 10 years by a conservation group,
The Dolphin Project.
   Volunteers try to photograph each animal they see and hope to
build a catalogue to identify individuals by coloring and markings
on their dorsal fins.
   ``I know of no effort of this magnitude that has ever been done
anywhere,'' said Charles Potter, collections manager for the
Smithsonian Institution, a dolphin expert who has worked with the
project.
   ``It's outstanding,'' he said. ``The federal government could
never get this many people out there observing. It just doesn't have
the resources.''
   The project will help monitor part of the population's recovery.
   ``Today, we had reports of dolphins coming up to boats, so close
people could touch them,'' said Beau Cutts, president of the
conservation group, which has headquarters in Marietta.
   ``These are wild dolphins. They seem to exhibit as much interest
in men as we do in the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin.''
   The first survey was from 5 miles offshore to 8 miles inland up
creeks and in marshes.
   Some boats found themselves amid dolphins than they could record
on the written reports.

   A shipment of 10 endangered black rhinos
arrived special delivery from Africa aboard a jumbo jet, doubling
the population of rhinoceroses in the United States.
   The one-ton beasts landed Sunday at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport in the rear of a Boeing 747. The animals are
destined for zoos and ranches, where they will be bred as part of an
international conservation program.
   One of the females is being taken to La Coma Ranch near McAllen,
owned by Calvin Bentsen, where it will join 400 other exotic
animals, including a male black rhino named Macho.
   ``I told him about it yesterday, and he got all excited,'' joked
Bentsen, 63, a cousin of U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   One of the rhinos broke a horn during the trip from Harare by way
of Frankfurt, West Germany. Several became dehydrated and were
doused with water inside a cargo terminal before being examined and
sprayed with an insecticide to kill any disease-carrying ticks.
   ``They're a little tired,'' said veterinarian Sherri Huntress of
the Dallas Zoo, which is receiving a pair of the animals.
   Veterinarians were most concerned about the condition of a
pregnant rhino, which apparently experienced only normal stress, zoo
officials said.
   In addition to Bentsen and the Dallas Zoo, the Fort Worth and
Milwaukee zoos and the Lee Bass ranch in southern Texas are each
getting a pair of rhinos, and San Diego's zoo is getting one.
   Habitat destruction and poaching have put the animal on the verge
of extinction. Their horns sometimes sell for as much as $4,500
apiece, desired as dagger handles and in medicinal potions.
   Before the shipment, only eight black rhinos were in the United
States.
   There are believed to be fewer than 3,000 southern black rhinos
in the wild. In 1970, there were more than 60,000 inhabiting the
grasslands, marshes and forests of Africa.
   Bentsen said while in 1960 he shot a black rhino in Kenya, he
wouldn't do it now.
   ``A true hunter would never shoot an endangered animal,'' Bentsen
said.

<TEXT>
   Four men were killed in weekend gang violence
in Southern California and at least 16 other people were injured,
including two free-lance television reporters who were pelted with
bottles.
   Twelve additional police officers were assigned to patrol west
Los Angeles to quell an outbreak of gang-related violence that
included the attack on the TV crew covering an earlier gang
shooting, said Sgt. Bob Tumas.
   ``It was out of control,'' Tumas said.
   Rich Farmer, 25, and Dave Fajardo, 21, from Newsreel Video
Service, were bombarded with bottles early Sunday after they
finished covering a gang shooting near Culver City in Los Angeles'
western suburbs, said Gary Arnote, owner of the free-lance video
company. Both men were cut by flying glass when full beer bottles
hit their van and both required stitches, Arnote said.
   Among the many shootings blamed on gangs in communities around
Los Angeles was that of Frank Gonzalez. Gonzalez, believed innocent
of gang involvement, was gunned down by three men in a passing white
Cadillac as he stood on a Los Angeles sidewalk Sunday afternoon,
said Detective Don Watson.
   In the west Los Angeles neighborhood of Mar Vista, Davion
Washington, 23, was shot and killed Sunday afternoon. Police believe
he was killed by a fellow gang member.
   In Santa Ana, about 40 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles,
Mark Anthony Brooks, 19, was shot to death and two others were
wounded early Sunday in a drive-by shooting. Police said Brooks
wasn't a gang member.
   Also fatally shot was a 19-year-old suspected gang member in
south-central Los Angeles Saturday night, police said. His name
wasn't immediately released.
   About 150 police officers arrested 267 people during a two-night
anti-gang sweep in the San Fernando Valley. The latest in a series
of operations dubbed ``Operation Hammer'' netted 94 reputed gang
members among the arrestees, police said.

   Texas officials, responding to President
Bush's hint the next economic summit could be held in his adopted
state, describe the prospect in glowing terms.
   ``Texas is a state of international importance and for the
president to bring the leaders of the free world to his home state
is a brilliant idea,'' Gov. Bill Clements' spokesman, Reggie Bashur,
said Sunday.
   Bush, asked Sunday in Paris if he might bring the leaders of the
seven richest democracies to Texas, said: ``That's a distinct
possibility.'' He quickly added, ``However, it's too early. No
decision has been made.''
   The president, speaking to reporters at the end of the 15th
economic summit, said: ``The fact that (Secretary of State) Jim
Baker is from Houston, and I'm from Houston, and (Commerce
Secretary) Bob Mosbacher is from Texas should have nothing to do
with where the next summit's going to be, and there has been no
decision.''
   Bush, born and raised in New England, moved to Texas after World
War II and entered the oil business. He owns a house in
Kennebunkport, Maine, and stays in a hotel when in Houston. But he
maintains Houston as his voting residence.
   Another president from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson, used to delight
in showing off his LBJ Ranch to foreign visitors in the 1960s, but
never held any formal summits in the state.
   Back in the Lone Star state, officials already are jostling for
the site.
   ``I think that's a great idea,'' said Texas House Speaker Gib
Lewis, noting his hometown of Fort Worth ``would be a super city''
for the summit.
   The hints Bush dropped about the roots he shares with Baker and
Mosbacher were not lost on Houston officials.
   Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby put a plug in for his hometown. ``There's no
better place than Houston to discuss economic initiatives. It's a
great city and President Bush's hometown.''
   Mayor Kathy Whitmire said she had already been thinking about the
summit.
   ``We had considered that he (Bush) will be hosting the economic
summit and we were hoping that he would consider bringing the summit
to his hometown ... since Houston is such a major international city
and since we are involved in a strong economic recovery now,'' Mrs.
Whitmire said.
   She said the main benefit to the city would be the international
exposure.
   ``I am going to be pursuing this issue with Secretary Mosbacher
and Secretary Baker because I think they share my view that Houston
would be a natural.''
   Houston Chamber of Commerce President Eileen Crowley said she
knew of no organized effort to attract the international economic
summit to Houston, but added that Bush may have provided all the
incentive the city needed Sunday.
   ``Given an opening like that, let's not let the opportunity go
by,'' she said. ``I'm sure we'll be talking about it.''

<HEAD>Opposition Party Members Arrested For Rangoon Bombing</HEAD>

   Security forces have arrested three members
of the main opposition party for a recent bombing at a government
oil refinery that killed three people, the chief of military
intelligence said today.
   Authorities said three people were killed and two others wounded
when a box in a package exploded at the Syriam refinery on the
northern bank of the Rangoon River on July 7.
   ``Three National League for Democracy youths have admitted their
responsibility for the blast at Syriam,'' intelligence chief Brig.
Gen. Khin Nyunt told a news conference.
   Khin Nyunt said he was convinced the Syriam bombing was connected
to a bomb explosion at Rangoon's City Hall on July 10. The
government-run Radio Rangoon said three people were killed in that
attack.
   Khin Nyunt said no arrests have been made for that bombing.
   The National League for Democracy is the largest and most popular
opposition group to emerge from a national uprising for democracy
which the army brutally crushed last year.
   The general said the youths _ identified as Than Zaw, Moe Kyaw
Thiu and Nyi Nyi U _ confessed to the refinery bombing. At the news
conference, he showed what he said were their photographs and party
identity cards.
   The bomb caused no damage to the refinery, one of only two in the
country.
   He identified the ``mastermind'' of the bombing as Moe Thiha, an
organizer for the National League for Democracy, and said he
remained at large.
   He charged that Moe Thiha received explosives training from the
rebel Karen National Union, an ethnic minority group battling for
greater autonomy from the government.
   Apparently referring to Aung San Suu Kyi, the general secretary
of the opposition party, Khin Nyunt said a party leader had made
``indirect suggestions that the military is responsible for the
recent bombings (and) insinuations that the military was after her
life.
   ``In fact we are worried that she might fall and hurt her toe
even, because we will be blamed for any harm to her,'' he said.
   ``Now it is obvious who is behind the recent bombing and plans to
disrupt law and order in the country,'' he added.
   Authorities have banned public demonstrations under martial law
declared since the army cracked down on a huge nationwide movement
for democracy in September.
   Khin Nyunt said restrictions on expression and movement of the
political parties would be lifted ``step by step depending on
security conditions.''
   An election would definitely be held in May and ``full freedom
will be given for the final party campaigns,'' he said.
   The National League has criticized the government's refusal to
talk with opposition groups and expressed doubts that the military
would hand over power.

   A woman hit the gas pedal instead of the
brakes and drove through a plate-glass window into City Hall,
causing up to $30,000 in damage, the mayor said.
   ``We're lucky it was Sunday and not Monday,'' said Mayor Jim
Sudduth, noting that an employee usually sits next to the window the
car went through.
   The vehicle broke two tall window panes, an air conditioner, an
internal wall partition and water lines and knocked down a computer
and printer, said Sudduth.
   The 84-year-old woman, whom officials refused to identify, was
treated at St. Patrick Hospital and released.
   Sudduth said the woman veered the wrong way onto a one-way street
to avoid hitting a car ahead of her about noon Sunday.
   ``She thought she put her foot on the brakes, but she put it on
the accelerator,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Norwegians Mistook Diesel Exhaust For Fire</HEAD>

   Norway accepted an explanation from the
Soviet Union today that no fire occurred aboard a nuclear submarine
that belched black smoke.
   But Norwegian officials complained that the Soviets should have
reported what they called a defect in the ship's nuclear power
system that forced it to the surface of the Barents Sea on Sunday.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov said the smoke that appeared
to come from a fire on board the Alfa class submarine was the
exhaust from the ship's diesel engines, the Tass news agency
reported.
   ``There were no accidents or other emergencies,'' The Soviet news
agency quoted Yazov as saying.
   ``We have to believe them on that,'' Arild Isegg, a Norwegian
Defense Ministry spokesman, said. ``Norway will take note of it,''
but Oslo still wanted a written explanation.
   Two earlier Soviet submarine accidents occurred off Norway since
April.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Bjoern Kanavin said the source of the
smoke was ``beside the point'' and that Norway's main concern was
the danger of radiation.
   ``The Soviets have indirectly confirmed that there was a problem
with the reactor, and in that kind of situation we want to be
informed,'' Kanavin said.
   The Alfa-class ship was spotted pouring smoke from its
observation tower Sunday and was being towed by a Soviet tugboat,
said Erik Senstad, another Defense Ministry spokesman.
   In response to a diplomatic query, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Oeyvind Nordsletten said Soviet officials told Norway on Sunday that
the smoke was part of an exercise and that the submarine had never
been in trouble.
   Today, Yazov said the submarine had been on a combat training
mission and was shifting its power load to a battery when ``one of
the cells was short-circuited ...
   ``The submarine surfaced. Its diesel engines were fired and
produced the exhaust,'' Tass quoted him as saying.
   Norwegian television showed the submarine cruising swiftly under
its own power and reported no outward signs of an accident.
   The ship was sighted by the Norwegian research vessel Mariatta in
the Barents Sea about 75 miles east of the Norwegian town of Vardo
and north of the Kola Peninsula. It was 30 miles north of Soviet
territorial waters.
   Senstad said the submarine may have reached a Soviet Northern
Fleet base on the Kola Pennisula today. Norway had no information of
casualties on board or damage to the ship's reactors.
   Alfa class submarines are powered by two nuclear reactors cooled
by liquid metal and have auxiliary diesel engines. They are capable
of carrying nuclear-tipped torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles as
well as conventional warheads.
   The Norwegian Insitute for Radiation Hygiene reported no traces
of radiation in preliminary tests of samples taken near the site of
the incident.
   Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg summoned Soviet ambassador
Alexander V. Teterin late Sunday and said ``it is entirely
unsatisfactory'' that Norway had not been warned.
   Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst was quoted by the Verdens
Gang newspaper as saying he is worried about the operations and crew
training aboard Soviet submarines sailing off northern Norway.
   ``It's extremely worrisome to have three incidents involving
nuclear submarines so close together ... and I must emphasize that
this concerns three different types of submarines,'' Holst said.
   On June 26, a fire broke out aboard a Soviet Echo II class vessel
that was sailing 70 miles off Norway's coast in the Norwegian Sea.
   On April 7, a MIKE class nuclear sub sank in the Norwegian Sea,
killing 42 Soviet sailors.
   Stoltenberg said Norway, a member of the NATO alliance, has
drafted a treaty that would require the Soviet Union to inform
Norway of military accidents. The Soviets have similar agreements
with the United States, Britain, West Germany and France.

<TEXT>
   About 200 people gathered among the damp weeds in a
monastery graveyard today to hold the first public requiem in the
Soviet Union for Czar Nicholas II, who was shot by Bolshevik guards
in 1918.
   Police using loudspeakers repeatedly ordered participants to
leave the unofficial prayer meeting in Moscow's Donskoi Monastery,
but the warnings only made the worshipers sing their Russian
Orthodox hymns louder.
   Organizers said the service reflected a recent resurgence of
monarchism among Soviets who have less fear of persecution and
arrest for their views.
   A brass band stumbled through ``God Save the Czar,'' and Orthodox
priests who conducted the service eulogized the czar and his
murdered family as ``real Russian martyrs.''
   In July 1918, soldiers acting on Bolshevik orders shot Nicholas
and 10 members of his entourage, including his wife and children.
Nicholas, born in 1868, abdicated in March 1917 as revolutionary
discontent swept Russia.
   ``Personally,'' said Father Vadim, one of the priests conducting
the service, ``I'm moved to tears that the children were also shot,
that they were subjected to terrible humiliation, spat upon and
slandered.''
   Many worshipers came purely out of sympathy for the royal
victims, said one of the meeting's organizers, Vladimir Anishchenko.
But Anishchenko, a member of the unofficial Commission on the
Remains of the Russian Imperial Family, said ``there are lots of
monarchists here.''
   The commission is calling for the remains of the royal family to
be given Christian burials in the Peter and Paul Fortress in
Leningrad, the traditional resting place for the Romanov royal
family, he said.
   Police and city officials who tried to disperse the prayer
meeting drew angry protests from the crowd.
   ``You're a Russian too, you should understand,'' one woman
shouted at a policeman.
   ``I'm warning you again,'' the policeman said through a
megaphone. ``Stop this meeting and disperse. The organizers will be
held responsible.''
   The main response was the repeated Russian Orthodox chant of
``God have mercy.''
   When the police eventually allowed the meeting to continue, an
old woman said with a smile, ``God has triumphed in the end.''
   Many worshipers carried thin candles and red-white-and-blue flags
of the provisional government that ruled Russia between the
overthrow of the czar in March of 1917 and the Bolshevik takeover in
November of that year.
   Russian monarchists are just beginning to organize, said
Anishchenko, whose T-shirt showed the double-headed eagle of the
imperial crest.
   Monarchists have already contacted Grand Prince Vladimir
Kirillovich, the ranking member of the Romanov royalty, who lives in
England. ``He just came back to life when he heard about our
activity,'' Anishchenko said.
   In April, Soviet screenwriter and former policeman Geli Ryabov
publicly claimed to have found the royal remains, including the
czar's skull, in a pit in the Ural mountains city of Sverdlovsk.
   The commission has since collected more than 10,000 signatures on
an appeal to the Supreme Soviet to have the bones certified and then
given a proper burial, Anishchenko said.

<TEXT>
   The Holy See and predominantly Roman Catholic
Poland today re-established full diplomatic relations, the first
time the Vatican has forged such ties with a Warsaw Pact nation.
   The announcement by the Vatican and Poland's state-run news
agency said relations, cut by the Communists who took power in
Poland in 1945, are at the level of ambassador.
   In Warsaw, Stefan Staniszewski, spokesman for the Polish Foreign
Ministry, said the announcement ``is a very important fact that
crowns a long process of normalization of relations between the
state and the church.''
   Poland's bishops, in a statement, said ``a proper development of
relations will influence the realization of citizens' rights in
Poland and open a new field of church activities with benefits for
the whole society.''
   The statement said relations will also increase Poland's prestige
``in the arena of international politics.''
   Negotiations had been going on for some time, and Polish-born
Pope John Paul II indicated recently that an agreement was near. He
disclosed a week ago that he intended to send an envoy soon but did
not say when.
   The Polish government has been eager to re-establish the ties to
boost its standings at home and abroad. In the past, some Polish
bishops were reportedly reluctant to do this, fearful that the
Polish government would seek to go behind their backs and deal
directly with Rome on church-state issues.
   A major hurdle was cleared in May when the Polish Parliament
enacted three bills establishing the legal status of the Catholic
Church.
   In April, Poland's Communist authorities reinstated Solidarity
after a seven-year ban and agreed to allow the free trade union
movement representation in parliament as an opposition party.
   Solidarity was formed during a summer of labor unrest a year
after John Paul was elected to the papacy. He has been an outspoken
defender of the union.
   In elections last month that were Poland's freest in four
decades, Solidarity candidates won all but one of the seats they
were allowed to contest.
   Today's announcement said the agreement takes effect immediately.
   It said the decision was taken in consideration of the ``noble
tradition'' of links through the centuries between the Holy See and
the Polish nation.
   John Paul has noted that the Holy See has relations with 117
countries and that ties with Poland would benefit both sides.
   During his last visit to Poland, in June 1987, the pope said the
lack of diplomatic ties with such a Catholic country was ``something
abnormal'' and could be harmful to the country.
   There was no immediate announcement on the name of the Vatican
envoy, but there has been speculation it could be Archbishop Gabriel
Montalvo, a Colombian who is papal nuncio, or ambassador, to
Yugoslavia.
   Yugoslavia, which is non-aligned, is the only communist country
in eastern Europe with Vatican ties. The Vatican also has full
relations with communist Cuba.
   The last papal ambassador to Poland left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939,
at the outbreak of World War II. After a series of high-level
visits, the two sides agreed to establish permament working contacts
in 1974.
   Vatican officials said recently they expected the papal envoy
could be named next month, raising speculation that the nuncio might
take up his post around the anniversary date of Sept. 5.

   An early-morning house fire killed six people
today, including a young mother and her three children, authorities
said.
   Three people escaped from the burning three-story home in a
moderate-income neighborhood, including a mother and daughter who
climbed out a second-story window and down a fire escape, the Fire
Department said.
   Five people were pronounced dead at the scene of the 1:30 a.m.
blaze, and an infant died at a hospital.
   Three firefighters suffered minor injuries, the Fire Department
said.
   Coroner's investigator Pat Gillespie identified the dead as Jerry
Jennings, 49, owner of the house; Jamie Scott, 22; Lynn Scott, 21,
and her children, Terrance, 3; Derrick, 18 months, and Brandon, two
weeks old.
   The relationships among all the victims were not immediately
known.
   Jackie Jennings and her daughter, Tyisha, escaped, as did Jerry
Jennings' wife, Mary, Gillespie said.
   The cause of the fire, which started on the first floor and
destroyed the home, was not immediately known. The blaze was spotted
by a police officer on patrol.

   Here are highlights of what occurred
exactly 20 years ago today during the Apollo 11 moon flight:
   One day after launch, Apollo 11 is streaking outward from Earth
toward the moon, which is still more than 100,000 miles ahead.
   At 12:17 p.m. EDT, the astronauts fire the rocket engine on
Columbia, their command and service module, for three seconds, just
long enough to put the craft precisely on target for the moon.
   Later, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr.
and Michael Collins beam a 36-minute television show to Mission
Control in Houston. They show a view of the Earth, now 128,000 miles
behind them, and then give a tour of their small space cabin.
   At 9:42 p.m. EDT, Mission Control bids the crew goodnight.

   The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council announced
today it has awarded a $53.3 million contract for construction of a
museum on the National Mall.
   Construction of the Holocaust Memorial Museum 400 yards from the
Washington Monument will begin next week, with completion expected
in three years. The contract was awarded to Blake Construction Co.
Inc. of Washington.
   The five-story, 250,000-square-foot limestone and brick building
will be constructed with private funds. Organizers say they hope to
raise $147 million to build and equip the museum, prepare permanent
exhibits and establish an endowment. To date, about $70 million has
been raised, officials said.
   ``With this action, the council is taking a significant and
irreversible step toward a noble and vital goal _ the establishment
of a national museum in the nation's capital to tell the story of
the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust and the millions of
other victims of Nazism,'' said Harvey M. Myerhoff, the council
chairman.
   The council was established in 1980 by Congress.

<HEAD>NBC Executives Urge Strong Stand Against `New McCarthyism'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two top NBC executives promised to withstand
pressure from self-appointed TV censors who oppose controversial
programs and mount campaigns aimed at advertisers with tactics one
called ``new McCarthyism.''
   Special-interest groups, many led by fundamentalist Christian
ministers, that urge sponsors to avoid programs considered
objectionable, present a significant worry to the network, NBC
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff told television reporters
this weekend.
   ``What you become concerned about is a sort of new McCarthyism
where certain parties are out there speaking for what I think is a
minority viewpoint in terms of what is acceptable network fare,''
Tartikoff said.
   Robert Wright, NBC president and chief executive officer, said
the network would be sensitive in its programming decisions during
the coming season, but would not shy away from hot topics.
   ``Our position is we will continue to look for and develop
controversial issues,'' Wright said.
   Special-interest groups campaigned, with some success, against
NBC's ``Nightingales,'' ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Roe vs.
Wade,'' among other shows.
   NBC was unable to sell all available advertising spots for the
critically acclaimed, but highly controversial, movie-of-the-week
``Roe vs. Wade'' because of its focus on abortion rights.
   ``The nervousness is not on our part,'' Tartikoff said. ``It's on
the part of the advertisers. They're caving incredibly quickly.''
   In response to advertiser defections, NBC added 10 staff members
to its standards department. Tartikoff said the network also was
conducting a study to examine whether critical special-interest
groups truly represent a change in the majority of viewers' values.
   Tartikoff did not admit that the series ``Nightingales'' was
canceled because of interest-group pressure. The series, about a
group of student nurses who spend a lot of time in sexy lingerie or
chasing doctors, was criticized by real nurses. Their write-in
campaign caused some sponsors to withdraw their commercials.
   ``I don't think there was anything up for contention on our fall
schedule that got eliminated because of these groups,'' he said,
while admitting that he was concerned about getting the new fall
schedule started without any problems.
   Wright said the network would pay special attention to
programming for the coming season, and that ``we will be a little
more reserved than we have been.''
   But Tartikoff seemed less willing to accommodate amateur critics.
   ``What I'm telling you is that there's a brush fire burning out
there, and I'm trying to put it out,'' he said. ``And I think if we
put it out, then we can go about our business.''
   Tartikoff's reference to McCarthyism linked critics' efforts to
the 1950s communist witch hunts staged by then-Sen. Joe McCarthy.

   Bystanders did nothing as two toddlers lay
drowning in a swimming pool, said an emergency official who was able
to save one of the children.
   Fire Capt. C.A. Beasley pulled the two girls from the pool Sunday
morning. Tiffidie Anne McGough, 15 months old, was dead at the
scene, officials said.
   Her 2-year-old half sister, Taffidie, was given emergency
treatment and was in critical condition today at Texas Children's
Hospital, said hospital information coordinator Tina Foster.
   Beasley told the Houston Chronicle that two men were standing by
the pool at the apartment complex when he arrived. They told him
there were ``dolls or dogs'' in the pool.
   ``Regardless of what they thought they were, I can't imagine
anybody standing there looking at two kids in the pool,'' Beasley
said. ``They would be better off out of the pool no matter what.''
   Officials believe someone at the scene must have called emergency
officials.
   The children had apparently wandered into the pool while their
mother dozed in a nearby apartment, the newspaper reported.
   ``I don't understand why they didn't'' try to save the children,
said Tammie Patterson, mother of the two girls. ``And I wish I knew
who it was.''
   Patterson, 20, said she learned her children had fallen into the
pool when an unknown man knocked on her door.
   ``I flew right past him, down the stairs and by the pool, and
both of my babies were lying there,'' she said.
   Taffidie's grandfather, who asked that his name not be used, was
stunned when he heard that onlookers had not tried to save the
children.
   ``It's hard to imagine somebody would do that,'' he told the
Chronicle. ``I'd help a dog if he were drowning.''
   District Attorney John B. Holmes said he knows of no law that
would impose criminal sanctions against someone who failed to come
to the children's aid.

<TEXT>
   A delegation of senior officials headed to western
Siberia today to negotiate with striking coal miners, whose protest
spread to other industries, strike committee spokesmen said.
   As many as 100,000 workers in the coal-mining region about 2,000
miles east of Moscow formed a strike committee late Sunday, marking
a new stage in their struggle for greater economic autonomy from
central authorities in Moscow, said committee spokesman Valery
Serdtsev.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
sent the miners a telegram overnight saying they were familiar with
the strikers' demands and were sending top aides to the region, said
Serdtsev in a telephone interview from Prokopievsk.
   The official media had not reported the appointment of the
delegation by midday today but has said the mining minister has been
traveling to cities in the region in an effort to end the strike.
   Serdtsev said the miners had been told they would meet tonight
with Politburo member Nikolai N. Slyunkov, chairman of the Communist
Party's Socio-Economic Commission, Stephan A. Shalayev, chairman of
the All-Union Council of Trade Unions, and Deputy Premier Lev A.
Voronin, who is also chairman of the State Committee for Material
and Technical Supply, which oversees the nation's industry.
   The delegation was to meet with representatives of the strike
committee in Prokopievsk.
   The labor unrest that began in one Siberan town on Tuesday and
spread rapidly throughout the region is the biggest challenge to
Kremlin control of the economy since Gorbachev assumed power four
years ago.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said ``there are only small
islands of tranquility'' in the region.
   ``The situation is changing from hour to hour, and mines that
were quiet yesterday unexpectedly stopped working today,'' the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported on Sunday.
   The western Siberian region is one of the nation's most important
coal areas, and it supplies fuel and coke used to make steel.
   Since Gorbachev came to power he has shown greater tolerance of
dissent and public debate and has sought to restructure the stagnant
and shortage-plagued Soviet economy. Most of the unrest since then
has been sparked by ethnic disputes in the non-Russian republics of
the Soviet Union.
   But western Siberia is in the Russian heartland, and those
involved in the unrest are workers _ the supposed backbone of the
proletarian state.
   Moreover, the miners are demanding greater autonomy from Moscow,
echoing demands heard from such non-Russian republics as Lithuania,
Estonia, Latvia, Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry said the coal strike had spread
from the mines to other major enterprises in several cities. It said
Mining Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov rushed from city to city seeking
to end the strike.
   Party and government officials on the municipal level were
reportedly backing the strikers.
   ``Local authorities think the demands are fair and are supplying
the workers with water and kvas,'' a Russian non-alcoholic beverage,
said Valery Legachev, a member of the strike committee in the city
of Prokopevsk.
   Miners from two more cities, Anzhero-Sudzhinsk and Belov, joined
strikers Saturday, the trade union newspaper Trud reported on
Sunday. All miners were said to be on strike in Prokopevsk,
Novokuznetsk, Kiselevsk, Leninsk-Kuznetsk, Osinniki, Kemerovo and
Berezovski.
   Legachev said strikers in Prokopevsk had 41 demands.
   The most important were that the Mining Ministry give miners and
local officials greater control of the industry, including more
rights in setting production rates and the rights to sell excess
production for foreign currency to be used for social services.
   Other demands include greater concern for the environment, such
as curtailing open-pit mining; higher salaries for medical workers;
lower prices at canteens and stores operated at the mines; better
housing and recreational facilities; and improved working conditions
in the shafts.
   Trud put the number of strikers at 100,000, Pravda said 80,000.
   In Kiselevsk, 17 non-mining enterprises struck in solidarity with
the miners, and Legachev said the situation was similar in
Prokopevsk.
   The region generally produces about 132 million tons of coal a
year. Its average output has dropped by 1 million tons since the
strike began and has cost the economy about $38 million, Trud said.
   The strike began Tuesday in the city of Mezhdurechinsk, where
miners were demanding higher wages, safer working conditions and
increased supplies of food and medical care.
   Those miners returned to work Thursday, but the strike spread to
other cities.

   KATZRIN, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ Industry Minister
Ariel Sharon called on the government today to ``eliminate'' PLO
chief Yasser Arafat to end the Palestinian uprising and revive the
Middle East peace process.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers today blew up the homes of
two Palestinians suspected of fatally stabbing an Israeli building
contractor on Friday, the army said.
   Speaking to reporters in this small Israeli town on a strategic
plateau captured from Syria, Sharon renewed his demands for strong
steps to end the 19-month Palestinian uprising, which has claimed
the lives of 565 Palestinians and 36 Israelis.
   ``We have to stop using slogans, dishing out promises and handing
out tranquilizers. The time has come to deal with terror and
violence,'' Sharon said.
   ``I think we are in a war, it's a different kind of war but a
war,'' he said. ``The most important thing is to restore law and
order, to bring an end to terror and violence called the intefadeh
(Arabic for uprising).''
   Sharon, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc, said the government also must ``eliminate the heads of
the terrorist organizations, first of all, Arafat.''
   Unless this is done, he said, ``I do not see any real possibility
of arriving at peace or starting a peace process.''
   It was not Sharon's first threat against the chief of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. On Jan. 28, he said on Israel
radio ``there will be no peace as long as Arafat lives.''
   Sharon's tour of the Golan, annexed after its capture from Syria
in 1967, came as the Cabinet faced its toughest political crisis,
which Sharon prompted by proposing a list of hard-line amendments to
the government's peace initiative.
   A 61-year-old retired general, Sharon is also a former defense
minister who spearheaded Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon to rout
PLO guerrilla strongholds from that country.
   He was forced out of the post in 1983 when an Israeli inquiry
commission found him indirectly responsible for the slayings of
hundreds of Palestinians by Israeli-backed forces in the Sabra and
Chattilla refugee camps in Beirut.
   But recently Sharon has made a comeback. His most notable gain
came July 5 when he forced Shamir to accept as Likud policy a list
of preconditions to the prime minister's peace initiative.
   Shamir's plan calls for holding elections in the occupied
territories to elect Palestinians to negotiate limited self-rule
with Israel, and Sharon's chief condition was that any vote be
delayed until the end of the uprising.
   The conditions triggered a Cabinet crisis when the center-left
Labor Party responded last week by threatening to leave the
government unless it was made clear that Likud's hard-line stance
was not government policy.
   The homes of the two 16-year-old Palestinians were destroyed in
Gaza City's Shajaiya quarter after the two were arrested for
allegedly killing 64-year-old Zalman Yosef Schlein in the southern
Israel town of Gan Yavne.
   ``The two confessed to planning and carrying out the murder with
a nationalist motive,'' the army said in a statement.
   The two, Nahed Yusef Radwan Gundiah and Mohammed Mahmud Ayed
Hamdiya, also allegedly confessed to belonging to groups associated
with Fatah, Arafat's mainstream faction of the PLO, the army said.
   At least 20 people were said to have lived in each house, and the
noise of the explosions could be heard across Gaza City, Arab
reporters said.

<HEAD>China Denounces Group Of Seven's Censure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with protest to France; picks up

<TEXT>
   China today denounced the seven leading
industrialized nations for their ``gross interference'' in calling
on China's Communist leaders to end their crackdown on participants
in the pro-democracy movement.
   The strongly worded response mirrored earlier Chinese reaction to
sanctions individually imposed by some of the seven, including the
United States and France, after the Chinese army violently crushed
the movement on June 4.
   President Bush has suspended all military sales to China.
   The government also protested that its embassy in Paris was
attacked for the second time since the crackdown and that the
bicentennial parade in the French capital last week included Chinese
pro-democracy students.
   A front-page editorial in the Communist Party newspaper, the
People's Daily, called on the Group of Seven to follow a foreign
policy based on economic and strategic considerations and not by
judging other nations.
   ``The actions taken by the Chinese government have in no way
offended the West or any other country,'' it said. ``The problem
arises simply because certain countries, out of their own likes and
dislikes and their sense of value, have in a broad scope directly
damaged China's interests and dignity with words and deeds.''
   The editorial said ``the near-sighted practice of keeping China
away from the world community may not only undermine world peace and
stability, but hurt the interests of the Western countries as well.''
   For years China crafted its own foreign policy with a heavy
ideological content, but in the past decade it has shifted to a
policy based on practical interests. It has shed its isolation of
the 1960s and early 1970s, and exchanges in education, culture,
science and sports have become routine.
   Most important, foreign investment and technology are now
critical to its ambitious goal of doubling national income by the
year 2000. But the editorial said foreign withdrawal of investment
would only encourage a spirit of self-reliance.
   The Group of Seven _ the United States, Great Britain, West
Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canada _ included their comments
on China in a communique issued at the end of their Paris summit
this weekend.
   ``We urge the Chinese authorities to cease action against those
who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to
democracy and liberty,'' it said.
   Hundreds of people were killed when the army attacked unarmed
civilians June 4 in clearing central Beijing of pro-democracy
protesters. Thousands have been arrested nationwide since and the
official media have reported 12 executions directly linked to the
protests.
   Official Chinese news reports on the summit did not mention the
portion of the communique dealing with China, but the People's Daily
editorial was read on the radio and the official Xinhua News Agency
issued a full English translation.
   The editorial did not quote from the Group of Seven statement,
but said it ``made unwarranted charges'' based on the seven nations'
``so-called values.''
   ``These groundless charges, which only represent gross
interference in China's internal affairs, are certainly unacceptable
to the Chinese government and people,'' it said.
   It also reiterated government warnings aimed at Hong Kong
residents who support the mainland's pro-democracy movement. The
British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   ``You carry out your capitalism and we carry out our socialism,
and neither side should poke its nose into the other's affairs,'' it
said. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents have protested
the crackdown and some have helped smuggle mainland fugitives to the
West.
   ``We advise those people not to lift a rock only to crush their
own feet,'' the editorial said cryptically.

   The trial of a Turkish auto mechanic accused
of scheming to pass American military secrets to the Soviets and
East Germans began today with jury selection.
   Prosecutors have yet to reveal if an Army warrant officer named
as a co-conspirator will testify, as expected, at the U.S. District
Court trial of Huseyin Yildirim, 61.
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield began jury selection in
the trial of Yildirim, who was a mechanic at Field Station Berlin, a
key eavesdropping base of the National Security Agency.
   He is accused of scheming with Warrant Officer James William Hall
III to provide military secrets to the Soviets and East Germans.
Yildirim is charged with conspiracy to provide classified
information.
   Hall, who isn't charged in the civil case, pleaded guilty to
spying at his court-martial and was cashiered from the service and
sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   The two men allegedly supplied the Soviets with secrets from 1983
to 1988 in an operation that intelligence officials have said may
have endangered ground troops in Europe and inflicted serious damage
to America's electronic espionage capabilities.
   Two women close to Yildirim, Peggy Bie and Ella Pettway, have
been quoted as saying that Yildirim is innocent and was actually a
double agent working on behalf of American intelligence.
   The case is being tried here because Hall was assigned to the
intelligence units at Fort Stewart, outside Savannah, before being
indicted.
   Yildirim was arrested in Balleair Beach, Fla., on Dec. 21.
Edenfield ordered the records in the case sealed April 13, and the
pretrial hearing in May was kept secret.
   Hall, 30, an intelligence analyst in the 24th Infantry Division
at Fort Stewart who spent much of his career in Europe, was
sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined $50,000 during court
martial proceedings at Fort McNair near Washington, D.C., in March.
   He pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage
and failing to obey Army regulations. As part of his sentence, a
military judge ordered Hall dishonorably discharged and required he
forfeit all future Army pay and allowances.
   Hall has cooperated with Army officials since his arrest, but the
government has not revealed whether he will testify against Yildirim.

   Five more Roman Catholic Churches have closed as
part of Cardinal Edmund Szoka's program to eliminate 30 inner-city
parishes that have been losing members.
   Sunday's closings brings to 26 the number of churches that have
shut their doors. Four others are to close later this year.
   ``We're all very unhappy but reconciled, I guess,'' said George
Blanchard, a member of St. Monica parish for 65 years. ``What else
can you do?''
   Also holding final Masses on Sunday were Antioch, Patronage of
St. Joseph, St. Stanislaus and Resurrection churches.
   Parishioners and officials of 18 parishes were turned down Friday
by the Michigan Court of Appeals in their effort to block the
closings.
   ``My father died a year and a half ago at 96, and I'm just glad
he didn't have to see this,'' said Mary Wojcik, a member of
Resurrection parish. ``It would have broken his heart.''
   The archdiocese cites declining membership, a shortage of priests
and the costs of maintaining the large churches as reasons for
ordering the closings.

   Typhoon Gordon left at least 12 people
dead and hundreds homeless as it roared across the northern
Philippines, officials said today. Eight children swept away by
floods were among the dead.
   The storm, packing winds as high as 115 mph, was heading toward
Hong Kong, prompting the British colony to order its army to move
about 11,000 Vietnamese boat people from tent camps to emergency
accomodations.
   Thousands of Hong Kong workers were allowed to leave work early
and packed subways and buses to get home and prepare for the storm,
expected to hit the colony early Tuesday.
   Rescue operations in the Philippines today were hampered by
strong winds and heavy rain whipped up by a second tropical storm
that buffeted Manila and the western coast of Luzon Island.
   Eight children were drowned Sunday in flooding near the Amburayan
River near Bangar, about 160 miles north of Manila, the government's
Office of Civil Defense said.
   Nine other people were reported missing in the area, it said.
   Four people were killed when heavy rain triggered landslides near
the mountain resort of Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.
   In the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan, officials said more than
1,500 families fled their homes to escape flood waters and more than
1,400 homes were destroyed.
   Crop damage in the two provinces was estimated at $15.8 million.
A bridge linking the two provinces also was heavily damaged by the
typhoon, officials said.
   Gordon was the strongest typhoon to strike the Philippines this
year. It slammed into Luzon, the main Philippines island, early
Sunday with winds of up to 116 mph and was reported today heading
for China at 14 miles an hour.
   Officials said casualty and damage reports were incomplete
because of flooding in the affected areas, which was worsened by the
tropical storm, which was reported today about 490 miles
east-northeast of Batanes, the country's northernmost province, and
was headed toward Japan's Ryukyu Islands at 12 mph with maximum
winds of 47 mph.
   Although the storm was well north of the Philippines, the
government weather service said it triggered monsoon storms that
drenched Manila and other areas of Luzon with heavy rain.
   Philippine Airlines canceled two domestic flights because of
today's storm, and major highways linking Manila with northern Luzon
were impassable due to floods.

<TEXT>
   More than 150 pounds of cocaine with an
estimated street value of $7.5 million have been plucked from South
Carolina beaches and waters in the past two weeks, an official said
today.
   The contraband, wrapped in Styrofoam and baled in burlap bags,
may have been from an unsuccessful air drop by smugglers, said James
McGivney, agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration in
Columbia.
   ``Right now we're in the position of trying to determine whether
it was a vessel that kicked them (the bales) off or an air drop that
went bad. We don't have any indication that either a vessel or an
aircraft sank,'' he said.
   Smugglers sometimes bring drugs north on small planes and then
drop them to be picked up by others.
   Some of the bales were found on beaches while others were picked
up offshore by charter fishermen, McGivney said. He didn't know how
many bales were found in all.
   ``Several bales were picked up from as far south as Edisto Beach
and from as far north as the Little River area,'' a distance of
about 120 miles, McGivney said.
   The wholesale value of the cocaine was at least $1.5 million. At
$100 a gram, the drugs have a street value of $7.5 million, McGivney
said. The Coast Guard, Customs, the FBI and the DEA took custody of
the cocaine, McGivney said. No arrests have been made.
   Packages of cocaine also washed ashore on Texas beaches earlier
this month. Officials there speculated that the tightly wrapped
packages came from a drug smuggler's ship that went down in Tropical
Storm Allison in June.
   Officials didn't know how many packages in all were found, but
the largest was 55 pounds, said Cliff Wolfe, a Customs agent in
Houston.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it must have
a formal letter from the United States requesting the release of an
American photographer who was captured after entering the country
with guerrillas.
   Tony O'Brien, who was on assignent for Time-Life Inc., was
arrested June 8 in Kabul at a hideout used by the Moslem guerrillas
who are trying to overthrow the Soviet-supported government.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the Afghan
government has decided in principle to release the 43-year-old
photographer.
   ``But we will need a letter from the American government
requesting us to release Mr. O'Brien,'' Amani said. ``We hope the
American consular officer who is in town is carrying such a letter,
which should also authorize her as the representative of the
American government.''
   Renny Smith from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi arrived in Kabul
on Sunday to oversee O'Brien's release.
   Mrs. Smith said she would not comment on the Afghan demand.
   ``I was told everything was OK. In fact, I have booked myself to
return on Tuesday,'' she said.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Afghan government appeared to be using O'Brien in an effort to force
the United States into issuing a statement that could be construed
as recognizing President Najib's government as legitimate. The
United States supports the rebels.
   A French photographer and an Italian photojournalist captured by
government forces were freed last year, but only after their
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior
officials to Kabul.
   The clemency pleas by the French and Italian governments were
widely publicized by Kabul as a show of official international
recognition.
   The United States withdrew its ambassador from Kabul in protest
after Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a
faltering Marxist government. The U.S. Embassy closed in January in
the final days of the Soviet withdrawal.
   Other major Western nations also closed their embassies, citing
fears of rapidly deteriorating security after the Soviets left.
   The Afghan government said last month it had decided to release
O'Brien, who is from Santa Fe, N.M., in response to a personal
request to Najib from Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat.

<DATELINE>LEIDEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the speech
President Bush delivered Monday at the Pieterskerk, the Church of
St. Peter:
   The Netherlands is an old friend, an honored ally of the United
States. And the friendship between our nations is older than the
American Constitution. And the United Provinces were one of the
models that our founders looked to in creating a nation from 13
sovereign states. And it's a pleasure to visit Leiden, a city whose
very name has symbolized for centuries Dutch determination and the
struggle for freedom against the forces of occupation.
   And for Americans too, Leiden is a special city, a place where we
trace our origins. So many of the individuals who shaped the modern
world walked the cobbled streets of Leiden. And it was here that
Hugo de Groot, known to the world as Grotius, the father of modern
international law, studied in the nation that is today the home of
the International Court of Justice.
   And it was here that Rembrandt lived and worked and created a
world of beauty that moves us still today.
   And it was here to Leiden that the pilgrims came to escape
persecution, to live, work and worship in peace. In the shadow of
Pieterskerk they found the freedom to witness God openly and without
fear. And here, under the ancient stones of the Pieterskerk, the
body of John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual leader, was laid to
rest.
   And it was from this place the Pilgrims set their course for a
new world. In their search for liberty, they took with them lessons
learned here of freedom and tolerance. And the Pilgrams faced the
dangerous passage, but carried on the winds of hope they arrived.
And in the rocky coast of New England, at the edge of a wild and
unsettled continent, they planted the seeds of a new world, a world
that became America.
   And today, as when the Pilgrims left this city, a new world lies
within our reach. Our time is a time of great hope, and a time of
enormous challenges. The new world we seek is shaped by an idea, an
idea of universal appeal and undeniable force. And that idea is
democracy. The power of the democratic idea is evident everywhere _
in the halls of government, in the hearts of people around the world.
   In the words of Victor Hugo, ``No army can withstand the strength
of an idea whose time has come.'' And ladies and gentlemen,
freedom's time has come.
   We, the people of the United States and the people of the
Netherlands, are fortunate. The freedoms that others are struggling
for are freedoms that we enjoy.
   But freedom never comes without struggle, and no struggle is
without sacrifice.
   The Americans and the Dutch both know that the cost of freedom is
high, and that's why both of our nations are partners in an alliance
of free nations that spans the ocean that the Pilgrims crossed. Our
alliance, the NATO alliance, connects two continents, unites a
hemisphere.
   But what connects us isn't merely a fact of geography. Ours is an
alliance forged on common values, rooted in a shared history and
heritage and a common kinship and culture as well. We are part of
the commonwealth of free nations.
   Almost two months ago, I came to Europe to celebrate the fruits
of our alliance, four decades of peace and prosperity and freedom.
At the time of NATO's founding, amid the airlift to a besieged
Berlin, few would have prediced a peace so strong and lasting. Here
in the Netherlands and elsewhere, some people expected war to come
again within their lifetime. Instead, the NATO era has brought the
longest period of peace that Europe has known in the modern age.
   And let me assure you, Americans know that to keep the peace in
Europe is to keep the peace for America. And today the Atlantic
alliance, formed to contain the threat of Soviet expansionism, is
creating new opportunities to ease tensions, to build a new world,
to build an enduring peace.
   And thanks to NATO's strength and unity, we now have the
opportunity to move beyond containment, to integrate the Soviet
Union into the community of nations. Thanks to NATO's steadiness of
purpose and its commitment to maintain strong deterrent forces, the
way is now open to real reductions in the level of arms that has
long cast a shadow over this continent, the most heavily militarized
on earth.
   In seizing these opportunities, reaching that new world depends
on the unity and strength of the entire alliance, not on the actions
of one nation alone.
   The revival of the Western European union, in which the
Netherlands played a vital role; the growing cooperation on security
issues between West Germany and France; British and French resolve
to modernize their own nuclear forces _ each of these developments
is a sign that Europe sees the wisdom of sustaining the collective
strength that has kept the peace.
   The lesson of our post-war experience is this: Strength has kept
us safe and has created opportunities for change, and from these
opportunities, we can create a new era of enduring peace.
   Let me say clearly: A stronger Europe, a more united Europe, is
good for my country. It's good for the United States of America. And
it's a development we welcome, a natural evolution within our
alliance, the product of true partnership 40 years in the making.
   This trend toward closer cooperation isn't limited to collective
security alone. Around the world, countries are now recognizing that
no nation, no nation, can prosper in economic isolation, and that's
why we look forward to the single European market and the more
integrated European Community.

   Jury selection began today in a civil trial
arising from the 1983 Korean Air Lines disaster in which a jumbo jet
strayed into Soviet air space and was shot down by a Soviet fighter
plane, killing all 269 people aboard.
   Families of passengers killed in the shootdown of Flight 007 are
seeking to prove in court that the airliner's crew engaged in
willful misconduct.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization concluded Flight
007 had been off course for nearly 5{ hours before it was destroyed.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson is presiding at the
civil trial, which he told a pool of 36 prospective jurors will last
three to four weeks. A six-member jury and three alternates are to
be chosen from the pool of District of Columbia residents.
   Lawyers for the families said they expect to present about 10
witnesses, several of them Korean Air Lines crew members who flew
the northern Pacific route of the ill-fated Flight 007. Lawyers for
the airline said they may present nearly two dozen witnesses,
including as many as 11 employees of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   Lawyers for the families suggest in court papers that crew
members aboard the Boeing 747 knew shortly after leaving Anchorage,
Alaska, on the last leg of their journey, that because of an error
they made before takeoff they were operating without a reliable
Inertia Navigation System. The three computerized devices aboard the
aircraft were the primary means of navigating the flight.
   Instead of temporarily aborting the flight to reprogram the
system, the crew may have decided to navigate the flight without it,
in clear violation of proper piloting procedure, say the families'
lawyers.
   Crewmen aboard some previous flights that had been aborted had
been disciplined.
   The plaintiffs contend that willful misconduct by the jet's crew
makes the airline liable for damages in excess of the
$75,000-per-passenger limit normally permitted under international
agreement.
   The U.S. government said the plane was lost due to a navigational
mistake and that its pilot did not know he was over Soviet
territory. The Soviet Union contends the plane intentionally flew
its course to photograph sensitive military installations.
   The jumbo jet was flying from New York to Seoul, South Korea,
when a Soviet military jet attacked it over Sakhalin Island, a site
of Soviet military installations.
   Rep. Larry McDonald, D-Ga., who was the chairman of the John
Birch Society, and 60 other U.S. citizens were among the victims.
   KAL says the only inference that can be drawn from the ``assumed
deviation'' from a normal flight path is that the crew was negligent
in failing to notice it had gone off course. The judge said in a
ruling last November that negligence may not be the only explanation.
   ``A failure to notice that the flight was off-course at Point A,
or point B, or Point C ... might be evidence only of negligence,''
said Robinson. ``But a failure to notice that the flight was
off-course at Point A and point B and Point C ... is susceptible to
a different interpretation.''
   That ``different interpretation'' is that ``the crew was aware of
its deviation but elected not to report it and take corrective
action,'' suggested the judge.
   Robinson found sufficient evidence for a conclusion that the crew
of Flight 007 knew the navigation system aboard the plane was
unreliable.

<HEAD>Reporter Covering Union Meeting Detained, Notes Taken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter covering a meeting of
striking carpenters was detained briefly and had his notes and a
tape recording of the proceedings confiscated.
   Johnny Gunter, a business writer for The Clarion-Ledger, was
covering a vote Sunday by carpenter union members on a proposed
contract with Georgia-Pacific's plywood and particleboard mills at
Taylorsville.
   Gunter filed a robbery complaint against Jones Fitzhugh, an
official with the Southern Council of Industrial Workers, and Loyd
McGee, a carpenters union member.
   Fitzhugh and McGee turned themselves in and each posted $200
bond. Justice Court Judge Dale Ford said Gunter would have to file a
civil lawsuit to recover his materials.
   The notes and cassette tape were confiscated near the end of a
meeting at Taylorsville High School that was attended by about 400
striking Georgia-Pacific workers.
   Gunter said he was admitted to the meeting by a union official,
and that he took notes and recorded the discussion. He said he made
no attempt to disguise his presence.
   Toward the end of the meeting, Gunter said, someone pointed him
out to Fitzhugh, who was presiding. Gunter said McGee then
approached him and asked for a camera, which he didn't have, and
then demanded his tape recorder. Gunter refused to surrender it and
was told to leave the meeting _ but that first he would have to give
up his cassette and notebook.
   Gunter said he refused to give up his notes and that he and his
wife, who was with him, got up to leave.
   ``We'd only taken a couple of steps when 20 to 25 men crowded
around us. I tried to shove my way past them and couldn't get
through,'' Gunter said. ``Several of the men were grabbing for my
recorder and notebook. Others locked the auditorium door so we
couldn't leave.''
   Gunter said he finally surrendered his tape and notes and was
allowed to leave. He then filed the robbery complaint.
   Fitzhugh declined to comment after posting bond.

   President Bush rang the curtain down
on his European odyssey today vowing to end East-West divisions and
predicting that ``ultimately, whatever the odds, freedom will
succeed.''
   Bush said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev already is ``moving
in our direction, coming our way'' and he urged the Kremlin to chart
a course ``that brings itself into the community of nations.''
   Bush spoke hopefully of the prospects for political and economic
reforms throughout Eastern Europe in a speech delivered in this
historic North Sea city where Rembrandt worked, Hugo Grotius
formulated theories of international law and the Pilgrims sought
exile before sailing for the New World.
   ``The challenge we face is clear,'' Bush said. ``We must work
together toward the day when all of Europe, East and West, is free
of discord, free of division.''
   Thousands of cheering Dutch people lined Bush's motorcade route
through Leiden waving American and Dutch flags. A banner strung over
the route read, ``Leiden is Georgeous.'' Other hand-held signs
criticized U.S. policy in Central America and demanded that abortion
be kept legal.
   Bush joked later, ``I'm not sure about some of those signs I saw
coming in. It reminded me of my own university, however.''
   Bush toured an exhibit of Pilgrim artifacts and was presented
with a partial family tree showing he is descended from at least two
Pilgrims who lived in Leiden before embarking for the New World in
the 1620s.
   Bush arrived in the Netherlands, the last stop on his 10-day
European tour, after visiting Poland and Hungary and attending
economic summit talks in Paris, where the seven richest industrial
democracies received a Gorbachev proposal for integrating the Soviet
economy with that of the West.
   Saying that dramatic changes were under way in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, Bush cited Gorbachev's letter as ``only the latest
example of the Soviets' moving in our direction.''
   Tracing the rebuilding of Western Europe from the rubble of World
War II, he said that ``the `other Europe' _ the Europe behind the
wall _ endured four decades of privation and hardship, persecution
and fear.''
   Said Bush:
   ``Today that `other Europe' is changing. The great wheel is
moving once more. Our time _ the exciting time in which we live _ is
a time of new hope, the hope that all of Europe can now know the
freedom that you all in the Netherlands has known, that America has
known, and that the West has known.''
   ``Our hope is that the unnatural division of Europe will now come
to an end, that the Europe behind the wall will join its neighbors
to the West, prosperous and free,'' said Bush, making the first
visit to the Netherlands by any American president.
   He said Poland and Hungary are moving at the forefront of
political and economic reform, traveling farther over the past year
than anyone in the West once thought possible.
   Delivering the last major speech of his European trip, Bush spoke
before several hundred people in Pieterskerk, the Church of St.
Peter, a huge cathedral dating to the early 12th century, after
conferring with leaders in The Hague, the nearby seat of the Dutch
government.
   He received an ovation at the conclusion of the speech.
   The president said that during his visits in Eastern Europe, he
heard ``new voices full of new hope. Theirs were the faces of
pilgrims on a journey, fixed on the horizon, on the new world coming
into view.
   ``And they know, as we do, that ultimately, whatever the odds,
freedom will succeed,'' he said.
   Leiden is the community where religious dissidents from England
took refuge before they sailed seeking freedom in America. The
remains of the Rev. John Robinson, a Pilgrim leader, is buried in
the cathedral where Bush spoke.
   ``Here in Leiden, where the Pilgrims dreamed their new world, let
us pledge our effort to create a new world in Europe, whole and
free, a new world now within our reach,'' he said.
   In this nation where protecting the environment is a major issue,
Bush noted that the economic summit leaders focused for the first
time this year on such problems as global warming, acid rain and
ocean pollution.
   Bush said pollution respects no national boundaries. ``It's time
for nations to join forces in common defense of our environment,''
he said. ``The United States will do its part.''
   Bush delivered his address after receiving a 21-gun salute at an
airport arrival ceremony in Amsterdam and having tea with Queen
Beatrix at Noordeinde Palace at The Hague and meeting with Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   The Netherlands, the first nation to establish ties with America
in 1782, is a staunch NATO ally that braved fierce public opposition
in agreeing to accept the basing of nuclear-tipped cruise missiles
in 1985. The missiles were never deployed as a result of the 1987
U.S.-Soviet treaty abolishing the medium-range weapons.
   Bush held nearly an hour of talks at the Parliament with Lubbers,
whose center-right coalition government collapsed in May over the
financing of an environmental cleanup campaign, and was thrown into
a caretaker status pending elections Sept. 6.
   Dutch politicians described Bush's visit as a ``pat on the back''
for a loyal NATO ally. The president returns to Washington on
Tuesday.
   At a post-summit news conference Sunday, Bush admitted he didn't
object when the gathering was cut short after three days with the
cancellation of a farewell dinner.
   ``We're kind of running out of gas,'' Bush said. ``I'll tell you,
it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me'' when
the summit and his participation in the French bicentennial were
coupled with the earlier stops in Eastern Europe.
   Bush hailed the outcome of the summit and said its first-ever
focus on environmental problems was a watershed.
   The final summit communique called for ``decisive action'' to
save rain forests, the atmosphere, and the seas, lakes and rivers,
saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage.
But it offered few specific proposals on how to accomplish these
goals.
   The document addressed a number of Bush initiatives, including
aid to Eastern Europe and endorsement of the administration's Third
World debt plan. It also offered a general endorsement of his call
for help for Hungary and Poland.

   Two former PTL aides charged with evading
$487,000 in federal income taxes had several hundred thousand
dollars more in questionable income the government did not
challenge, an Internal Revenue Service agent testified today.
   IRS Agent Charles F. Mauney, an expert in tax-evasion cases,
testified that David and James Taggart did not report more than
$400,000 in taxable income for the years 1984 and 1985.
   Mauney, who was questioned by government prosecutor David Brown,
testified that the IRS did not challenge more than $320,000 in PTL
payments to the defendants for those years. The defendants are also
charged with similar violations for the years 1986 and 1987 _ a
topic expected to be taken up as Mauney's testimony continues.
   ``There has been some testimony or documents in this trial which
purport to account for some of these (payments),'' Mauney said.
``The government decided not to challenge these items.
   ``A lot of these items are questionable,'' he said. ``If I was
doing a civil examination I would not allow them.''
   The Taggarts, accused of taking more than $1 million in PTL money
to bankroll their extravagant lifestyle, were fired by the TV
ministry following the resignation of PTL founder Jim Bakker.
   Defense attorney Ben Cotten has not ruled out an appearance by
Bakker, who was the defendants' boss and close friend during the
years the Taggarts' were charged with evading $487,000 in income
taxes.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch _ his former top deputy at the
now-bankrupt television ministry _ are scheduled to go on trial in
Charlotte Aug. 28 on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave the jury the day off
Friday. The prosecution is expected to rest its case today after
about two hours of additional testimony.
   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as piano
players. Within a few years, David, 32, was promoted to Bakker's top
personal aide and James, 35, became PTL's interior decorator.
   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the television
ministry when Bakker's resigned in March 1987 following revelations
of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.
   Following a 16-month grand jury investigation into PTL's
operation under Bakker's leadership, the Taggarts were charged with
tax evasion and conspiracy last December.
   Prosecutors accuse them of diverting more than $1.1 million in
PTL money to their own use by taking large cash advances and by
using blank ministry checks to pay off their personal credit card
bills.
   Beginning July 5, testimony from dozens of New York shopkeepers
and friends of the Taggarts showed the defendants went on spending
sprees in the most exclusive stores in Manhattan, Florida,
California and Europe. The purchases included a $96,000 ring and an
$85,000 diamond and sapphire pin.
   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts used money donated to the
tax-exempt religious organization to buy a $640,000 condominium in
the exclusive Trump Tower New York skyscraper on Fifth Avenue.
   On Thursday, the assistant manager of a Charlotte bank testified
the Taggarts' combined net worth grew from $171,000 to nearly $1.7
million from 1984 through 1987.
   If convicted, the Taggarts each face a maximum sentence of 25
years in prison and fines of up to more than $1 million.
   For about seven years, David Taggart served as Bakker's personal
aide for all but a short time in 1983, when he left PTL for several
months. Older brother James was an interior decorator whose firm was
paid more than $1.2 million over three years by PTL.

   The world's major industrial democracies must work to maintain an
open trading system to preserve sustained economic growth. And our
progress at this recently concluded economic summit in Paris brought
us closer to a more coordinated and common approach across a wide
spectrum of critical global issues.
   The key is concerted action, bringing the collective strength of
the West to bear on our common concerns. Concerns like the
environment, global warming, acid rain, and pollution of the world's
oceans _ these are problems that know no borders, that no line on a
map has the power to stop. Pollution crosses continents and oceans,
and it's time for nations to join forces in common defense of our
environment.
   The United States of America will do its part. A little over a
month ago, in the United States, I announced a series of sweeping
changes to our Clean Air Act, changes meant to ensure that every
American, in the space of one generation, will breathe clean air.
   And shortly after I get back to the United States, after I return
home, we will send our clean air legislation to Congress. And last
week, in Poland and Hungary, I announced initiatives to work with
those two countries to combat their pollution problems. The next
step is clear. We must together, take concerted action to combat
this common problem _ clean up our environment for oursevles and for
our children.
   And the summit underscored the fact that it's time we take the
next step in solving the debt problem, to encourage conditions for
global growth that will benefit the industrialized nations and the
developing world alike. We must make progress on this, because it's
more than a matter of economic development. Democracy is at stake.
   Freedom can nourish the barren soil of poverty just as the
Pilgrims landed upon a desolate rock and laid the foundations of the
freedom and prosperity that we know today. Economic and democratic
development go hand in hand. And the steps we've taken towards a
common strategy on debt will sustain a favorable climate of growth,
and for the flourishing of democracy in the developing world.
   And there's Eastern Europe. Let me explain the approach that I
take towards reform in Eastern Europe. We will never compromise our
principles; we will always speak out for freedom. But we understand
as well, how vital a carefully calibrated approach is in this time
of dynamic change.
   The Soviet Union has nothing, nothing to fear from the reforms
that are now unfolding in some of the nations of Eastern Europe. We
support reform in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union. And we're
seeing dramatic changes. General Secretary Gorbachev's recent letter
two days ago, to the economic summit, is only the latest example of
the Soviets' moving in our direction, coming our way.
   I've said it many times, that I want to see perestroika succeed.
I want to see the Soviet Union chart a course that brings itself
into the community of nations. And my visits these last two months
demonstrate how closely the United States is linked to Europe. For
half a century, America has been deeply involved in the future of
this continent and U.S. involvement will be a strategic fact in the
next century as it has been for this one.
   We will play a constructive role in Eastern Europe's economic
development, in the development of political pluralism and in
creating an international climate in which reform can succeed, and
that is why America's relations with the Soviet Union are so
important.
   Improved relations with the U.S.S.R. reduce pressure on the
nations of Eastern Europe, especially those on the cutting edge of
reform.
   The new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working
in concert _ a world where more and more nations enter a widening
circle of freedom.
   In the pulpit here at Pieterskerk, one year after peace was
restored in Europe, Winston Churchill spoke to the people of Leiden.
The allies had triumphed over tyranny. The occupation was over.
After six years of war and devastation, Churchill said: ``The great
wheel has swung full circle.'' Europe then stood at the threshold of
a new era -- an era whose hope Churchill expressed in a single
simple phrase, ``Let freedom reign.''
   And we all know what followed.
   Half of Europe entered that new era and half of Europe found its
path blocked, walled off by barriers of brick and barbed wire. The
half of Europe that was free dug out from the rubble, recovered from
the war and laid the foundations of free government and free
enterprise that brought unparalleled prosperity and a life in peace
and freedom.
   And the other Europe _ the Europe behind the wall _ endured four
decades of privation and hardship and persecution and fear. And
today, that other Europe is changing.

   The nation's main weather satellite has moved
to its summer home, better to watch for hurricanes threatening the
East and Gulf coasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said Monday.
   The self-propelled satellite has moved to a position over the
equator at 98 degrees west longitude _ nearly due south of central
Texas. The satellite has been located at 108 degrees west longitude,
due south of western New Mexico.
   The move means the satellite will be able to see 690 miles
farther east in the Atlantic Ocean to give warning of tropical
storms developing off the coast of Africa.
   Normally the National Environmental Satellite, Data and
Information Service operates two stationary weather satellites at
22,300 miles altitude over the equator, but one of them failed last
January. It will be replaced next year.
   In the meantime the lone stationary satellite is moved west in
the winter to watch out for storms developing in the Pacific Ocean
and east in summer to help track developing hurricanes.

   A passenger ferry capsized in the Jamuna
River near Dhaka and at least 60 people were feared drowned, police
said Monday.
   The ferry was carrying at least 70 passengers when it capsized
during a sudden rainstorm Sunday near Manikganj, about 35 miles
northwest of Dhaka, police said.
   ``We have reports that 10 people swam ashore and the rest are
missing,'' said a police official at Manikganj, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Abdul Kader, an official who helped in the rescue, said it was
unlikely any more survivors would be found.
   ``The river was very fast at the point the boat sank so it was
difficult for anyone to survive even if the person knew how to
swim,'' he said. ``The rainstorm, which lasted 30 minutes, whipped
up high waves as the boat went down.''
   Bangladesh is criss-crossed by hundreds of rivers, and ferries
are a popular means of transport. Ferry accidents are common during
the summer monsoon, which lasts from July through September.

   Heavy rain in central and southern

   The weekend flooding also left 1,413 people homeless in six
provinces south of Seoul. The refugees were taken to schools and

   Property loss, including damage to crops, was estimated at $4.2
million.
   Hardest hit was Taejon, 85 miles south of Seoul, where two
villagers drowned and another was missing when the area was battered
by 9.6 inches of rain Sunday, the government said.
   Service on the Kyongbu Railroad linking Seoul and Pusan was

   The U.S. Agency for International
Development announced Monday a $17 million aid package to
rehabilitate the Tanzania to Zambia railway.
   The money will be used to buy eight electric locomotives, spare
parts, tools and other equipment for the line to enable it to haul
1.9 million tons by 1991.
   The project is part of U.S. support for the nine-member Southern
African Development Coordination Conference, which seeks to reduce
regional dependance on export routes through South Africa.
   The 1,150-mile railway, which links Tanzania's Indian Ocean port
city of Dar es Salaam with Kapiri Mposhi, just north of Zambia's
capital of Lusaka, was built with Chinese assistance in the early
1970s.

   The chairman of a House panel investigating the
Department of Housing and Urban Development said today that the
department's handling of a firm represented by former HUD Secretary
Carla Hills was ``remarkable'' in its laxness.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., referred to a nine-page letter from
President Reagan's HUD secretary, Samuel Pierce, to DRG Funding
Corp. lifting restrictions that had been placed on DRG for
violations of department rules.
   ``When you read this letter you will share my pained amusement,''
Lantos told Mrs. Hills, now the government's top trade official,
during questioning before his Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing.
   The restrictions were lifted after Mrs. Hills, who was employed
as a lawyer for DRG from 1981 to 1984, met with Pierce and other HUD
officials on the company's behalf.
   ``What came out of the meeting was one of the most remarkable
(developments) of Mr. Pierce's eight-year tenure,'' Lantos said.
   ``This is a devastating letter, recounting all of DRG's flaws,
breaches, non-compliance, irregularities and then concludes, `But we
will lift the requirement that you pre-clear loans,''' he said.
   Lantos said he couldn't understand why the department, after
enumerating all of the problems with DRG, dropped a previous
requirement that DRG business be cleared through HUD before
continuing.
   Mrs. Hills said the ``pre-clearing'' policy was hurting DRG's
business because it was slow and cumbersome and was threatening to
put the company out of business.
   She said Pierce's letter was ``very tough'' and she advised her
client, ``You are going to have to be more careful than careful''
from now on.
   Mrs. Hills, who was HUD secretary under President Ford during the
mid-1970s, said she saw nothing inappropriate in representing DRG as
a client after she left office.
   ``My dealings with HUD were purely in my capacity as a lawyer,
representing clients to the best of my ability on the merits of
their case,'' she told the subcommittee.
   Mrs. Hills returned to government service earlier this year as
the Bush administration's U.S. trade representative.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he doesn't want to
see federal support of housing programs suffer because of the
influence-peddling and other problems during the Reagan
administration.
   The topic is sure to come up Wednesday when the House takes up
the fiscal 1990 spending bill for HUD and other agencies including
the Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Congress has fallen far behind schedule in its consideration of
the spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The House
was supposed to pass all 13 of them before the July Fourth recess,
but only two have cleared so far.
   Foley now hopes to pass the rest of them by the August recess.
Three are scheduled for this week, with the agriculture and foreign
operations bills slated for action in addition to the HUD bill.
   The Senate last week began consideration of a State Department
authorization bill.
   Among the debates the bill is expected to draw this week are
whether the United States should continue talks with officials of
the Palestine Liberation Organization who have past links to
terrorism, and whether the White House should be barred from using
other countries to carry out deeds that the administration itself is
barred from doing _ such as what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   After dealing with foreign affairs, the Senate is expected to
turn to the American heartland with a rural development bill. The
legislation would earmark federal money for loans to rural
businesses, upgrading rural water and sewer systems, and provide aid
to rural schools and hospitals.
   Also, negotiators from the Senate and the House continue efforts
to forge a compromise bill to bail out the savings and loan industry.
   The House-Senate conference has tentatively agreed to adopt the
most stringent features from the separate legislation passed by each
chamber, in hopes of preventing a recurrence of the current troubles
which are costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.
   The two chambers were still wrestling last week with differences
over how to finance the thrift industry bailout and how to structure
the new regulatory system.
   How to prevent flag-burning will be discussed as a House panel
continues hearings on ways to overcome a Supreme Court ruling that
upheld the legality of flag-burning as a form of political protest.
Constitutional experts and veterans' groups are scheduled to testify
this week before the constitutional law subcommittee.
   The House ethics committee, which took a breather after its probe
forced the resignation last month of Speaker Jim Wright, is expected
to meet this week to consider the case of Wright's chief accuser,
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   Gingrich, now the No. 2 Republican in the House, is accused of
violating House rules when he formed a partnership to promote his
book with people who had an interest in legislation. The ethics
committee has not yet decided whether to launch a formal inquiry
into the matter.

   Iran has issued its first two postage
stamps depicting Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, it was reported Monday.
   Khomeini, who died June 3, had decreed that during his lifetime,
no pictures of him should appear on stamps or banknotes.
   A 20-rial (about 27-cent) stamp shows Khomeini ``smiling
contentedly as masses beneath mourn his death with a banner pledging
they would continue his path,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency
said.
   A 70-rial (about 94-cent) stamp is a portrait of Khomeini looking
down from a balcony, in his white robe and black cap, as he did
during audiences at his residence in north Tehran.
   The agency said there were no immediate plans to put Khomeini on
banknotes.

   A Jesuit priest who publishes a newsletter on
China said Monday he holds little hope for the country's future
until the demise of aging conservative leaders who are behind the
crackdown on dissent.
   ``I'm not very optimistic,'' said Rev. Yves Nalet, who puts out
the Jesuit-funded China News Analysis. ``It's very rare to have an
elderly leadership with a good vision of the future. They are afraid
of death.''
   Nalet, a 42-year-old Frenchman, and two other priests are
continuing a rich history of Jesuit scholarship on China with their
newsletter published twice a month in this British colony.
   ``One of the traditional works of the Jesuits is to try to
understand what is happening in the society where you live,'' Nalet
said.
   He noted that the Jesuits, a Roman Catholic order founded in 1534
by Ignatius Loyola, has been interested in Chinese culture since the
time of Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), the brilliant Jesuit scholar who
became a court official during the Ming dynasty. Some members of the
order learned classical Chinese and became mathematicians and
astronomers to the country's emperors.
   The Jesuits who write China News Analysis each have a doctorate
in Chinese studies. They subscribe to scores of newspapers and
periodicals from China that form the core of their research.
   Nalet said their publication, which first appeared in 1953, has
about 800 subscribers, including embassies, schools and government
agencies.
   The demand for news and views about China has shot up since the
events of the spring, when a student-led movement for democratic
change in Beijing captured the imagination of the world.
   The government, led by a group of aging revolutionaries, called
in the military to crush the movement and ordered a crackdown on all
dissent. Moderate party chief Zhao Ziyang was sacked and replaced by
Jiang Zemin, the little-known party head of Shanghai.
   ``My impression is that Jiang Zemin doesn't have much power,''
Naley said in an interview in his office. ``The only base he has is
that he's backed by Deng Xiaoping,'' the 84-year-old senior leader
of China.
   The political situation is in ``a period of transition until the
elder leaders die,'' said Nalet, who believes that no real change in
the country can occur until a new generation takes control. No
obvious successor to the aging revolutionaries has emerged, however,
meaning the likelihood of a continuing power struggle.
   Nalet also is pessimistic about China's economy, which has
quickly grown in the past decade under Deng's policy of
modernization and opening to the outside world.
   ``Behind the facade of party unity raw power struggles have
always existed; the latest episode has shattered forever the myth of
a party united in the pursuit of modernization,'' the July 15
edition of the newsletter said.
   The private sector that mushroomed under Deng's policies may be
hit hard by the latest political campaigns that have attacked
Western ideals. ``I don't think many people will want to start a
business of their own, it's too dangerous,'' he said.
   Nalet said that many of Zhao's economic advisers who favored
reforms have lost their jobs in the crackdown, ``so we are going to
go back to a centralized, planned economy.''
   Rural enterprises that also grew rapidly recently may find it
difficult to get raw materials if the government decides to take
strong measures to ensure critical resources go to state-run
factories, he said. That would exacerbate an already serious
unemployment problem in the countryside.
   The Jesuit scholar, in reviewing the events in Beijing, said the
democracy movement ``was too early and went too far.''
   Communist China is only 40 years old and the aging
revolutionaries who still wield power responded to the movement by
saying, ``We have built a country, we have built a party and we
don't want to see this disappear.''
   He expressed hope that the democracy movement ``may have started
a new vision'' among the Chinese. ``How long it will take to come
back is another question.''

   A large square on the trade fair floor guide was
marked ``Japan,'' but only three small Japanese stalls could be
found.
   The Italian Institute for Foreign Trade was not at its assigned
booth, nor was the Association for British Commerce in China. Twelve
Thai companies, a Papua New Guinea exhibit and a large West German
Economics Ministry exhibit also were missing.
   Instead, several dozen stalls at the Beijing International Fair
were occupied by Chinese exhibitors filling in for foreign companies
that backed out at the last minute, either in protest or nervousness
over last month's violence in Beijing.
   The 10-day trade fair, which opened Friday, was Beijing's first
since the army crushed student protesters and supporters in street
fighting, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.
   According to the fair catalogue prepared in advance, the East
bloc countries, China and South Korea _ debuting at a Chinese trade
fair _ were expected to dominate, with relatively few Western
exhibitors.
   But even fewer Westerners showed than expected, and even several
East European companies stayed away out of nervousness. Those
Westerners who came kept a low profile.
   ``Right now we're not talking to the press,'' said a woman at the
booth for the U.S.-China Industrial Exchange Inc., one of two
American exhibitors.
   ``There was some question of `to be or not to be,''' said a
representative with the Czechoslovak company Technopol, which was
exhibiting a wide range of equipment including industrial-sized
kitchen appliances.
   But he said, ``I have no feeling that it's dangerous to be here.
It was terrible, what happened, but I'm sure more people die in a
year in New York City than died in the city of Beijing'' in the
clashes. He refused to give his name.
   ``It's better for us, frankly, that they didn't come,'' he said
of the absentees. ``We don't have so much competition.''
   The official Chinese media have publicized the fair as an example
of how life in Beijing and relations with foreign countries
supposedly have returned to normal. They have not mentioned those
who stayed away.
   Chinese reports also have been silent about one prominent
participant: South Korea.
   Ten South Korean companies filled half of one large hall at the
China International Exhibition Center, in a step forward for the two
countries' newly formed trade ties. Although China still recognizes
North Korea and has no diplomatic ties with Seoul, it announced last
year it would pursue trade with capitalist South Korea.
   Fair brochures did not mention South Korea, but listed its
companies under the umbrella Korean Trade Promotion Corp.
   Thousands of Chinese wandered among the nearly 3,000 exhibits on
Sunday and Monday, but few seemed to be there to do business.
   ``People come to look around, not to buy,'' said a college
student who said her father was working at the center and gave her a
ticket. Tickets were needed to get in, but none were on sale _ all
were distributed by work units to employees as perks.
   Young men with blue work trousers rolled halfway up their legs
and women with children examined a sporty black Daewoo Racer car
parked in the South Korean section. ``Look, it has seat belts,'' one
boy shouted. Few Chinese cars do.
   Technopol's exhibit also was a big draw when the company began
demonstrating its kitchen equipment by mixing and baking dozens of
rolls. ``Soon we'll have something to eat,'' joked one passerby.
   But the biggest attraction seemed to be a bank of Samsung TV sets
on which Western music videos flashed. Dozens craned to watch as
Madonna pranced and sang, ``Like a Virgin.''

<HEAD>China Accuses France of Interfering in Domestic Affairs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Monday accused France of continuing to
interfere in its domestic affairs by allowing Chinese students to
march in the Bastille Day parade in Paris.
   Hundreds of Chinese students wearing headbands with the Chinese
characters for ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' rode bicycles in
the parade Friday. They carried a banner saying, ``We carry on.''
   During a meeting with the French Ambassador Charles Malo, a
Foreign Ministry official called it ``an attack by insinuation
against the Chinese government.''
   The official noted the students participated in a celebration
that was attended by dozens of heads of state and broadcast live to
many countries, ``thus creating a very bad impact throughout the
world.''
   He also said France has ``repeatedly taken actions unfriendly to
China,'' but did not elaborate.
   China repeatedly has criticized France for giving refuge to
leaders of the crushed pro-democracy student movement, among them
Wu'er Kaixi.
   The Foreign Ministry official also said a group of youths
attacked the Chinese Embassy in Paris on Friday, smashing
second-floor office windows and prying away a copper doorplate.
   It was the second time China has protested an incident at its
embassy in France. China says a group of people occupied the embassy
June 29 and harassed the staff.
   Relations between the two nations have been strained since troops
put down the student movement on June 3-4, killing hundreds _
perhaps thousands _ of people. France froze contacts at all levels
two days later.
   Attache Jean Poncet said regular contacts up to the ministerial
level continue, but they are ``not always pleasant contacts.''
   On Friday, the French community in Beijing marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution with a brief ceremony that
contrasted sharply with the festivities in Paris.
   The French Embassy originally planned an all-night party with
bands and orchestras, dancing, buffets and fireworks in the city's
diplomatic section. Instead, about 200 of Beijing's French community
attended a one-hour ceremony at the embassy.
   Malo read the first two articles of France's first Declaration of
the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but ``he didn't speak (and)
didn't mention China at all,'' Poncet said. The document, approved
by the National Assembly in 1789, upholds the rights of all people
to freedom and equality.
   ``We didn't feel it was right'' to hold a larger celebration,
Poncet said, explaining the embassy didn't want to invite Chinese
officials.
   ``Not because of the persons themselves, but because they
represent (Chinese) institutions,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will recall almost 1.3 million
cars that violate federal pollution-control standards due to a
faulty part, the Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The agency said Ford would begin notifying owners of the problem
on July 24, starting with owners in California. Because of the large
number of vehicles involved, the recall will be conducted in stages
through February 1990, it said.
   The cars have a faulty part in the fuel injector. Dealers will
replace it free of charge with an improved-design injector, EPA
said, and may be required to replace the catalytic converter, the
exhaust-gas sensor and the electronic engine control processor.
   The agency said it discovered the fault, which causes excessive
emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, during testing of
1985 and 1986 model Fords.
   The vehicles to be recalled are 364,000 1985 Ford 2.3-liter
Mercury Tempo and Topaz cars; 339,000 1986 Ford 2.3-liter and
2.5-liter Tempo, Taurus, Taurus wagon, Topaz and Sable cars; and
579,000 Ford 2.3-liter, 2.5-liter and 1.9-liter Tempo, Taurus,
Taurus wagon, Escort, Escort wagon, EXP, Topaz, Sable, Lynx and Lynx
wagon cars of the 1987 model year.

<DATELINE>FRIARS POINT, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White residents are seeking what
blacks in many Southern cities spent decades fighting for _ a voice
in their government.
   Only 15 percent of the 1,300 residents of Friars Point, a
Mississippi Delta hamlet, are white. Blacks fill all five positions
on the Board of Aldermen. The last white alderman, Charles Wilson,
lost a bid for re-election in June.
   ``Why should the rights of a white minority be any different than
the rights of a black minority?'' asks John Yount, who started a
petition drive asking the board to create four wards, one with a 65
percent white voting-age population, with a fifth alderman to be
elected at large.
   Under a ward system, Yount said: ``I don't know if a black man or
a white man will be elected out of our district, but at least he
would be accountable to us.''
   Yount said he passed the petition among about 80 percent of the
nearly 200 whites in Friars Point, and received only 20 signatures.
   There is little opposition to a ward system, but some question
whether it should be drawn along the racial lines proposed by Yount.
   ``I don't see _ mathematically, no way _ that we could draw a
line putting all of the white people in the district and come up
with a 65 percent ward,'' said Mayor James Washington, who is black.
``There's no way.''
   But Washington added that he and the board favor a ward system.
   Town attorney Hunter Twiford said Monday he had prepared a
recommendation for changing the town government to a ward system and
may present his proposals to the board Tuesday night. The board then
must decide whether to order a demographic study for drawing up the
wards.
   If the board does vote to change, it would have to get U.S.
Justice Department approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
which requires prior approval of all election changes in Mississippi.
   Friars Point was founded in the early 1830s by John Friar, who
came ashore by flatboat from St. Louis. The northern Mississippi
river town prospered for about 50 years in the days of the steamboat
until railroads took over, then became a mostly white farming
community.
   In the late 1940s, mechanization pushed black field hands into
town looking for work, and whites gradually became the minority.
   About 150 whites live in a sliver of suburbia nudged against the
Mississippi River levee by larger black neighborhoods. Blacks work
for whites, rarely vice versa.
   Yount says the ward system is the whites' only chance of getting
representation, and that they'll go to court if necessary.
   ``We're not trying to decrease the authority of the board,'' said
Yount, 42, who manages the main office of a farming operation in
nearby Marks. ``If (Wilson) had been re-elected this past time, this
would never have come about. We have houses there, we have property
there. We want to be involved in city government.''

<TEXT>
   An opposition lawmaker was charged with
espionage Monday for allegedly receiving $120,000 from North Korea
and running for public office on the order of communist agents.
   In the most serious such case in South Korean history, the Agency
for National Security Planning said Suh Kyung-won was turned over to
prosecutors, who have 30 days to produce the indictment needed for
trial.
   If convicted, Suh, 52, could face the death penalty.
   Suh aide Pang Yang-hyun, who also was charged with espionage, is
accused of being the middleman in Suh's alleged transactions with
the Pyongyang government.
   The intelligence agency said Suh received a total of $120,000 on
14 occasions between April 1985, when he was allegedly recruited by
North Korean agents, and December 1988.
   The intelligence agency's evidence included photographs, bank
records, a North Korean passport it said Suh used, a memorandum he
allegedly wrote for communist agents, straw slippers from a hotel in
Pyongyang and paper on which he allegedly wrote code words for North
Korean agents.
   The evidence also included notes intelligence agents said Suh
made during a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung,
outlining Kim's ideas for unification.
   Ahn Ung-mo, deputy director of the security agency, said Suh ran
for the National Assembly as a member of the leading opposition
Party for Peace and Democracy. Suh did so on secret orders from
North Korea, which had given him campaign funds, Ahn said.
   ``Suh won a seat in the National Assembly under direction from
North Korea, passed secrets to Pyongyang and staged various
anti-government activities,'' Ahn said.
   The leading opposition Party for Peace and Democracy expelled Suh
as a member after he was arrested June 28 and it has accused the
government of harassment and political sabotage for the questioning
of party members.
   The leader of the party, Kim Dae-jung, turned down two requests
to be interviewed by intelligence agents, saying he had nothing to
add to the investigation that authorities cannot learn elsewhere.
   Suh, a farmer and dissident-turned-lawmaker, surrendered June 25
after first telling party leaders he had illegally visited North
Korea in August. He was arrested June 28 on charges of violating
national security.
   South Korea forbids unauthorized trips to North Korea,
maintaining that dialogue on unification must be conducted through
official channels.
   The case is the most serious of its kind since the peninsula was
divided at the end of World War II because of the alleged frequency
of Suh's contact with North Korea and the political overtones.
   In 1949, shortly after the new government took office, some South
Korean legislators were accused of pro-North Korea activities. In
the early 1970s, a lawmaker was investigated for communist activity.
   Also Monday, news reports said immigration controls have been
tightened to block foreigners from entering South Korea to
participate in a peace march aimed at unification.
   About 100 foreigners, including about 30 Americans, were expected
to enter the country for a July 20-27 ``International Grand Peace
March for the Reunification of the Korean Peninsula.'' Authorities
said the march would be stopped.
   Immigration procedures were tightened at all ports of entry and
police were checking hotels for marchers already suspected to be in
South Korea, according to Seoul newspapers.
   South Korean law prohibits foreigners from engaging in political
activity, and in the past those breaking the law have been detained
and deported.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Business Inventories Suggest More Production Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business sales were virtually flat in May while
inventories rose 0.7 percent, the government said Monday, leading
some analysts to predict further production cutbacks during the rest
of the year.
   ``The implication is that production is going to slow some more
in the second half of year,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   ``It could imply a small inventory correction in the second
half,'' said James Annable, an economist at the First National Bank
of Chicago.
   When not accompanied by increases in sales, rising inventories
often prompt manufacturers to cut back production until stockpiled
goods are sold, resulting in a loss of jobs.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May
after a 0.8 percent rise in April.
   The pace of business sales, on the other hand, hardly moved,
rising a minuscule 0.02 percent to a seasonally adjusted $517.9
billion. Sales had risen 2.0 percent in April after holding steady
in March.
   The May business activity produced a slight increase in the ratio
of inventories to sales. It was 1.5, meaning it would take 1{ months
to exhaust inventories at the May sales pace. The ratio was 1.49 in
April and 1.51 in March.
   Analysts noted the buildup was most felt in the retail area,
where the economy has slowed the most as the Federal Reserve
tightened credit to contain inflation. Inventories were up 0.9
percent compared with a sales decrease of 0.1 percent.
   ``I'm starting to wonder whether retailer inventories are getting
out of hand,'' said Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank
in New York. ``The numbers suggest they're growing a little too
fast.''
   The automobile industry, which has seen swollen new car
inventories, already has reduced production at some factories.
Commerce said auto inventories rose 0.9 percent in May while sales
dropped 1.8 percent from April.
   But even without the automobile category, inventories rose 0.9
percent in May.
   Other major inventory increases were noted at department and
clothing stores, Steinberg said. Overall, general merchandise
inventories rose 2.2 percent.
   All categories showed increased inventories in May, however.
   In addition to the 0.9 percent increase in the retail area,
manufacturers' backlogs were up 0.6 percent while wholesalers'
buildup was 0.8 percent. Inventories were 8.1 percent above May 1988.
   Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5
percent. Manufactuers' sales fell 0.2 percent and retailers' were
down 0.1 percent. Sales rose 8.2 percent over May of last year.

<TEXT>
   A review of Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty's
case by the communist authorities is raising hopes he will be
declared innocent of treason and other trumped-up charges on which
he was convicted 40 years ago.
   The world watched in disbelief in 1949 when Hungary subjected him
to the kind of show trial Josef Stalin used so often in the Soviet
Union. There were allegations the Roman Catholic prelate was drugged
into submission.
   Mindszenty was released during the uprising of 1956 and fled to
the American legation in Budapest, which later became the U.S.
Embassy. He remained there for 15 years before being granted safe
passage to Rome.
   The reform movement sweeping Hungary already has resulted in the
rehabilitation of Imre Nagy, the premier executed for leading the
uprising aginst Stalinism.
   Church officials hope the same will be done for Mindszenty, who
died in Vienna in 1975 at age 83. His rehabilitation would vastly
improve the climate for a visit to Hungary by Pope John Paul II
scheduled for September 1991.
   ``The rehabilitations have started,'' said the Rev. Ervin
Szepesdi, chief aide to Cardinal Laszlo Paskai, current leader of
the Hungarian church.
   He would not give further details, a possible reflection of the
matter's sensitivity, referring instead to reports in official media
last week that the review was under way.
   Mindszenty's case became a symbol of the Cold War and religious
persecution in the Soviet bloc. Its resolution presents several
difficulties, including the allegations of drugging and reports that
important documents have disappeared.
   L'Avvenire, the newspaper published by the Italian Bishops
Conference, said Thursday: ``The long suffering of the primate of
the Hungarian church remains in the history of the country as one of
the most grevious wounds inflicted on the nation's Christian
tradition.''
   The cardinal was appointed to the primacy with the communist
government's asseent, but tension between church and state grew and
he was arrested at the end of 1948.
   In February 1949, Mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison for
high treason after confessing, almost certainly under the effect of
duress or drugs, to most of the charges against him. Protests came
from around the world.
   At the U.S. mission, he lived in a third-floor apartment until
the Vatican worked out the departure arrangement in 1971. Its
efforts to gain his freedom were complicated by Mindszenty's desire
to be cleared before leaving.
   The decision of Pope Paul VI to remove Mindszenty from the
primacy of the Hungarian church in 1974 was followed by improved
relations between Hungary and the Vatican.
   Mindszenty regarded himself as a sacrifice to a thaw in the Cold
War, writing in his memoirs he became an unwelcome guest of the
Americans ``because I stood in the way of the policy of detente.''
   Last week, the official news agency MTI quoted Paskai as saying
in a letter to the government he believed the review of Mindszenty's
``unlawful conviction'' would increase the government's credibility
and promote ``national reconciliation.''
   Premier Miklos Nemeth responded by confirming ``that the
Hungarian government had requested the prosecutor general to review
the penal procedure'' against Mindszenty, the agency said.
   There has been no indication of how long the review would take.
   About half the 10.6 million people in Hungary are Catholics, but
many no longer practice the faith.

   Narcotics and money-laundering schemes
may link Chicago mob bosses to a cult-influenced drug ring blamed
for 15 slayings near Matamoros, Mexico, a newspaper reported.
   ``We can acknowledge we are looking into a relationship, but I
really can't go into any details,'' said Charles Harrison, assistant
special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs regional office in
Houston.
   But officials in Chicago said today they knew of no such
connection.
   The Brownsville Herald reported Sunday in a copyright story that
Harrison's agency is investigating a possible relationship between
Chicago organized crime leaders and the cult ring.
   It identified Manuel ``Poncho'' Jaramillo, who lives in Mission,
Texas, as an alleged connection between the two groups. The
newspaper cited court transcripts, indictments, affidavits and
police records filed in drug and racketeering cases in south Texas
and Illinois.
   Jaramillo's Houston attorney, Dennis Yates, called drug and
racketeering allegations against his client ``harassment.''
   ``Those accusations, as far as we're concerned, are absolutely
untrue,'' Yates said. ``They aren't substantiated, they have not
been substantiated and they never will be substantiated.''
   Among Jaramillo's associates are Albert Caesar Tocco, a reputed
Chicago mob boss arrested in January by FBI agents and charged in a
48-count federal racketeering indictment, according to the Herald.
   Bob Long, an FBI spokesman in Chicago, said he knew nothing about
it.
   ``Apparently they're saying Tocco may have some involvement''
with the Matamoros drug ring, Long said by telephone today. ``They
may or may not be correct,'' he said.
   Tocco, 59, is jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
downtown Chicago awaiting a Nov. 6 trial on the racketeering charges.
   Jerry Gladden, chief investigator for the Chicago Crime
Commission, also said he's unaware of any connection between the
Chicago mob and the cult ring.
   Jaramillo also is allegedly connected with members of the
Matamoros-based Hernandez family, which Mexican and American agents
believe was central to a gruesome cult accused of killing 15 people,
federal investigators said. Police have said some of the cult's
victims were sacrificed in rituals aimed at protecting a narcotics
ring.

<TEXT>
   Robert Muthiah left his home in
northern Sri Lanka and bicycled 170 miles to Colombo to escape
recruitment into a Tamil militia that is supported by Indian
peacekeeping troops.
   Residents say the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front,
which controls the government of the Northeastern Province, is
preparing for another round of fighting with rival militias by
forcing Tamils to join its ranks.
   Hundreds of Tamil youths have fled the region, claiming the group
was picking up men from their homes, shaving off their hair and
eyebrows and forcing them to undergo training at military camps.
   ``It is not safe for me at home any more,'' said Muthiah, 25, who
registered at a relief center set up for the Tamils near Colombo.
``Tamil groups assisted by Indian peacekeeping troops have been
cordoning off villages and searching every home for young men.''
   ``I do not want to join any movement,'' he said. ``I just want to
live in peace with my family.''
   Another Tamil youth, Mylvaganan Mathyvathanan, 17, said he jumped
off a jeep taking him to an army camp and made his way to Colombo
from his village in the northern district of Jaffna. He said he
complained to Indian soldiers about the forced conscription, ``but
they just turned away and were not interested.''
   At least 386 men registered last week at the center, which
provides them with food and a place to sleep. Hundreds of others
have visited but have not registered because they do not want to
reveal their identities.
   The Liberation Front admits it is recruiting youths for a civil
volunteer group but denies using force.
   But the recruitments have been stepped up since May, when a rival
militia, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, opened talks with the
government.
   The two groups have been bitter rivals since the Liberation Front
accepted a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil secessionist
war. The Tigers rejected the accord's offer of limited autonomy and
continued fighting for an independent Tamil nation.
   The accord was sponsored by neighboring India, which sent in
troops to enforce a surrender by the Tamil groups. The Indian
soldiers have aligned with the Liberation Front and hold joint
patrols with its members to ferret out the Tigers.
   ``We have reports that the abductions are done with the
connivance of the Indian peacekeeping forces,'' says Foreign
Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. ``I have taken up this matter with the
Indian High Commission (embassy) who have said they will look into
the charge.''
   Indian officials in Colombo deny the charge. But the New Delhi
government has said it supports the Liberation Front government and
views the Tigers' talks with Colombo with suspicion.
   Wijeratne says also that the provincial government was not
authorized to raise a volunteer force.
   ``The civil volunteer force should come under the direct
authority of the inspector-general of police and recruitment,
training and issuing of arms should be done by the deputy
inspector-general of police in charge of the northern region,'' he
said.
   Both posts named by Wijeratne are controlled by the federal
government in Colombo.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
live mostly on the north and east. Tamil militants, including the
Liberation Front and the Tigers, started fighting for an independent
nation in 1983, claiming they were discriminated against by the
Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the separatist war. The
victims include at least 800 Indian soldiers and many Tamils who
were caught up in the fighting between the two groups.

<TEXT>
   Eleven years after a 400-acre landfill
loaded with radioactive and chemical wastes was closed by its
operator, dust is flying as the company tries to stop more waste
from seeping into groundwater and a lake.
   Bulldozers are piling tons of dirt and clay atop the 22 burial
trenches, which residents call poison pits, at US Ecology's landfill
in an effort to put a tight lid on the facility just west of town.
Eventually, there will be a 4-foot-thick layer of dense clay over 65
acres.
   ``We're trying to stop rain water from going down and carrying
(waste) away from the site,'' said Mark Bowen, site manager. ``We're
installing clay caps on the trenches that will cut the water seepage
by more than half.''
   ``By eliminating water from entering the trenches, we hope to
stop the escape of waste buried in them,'' he said.
   After two decades battling the company, residents of Sheffield, a
town of 1,000 people 60 miles north of Peoria, are cynical about
claims the landfill will be stabilized, unconvinced of their safety
and weary of the fight.
   They say that tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, and
solvents, pesticides and poisons escaping into underground water and
seeping into Trout Lake can't be stopped by simply piling new clay
atop the trenches. The buried wastes include highly radioactive
plutonium and uranium, about 100 pounds in all.
   Trout Lake is off limits to fishing, swimming or any recreation
because of the dump.
   The dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the
operator, then called Nuclear Engineering Co., to bury waste in a
new trench. The state said tritium gas was leaking and the ground
was too sandy to prevent wastes from migrating away from the site,
leased from the state.
   The company ``put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the
sheds and sent us a telegram saying `We have finished our work at
the site. Since you own it, it's yours again,''' said Clifford
Weaver, a lawyer who represented the state.
   The state filed a $97 million lawsuit, charging the company had
broken its 99-year lease and demanding that it remove the
radioactive wastes.
   Ten years of litigation produced an agreement from the company,
which became US Ecology Inc. in 1981, to spend $8 million for
immediate maintenance and long-term care of the facility.
   A second state lawsuit demanding exhumation of chemical wastes
remains active.
   ``We've fought the dump for 100 years, it seems,'' said Jay
Langford, a pharmacy owner and member of a citizens group opposed to
the dump. ``They won't stop the leaking. It will leak some more and
they will buy another farm to keep it on their property.''
   As part of its agreement, US Ecology purchased a 170-acre buffer
zone around the dump.
   Langford said the clay cap is only a smoke screen.
   ``They are just so deceiving. They are willing to let it ruin all
our lakes, streams and water supplies. Who cares if they put a
beautiful cap on it? It's what's underneath that's the problem,''
Langford said.
   Beautician Robin Hewitt said she uses bottled water because water
from the town's well ``smells like rotten eggs and chlorine and is
pure rust coming out of the faucets.''
   The landfill trenches hold 7.6 million cubic feet of buried
wastes.
   US Ecology says exhumation of the waste is unnecessary, would
take 15 years and cost $500 million, which would bankrupt the
company.
   ``The caps should be finished by the end of August, and then
we'll start preparing the soil, seeding it and building fence,''
said Mark Cade, company spokesman.
   Cade said no danger is associated with the dump.
   ``The fact is, this site has never been unsafe,'' Cade said.
``This is not a serious problem. It's a perception problem. They say
this is a horrible place but I can't find the horrible place.''

   Barbara Bush unveiled the
cornerstone of a new American school in the Hague on Monday and
confessed that no one can find a similar marker back at the White
House.
   ``One of the great mysteries of the White House is where they put
the cornerstone,'' she said.
   The first lady said historians know when the cornerstone was laid
and who did it, but ``absolutely no one knows where.''
   She added, ``We decided that was one uncertainty we could live
with.'' The White House is currently getting a facelift that
involves scraping off its many layers of paint and restoring the
original stonework.
   Mrs. Bush spoke at the future site of the American School of The
Hague. At this point, the school is still a dusty construction site
with concrete forms.
   The inscription on the stone reads: ``The American School of the
Hague. This cornerstone unveiled by Mrs. Barbara Bush, first lady,
July 17, 1989, on the occasion of the first visit by a president of
the United States of America to the Netherlands.''
   Mrs. Bush was accompanied by Ria Lubbers, wife of Dutch Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers, Susan Baker, wife of Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, and the wives of several other Dutch officials.
   Mrs. Bush and her entourage also stopped in Amsterdam to visit
the Van Gogh Museum. About a dozen demonstrators awaited her,
chanting ``Bush go home.''
   If she saw them, it was only in passing.
   Dirk van der Oord, the museum's public affairs director,
dismissed the protest as ``very old stuff, 20 years ago. For
Amsterdam, it's very small.''
   Touring the museum, Mrs. Bush stopped to scrutinize the Van Gogh
painting, ``Field with Iris,'' and said aloud four times, ``I love

<TEXT>
   The United States has offered to pay up to
$250,000 per person to families who lost relatives when the USS
Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf last
year, the State Department said today.
   But Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said Washington will
only turn over the money if the Tehran government names an
``appropriate intermediary'' to disburse the funds.
   Of the 290 people killed on Iran Air Flight 655 July 3, 1988, 250
were Iranians.
   In general, the U.S. plan calls for Washington to pay the
families of each full-time worker $250,000, while the families of
others will receive $100,000.
   Boucher said the United States is not bound under international
law to compensate the victims' families, but former President Reagan
promised such payments would be made on humanitarian grounds.
   Washington has contacted officials in India, Italy, Pakistan, the
United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia to have them relay the offer to
victims' families in those countries. Although the countries have
yet to respond, Boucher said the United States is confident the
offer will be accepted.
   ``The same offer has been communicated to the government of
Iran,'' he said. ``Unfortunately during the past year the government
of Iran has ignored repeated efforts by the United States to obtain
information from the families of the Iranian victims.''
   Boucher said the U.S. government is ready to make payments to the
families ``so long as the government or Iran permits an appropriate
intermediary to distribute the funds to the families.'' An
intermediary is necessary because the United States does not have
diplomatic relations with Tehran, he said.

<TEXT>
   The war on cancer has brought improved
therapies for America's middle class and affluent but the disease is
too often a needless death sentence for the poor, the American
Cancer Society president said Monday.
   For the 37 million Americans who do not have health insurance and
do not qualify for Medicaid, a cancer diagnosis usually comes when
the disease has advanced to a stage where little can be done except
control the pain, said Harold P. Freeman, cancer society president.
   ``The combination of cancer and poverty is, indeed, a lethal
combination,'' said Freeman, chief of surgery at Harlem Hospital in
New York.
   ``The chance of getting cancer and dying from it is
disproportionately higher among poor Americans, regardless of
race,'' Freeman said in introducing a report based on hearings the
society held along with the National Cancer Institute and the
Centers for Disease Control in May and June.
   He called for ``a new kind of war on cancer, a guerrilla war'' to
break the economic and cultural barriers that prevent the poor from
getting early cancer diagnoses and adequate treatment for the
disease.
   The cancer society says that in general, half of all cancer
patients are expected to live for at least five years after
diagnosis. However, only 35 percent to 40 percent of cancer patients
who live below the poverty level can expect the same, the society
says.
   The society estimates that 178,000 people with cancer who might
have been saved through early diagnosis and treatment will die this
year. Freeman estimated that half or more of them are poor.
   The cancer society's regional hearings found that the poor must
make extraordinary sacrifices to pay for health care and that these
Americans find the health-care system insensitive and intimidating.
   Cassandra Middleton, a 26-year-old cancer victim from John's
Island, S.C., who testified at one of the hearings and joined cancer
society officials at Monday's news conference, summed up her
experience with the medical community: ``They made me feel poor. I
know I am, but they made me feel it, too.''
   Middleton described the bureaucratic maze she had to navigate to
become eligible for Medicaid and other public health assistance.
Only about 45 percent of those living below the poverty level are
eligible for Medicaid.
   For most of the people who have slipped through the holes of the
social safety net, the hospital emergency room becomes their entry
to the health care system. But suspicion of cancer _ even a lump in
the breast _ does not qualify as a medical emergency, and poor
patients with symptoms but not in a life-threatening crisis
generally are not treated, Freeman said.
   One of the key problems, he said, is that cancer prevention
efforts have failed to reach poor Americans because the education
programs are ``unrealistic, they are not relevant and they are not
spoken in the language of the people they are trying to reach.''
   The result is a belief among the poor and uneducated ``that a
diagnosis of cancer is a silent death sentence,'' Freeman said.
``There is a pervasive sense of fatalism in the poor and this leads
to an overall feeling of powerlessness.''
   The cancer society presented the report as a ``national call to
action,'' and gave it to President Bush, congressional leaders and
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   For its part, the cancer society said it is committing $1.8
million for national demonstration programs in Harlem, Miami and
Oakland, Calif., to develop cancer education and detection programs
for the poor. The group recently allocated an additional $1 million
to support local education and research activities targeted to the
poor nationwide.
   Freeman said the society has made no policy recommendations to
Congress or the Bush administration, but he said ``the American
health-care system has to be relooked at.'' The society may make
specific recommendations after its national board meets in November,
he said.

   Actor Kadeem Hardison says he took the part of

   ``I thought I'd make good money in a short period of time and
they were going to let me play a home boy on TV,'' he recalls,
adding his opinion of the show has changed.

surgery Monday to repair a shattered elbow he suffered when he fell
during a London visit.
   Doctors at the University of Utah's Sorenson Medical Center
pronounced the operation a success and said the 56-year-old
Republican will have to wear a cast for some time while the injury
heals, said hospital spokesman John Dwan.
   Bangerter, one of eight governors on a European trip organized by
the National Governors Association, was hurt July 4 when he fell at
Westminster Abbey.

   A flashy white suit and cape made for
Elvis Presley to wear in his 1973 ``Aloha from Hawaii'' concert has
been stolen, according to the Presley impersonator who bought it for
$7,500.
   Charlie Stickerod said the outfit was taken from his home
Saturday night or early Sunday by a burglar who left behind 24-karat
gold Elvis records and other memorabilia.
   ``I'll pay. No questions asked,'' said Stickerod, who is offering
a $5,000 reward for the return of the suit he bought two years ago.
   Stickerod, who has been impersonating ``The King'' since 1978,
said he had planned to wear the white gabardine suit, studded with
blue and red stones and gold stars, for the last time in the United
States at a show Saturday in San Jose.
   The 37-year-old Stickerod said he planned to wear it for the
October premiere of a show in Moscow for Raisa Gorbachev and then
retire the suit and its cape in a glass case at his home.

   China denounced the seven leading industrialized
nations Monday for their ``gross interference'' in calling on
Chinese authorities to stop the crackdown on participants in
pro-democracy protests.
   Instead, the government made clear it plans to continue rounding
up anyone involved in the seven weeks of protests for freedom,
democratic reform and cleaner government. A report in the Communist
Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said those who surrender will
get lenient treatment.
   ``All hesitation is useless,'' it said. ``Surrendering,
thoroughly confessing (and) doing meritorious work ... is the only
way out for all criminals.''
   The strongly worded message to the Group of Seven echoed earlier
Chinese reaction to sanctions individually imposed by some of the
seven, including the United States and France, after the Chinese
army crushed the protests June 3-4.
   The Foreign Ministry expressed ``great regret'' over the Paris
summit's statement, which it said ``violates the most basic
criterion of diplomatic relations.''
   ``China absolutely cannot accept this,'' said the statement read
on state TV.
   A front-page editorial the People's Daily called on the Group of
Seven to consider China's ``global strategic importance'' and
potential as a market.
   ``The near-sighted practice of keeping China away from the world
community may not only undermine world peace and stability, but hurt
the interests of the Western countries as well,'' it said.
   ``The actions taken by the Chinese government have in no way
offended the West or any other country. The problem arises simply
because certain countries, out of their own likes and dislikes and
their sense of value, have in a broad scope directly damaged China's
interests and dignity with words and deeds.''
   The Group of Seven statement, it said, made ``groundless charges,
which only represent gross interference in China's internal
affairs.''
   The seven nations _ the United States, Great Britain, West
Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canada _ included their comments
on China in a communique issued at the end of their summit.
   ``We urge the Chinese authorities to cease action against those
who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to
democracy and liberty,'' it said. It also urged the World Bank to
postpone examining new loans to China.
   More than 200 civilians were killed by official count in the army
attack on protesters and supporters. Western intelligence sources
said up to 3,000 may have died. Thousands have been arrested
nationwide and at least 12 have been executed.
   The Foreign Ministry lodged a separate protest with France for
having allowed Chinese students in Paris to march in Friday's parade
for the bicentennial of the French Revolution. The students carried
a large banner reading, ``We Carry On,'' in implied support for
their Beijing classmates.
   China called the march ``an attack by insinuation'' on its
quelling of the protests and demanded France stop ``interfering in
China's internal affairs.'' China filed two earlier protests with
France since June 4 for allowing several Chinese fugitives to enter
the country and not stopping a protest at its embassy in Paris.
   For years, China crafted its own foreign policy with a heavy
ideological content, but in the past decade it has shifted to a more
hard-nosed policy based on practical interests. Foreign investment
and technology are now key to its modernization program.
   But the People's Daily said foreign sanctions would only
encourage a spirit of self-reliance.
   It also warned Hong Kong residents who try to help the mainland
democracy movement that they should not ``lift a rock only to crush
their own feet.'' The British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   In other developments, the party's Central Disciplinary
Inspection Commission issued a strong warning against corruption by
party members in state-run factories and businesses. In a 10-minute
report that opened the national television news, the commission
ordered party officials to ``raise the ideological quality of party
members'' and impose stricter discipline.
   Beijing city officials announced Monday that they had expelled 77
party members since January for corruption, and Shanghai announced
three expulsions.
   Other local governments have announced hundreds more to try to
convince the public that the party is cleaning up its ranks.

<HEAD>Report Casts Doubt on Effectiveness of Bush's Clean Air Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan for cleaning up the
nation's air is unlikely to meet its goal of eliminating unhealthy
levels of urban smog by the year 2000, the main author of a new air
pollution report to Congress said Monday.
   The report by the Office of Technology Assessment, which advises
Congress on scientific issues, said even if all known methods of
pollution control are used, many cities will remain above federal
limits for smog-causing ozone by the end of the century.
   It said residents of the most polluted cities _ Los Angeles, New
York and Houston _ may have to live with unhealthy levels of smog
for another 20 years or more.
   Bush said last month in proposing a sweeping revision of the 1970
Clean Air Act that his measures would mean the vast majority of the
approximately 100 cities currently in violation of ozone limits
could gain compliance by 1995. The president said all cities would
be within the limits by the end of the century.
   The Office of Technology Assessment study, which was begun two
years ago, did not specifically analyze the Bush proposal, but
Robert Friedman, the report's main author, told a news conference
the administration's forecast was probably too rosy.
   ``I don't see how they're going to do it,'' he said. ``I hope we
are wrong and they are right, but I fear that will not be the case.''
   He said in an earlier interview that between 30 and 45 cities
probably will still be in violation of the ozone standard by the
year 2000, even if all available anti-pollution technologies are
used. Among these are Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Washington,
D.C., Boston, Baltimore and St. Louis, he said.
   The report did not include a complete list of cities and their
prospects for compliance.
   Ozone is formed when hydrocarbons from car exhaust and other
sources mix in sunlight with nitrogen oxides released by the burning
of fossil fuels such as petroleum.
   Ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere, where it filters the
sun's rays. But closer to the ground, ozone turns into choking smog
that some scientists believe could cause permanent lung damage by
limiting the lungs' ability to ward off infection.
   The OTA study said that each year, about 21 million people are
exposed during outdoor exercise to ozone levels above the federal
standard, each of them for about nine hours a year, on average.
About one-quarter of these people live in Los Angeles.
   ``Though experts disagree about the level of danger that ozone
actually poses to the population, a large portion of the American
people live in places where ozone concentrations far exceed those
known to be completely safe,'' the study said.
   The White House is expected to unveil later this week full
details of its clean air proposal, which was announced June 12 in
outline form. Draft legislation incorporating Bush's proposals has
been circulated on Capitol Hill in recent days.
   Friedman said lack of detail in the original administration plan
made it impossible to fully explain why Bush believed more gains
against urban smog are possible than foreseen in the OTA study.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said in a written response to
the Office of Technology Assessment study that it did not take into
account the administration's assumption that state and local
governments would take their own anti-pollution measures to
supplement the federal measures proposed by Bush.
   The EPA said an administration bill would include ``strong
enforcement and compliance provisions to see that non-federal
activities are implemented and succeed.''
   Among the most effective means of curbing ozone are reducing
gasoline's evaporation rate; modifying gas station pumps to trap
escaping vapors, and tightening controls on facilities that treat,
store and dispose of hazardous wastes such as chemicals and sludge.
   The OTA said the cost of employing all available technologies
nationwide would be between $4.4 billion and $7.8 billion a year by
the mid-1990s and between $8.8 billion and $13 billion per year a
decade later.

<TEXT>
   Members of a task force designed to get
``career drug criminals'' off the streets have arrested 456 people,
including 25 charged with murder, officials said Monday.
   The U.S. Marshals Service led the Street Terror Offender Program,
or STOP, aimed at fugitives in the Washington-Baltimore area sought
in drug-related homicides or on other drug charges.
   Some fugitives were arrested as far away as California and
Florida, officials said.
   ``The eight-week program was designed to remove from the streets
career drug criminals,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said at a
news conference announcing the arrests.
   William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, said those arrested ``have found that the criminal
justice system in this area works.''
   The program, Bennett said, proves ``the bad guys can be
apprehended and brought to justice.''
   The $1.3 million federal program, which began May 22, targeted
those with an active drug felony warrant and at least three felony
drug arrests or convictions. Also targeted were suspects with an
active warrant for a drug-related homicide.
   Among those arrested was Herbert Douglas Jr., a suspect in three
Washington homicides.
   Douglas had been sentenced to 146 years in prison after being
convicted in a 1981 shootout with police during an armed robbery,
but he was paroled after serving less than six years. He is charged
with murder in a 1987 killing and a 1989 double homicide.
   Authorities also said they arrested Tony Miller, an alias for
Sean Henry.
   On the day Henry's trial was to begin on charges of distribution
of cocaine, the court received a death certificate for him. He was
subsequently arrested under another name and released, but a
fingerprint check revealed his identity. He was arrested at Parris
Island, S.C., while attending Marine Corps boot camp.
   U.S. Marshals Service Director Stanley Morris said about 62
percent of those sought were considered armed and dangerous, but
that all the arrests were made without a shot being fired.
   STOP targeted 840 fugitives, arrested 456 and filed detainers on
155 already jailed on other charges. A total of 229 remain at-large.
   ``People get tired,'' Morris said in an interview when asked why
the program ended before all the suspects were arrested.
   ``Eight weeks is a long time. Our experience is that's about ...
the length of time you can run an operation like this without people
starting to get homesick, a little careless and start to lose their
edge.''
   The program involved 56 federal marshals and 34 local officers.
Officials lauded the cooperation between federal and local agencies.
   Of those arrested, 172 were wanted for crimes in the District of
Columbia, 154 in Baltimore and 130 in suburban Maryland and Virginia.
   Bennett said a similar program could be carried out elsewhere,
but he would not say where.
   ``It's not the sort of thing you want to let out ahead of time,''
he said.

   The $500 million stealth
bomber flew for the first time today, soaring above the Southern
California desert on a two-hour flight aimed at keeping Congress
from scrapping history's most expensive warplane.
   The B-2, designed to evade enemy radar, was arrayed with
reflective material to allow test personnel to keep track of the
plane and its two pilots.
   The sinister-looking, black jet raced down an 11,000-foot runway
at the secretive Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale and lifted off at
6:37 a.m., with two F-16 fighter jets giving chase through the still
and cloudless desert sky.
   It landed here at 8:30 a.m. after performing test maneuvers over
the Mojave Desert. The plane landed perfectly on the runway's center
line at Edwards, where the space shuttles land after returning from
orbit.
   The bat-winged bomber, 69 feet long with a 172-foot wingspan,
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver, idled for
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar. The B-2 will remain
at Edwards for further tests.
   The plane's landing gear remained down during the flight, as is
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions.
   B-2 test pilot Bruce Hinds later called the bomber ``a very
nimble aircraft'' and said it made a ``rock stable'' landing. Hinds
said the plane handled much the same way it had on a flight
simulator and called it an enjoyable plane to fly.
   The stealth bomber's only previous flights have been on a
computer flight simulation; Air Force and Northrop officials say no
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been
flown.
   The flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber, which
is already 18 months behind schedule. At a budgeted price of $500
million each _ the Air Force wants 132 of the planes _ it is the
most expensive warplane in history.
   A key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding
until the plane proves itself in the air.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday. ``It is far too
expensive to be a stealth taxi.''
   As the plane took off this morning, the ``Star Spangled Banner''
was sung on the runway by Alis Clausen, a member of the staff of a
local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess Taft unfurled the Stars
and Stripes, which was held by a tearful Linda Tokish.
   Thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the
tumbleweeds outside the Palmdale plant shouted ``Here they come,
here they come!'' as the great flying-wing's dark shadow passed
over. ``Great God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   ``I'm shaking. My legs are shaking. It was going right over my
head,'' said Shari Cutler, who came with her four children.
   ``It feels great. It feels just fantastic. A lot of work has gone
into this. Millions of man hours, with people working seven days a
week, 24 hours a day. We feel just great,'' said Air Force Col.
Douglas Kennett.
   ``I was overcome with emotion. I was so thrilled when I saw the
wheels go up. I'm just so excited to know that it's up there now and
I pray that it lands safely,'' Taft said.
   ``This represents the technology of tomorrow,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``It gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence. ... It
represents a new generation of technology and it's the way you're
going to see airplanes look tomorrow.''
   The bomber's maiden flight had been scheduled Saturday, but a low
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight.
   After the flight was canceled, workers checked the aircraft and
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the
bomber's fuel system. The problem was fixed, but no other details
were available, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Fergeson.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs, and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that have formed part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent since
the 1950s.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
several years.

<HEAD>USDA Reports Cut in Government Investment in Surplus Commodities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought-reduced crops and higher market prices
have helped cut sharply the government's investment in surplus farm
commodities, an Agriculture Department report showed Monday.
   The department's Commodity Credit Corp. had $13.5 billion
invested in price support loans and actual inventories as of May 31.
That included $9.1 billion in loans outstanding, and $4.4 billion in
government-owned commodities, said the report by Keith Bjerke, the
CCC's executive vice president.
   A year earlier, on May 31, 1988, the CCC had a total investment
of $23.1 billion, including $14.3 billion in loans oustanding and
$8.8 billion in inventories.
   The CCC finances various price support operations of the
department, including those for wheat, feed grains, rice, tobacco,
cotton, soybeans, dairy products, honey and sugar.
   In the case of the major grain crops, the 1988 drought reduced
production and pushed up prices. That reduced the need for price
support loans and forfeitures, which means the CCC takes over
ownership of crops when farmers opt not to repay the loans.
   When market prices are high enough, it's usual for farmers to pay
off the loans and use or sell as they choose.
   The farmer-owned grain reserve, which enables wheat and feed
grains to be stored and kept off the market under government loan
until prices rise enough to trigger their release, consisted of 287
million bushels of wheat valued at more than $1 billion as of May
31, the report said.
   Corn and other feed grains in the reserve totaled more than 1.03
billion bushels valued at $2.57 billion.
   The total value of commodities acquired by CCC in the first eight
months of the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 was $1.72 billion,
the report said. In the same period of 1987-88, CCC acquired
products valued at $9.62 billion.
   Net losses to CCC totaled about $3.52 billion through May 31, the
report said, compared with a loss of more than $10 billion in the
same eight months of 1987-88. The decline was mainly due to the
smaller volume of grain moving into CCC inventories, and reduced
payments to farmers.

<HEAD>Tributes Abound to Herbert von Karajan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Berlin Philharmonic on Monday
mourned the death of Herbert von Karajan, its former ``conductor for
life,'' and the Salzburg Festival, where he was to perform this
month, held a minute of silence.
   Tributes abounded for the Austrian-born maestro who died Sunday
of heart failure at age 81.
   The Berlin Philharmonic, which he quit in April after a stormy
relationship for three decades, said Karajan had ``stamped his
orchestra with his own inimitable style.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a telegram to Karajan's
widow, praising the maestro for his more than 30 years with the
Berlin Philharmonic.
   Kohl said Karajan helped continue Berlin's reputation as ``one of
the (world's) leading cultural metropolises. We thank him for that.''
   In Austria, Salzburg Festival president Albert Moser called for a
minute of silence for Karajan during rehearsals and gave a brief
speech, a spokeswoman said.
   Karajan was to have opened this year's festival July 27 with
Giuseppe Verdi's Opera ``A Masked Ball,'' with Placido Domingo.
   In a statement, the festival directorate said it mourned Karajan,
who made ``a substantial mark'' on the festival, and it had not yet
determined who will replace him.
   Festival organizers confirmed reports that Karajan died of heart
failure at his home in Anif, outside Salzburg, said the spokeswoman
who commented on condition of anonymity.
   No funeral plans were announced. The Austria Press Agency
reported it would take place in Anif exclusively for family members
but no date was given. Salzburg Festival organizers said they could
not yet confirm the report.
   British opera director John Schlesinger, who had been preparing
the Verdi performance with Karajan, said the show will go on but
Karajan will be sorely missed.
   ``The death of maestro von Karajan is a terrible blow for all of
us. We had been working together on `Un Ballo in Maschera' for more
than a year with great enthusiasm and close collaboration,''
Schlesinger said from Salzburg.
   Karajan, who conducted at the Salzburg Festival since 1948, was
its sole artistic director in 1956-60 and had been on the
directorate since 1964. Last year he resigned from the body but
continued to conduct during this year's festival.
   Riccardo Muti, musical director of La Scala in Milan, told Rome's
Il Messaggero newspaper in Ravenna:
   ``We have lost the most important conductor of our time, the last
great maestro of the Romantic era. Karajan did not leave heirs, but
in reality we are all his heirs, some more, some less,'' Muti said.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt said Karajan was ``perhaps one
of the last great aesthetes of the music scene _ a man with
heightened sensitivity for a tone with color, for a seamless
transition, for music that seems as if it comes from the heavens.''
   The widow of Wilhelm Furtwaengler, who Karajan succeeded as head
of the Berlin Philharmonic, said Karajan's death marks ``the end of
an epoch'' in concert halls.
   ``He was especially brilliant in conducting Anton Bruckner and
Richard Strauss I have never heard such a brilliant ``Don Quijote''
than when he conducted it two years ago in Berlin,'' said Elisabeth
Furtwaengler.
   But Karajan's wealth, love for publicity and what some viewed as
vanity have also irritated many critics.
   The London Times said of Karajan on Monday: ``He was the greatest
orchestral trainer of our century, and maybe of all time. He was an
egomaniac, a bully and a ruthless opportunist. ... He received far
more adulation, sold far more records, made far more money than any
other classical musician.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, nearing the end of a
diplomatic pilgrimage across Europe, declared Monday that Western
resolve and the dramatic changes in the Soviet bloc have made
possible ``a new world'' free of discord between East and West.
   The Soviets are ``moving in our direction, coming our way,''
declared Bush in a speech delivered in this historic city from which
the Pilgrims embarked on their voyage to the New World.
   Bush delivered the address in a centuries' old church here after
flying to Amsterdam from Paris and the weekend economic summit with
the seven richest nations of the West. The president was homeward
bound Tuesday after his 10-day, four-nation trek across Europe.
   He said his journey through Poland and Hungary demonstrated anew
that ``even in the Europe behind the Wall, the dream of freedom for
all Europe has never died.''
   Bush said the surprise letter that Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev sent the summit nations seeking to link his faltering
economy with the West was ``only the latest example of the Soviets
moving in our direction, coming our way.''
   The Soviet Union has ``nothing to fear from the reforms that are
now unfolding'' in Eastern Europe, said Bush.
   ``I want to see the Soviet Union chart a course that brings
itself into the community of nations,'' said Bush, speaking in the
Pieterskerk where the spiritual leader of the Pilgrims, John
Robinson, is buried.
   Bush said the dream of freedom is ``alive today in Warsaw, in
Gdansk, in Budapest and yes, across the Soviet Union.''
   ``The challenge we face is a very clear one. We must work
together toward the day when all of Europe, East and West, is free
of discord, free of division,'' he said.
   Bush also had tea with Queen Beatrix and conferred with Dutch
leaders at The Hague, the seat of government.
   Thousands of cheering Dutch people lined his motorcade route,
interspersed with demonstrators decrying U.S. policy in Latin
America and carrying signs demanding that abortions be kept legal.
   Stepping from his limousine, and waving to the crowd, Bush was
escorted by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers into Pieterskerk, which
dates to the 12th century.
   The president toured an exhibit of Pilgrim artifacts and received
a partial family tree tracing his own lineage to at least two of the
religious dissidents who lived here in the early 1600s after fleeing
persecution in England.
   Today, he said, as in 1620 ``when the Pilgrims left this city, a
new world lies within our reach.''
   ``The new world we seek is shaped by an idea _ an idea of
universal appeal and undeniable force. And that idea is democracy,''
he said.
   Bush claimed the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization had ``kept us safe'' while also creating opportunities
for change in the East-West division.
   ``Thanks to NATO's strength an unity, we now have the opportunity
to move beyond containment, to integrate the Soviet Union into the
community of nations,'' Bush said, outlining his hopes for deep cuts
in arms levels across the continent.
   ``Our hope is that the unnatural division of Europe will now come
to an end, that the Europe behind the wall will join its neighbors
to the West, prosperous and free,'' Bush said on the first official
visit to the Netherlands by an American president.
   Bush recalled that Winston Churchill, in a postwar speech in the
same church, had welcomed the triumph of freedom over tyranny with
the words, ``The great wheel has swung full circle.''
   Half of Europe emerged from the war ``and laid the foundations of
free government and free enterprise that brought unparalleled
prosperity and a life in peace and freedom,'' said Bush.
   ``The `other Europe' _ the Europe behind the wall _ endured four
decades of privation and hardship, persecution and fear.''
   But now, he said, ``The great wheel is moving once more.''
   In Poland and Hungary Bush said he heard ``new voices full of new
hope. Theirs were the faces of pilgrims on a journey, fixed on the
horizon, on the new world coming into view.
   ``And they know, as we do, that ultimately, whatever the odds,
freedom will succeed,'' he said.
   Leiden was also home to the painter Rembrandt and Grotius, the
father of international law.
   Bush called it ``a special city'' for Americans, and a place
``whose very name has symbolized for centuries Dutch determination
in the struggle for freedom against the forces of occupation.''
   He said the United States and the Netherlands were ``partners in
an alliance of free nations that spans the ocean that the Pilgrims
crossed.''
   The visit was a boost for beleaguered Dutch prime minister
Lubbers, whose right-center coalition government collapsed in May
over environmental issues and is facing elections Sept. 6.
   The lavish praise for the Dutch came against the backdrop of the
small country's stalwart support of U.S. and NATO defense strategy.
The Netherlands overcame disarmament impulses to agree to accept
nuclear-tipped U.S. missiles in 1985.
   As it turned out, the missiles were never put in place. The
intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed by former
President Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987 eliminated the need for them.

<HEAD>`Safe-to-Eat' Coating Could Extend Shelf Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are working on a safe-to-eat, nearly
invisible coating made from milk that could extend the shelf life of
fruit and vegetables, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Attila E. Pavlath, a chemist with the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said tests are concentrating on a film based on
casein, a milk protein. A small amount of vitamin C is added to help
protect against browning.
   Pavlath, who works at the agency's research laboratory in Albany,
Calif., said in a report released here that small pieces of sliced
and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for several
days. Unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a few
hours.
   The scientists want to make the film thinner, a process that
might take two more years, Pavlath said.
   Films that ``the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot
detect'' also could be made from protein in soybeans, corn and
wheat, the report said.
   ``Some people who like fresh produce don't necessarily want to
spend time in their kitchen washing, slicing, peeling, pitting and
paring,'' Pavlath said. ``It's part of the trend toward buying food
that is ready to use and easy to store.''
   A successful coating would allow more types of produce to be
pre-sliced and packaged. Such coatings may have other potential
uses, perhaps for keeping fillings in pizzas or preventing pies from
soaking the crust.
   Unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the
``skin'' on sausages, new films could be modified to add flavors or
colors to standard fare, Pavlath said.
   One possibility, he said, would be fresh sliced pears protected
with a somewhat thicker protein coating flavored with red cherries.

<HEAD>People Remember Different Things About 1988 Democratic Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Different people remember different things about
the Democratic National Convention that opened a year ago Tuesday,
but everyone at least seems to remember that it happened in Atlanta.
   That makes officials of the Georgia capital happy as they try to
sell their city as the site for the 1994 Super Bowl and the 1996
Summer Olympics.
   There aren't many physical reminders left of the four-day
convention that nominated Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as the
party's presidential standard-bearer: Colorful banners on light
poles and some nicely paved sidewalks in the convention district.
   But some remember the convention and Dukakis' speech as the high
point of the Democratic campaign.
   ``There are very few things I have been involved in that have run
so smoothly or so triumphantly,'' said Mayor Andrew Young, who
chaired Atlanta '88, the non-profit group that organized the
convention. ``If we could have kept running the campaign, we might
be running the White House.''
   Atlanta '88 President Bobby Kahn remembers Dukakis' triumphant
entry into The Omni arena on the final night to the tune of Neil
Diamond's ``Coming To America.'' But even better, he recalls: ``We
got out of the Omni on time.''
   That saved labor and insurance costs and helped bring the event
in $500,000 under budget. Atlanta '88 spent $14.5 million, most of
it from a special hotel-motel tax.
   Other memories are less pleasant and more immediate.
   The the court system is still dealing with some of the 1,200
misdemeanor cases filed against anti-abortion protesters who came to
capture a share of the convention's limelight.
   Last week, Randall Terry, head of the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue, returned to Atlanta on a book promotion tour and
was arrested on warrants stemming from the protests. Terry's
attorney said he thought the warrants had been vacated. The activist
was freed on bail.
   Also before the courts is a lawsuit against actor Rob Lowe
stemming from an incident turing the round-the-clock partying that
occupied some of the 4,210 delegates, 13,500-odd journalists and
thousands of other hangers-on convention week.
   Lowe is accused of seducing a teen-age Atlanta girl and then
persuading her to have sex with another woman while he taped it with
his home video camera. Fulton County prosecutors are considering
criminal charges against Lowe, who denies wrongdoing.
   Bad publicity has been turned to good advantage in one case.
   The uproar over the small size of the Omni _ hundreds of
delegates and reporters were locked out one night when fire marshals
declared the place overcrowded _ added impetus to efforts to build
the Georgia Dome.
   The dome, an enclosed stadium designed to hold 72,000 people, is
to be located next door to The Omni and the World Congress Center.
An Atlanta architect was chosen last week to build it.
   Construction of the dome is considered essential to the city's
bids for the 1994 Super Bowl and the 1996 Summer Olympics.
   The convention put Atlanta on the map again for many people, said
Chamber of Commerce official Barry King, who's been lobbying the
International Olympic Committee for the games.
   ``It proved to the world we could do it, that Atlanta was a
capable city, a modern town and not a burned-out cinder from 125
years ago,'' King said, referring to Civil War images.

<HEAD>National Teaching Certificate to be Offered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers will be rigorously tested on their
specialty, teaching techniques and knowledge of child development
under a voluntary national certification system outlined Monday by
an independent panel.
   With its new national credential, to be offered in 29 fields
starting in 1993, the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards says it hopes to dispel the myth that ``any modestly
educated person with some instinct for nurturing has the requisite
qualifications to teach.''
   The private group said it hopes that the system will also lead to
improved teacher training and, ultimately, to better-educated
children.
   ``This process will push the renewal of American education a big
step closer to reality,'' former North Carolina Gov. James Hunt,
chairman of the 63-member board, said Monday in releasing the
guidelines.
   The nation's 2.5 million teachers will need a bachelor of arts
degree and at least three years of experience to apply for
certification, according to the new blueprint.
   Board president James A. Kelly said professions such as medicine
and law took decades to set standards for practitioners. He said the
teacher standards board, formed in 1987, will compress the process
into five years ``because we want to influence the quality of the
enormous influx of new teachers needed during the 1990s.''
   The new credential is expected to help draw more and better
people into teaching and help teachers move into new roles as
mentors, curriculum specialists and other positions requiring
expertise or extra responsibility.
   Certified teachers may also command better salaries, but Kelly
said local authorities will have to determine that. ``The board has
always said we want our certificates to be recognized,'' he said in
an interview. ``But it's not the board's business to say how each
school district and private school should recognize certified
teachers.''
   The national board was proposed three years ago by the Carnegie
Forum on Education and the Economy in a report called ``A Nation
Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century.'' Many were skeptical that
its mix of teachers, government officials, business leaders and
higher education representatives could succeed at what they said was
a highly controversial task with uncertain potential to improve
education.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers
and a longtime backer of national teacher certification, said the
criteria laid out Monday prove the skeptics wrong.
   ``They said it couldn't be done but we did it,'' Shanker said.
``We can be proud that we have come so far.''
   Mary Futrell, president of the National Education Association,
called the guidelines ``an important step down the long road toward
developing a national teaching certificate that can be supported and
embraced by all teachers.''
   The two teacher unions each have seven seats on the board and
have been active in developing the certification process.
   The board said the 29 fields for which it plans to issue
certificates include music, art, foreign languages, physical
education, special education, vocational fields, and subject areas
such as math, science, social studies and English for different age
groups.
   Still to be completed is an evaluation system that is
``professionally credible, publicly acceptable, legally defensible,
administratively feasible and economically affordable for the
teacher candidates,'' Hunt said. ``These assessments will be
state-of-the-art and go far beyond the pencil and paper assessments
used for state licensing today.''
   Among the potential assessment methods described Monday were
multiple choice tests, essays, interviews, simulated lesson plans,
simulated parent conferences, documentation of performance and
observation by trained examiners in the workplace. There will be no
limit on the number or percentage of teachers certified.
   A typical evaluation could involve asking a music teacher to
bring a videotape of an orchestra rehearsal or asking a teacher to
come to an assessment center to discuss and defend alternative
instructional methods, Kelly said.

   Thirty FBI agents having breakfast
before a softball tournament watched local police arrest a man the
agency had been seeking.
   Policeman J. Beachler said the agents watched from windows of
Cockerell's Restaurant as police arrested John R. Howard, 27, on a
charge of fleeing Pinellas County, Fla. The FBI said the suspect's
real name is Earn Howard.
   Police in this Columbus suburb said Howard is wanted in Florida
on child abuse and sexual assault charges involving a 13-year-old
girl. He was being held in the Franklin County Jail.
   Beachler said the FBI tracked Howard to the area. He was working
as a roofer.
   ``He was contacted by a local FBI agent posing as a builder, and
a meeting was arranged at the restaurant,'' Beachler said.
   ``It was purely accidental that the guys were in there for the
softball tournament,'' said Douglass Ogden, FBI senior agent in the
Columbus office.
   Westerville was host Saturday to the annual FBI Law Enforcement
Softball Tournament.
   FBI agent Doug Ogden said Monday that the Columbus FBI won the
unofficial softball tourney, but but he wouldn't say how many teams
played or how teams were elimated.

   Frank ``Junior'' Coughlan gave a damn
a little too early in ``Gone With The Wind,'' and so he landed on
the cutting room floor.
   Coughlan, now 73, played a soldier who had one line in the 1939

   ``They cut me out because I said `damn' an hour and a half before
Clark Gable did,'' said Coughlan, of Los Alamitos. ``Back then, that

   Coughlan was among 600 people who spent Sunday afternoon at
Culver City Studios to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the film
adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's ``Story of the Old South.''
   The Culver City Historical Society used the motion picture's
golden anniversary as an opportunity to raise funds for a museum of
movie memorabilia and to help put Culver City on the movie-making
map.
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said all of its productions came out of
``Hollywood'' until the 1970s when it confessed to residing in
Culver City.

   French authorities arrested an unspecified number of
suspected terrorists in connection with the just-completed economic
summit and bicentennial celebrations, the interior minister said
Monday.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse and state-owned
television reported that three of those arrested belonged to the
Irish Republican Army.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, however, gave no information about
how many people were involved or where and when they were picked up.
   Joxe said the suspected terrorists were arrested during the
intense pre-summit security sweep carried out throughout France.
   More than 30,000 additional police and troops were brought into
Paris to ensure security and control crowds for last weekend's
events.
   Prime Minister Michel Rocard congratulated Joxe for what he
called the ``perfect success'' of the work of police and security
forces during the weekend.
   State-owned television Antenne 2 said the three IRA members were
arrested in Ste. Menehould in eastern France on the basis of
information provided by the British authorities.
   It said they came to the attention of the French security
services during preparations for the summit of the seven richest
democracies and for celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the
French Revolution.
   Under French law, the police and the interior minister, who has
responsibility for police affairs, are not required to give names or
other details of arrested persons.
   ``France has made progress in the field of terrorism,'' Joxe
declared. ``Thanks to the reinforced surveillance, which worked
well, the national police was able to make certain arrests.''
   He refused to give any further information. According to the
television report, the IRA members were in possession of false
identity papers and detonators when they were picked up on July 14.
   They were assembled in what was described as ``a rear base'' for
strikes against British army installations in West Germany, and were
not explicitly planning any action to disrupt the summit or the
anniversary celebration, the television said.
   Joxe said his services had received no indication of an
``individual threat'' concerning any of the 34 chiefs of state or
government who were in Paris over the weekend.
   Most of the visiting leaders had left Paris by midday Monday.

<HEAD>American Firm Signs Deal to Lease Land in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese firm Monday granted an American camera
company the right to lease 60 million square feet to third parties
for 25 years.
   The Concord Camera Corp. signed the agreement in Hong Kong with
the Wan Kong Economic Development Corp. of Baoan County.
   Under the unusual agreement, Concord, based in Rahway, N.J., will
sub-lease manufacturing space and supply labor to corporations which
want to set up operations in China.
   Jack Benun, chairman of Concord, declined to say how much the
deal was worth. He also said his company had yet to determine how
much it would charge for space in the planned industrial park, to be
used mostly for light industry.
   The deal appears to be an attempt on China's part to regain the
confidence of Western investors following the bloody June 3-4
crackdown on a movement for freedom.
   Over the weekend, the official China News Service quoted a
Chinese official from Hainan province as saying China wanted to go
ahead with another project that also allows a foreign firm to lease
space to foreign investors. An official at the Hong Kong office of
that firm, Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction giant, said
Monday the firm had no comment on the Chinese report about the
Yongpu Port.
   In recent weeks, Hong Kong newspapers have said conservative
Chinese officials, whose have gained power as a result of the
crackdown, had criticized projects such as these. The officials were
quoted as saying the projects were tantamount to selling China's
sovereignty to foreigners.
   To increase confidence of potential investors, Benun said,
Concord was planning on incorporating an insurance company to
guarantee all assets in the area. He said his firm had yet to work
out the details.
   Benun said his Chinese partner would approve any investor as long
as they met the environmental guidelines of Baoan County.
   He said he secured the deal during a visit of top officials from
Baoan County to New Jersey several weeks ago. The basis of the deal,
he said, was Concord's six-year relationship with the county.
   Concord began producing cameras in Baoan in 1983 and has gone
from occupying 10,000 square feet of space to its current production
facilities of 240,000 square feet. It employs 2,000 Chinese.
   Benun said Concord makes about 4 million cameras a year, 55
percent of which are sold in the United States and 45 percent of
which are sold in Europe and Asia.
   Benun said he did not believe the recent turmoil in China would
affect his investment.
   ``It's our belief that with six years under our belt and with the
local authorities having always delivered what they promised there
should be no reason why anything should change,'' Benun said.
   He said the area _ fields and mountains located about 15{ miles
from Hong Kong _ would be ideal for Hong Kong investors.
   ``I've seen it and it's as far as the eye can see,'' he said.
``It's equal to 1,333 football fields.''
   He estimated an initial investment at about $600 million, but he
said his company was not obligated to put up the full amount.
   Concord had $18 million in sales in 1988 and cleared a profit of
2.3 million, Benun said.

<HEAD>Israel Fears Missiles in Lebanon Could Trigger Arms Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of Israel's air force said
Monday that Israel was concerned about the reported introduction of
surface-to-surface missiles in Lebanon, saying it could trigger a
dangerous new arms race.
   Lebanese military sources in April reported Iraq gave six Frog-7
missiles to Christian forces as a deterrent against Syria, which has
been bombarding Beirut with as many as 400 shells daily.
   The Soviet-designed missiles can carry a warhead of 1,200 pounds
for more than 40 miles, enough to reach Damascus from Beirut.
   Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said he was unable to confirm that Frog
missiles were in the hands of Christian militias. But he said even
if they were, Israel would not intervene at this stage.
   ``We have so many problems around our own borders let us not
intervene in such a mess over there, as well,'' he said.
   However, the air force commander said there was concern that if
the Christians got such a weapons system other militias would
acquire them as well, ultimately posing a threat to Israel that
could prompt pre-emptive action.
   ``We are worried about Frog missiles in Lebanon because we are
worried about the arms race that will start up there,'' he told
reporters at Israel Air Force headquarters in Tel Aviv.
   ``We are not worried about the Christians launching them against
us. We are worried that if the Christians have them then the Shiites
would like to have them and the PLO would like to have them. Then
we'll have some that might be pointed against us.''
   Such an arms race, he said, could lead to ``a point where we will
have to intervene if they get into the hands of those who might
launch them against us.''
   Bin-Nun noted Syria had mounted a naval blockade of Christian
harbors in Lebanon to prevent missiles being shipped from Iraq,
which is an arch rival of Syria.
   There has been no official comment, but Israeli commentators have
expressed growing concern that an Israel-Syria naval or air clash
could occur in Lebanon even though the two countries have a shared
interest in keeping Iraqi missiles out of Beirut.
   Saying a clash could result if the Israeli navy's freedom of
action was restricted, the Maariv newspaper said in an editorial
last week ``this is a dangerous and sensitive political and military
situation that compells the Israeli government to take a stand, and
perhaps action.''
   Bin-Nun, 48, an ex-fighter pilot who fought in the 1967 and 1973
Middle East wars, defended Israeli air raids in Lebanon which often
result in civilian casualties.
   ``If we had not hit (PLO bases) then we would have them much more
often on our northern border,'' Bin-Nun said.
   He said the air force never operated on the basis of a single
intelligence source in selecting a target and that several agencies
had to approve each strike. Also, he added, a final OK was obtained
``from the highest possible level'' _ presumably the prime minister
or defense minister.
   In addition, pilots risked their lives and aircraft by flying low
and limited the number of bombs they dropped so that the possibilty
of hitting civilians would be lessened.
   ``I believe that no air force that I know in the world would have
taken so many precautions against hitting civilians,'' he said.
   ``We are really very sorry about every one who is being injured
or who dies in any attack who is innocent. But they (guerrillas) use
the civilians to hide behind, and we cannot stop fighting them
because of that,'' Bin-Nun said.
   In eight air raids this year, most against PLO targets, Israeli
forces killed eight people and wounded 67, according to reports from
Lebanon. In 1988, 128 people died and 356 were wounded in 25 air
raids. Some victims were civilians but no breakdown was available.

<HEAD>Radio Soleil Back On Air With Regular Broadcasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's most popular radio station
went back on the air Monday, resuming regular broadcasts that were
interrupted for three weeks by strikers who alleged a shift in the
station's political orientation.
   The director of the Roman Catholic station Radio Soleil, the Rev.
Arnaux Chery, hired a new staff to replace employees who were fired
or went on strike June 26.
   ``It makes me laugh when people say Radio Soleil is all
through,'' Chery told listeners Monday morning.
   Regular live broadcasts of religious and news programs had been
replaced by music and pre-recorded programs since the strike began.
Strikers had protested the firing of the program director and an
alleged conservative shift in orientation.
   The station has encouraged the poor to fight social injustice,
and it played a crucial role in the downfall of the Duvalier
dictatorship in 1986.
   But since April, Haiti's conservative Conference of Catholic
Bishops began firing station employees, including some of the most
popular reporters. It appointed Chery as station director in an
apparent move to check the influence of radical priests and
employees.
   In several declarations, the bishops accused the fired staffers
of insubordination and reaffirmed the goal of Radio Soleil to
evangelize through ``education, information, and entertainment.''
   The Haitian Press Club on July 5 protested the firing of news
editor Venel Ramarais and said the moves were ``part of a general
plan to destabilize the Haitian press.''
   During the last months of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's rule,
Radio Soleil was the only station broadcasting news. Duvalier fled
to exile in France in February 1986.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi blamed Sri
Lanka's president Monday for the stalemate on the withdrawal of
Indian troops from the island nation.
   Gandhi said President Ranasinghe Premadasa has not responded to
an Indian proposal for discussions on drawing up a timetable for the
departure of an estimated 40,000 troops.
   The troops were sent sent to disarm Tamil guerrillas under a 1987
peace plan designed to give the minority group limited autonomy.
   ``He has refused to talk,'' Gandhi said upon his return from a
six-day visit to Pakistan, the Soviet Union and France.
   An Indian government spokesman said that in Sri Lanka over the
weekend, Tamil guerrillas killed seven Indian soldiers and two other
clashes left three guerrillas and 10 civilians dead.
   Such clashes previously were routinely reported in Sri Lanka, but
Premadasa's government imposed censorship July 6, citing security
concerns that coincided with a growing estrangement with India.
   Premadasa has demanded that the Indian soldiers in his country
withdraw by July 29, the second anniversary of a peace pact that
dispatched the force.
   Gandhi has said such a quick withdrawal could spawn even more
violence in Sri Lanka. At least 9,000 people, including nearly 1,000
Indian soldiers, have been killed in the Tamil separatist war that
started in 1983 with attacks on the Sinhalese-dominated government
and Sinhalese civilians.
   The Indian troops were invited to Sri Lanka by Premadasa's
predecessor, President Junius R. Jayewardene, who signed the 1987
peace accord.
   Premadasa, who took office in January, opened talks this summer
with the most powerful Tamil guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eeelam. He subsequently called for a speedy Indian
withdrawal.
   Premadasa is Sinhalese, like 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent, say they face Sinhalese
discrimination in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.

   Syrian gunboats seized a ship carrying
vegetables to the blockaded Christian enclave Monday and escorted it
to the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli in north Lebanon, a
military spokesman said.
   Syrian and Christian gunners dueled with tank and howitzer fire
in and around the capital, and Israeli-allied militiamen shelled
Palestinian guerrilla positions in south Lebanon.
   A spokesman for Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun said
the Syrian gunboat intercepted the vessel 15 miles off the Christian
port of Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut. Tripoli lies 50 miles
north of the capital.
   The spokesman identified the seized ship only as the Peter-M. He
said he had no information on its nationality, owners or tonnage.
   The Syrian navy previously stopped several cargo vessels headed
for the beleaguered enclave, apparently to search them for arms. The
ships were all allowed to continue on course, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   Artillery explosions jolted both sides of divided Beirut as the
Syrian army and Aoun's mainly Christian troops continued a
confrontation that dragged on with no solution in sight.
   Thousands of civilians huddled in basements and underground
shelters as howitzer, mortar and tank fire showered the city. Syrian
gunners enforced a blockade of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave, home to 1 million people, and Christian forces fired back.
   Police reported one person killed and 15 wounded, raising the
overall toll to 419 killed and 1,688 wounded since the shelling
began March 8.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein blamed Syria for
failing to end the 14-year-old civil war, which has killed more than
150,000 people. Syria backs the rival Moslem Cabinet of Salim Hoss
that has existed since Aoun became head of a Christian Cabinet last
September.
   ``It is crystal clear that the Syrian regime is the main party
responsible for the destruction of Lebanon and the dispersion of its
people,'' he said in a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the
Baath socialist party's rise to power in Iraq. Syria is ruled by a
rival faction of the party.
   He reiterated his support for Aoun in the current fighting,
saying ``Iraq remains committed to saving Lebanon from this (Syrian)
tyranny and oppression.''
   The Syrians have demanded a ban on Iraqi arms shipments to Aoun's
army and the removal of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles they claim
Aoun has acquired from Iraq. With their range of nearly 45 miles
they are capable of hitting the Syrian capital, Damascus.
   Police said gunners of the South Lebanon Army militia shelled
newly established Palestinian positions in the hills of Baslaya, six
miles east of Sidon port. No casualties were reported.
   Maj. Gen Antoine Lahd, commander of the 2,500-strong militia,
said on the Voice of the South radio that he would shell Sidon's
refugee camps of Meih Meih and Ein el-Helweh if guerrillas do not
withdraw from the Baslaya area. No deadline was set.
   The Syrians have maintained the siege on the Christian sector
despite repeated calls by the Arab League for a cease-fire and an
end to the blockades.
   The siege started one week after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run
by Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of Beirut to recoup $100
million in customs dues lost annually.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, a staunch Syrian ally, retaliated
by shelling the Christian enclave. Syrian troops later joined the
bombardment, sealed off the enclave's land exits and blockaded its
sea outlets with artillery fire.
   Syria keeps 40,000 soliders in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League. The Christians, with 20,000 troops,
say the Syrians betrayed their mandate by siding with the Moslems in
the civil war and should leave.

<HEAD>Cuba's `National Poet' Dead At Age 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cubans on Monday filed past the body of
Nicolas Guillen, the country's national poet, as a two-day mourning
period began, according to Cuba's official news agency.
   Guillen, one of Latin America's best-known writers and the man
who introduced African and Latin musical rhythms into verse, died
Sunday after a long illness that resulted in the amputation last
month of his left leg, according to Prensa Latina. He was 87.
   The agency said he had also suffered from advanced
arteriosclerosis and Parkinson's disease.
   Guillen's body lay in state in Havana's Plaza of the Revolution
at the foot of a monument honoring Jose Marti, a famous Cuban poet
of the 19th century. A public funeral was scheduled for Tuesday.
   Guillen's work celebrated Cuba's multiracial and ethnic mix as
well as the 1959 communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to
power. For more than 25 years he was director of Cuba's Union of
Writers and Artists and, at the time of his death, honorary
president.
   Prensa Latina said word of his death sent a ``shock wave''
through Cuba's people, many of whom know his verses by heart.
   In the prologue to a book of what he called ``mulatto'' poetry,
Guillen said: ``In these verses perhaps enter the same elements that
enter into the ethnic composition of Cuba, where we all are
mestizos. ... One day they will say: Cuban color. These poems
anticipate this day.''
   The passage was quoted by Prensa Latina in a dispatch monitored
in Mexico.
   Born in the city of Camaguey on July 10, 1902, Guillen studied
law in the eastern city and covered the Spanish civil war as a
magazine reporter. Later, he ran unsuccessfully for mayoral and
senate offices, first as a Popular Socialist.
   His first trip abroad, in 1937, was to Mexico, where he
participated in a conference sponsored by the Mexican Revolutionary
Writers and Artists League.
   From 1945 to 1948 he traveled in South America. Recollections of
the trip were included in works published in Buenos Aires and later.
   When Guillen tried to return from a trip to Chile in 1953,
dictator Fulgencio Batista refused to let him into the country and
he began a five-year exile.
   Among his best-known works are ``Themes of the Son,'' a reference
to the Cuban dance, the son, published in 1930, and ``The Dove of
the Popular Flight'' in 1958, which includes his elegies and is
considered a high point in Spanish poetry.

   A 7,500-acre cotton farm once owned by movie star
John Wayne has been selected as the site for a $160 million military
museum and research complex, officials announced Monday.
   The complex will be on John Wayne's Red River Ranch, one of six
sites in Arizona that had competed for the project, said John R.
Radell, chairman of the Institute for the Study of American Wars.
   ``We chose the Casa Grande site because its central location
makes it easily accessible to residents and tourists from metro
Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego and Los Angeles,'' Radell said. ``In
addition, the direct transfer of 300 acres of land provides an
immediate financial beneift.''
   The land, worth $1 million to $2 million, is being donated by the
owners of the ranch, a partnership of Circle K chairman and chief
executive Karl Eller and developers William S. Lund and Timothy R.
Olson.
   Wayne, who died in 1979, had a ``direct, personal involvement''
in the operation of the ranch for about 20 years, Olson said. ``I'm
sure he would be very pleased about the plans to construct this
facility on the property.''
   No member of Wayne's family is involved in the ownership of the
land or the meseum project, he said.
   The first phase of the project, which will concentrate on the
Vietnam and Korean wars, will be completed in five years and is
expected to cost $70 million, Radell said.
   The overall project, which is to cover all American wars, will be
finished in about 20 years and will cost at least $160 million, he
said. So far, the group has raised only $60,000.

   The roof of a potato storage cellar
collapsed Monday, killing one man and injuring six others, police
said.
   A crew had been working to put in footing for supports for the
roof, composed of wooden beams covered with wire, plastic and bales
of straw, Police Chief Bob Jatczak said.
   Three workers, including the one who died, were trapped, he said.
   A group of workers used their hands to dig through the debris,
said Chris Toedtle, a mechanic at the Western Potato Storage Plant
who went to the scene.
   Toedtle estimated it took 10 minutes to find one trapped man and
perhaps 15 minutes longer to dig to where he was.
   Jatczak identified the dead man as William Burgess, 42, of
Alliance. He said Burgess was asyphixiated.
   The cellar was 300 feet long and nine feet from floor to the
ceiling, Jatczak said. Authorities do not know whether there was a
problem with the roof before the collapse, he said.

   Ronald Peters, identified by federal
authorities as a bookmaker who handled bets for Cincinnati Reds
manager Pete Rose, on Monday began serving a two-year federal prison
sentence on drug and tax charges.
   Peters entered the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.
   He said he was told he could whittle three months a year off his
sentence for good behavior. He also hopes to transfer to a halfway
house after a year.
   Peters, 32, former owner of a restaurant and tanning salon in
this southwestern Ohio town, pleaded guilty to federal charges of
cocaine distribution and making false statements on his 1985 income
tax return. Federal authorities said Peters failed to report about
$80,000 in income from bookmaking.
   Major League baseball executives are investigating Rose's
gambling, and a federal grand jury in Cincinnati is investigating
whether he reported all taxable income. Rose denies any wrongdoing.
   ``Seeing your face in the paper every day and on the news _ I'm
sure it's going to be a while before my face gets in the paper again
_ just to get away from all that for a while will be nice,'' Peters
said Monday before he left for prison.
   He said he will live in a dormitory at the prison, which has
tennis courts, a putting green and educational courses. Peters is a
former golf teaching professional.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel of Cincinnati sentenced
Peters on June 16. He could have been sentenced to 23 years in
prison. Federal prosecutors requested a reduced sentence because
Peters cooperated with government investigators examining Rose's tax
payments.
   Peters told investigators he took bets on behalf of Rose that
exceeded $1 million over two years, assistant U.S. attorney Robert
Brichler has said.

<HEAD>Girl Who Lost Hand to Bomb Gets Artificial One in Time for Birthday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 5-year-old girl who lost her left hand
when a bomb exploded at a K mart store is learning to make necklaces
and hair bows with an artificial hand, her mother says.
   The high-tech prosthetic hand came as an early birthday present
for Erin Bower, who turns 6 on Tuesday.
   Erin received the electrically powered hand at Medical Center
Prosthetics in Houston last week and is participating in a
three-week training program to help her use it.
   ``I don't think she'll ever forget this birthday. It's because of
her hand. She loves her hand,'' Erin's mother, Maureen, said in a
telephone interview with The Indianapolis Star.
   Mrs. Bower planned a birthday celebration for Erin, who was
injured April 17 when a bomb went off as she picked up a package of
toothpaste at the K mart store in Castleton. The case remains under
investigation.
   Mrs. Bower said that when Erin put on her electrically powered
hand for the first time, she said, ``Mommy, I wish I could have my
other hand back.''
   ``I said, `Erin, I do, too,''' Mrs. Bower recalled. ``She said,
`It's too bad we just can't grow one.' I told her, `I wish we could,
but we can't.' Then Erin said, `Well, this arm isn't bad, I like
this arm, too.'
   Erin undergoes two hours of therapy a day to learn how to use the
hand, which is activated by nerve impulses in Erin's left arm. The
electrical current released by those muscles is picked up by
electrodes in the artificial hand, causing it to move as Erin
desires.
   Mrs. Bower said the therapy has been fun for her daughter. ``They
know she loves arts-and-crafty kind of things. She's made bead
necklaces. She's made hair bows, so she'll learn to tie. She's
played cards. They have a bow and arrow with a plunger at the end,
and she's learned to do that.''
   Mrs. Bower has been told it will be at least six months before
Erin starts using her artificial hand with the same confidence and
reflexes as the old one.
   She said the training program has also helped her daughter
mentally because she sees other children who have lost limbs.
   ``It helps Erin to put her own problems in perspective. And me,
too,'' said Mrs. Bower. ``What happened to Erin, we're kind of lucky
she's even here with us.''

<HEAD>Norway Says Soviets Failed to Report Mishap on Nuclear-powered Sub</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway said Monday the Soviet Union failed to
report a mishap on a nuclear-powered submarine and that its late
account did not respond to Norway's concern about radiation.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov said Norwegian observers
were mistaken in reporting a fire aboard the submarine Sunday in the
Barents Sea east of Norway, according to the Soviet news agency Tass.
   It quoted Yazov as saying there was a short circuit in a battery
cell in the vessel's nuclear power system that forced the sub to
surface and switch to auxiliary power.
   ``Its diesel engines were fired and produced the exhaust,'' Yazov
said. ``There were no accidents or other emergencies.''
   There have been two accidents involving Soviet nuclear-powered
submarines near Norway's coast since April, with one claiming 42
lives, and the Norwegians were angry about the Soviet response in
the third incident.
   ``Whether there was smoke from a fire or from a diesel engine is
really beside the point,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman J. Bjoern
Kanavin. ``Our main concern was ... danger of radiation.
   ``The Soviets have indirectly confirmed that there was a problem
with the reactor, and in that kind of situation we want to be
informed.''
   Norway's NTB news agency said that after the Norwegian observers
reported trouble aboard the Alpha-class submarine Soviet suthorities
told the Foreign Ministry there was no threat of radiation.
Preliminary Norwegian tests showed no signs of contamination.
   Norwegian officials said the submarine on Monday reached a base
of the Soviets' Northern Fleet base on the Kola Pennisula under its
own power.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Arild Isegg said Norway accepted
Yazov's explanation on the origin of the smoke.
   ``It may sound plausible that the smoke came from a diesel motor
starting up. But we wonder why they didn't just tell us that from
the beginning,'' Isegg said.
   The Soviets initially denied there was anything wrong with any of
its submarines.
   Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told reporters Sunday the
Soviet delay in advising Norway of the mishap ``is unacceptable.''
He also used that phrase when the the Soviets did not report a a
fire aboard an Echo II-class sub that was 70 miles off Norway's
coast in the Norwegian Sea. No casualties were reported in that
accident.
   A Soviet MIKE-class submarine caught fire and sank April 7 in the
Norwegian Sea and 42 crewmen perished.
   On Sunday a Norwegian vessel spotted smoke from a Soviet sub and
reported the vessel was 75 miles east of the Norwegian coast in the
Barents Sea and 30 miles north of Soviet territorial waters.
   Defense Ministry officials in Oslo said the smoke could indicate
a fire. Stoltenberg summoned the Soviet ambassador immediately to
show the seriousness with which Norway viewed the incident.
   Kanavin said: ``As a diplomatic question, I don't think this will
be pursued much further in the short term. But in the long term it
stresses the need for mutual warnings.''
   He said Norway is preparing a proposed treaty to present to the
Soviets that would require the two nations to inform each other of
military accidents. The Soviets recently signed such agreements with
the United States, Britain, France and West Germany.
   Kanavin said Norway was justified in its sharp reaction to the
initial Soviet silence.
   ``The submarine came up to the surface, it was being towed and
any observer would have to believe it was involved in an accident,''
he said. ``We had to react quickly ... especially since there have
recently been two extremely serious accidents of which we were not
warned.''

   Religious disturbances in Somalia that left
more than 30 people dead last week were not a coup attempt, the
State Department said Monday.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that latest reports
indicate the capital, Mogadishu, is quiet and that all Americans
appear to be safe after Friday's disturance.
   The Somali government announced that 32 people were killed and 59
were wounded when protesters clashed with government security forces.
   ``Although the disturbances probably had an anti-government
element to them, there was no coup attempt, to our knowledge,''
Boucher said.
   The violence came on the second day of the Moslem celebration of
the Feast of the Sacrifice. President Mohammed Siad Barre, who has
held power since taking over in a military coup in 1969, imposed a
curfew Saturday from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

   A $60 million Star Wars experiment was praised
by its managers Monday as ``a major achievement'' in advancing plans
for a space-based missile shield but they said congressional budget
cuts raise questions about the system's future.
   The experiment, launched over White Sands Missile Range in New
Mexico on Thursday, tested how a neutral particle beam accelerator
would work in space. It was the first time such a beam of atomic
particles was fired into the heavens.
   The test known as BEAR _ or Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ was
considered a primary step in Pentagon's research into the lasers,
beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons which would be
designed to shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the United States
or its allies.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally
called, would make use of particle beams as a potential anti-missile
weapon. A beam would determine whether an object is a decoy or an
enemy warhead, and could be used to disable a missile.
   Last week's experiment involved lifting into space _ just for a
few minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires
rocket. Before the rocket returned to Earth, the accelerator was
turned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how the
particle beams moved.
   At a news conference Monday, the experiment's managers declared
the test a success, displaying a fuzzy black and white video tape of
the bright, pulsing beam as it emerged from the rocket.
   Air Force Col. Thomas Meyer, head of the SDI organization's
office of directed energy, said the experiment showed that the
complex equipment needed to produce the beam could be made in a
compact way, survive being shot into space, and function well.
   ``It is a major achievement, both in technology and
engineering,'' Meyer said.
   He said the experiment ``demonstrates the promise (of SDI) that
we have talked about all along.''
   In the laboratory, the equipment used for ground experiments of
the system would fill an average-size house, while the payload
aboard the rocket was about 24 feet in length and 3{ feet in
diameter.
   The director said the program's designers and scientists also
wanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affected it.
   ``All ... experiment objectives were succesfully achieved,'' he
said.
   Meyer, asked how long it will take before the system could become
a full-fledged weapon in space, indicated that budget cuts are more
of a problem than technical difficulties.
   ``The real issue is, what is the funding for SDI?'' Meyer said.
``It's difficult for me to tell you when we'll have a weapon in
space without a clear definition of what our future funding is. And
it's continuing to be up in the air.''
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said a number of programs ``have yet to go in
terms of proving and particle beams is one.''
   ``I have not seen the briefing; my reaction is skepticism to say
that it's all fixed,'' he added.
   Meyer called the elements of last week's experiment
``on-the-shelf hardware,'' but that some engineering problems still
need to be worked out.
   ``It only takes the money to put it together ... and that's when
we'll get the weapon,'' he said.
   Army Lt. Col. Warren Higgins, a former manager of the BEAR
program also at the briefing, disputed the notion that the tests
were in conflict with the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   Critics of the Star Wars program say the treaty puts severe
limits on testing and deployment of a space-based defense.
   ``We have a non-lethal beam, we had no target,'' Higgins said,
adding that the experiments have been cleared as
``treaty-compliant.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has battled congressional budget
cuts in the space-based anti-missile defense.
   The House Armed Services Committee has approved a $3.5 billion
budget for SDI, compared with the $4.6 billion President Bush
proposed. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced the
administration's request to $4.5 billion.

<HEAD>Region of Soviet Georgia Sealed Off After 14 Killed in Weekend Riots</HEAD>

   Thousands of soldiers patrolled and sealed off the
Abkhazia region of Soviet Georgia, where 14 people were killed and
187 injured in a weekend of ethnic riots, officials reported Monday.
   Also in the Caucasus, daily demonstrations and scattered strikes
over the past three months have turned the ethnically troubled
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan into a tinderbox, the official
Tass news agency reported. It said troops were on patrol.
   Violence in Abkhazia began Saturday night when Abkhazians
surrounded a new university branch to protest its policy of offering
courses only in the Georgian language, said Vadim Bakatin, the
Soviet interior minister, and a spokesman for the Georgian Foreign
Ministry.
   He said the violence stemmed from demands for greater autonomy by
the Abkhazians, who are outnumbered by Georgians 240,000 to 94,000
in their own region.
   In a speech to the Soviet legislature reported by Tass, Bakatin
put the death toll at 13, including 10 killed Saturday night, two
who died later and one killed Sunday.
   An editor at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform, Otar Kapanadze,
said by telephone that another person died of injuries Monday,
raising the toll to 14. No violence was reported Monday.
   Bakatin said 3,000 police and soldiers from his ministry were
patrolling the region.
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said ``all roads were
blockaded along the border'' of the Abkhazia region and disturbances
spread on Sunday to the western parts of the Georgian republic.
   Groups of Abkhazians and Georgians roamed the region during the
fighting Saturday and Sunday, attacking police stations and freeing
180 prisoners, Bakatin said. He said they seized 95 automatic
weapons and 100 handguns.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told a news briefing
in Moscow the Communist Party might postpone a Central Committee
plenum set for late this month, at which the question of
nationalities is to be discussed. He said some policy papers still
were being drafted.
   Unrest in Sukhumi, capital of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic
nearly 1,000 miles south of Moscow, disrupted food and water
supplies and transportation for tens of thousands of vactioners on
Black Sea beaches, Bakatin said.
   ``Transport workers intend to restore rail and air traffic to
schedule within the next few days,'' Tass reported.
   Bakatin and Roland Beridze, a spokesman for the Georgian Foreign
Ministry reached by telephone in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, said
Abkhazians were angered by creation of a branch of Tbilisi State
University in Sukhumi that offered classes only in the Georgian
language.
   A university in Sukhumi offers most courses in Russian, with a
few in Georgian and Abkhazian, Beridze said.
   Earlier reports from Sukhumi said Abkhazians had been excluded
from the university, but Beridze said, ``If they wanted to study in
Georgian, there would be no limit on the number of Abkhazians.''
   Beridze, a Georgian, said violence began when ``Abkhazians
surrounded the building of the affiliate of Tbilisi State University
and didn't let applicants go in to take their entrance exams.''
   Abkhazians want their own republic, which would be the 16th in
the Soviet Union. Abkhazia, which has 535,000 people and 3,320
square miles, is in the Caucasus Mountains next to Turkey.
   In nearby Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass said, soldiers patrolled in an
attempt to prevent more of the sporadic violence between Armenians
and Azerbaijanis reported over the past three months. The region's
population is predominantly Armenian, but it was assigned to
neighboring Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Plans to hold an illegal demonstration in the regional capital of
Stepanakert on Friday fell through, but people gather every day
outside Communist Party headquarters and in the central square of
the town of Shusha, the agency reported.
   ``In other populated localities of Nagorno-Karabakh, explosive
situations develop when hundreds of people gather for rallies,'' it
said.
   Tass linked the ethnic violence to the deaths of eight children
killed Friday when a military helicopter crashed in the remote
settlement of Kelbadjar. Initial reports had not indicated the
victims were children or that the accident was related to the unrest.
   The Tass report said the children were watching the helicopter
take off and as it ``began ascending, it got caught in a
high-voltage power line and fell to the ground, killing eight of the
children. The tragedy could have not taken place if troops had not
had to be brought in to restrain the ethnic conflict.''

   Senior officials flew to Siberia and met with coal
miners Monday in an effort to end the Soviet Union's biggest strike,
which is spreading to the main coal fields and threatens to cripple
industry.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the special commission met with a
new regional strike committee that demands a greater voice for
miners in running the industry in western Siberia, 2,100 miles east
of Moscow.
   State television said eight mines had been struck in the
Ukraine's Donetsk Basin, the main coal region 1,450 miles south of
Moscow. The official news agency Tass said more than 2,000 miners
were striking at six mines in Makayevka, adjacent to the
administrative center of Donetsk.
   Tass said the Donetsk miners' demands were fewer than those in
western Siberia: more rapid reduction in the bureaucracy running the
mines, longer vacations and improved housing.
   In remarks to the Soviet legislature before reports about the
Donetsk strikes, Ryzhkov said 110,000 miners and sympathizers were
striking in the Kuznetsk Basin, the nation's second-ranking coal
production area.
   Politburo member Nikolai N. Slyunkov led the Moscow delegation,
which Tass said conferred with miners in Kemerovo and then with a
strike committee in Prokopievsk.
   Mines in both cities and seven others are involved in the
week-old strike. Each city has two representatives on the committee,
which was formed late Sunday night, said committee spokesman Valery
Serdtsev.
   In the first Kremlin comment on the strike, Ryzhkov said it
threatened production at some metallurgical and power plants.
   Weekend press reports said coal production had been cut by 1
million tons and a coal shortage had interrupted work at the
Magnitka steel complex in the Ural Mountains.
   Ryzhkov said in televised remarks to the legislature that he and
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a telegram to the miners Sunday
urging them to return to work and promising to address their
grievances.
   He said any decisions made in Kuznetsk also would affect Donetsk
miners. The premier said he opposed using force because violence
would only make things worse, and noted that the legislators were
asked last month to draft a law on strikes and collective
bargaining, Tass reported.
   Ryzhkov also criticized regional authorities in the Kuznetsk
basin for failing to meet the miners' needs. He responded to a
speech by Viktor Medikov, a local representative, who said miners
were tired of working hard for few benefits.
   Soviet law does not forbid strikes, but they were suppressed
before Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.
   The strike apparently is the largest in the Soviet Union since
the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 and the civil war and turbulence
that followed.
   Official Soviet histories do not mention any strikes since then,
and underground reports speak only of sporadic work stoppages
neither as widespread or prolonged as the mine strike.
   Slyunkov's commission was instructed to study what Ryzhkov
described as social problems in the Kuznetsk Basin and prepare a
plan for economic development of the region, Tass said.
   Demands by the miners include higher wages; better food, housing
and working conditions, and a greater role in running the industry.
   Local party government officials were not included on the strike
committee, but press reports said they declared support for greater
autonomy from the Coal Mining Ministry, which runs the mines from
Moscow and controls many social services in the coal basin.
   On the special commission with Slyunkov were Coal Mining Minister
Mikhail I. Shchadov; Stephan A. Shalayev, chairman of the All-Union
Council of Trade Unions, and Deputy Premier Lev A. Voronin, chairman
of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, which
oversees industry.
   Serdtsev, the Kuznetsk strike committee spokesman, and the
Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda said miners were divided
about whether to extend the strike to other enterprises in the
region or to stop delivery of coal to plants outside the area.
   ``The strike committee in Prokopievsk decided to stop the
shipment of fuel to users, which will in turn affect the country's
steel workers,'' Pravda said in a dispatch from the region.
   It added, however, that strikers from the regional administrative
center Kemerovo wanted to continue shipping coal that had been mined.
   ``The coal miners are showing restraint and discretion, and not
yielding to inflammatory demands that the enterprises of other
sectors be asked to join the strike,'' the paper declared. But press
reports Sunday said workers at 17 non-mining enterprises in the town
of Kiselevsk had struck in solidarity.

   Federal investigators entered a nuclear weapons
plant in Ohio unannounced on Monday looking into allegations of
mishandling of hazardous wastes, the plant operator said.
   Agents of the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office
in Chicago arrived at the Feed Materials Production Center armed
with videotape cameras, said Pete Kelley, a spokesman for
Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which runs the plant.
   ``They just kind of showed up,'' he said in a telephone
interview. He said Westinghouse managers apparently were not told in
advance of the inspection, but added, ``There's no question that
what they're looking at is waste and waste management.''
   Later, Kelley said, ``They were asking to film, or make pictures,
of some areas they consider violations'' of federal regulations
governing waste management.
   EPA officials declined to comment beyond saying an investigation
was under way.
   The plant, situated at Fernald, about 18 miles north of
Cincinnati, is owned by the U.S. Energy Department. It processes
uranium for the department's nuclear weapons program, although last
week Westinghouse stopped production indefinitely. The company said
it wanted to focus more attention on waste cleanup.
   Also last week the EPA added the plant to its list of hazardous
waste sites requiring the most immediate cleanup. But as recently as
this past weekend the agency declined to say whether it was involved
in an investigation at Fernald.
   The EPA inquiry coincided with the start Monday of the Energy
Department's own inspection of Fernald. About 30 members of a
special team of department inspectors began two days of safety
briefings there before starting a wide-ranging inspection of all
operations, including waste management, said spokesman Will
Callicott.
   The Energy Department inspection is unrelated to the EPA's
action. Callicott said his department had been given no information
about the EPA's inquiry.
   At EPA headquarters in Washington, the agency issued a terse
statement that it was ``examining the situation at Fernald regarding
the allegations.'' Spokesman Dave Ryan said he could not describe
the allegations or make any other comment.
   EPA officials at the regional office in Chicago said they had no
immediate information about the Fernald probe.
   Kelley said the EPA team that arrived at Fernald on Monday said
it planned to show its videotapes at a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee hearing Wednesday to be chaired by Rep. Thomas Luken,
D-Ohio, a critic of Fernald waste management.
   Fernald recently has become the focal point of various federal
probes, including an FBI preliminary investigation of unspecified
allegations of financial fraud.
   Kelley and Callicott said Monday the FBI had provided no
information about the fraud probe, which the bureau last week said
was related to the granting or execution of contracts at Fernald.

   President Bush discovered his Pilgrim
ancestry here Monday, when he was shown proof of a direct family
link with English religious dissenters who left Leiden for the New
World.
   After Bush delivered a speech at St Peter's Church here, city
archivist Theo Schelhaas gave Bush a copy of his family tree, which
dates back to an English couple known to have married in Leiden in
1603.
   Bush ``appreciated very much that his lineage had been fleshed
out'' by the archivist's research, Schelhaas' assistant, Pieter de
Baar, said.
   The president made the trip to Leiden during a 24-hour courtesy
visit to the Netherlands, where he held meetings with Queen Beatrix
and Premier Ruud Lubbers as well as paying homage to the Dutch roots
of the Pilgrims.
   A small community of English Protestant dissenters lived here for
more than a decade before setting sail for America in the early 17th
century.
   Bush is a direct, 12th generation descendant of Francis Cooke and
his Canterbury-born wife, Hester Mahieu, according to Schelhaas'
records.
   Little is known about the Cookes except their marriage date, June
4, 1603, and the fact that they had three children, including their
daughter Jane Cooke, a Bush ancestor born here in 1615.
   According to the Leiden records, Bush's roots can also be traced
to another Pilgrim family, the sisters Abigail and Sarah Jenney,
both born in Leiden and daughters of a brewer's apprentice, John
Jenney, and his wife Sarah Carey.
   Bush's father was related to Abigail Jenney as well as to the
Cookes, and his mother is a descendant of Sarah.
   Bush, in his remarks, joked: ``I'm glad to be back with my
cousins because we fondly remember Aunt Abigail back there those
many years ago.''
   The president, the records showed, also is a distant relative of
Vice President Dan Quayle, with some branches of their ancestry
going back to a 14th century family living on the Isle of Man, and
of archivist Schelhaas himself, De Baar said.
   ``You might say they're cousins in the 35th degree,'' he said of
Bush and Quayle.
   Leiden's mayor, G.H. Goekoop, also mentioned Bush's roots, and
pointed out that two other American presidents, William Howard Taft
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had ancestors in Leiden.
   ``Yes, here in Leiden not only the Dutch and American nations
come together, indeed, even the families of Democratic and
Republican presidents are linked,'' Goekoop said. ``We believe the
American reality began right here when the Pilgrims asked for
refuge.''

   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, a former defense
minister who favors tougher action against the Palestinian uprising,
said Monday the Israelis must ``eliminate'' Yasser Arafat if they
want peace.
   In an earlier threat against the PLO chairman, Sharon said Jan.
28: ``There will be no peace as long as Arafat lives.''
   Israeli soldiers wounded 13 Palestinians during confrontations in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials
reported. At least 565 Palestinians and 36 Israelis have been killed
in the 19-month-old uprising in the occupied lands and more than
8,000 Palestinians have been wounded.
   Also Monday, the underground Palestinian Popular Army alleged
university professor Sari Nusseibeh, suggested as a possible
Palestinian negotiator with Israel, had embezzling funds from the
uprising and gone abroad with help from the Israeli security service.
   Sharon toured the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967, and
renewed his demands for strong measures to end the Palestinian
revolt, which he called a ``different kind of war'' against Israel.
   ``We have to stop using slogans, dishing out promises and handing
out tranquilizers,'' he told reporters. ``The most important thing
is to restore law and order, to bring an end to terror and
violence.''
   The government must ``eliminate the heads of the terrorist
organizations, first of all Arafat,'' or there is no chance for
peace, he declared.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he
had not seen the complete text of Sharon's remarks but added: ``I
point out that U.S. policy is to support a de-escalation of violence
in the Middle East, not an escalation of violence. If true, as
reported, these remarks would obviously not help in that process.''
   Sharon, 61, was defense minister and directed Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon with the stated aim of driving Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas out of the country.
   He resigned in 1983 after a commission found him indirectly
responsible for the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut refugee camps
by Lebanese Christian militia allies of Israel.
   Earlier this month, Sharon led a rebellion in the conservative
Likud bloc that forced Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept harsh
conditions for his plan of discussing peace with the Palestinians.
   In response, the center-left Labor Party threatened to leave the
Cabinet, creating a crisis in the coalition government.
   Motta Gur, a Labor minister, said Monday of Sharon's latest
statements: ``In talking, Sharon is most effective. As defense
minister, he led us to a most unnecessary war. Although we were
closer than ever to Arafat in Beirut, Sharon did not harm Arafat,
did not eliminate terrorism, did not resolve the Palestinian problem.
   ``One needs extraordinary audacity to make all these claims,''
Gur said in his comments on Israel radio.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands observed a general strike
Monday to protest alleged harsh conditions in Israeli prisons, where
the army says more than 8,600 Palestinians are held on suspicion of
security offenses.
   Soldiers blew up the homes of two Palestinian youths suspected of
fatally stabbing a 64-year-old Israeli building contractor, Zalman
Yosef Schlein, on Friday, the army reported.
   ``The two confessed to planning and carrying out the murder with
a nationalist motive,'' the army said in a statement about the
destruction of the houses in Gaza City's Shajaiya district
   Nahed Yusef Radwan Gundiah and Mohammed Mahmud Ayed Hamdiya also
said they belonged to groups associated with Fatah, the main PLO
guerrilla group led by Arafat, the army said.
   A leaflet issued by the Palestinian Popular Army, an umbrella
name for loosely organized squads of militants, declared that
Nusseibeh ``has secretly left the country with the help of the
Zionist Shin Bet after it was discovered large sums of money given
to him to be distributed to the popular armies and strike forces
were `lost' on the way.''
   It said the professor at Bir Zeit University ``adores fancy
parties and loves to conduct `Palestinian struggle' ... from fancy
hotels.''
   Nusseibeh was named in recent Israeli court documents as a
paymaster of the uprising, responsible for distributing PLO funds
and publishing uprising literature. He has not been charged.
   Friends said he was abroad on vacation and could not be reached
for comment.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Monday the
United States has an ``intransigent, hegemonic imperialist
attitude'' toward Latin America and the rest of the Third World.
   On the 10th anniversary of the day the late President Anastasio
Somoza fled Nicaragua, Ortega declared that Washington is not
interested in democracy so much as in ``domesticating the peoples of
Latin America and the Caribbean.''
   He addressed a symposium called ``Democracy and Revolution''
commemorating what the Sandinista government calls the Day of Joy _
July 17, 1979, when Somoza fled and his family's 42-year-old dynasty
ended. The guerrillas entered Managua two days later.
   Festivities for the revolution's 10th anniversary have been
low-key, and no heads of state are expected. Most of the observances
are cultural events.
   During a speech to the symposium that lasted just 10 minutes
short of two hours, Ortega mentioned prominent Americans who had not
accepted invitations to attend.
   Among them were former President Jimmy Carter, former U.N.
Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and Elliot Abrams, former assistant
secretary of state for interAmerican affairs.
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick and Abrams, both of whom served President Ronald
Reagan, are known for strong opposition to the leftist Sandinistas
and support for the Contras, rebels who fought Ortega's government.
   Ortega said Nicaragua has more democracy than the United States
because the Sandinistas have increased literacy, lowered infant
mortality, improved health services and distributed land to
peasants. ``The revolution means the attainment of democracy,'' he
said.
   The president said more than 120,000 peasant families have
benefited from land distribution and the number of families in farm
cooperatives has grown to 76,715. Ortega said the number of labor
unions has increased from 163 before the revolution to 873,
representing 28 percent of workers.
   He criticized President Bush for concerning himself with ``the
problems of Hungary and Poland when he has so many problems in Latin
America.'' Ortega described Central America and the Caribbean as
``explosive territories.''
   Washington is not interested in helping solve the economic
problems of Latin America ``because there is no vision, there is an
underestimation of our nations'' and their problems, he said.
   Bush's visits to Poland and Hungary exhibited a lack of interest
in Latin America, Ortega said, and urged Latin Americans to unite in
demanding a change in the U.S. attitude toward their problems.
   ``It's better to collide with U.S. policy now ... than face
revolutionary struggles tomorrow,'' he said.
   Nicaragua, which has 3 million people, is in an economic crisis
that has made it one of the world's poorest nations, according to a
study by a U.S. economist hired by the Sandinista government. Sweden
financed the study.
   Last week, Ortega said he was willing to talk with the opposition
about more changes in electoral and media laws. The opposition has
said the new rules still gave the Sandinistas an unfair advantage.
   General elections are scheduled for Feb. 25.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Meets With Solidarity Lawmakers on Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with meeting over, Jaruzelski still
undecided, Solidarity comments. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
met with Solidarity lawmakers for six hours Monday and tried to
persuade them to support him for president.
   Authorities, as expected, announced that the National Assembly
will convene Wednesday to elect the president. Solidarity said its
senators and deputies will meet Tuesday to consider their votes.
   Jaruzelski has the support of his Communist Party and its ally,
the United Peasant Party, but he has said he doesn't want to be
elected without backing from the opposition.
   It remained unclear if Jaruzelski would allow his name to be
placed in nomination.
   The president is to be chosen by a majority of the National
Assembly _ the 100-member Senate and 460-member Sejm, meeting in a
joint session.
   Because of its overwhelming victories in the June 4 and June 18
elections Solidarity controls 259 of the 560 seats, or 46 percent.
   The legislators from the independent union movement asked scores
of questions at the closed-door meeting with Jaruzelski at the Sejm.
   A small contingent from the anti-communist Confederation for an
Independent Poland demonstrated outside the bulding. One of their
banners read, ``Jaruzelski Really Must Go.'' Police did not
interfere.
   Sen. Karol Modzelewski of Wroclaw, speaking for the Solidarity
lawmakers, told reporters the meeting was difficult ``for both sides
for several reasons. But there is no doubt it is an event of high
rank.''
   Jaruzelski told the Communist Party's Central Committee on June
30 that he did not want to run for president and recommended
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the position.
   But the party asked Jaruzelski to reconsider.
   ``It's still not clear what decision he will make,'' said
Modzelewski.
   The senator reported Jaruzelski said he would step down as
Communist Party leader if elected president. ``He said there is no
doubt that the two posts are not to be combined,'' Modzelewski said.
   Kiszczak also attended Monday's meeting, but Solidarity lawmakers
who participated said most of the discussion focused on Jaruzelski's
possible candidacy.
   They said Jaruzelski gave a speech and then answered questions.
Some indicated they did not like the general's responses.
   ``It's the same thing he's been saying for years,'' said Jozef
Slisz, leader of the independent farmers' union Rural Solidarity and
deputy speaker of the Senate.
   Under a revamped constitution, the president is to serve up to
two six-year terms and control Poland's military and foreign
relations. He also will nominate the prime minister who is to put
together the next government.
   On Friday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said he would cooperate
with Jaruzelski if he is elected. He also said Poland's domestic and
international situation requires that the president come from within
the communist coalition.
   But Modzelewski said Walesa's statement did not mean the
Solidarity lawmakers were bound to vote for Jaruzelski.
   ``It is not a habit of parliamentary democracy that an opposition
votes the same way as the government majority,'' he said. But he
addeed that even if the opposition votes against Jaruzelski,
Monday's meeting was important as ``an attempt at opening a certain
dialogue, which is very difficult but necessary.''
   According to at least one parliamentary leader, there are fears
that a non-communist president would provoke a dangerous reaction
from hardliners inside Poland or from other countries in the Soviet
bloc.
   President Bush praised Jaruzelski during his trip to Poland July
8-11 and that is considered to have eased opposition to Jaruzelski,
who imposed martial law to crush Solidarity in December 1981.
   Solidarity was restored to legal status April 17.
   In a concession to the communist coalition Monday, members of the
Citizens Parliamentary Club _ as the Solidarity lawmakers call
themselves _ agreed the balloting for president should be open. The
opposition previously had favored a secret ballot.
   The communist coalition wants an open ballot to make it easier to
uphold party discipline.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Army Captures Guerrilla Base Near Pakistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers captured a base
overlooking the guerrilla-controlled town of Gaziabad, near the
Pakistani border, and killed at least 68 insurgents in another
offensive, officials said Monday.
   The government said it must have a formal letter of request from
the United States before it could release an American photographer
captured last month after entering the country with guerrillas.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said he had given Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposals from the United Nations for
ending the 11-year-old war between the Soviet-sponsored government
and Moslem guerrillas. Gandhi returned to New Delhi from a six-day
trip to France, the Soviet Union and Pakistan.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry,
said at least 68 guerrillas had been killed since Sunday in a
government offensive around Surkdewar, 75 miles southeast of Kabul.
   Amani did not give details of either offensive, and no
independent confirmation of the government claims was available.
   After Gaziabad, Amani said, the army would aim for Torkham,
believed to be the last guerrilla outpost in the east. Gaziabad is
100 miles east of Kabul _ about 20 miles from Pakistan _ and Torkham
is 6 miles from the border.
   The seven main rebel groups fighting to overthrow the communist
government are based in Pakistan.
   ``For every step we take now, we are consolidating the last three
steps we have taken,'' Amani said. ``Our eventual aim is to march
toward Torkham and free our territory from our opponents.''
   Gaziabad has three large orange and olive farms that serve as
bases for the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who began fighting after a
communist coup in April 1978.
   Guerrillas have controlled the area since before the Soviet Union
sent soldiers to Afghanistan in December 1979. Soviet military
forces completed a U.N.-mediated withdrawal Feb. 15.
   American photographer Tony O'Brien, 43, was arrested June 8 at a
guerrilla hideout in Kabul while on assignment for Time-Life.
   Although the government has decided in principle to free him,
Amani said, ``we will need a letter from the American government
asking us to release Mr. O'Brien. We hope the American consular
officer who is in town is carrying such a letter, which should also
authorize her as the representative of the American government.''
   Renny Smith from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, who arrived
Sunday to oversee the release, would not comment on the Afghan
demand. ``I was told everything was OK; in fact, I have booked
myself to return on Tuesday,'' she said.
   Gandhi did not give details of the U.N. proposals he passed to
Gorbachev, but described them as incomprehensive and inadequate. He
said Gorbachev's reaction was similar.
   India, a Soviet ally of long standing, was the only noncommunist
country to recognize the Afghan government after the coup in 1978.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel to Consider Complaint Against Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee will consider
pursuing a complaint against Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, the
fiercely partisan conservative whose accusations sparked the panel's
investigation of Speaker Jim Wright, sources said Monday.
   The committee could vote Thursday, its first scheduled meeting
since Wright resigned from the House last month, to begin a
preliminary inquiry into Gingrich's conduct. The inquiry, according
to the committee source, will center on a partnership formed to
promote a book written by the Georgia lawmaker, his wife and a third
person, sources said.
   ``We'll probably be taking up Gingrich and not anything else,''
said one committee source, insisting on anonymity.
   The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. John T. Myers of
Indiana, said he presumed the Gingrich case would be on the agenda
because ``it's one of the things we have not dealt with.''
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed a 10-count complaint in April
accusing Gingrich of violating several House rules by the formation
of the COS Limited Partnership. Twenty-one investors put up $5,000
each in an unusual arrangement to promote the book, ``Window of
Opportunity.''
   Gingrich has denied any wrongdoing in the book promotion.
Spokeswoman Sheila Ward said Gingrich was aware of the committee
meeting but has received no formal notification of any action on
Alexander's complaint.
   According to the complaint, the investors' money could be
construed as income to Gingrich, a violation of limitations on
outside earnings applicable to House members.
   The complaint also said the more than $100,000 raised could
constitute a gift to Gingrich from those with a direct interest in
legislation. House rules prohibit members from keeping gifts of more
than $100 from anyone with such a direct interest.
   Alexander alleges the money could be considered campaign
contributions, subject to reporting obligations and restrictions
under campaign financing laws. If so, Alexander said, the investment
money may have exceeded contribution limits and may not have been
properly reported.
   Gingrich said in April that none of the investors received
``unusual or extraordinary personal help'' from him in their
dealings with the federal government. But he acknowledged that some
of the investors had a direct interest in legislation and that he
had handled routine requests from some of them.
   He contended that the $5,000 each investor gave to the
partnership does not constitute a gift.
   Under rules of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,
the formal name of the ethics committee, the panel ``shall conduct a
preliminary inquiry'' if members believe a complaint merits further
action. Gingrich would have an opportunity to respond to the
allegations.
   Gingrich initiated the investigation that led to the panel
charging Wright with 69 rules violations. That led to the Texas
Democrat's decision to give up his speakership and resign from the
House.
   Wright's alleged violations including charges that bulk sales of
a book he wrote violated outside earning limits and that he received
gifts from a business associate with a direct interest in
legislation.

   Nearly half the Japanese questioned in a poll
released Monday believe Japan will overtake the United States as the
most dominant economic power in the 21st century.
   The Tokyo Broadcasting System said 45 percent of the 1,500
Japanese interviewed in the poll, conducted in the beginning of
July, said Japan would be the world's strongest economic power next
century.
   Forty percent said they expected the United States to remain at
the top economically, it said. The remainder did not respond or gave
other answers.
   In a similar poll of 1,225 Americans interviewed by telephone in
the United States, 47 percent said they believed their country would
remain the world's No. 1 economic power, while 38 percent said Japan
would surpass the United States, TBS said.
   The poll was conducted jointly by TBS and CBS News of the United
States. TBS did not provide a margin of error.

<HEAD>Wage Suit Filed For Crewmen of Reflagged Tankers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law firm representing U.S. maritime unions
said Monday it had filed a lawsuit accusing operators of the 11
reflagged Kuwait tankers in the Persian Gulf of paying crew members
less than the legal minimum wage.
   Plaintiffs in the suit in U.S. District Court in Dover, Del. are
18 Filipino seamen who, the suit charged, were paid as little as $2
per hour when they should have been getting $3.35.
   The law firm of Quasha, Wessley and Schneider represents the
seamen and the several unions in the AFL-CIO representing seamen,
officers and longshoremen are not parties to the case directly,
though the law firm announced its action in the name of the AFL-CIO
Maritime Committee.
   Spokeswoman Anne Comfort said the firm expects substantially all
crew members of the tankers to join as plaintiffs, about 500 people.
   The Kuwaiti government was permitted to reregister the ships in
the United States in 1987. This made the vessels eligible for U.S
military protection without the complication of treaties or other
government-to-government agreements during the Iran-Iraq war, when
Iranian forces were attacking shipping to and from Kuwait, which
supported Iraq, and Iraqi forces were attacking Iran's tanker
traffic.
   The United States was anxious to keep Kuwait from carrying out a
threat to turn to the Soviet Union for military help.
   At the peak of the effort, the U.S. Navy had 27 warships in the
Gulf. Other western naval forces brought the total to more than 80.
   With the end of the war, those forces were reduced, the U.S.
contingent dropping to 10 in April of this year.
   Kuwait transferred six of the tankers back to its own flag in
April, May and June of this year, but five still were flying the
Stars and Stripes.
   At the request of the Defense Department, the Coast Guard waived
most of the requirement that all crew members aboard U.S.-flagged
vessels be U.S. citizens., leaving only the master and the radio
operator subject to the requirement.
   But the AFI-CIO Maritime Committee said no waiver was granted
from U.S. laws requiring payment of at least $3.35 per hour.
   An inspection team from the International Transport Workers
Federation, an international grouping of union, discovered on
boarding three of the 11 tankers in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in
May that seamen were paid less than $2 per hour.
   The AFL-CIO announcement quoted Gert-jan Harmsen, one of the
Rotterdam inspectors, as saying crewmen were ``reluctant to complain
for fear of being thrown off the ship or blacklisted in the future.
Some crewmen were even threatened with arrest and jail if they
complained to authorities.''
   Defendants in the suit were Chesapeake Shipping Inc. of Dover,
Del., the registered owner of the ships; Gleneagle Ship Management
Co. of Houston; NAESS Inc., a Manila-based ship crewing agency; and
Santa Fe International, a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., the
Kuwaiti-government owned corporation that is the actual owner of the
ships. Santa Fe employs a majority of the directors of Chesapeake
Shipping, which was formed in 1987 to handle the reflagging.
   At Gleneagle in Houston, a woman answering the telephone said all
executives who could answer questions were in a meeting.

   Children who weren't alive when man first landed
on the moon got a chance to guide another ``spacecraft'' to a lunar
landing Monday at the Challenger Center's mock Mission Control.
   Aided by nine flight controllers who were in NASA's Mission
Control during Apollo 11's historic July 1969 landing, the youths
talked through headsets and completed checklists before giving the
go-ahead for the mock landing.
   While the 15 students worked in Mission Control, another group of
children were ``flying'' in a simulator at a second Challenger
Center in Greenbelt, Md. Accompanying those children was former
astronaut Michael Collins, who circled the moon in Apollo 11's
command module while Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin landed
in the lunar module.
   ``I learned what it really feels like, and what you have to do to
communicate with people up there. It's really kind of hard,'' said
Trina Jones, 11, who will attend Houston's Lanier Middle School this
fall.
   ``I was afraid I would mess up,'' she added.
   The simulation marked the first time that students from the two
Challenger Centers were able to communicate with each other. The
facility in Houston was the first center, opening in August 1988.
   The centers, built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died
in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, offer youngsters a
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions. The two
centers are the first of a planned network of simulators.
   For about 30 minutes, the students sat behind their control
consoles along with the veteran flight controllers. The mostly
fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders also watched three television
monitors above, which showed their counterparts working at the other
center and television footage taken when the real lunar module
approached the moon.
   Shortly before the landing, Gene Kranz, chief flight controller
for the touchdown two decades ago, asked all the controllers if they
were ``go, no-go'' for a landing. They all gave their OK.
   Soon, a voice from Greenbelt repeated the words spoken 20 years
ago: ``Houston. Tranquillity base here. The Eagle has landed.''
   Several relatives of the Challenger astronauts attended the
event, including Jane Smith, widow of pilot Michael Smith; Lorna
Onizuka, widow of Ellison Onizuka; and Cheryl McNair, widow of Ron
McNair.
   Kranz, who is now director of mission operations at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said such simulations are important to keep children
interested in science and space so they may be motivated to pursue
careers in those areas.
   ``It's an incredible opportunity to basically challenge their
curiosity. If their curiosity is up, we'll do OK,'' Kranz said.

   The scientists who designed the rocket
that sent people to the moon 20 years ago reunited Monday to
commemorate the event and to voice shame that the United States
barred their project manager from attending.
   Arthur Rudolph, project manager for the Saturn V rocket at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, remained in voluntary
exile in his native West Germany, under threat of prosecution for
alleged Nazi war crimes if he returned to the United States.
   ``Many believe this is a sad day,'' said retired NASA scientist
Ernst Stuhlinger, who like Rudolph was one of 118 Germans who came
with Wernher von Braun to America after World War II and helped
start America's space program in Huntsville.
   Another member of the von Braun brain trust, Konrad Dannenberg,
said Rudolph's absence blights the nationwide festivities
celebrating the 1969 Apollo 11 moon walk.
   ``It's a shame for the United States to send out a man who did so
much for the United States,'' Dannenberg said. ``Everyone here
should be ashamed this thing happened.''
   Rudolph, now 84, retired in January 1970 after helping send two
spaceships to the moon and moved to San Jose, Calif., where he lived
in relative obscurity for 14 years. His tranquil retirement ended
when the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations
raised allegations that during World War II he was involved in the
deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners who were forced
to work in a V-2 rocket factory where he was technical director.
Those allegations were backed up by some survivors.
   Rather than fight the allegations Rudolph left the country,
returning to Hamburg, West Germany. A two-year investigation there
found no offense against Rudolph and returned his citizenship.
   Rudolph did not return phone calls to his Hamburg residence
Monday. One of his friends and former colleagues in Huntsville,
Walter Haeussermann, said Rudolph was doing no interviews on the
20th anniversary because ``so many things have been distorted.''
   Three weeks ago, Huntsville television station WHNT caught up
with Rudolph at a scientific convention in Salzburg, Austria, where
he gave his last interview and talked about wanting to return to
Huntsville.
   In the interview, he acknowledged ``forced labor'' worked for
months underground without seeing daylight, but he said that was not
his decision. He said he once gave the workers a 12-hour break
because they looked ``very tired.''
   ``My boss called me on the carpet and said, `If you do that
again, I'll put you in a concentration camp,''' Rudolph said.
   He said the events of World War II must be put in perspective.
``That was, of course, a dictatorship. If I didn't do what I had
been told, there was a high danger I would lose my life or be put in
a concentration camp,'' he said.
   Dannenberg, 77, said efforts to clear Rudolph's name in the
country he served for 25 years have failed.
   Petitions to President Reagan went unheeded and efforts to get
the Alabama Reunion Committee behind Rudolph's case were rejected by
Chairman David Rumbarger because he feared it could jeopardize the
group's non-profit status with the federal government.
   All of von Braun's original team has retired from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and half of them _ most in
their 70s and 80s _ are still living. Von Braun died in 1977.
   Stuhlinger said he and some other von Braun members visited
Rudolph three weeks ago at the Austrian convention.
   ``His physical health is good, considering he's 84 years old. But
he's sad and depressed about the fate forced on him,'' said
Stuhlinger, who is 75.
   Monday's reunion was also a chance for more than 800 U.S.-born
Americans who worked with the German team to gather. Many of them
also felt Rudolph should be allowed to return.
   Ed Buckbee, director of the Space and Rocket Center in
Huntsville, was press spokesman for the von Braun team during most
of the moon program.
   ``We allowed him to come into our country knowing his background,
allowed him to work to the top of our space program, retired him and
congratulated him. Then, after we'd used all his capabilities,
another branch of government decided to investigate him and punish
him,'' Buckbee said.
   ``There is reason to be ashamed. I certainly am.''

   A six-member jury was chosen Monday in U.S.
District Court to hear a lawsuit accusing Korean Air Lines of
willful misconduct when one of its passenger jets was shot down by
Soviet planes in 1983, klling all 269 people aboard.
   Families of 132 of the passengers killed when Flight 007 was
destroyed are suing KAL, alleging that the plane's crew, due to a
navigational mistake deliberately left uncorrected, allowed the
plane to go hundreds of miles off course over a period of several
hours into Soviet air space.
   After the six jurors and three alternates were chosen and sent
home for the day, lawyers for the airline asked Judge Aubrey
Robinson to limit presentation of the conclusions of a report on the
shootdown by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
   The ICAO said Flight 007 had been off course for nearly 5{ hours
before it was destroyed.
   Robinson said any analysis in the report which the families want
to present in court must be found to have ``a reasonable basis''
before he will admit it into evidence.
   But the judge said he had no intention of keeping most of the
information in the report out of the case.
   ``I do not see the report as being wholly untenable,'' the judge
told KAL attorneys.
   The case will turn on whether plaintiffs can show willful
misconduct by the crew. Failing that, international agreements limit
them to recovering at most $75,000 each.
   Lawyers for the families have contended that crew members chose
to continue the flight with a flawed program in the aircraft
navigation system rather than return to the starting point to
reprogram it, possibly leaving them open to company discipline.
   Previously, the judge said: ``A failure to notice that the flight
was off-course at Point A, or point B, or Point C ... might be
evidence only of negligence. ... But a failure to notice that the
flight was off-course at Point A and point B and Point C ... is
susceptible to a different interpretation.''
   The trial could last three to four weeks, the judge told jurors.

   The mayor called it murder most fowl
and ordered the defendant to do time on a petting farm. Robert
Yarsky thinks the sentence is daffy but he hasn't tried to duck it.
   Yarsky, 20, of Strongsville, has been baling hay and doing other
chores at a petting farm as part of his court-ordered community
sentence for running over Danny, a beloved neighborhood duck, in
January.
   Strongsville Mayor Walter Ehrnfelt called it ``premeditated
murder of Danny the Duck.'' Joseph and Shirley Spak, owners of the
popular Pekin duck, received dozens of cards, letters and flowers
after Danny's death.
   Yarsky says he could not get police or the mayor to believe
Danny's demise was an accident. ``I figured I would get a fine, but
I didn't think it would be anything outrageous like this,'' he said
last week when interviewed at the Olmsted Township farm, where he
must work two days a week for two months.
   Yarsky's flap with the law began Jan. 23, when he and three
friends were driving down a residential street in Strongsville, a
city of 36,000 in northeast Ohio.
   ``There was a stop sign, and I guess I was paying more attention
to the stop sign than anything,'' Yarsky said. ``My friends shouted,
but I really didn't see anything except for kind of a little white
flash out of the corner of my eye, and I swerved the car. Then I hit
it.
   ``I remember there was this guy in a van who saw it happen, and
he charged at me. So I left the scene, because I didn't know what
that guy was going to do. Later that evening, the police arrested
me. They said they had three witnesses, but I've always said I
didn't do it intentionally.''
   Ehrnfelt said he got a much different impression based on police
accounts and Yarsky's lack of remorse in his appearance in mayor's
court Feb. 9. Yarsky pleaded no contest to the second-degree
misdemeanor charge of killing an animal.
   ``I don't think young people can go through life with that kind
of attitude, whether the life be animal or person,'' the mayor said.
   ``This duck had crossed the road there for maybe about nine
years. It would actually come up to the roadway and hesitate and
then start across the road and then swim in a little creek that is
right next to the fire station,'' said Ehrnfelt. ``Then he would
travel back.
   ``Everyone knew this duck, and cars would stop for him and let
him cross the road. Even school buses would stop if he was going
across the road. Everyone gave him necessary consideration, with the
exception of Mr. Yarsky.''
   Ehrnfelt fined Yarsky $750, assigned $28 in court costs and
suspended a 90-day jail sentence pending completion of community
service at Burnette's Farm and Education Center, which is owned by
Jim Burnette. Yarsky also has to buy a new duck for the Spaks.
   Yarsky, who recently took a job with a storage company, said he
didn't know what to expect when he began his sentence at the pet
farm in June. After about six working visits, he said he was
enjoying the experience.
   ``It's not a bad place, and I like it, but I've always had
compassion for animals,'' Yarsky said. ``My uncle lived on a farm,
and I've been around animals all my life. But the mayor gets the
idea I don't have compassion for animals, so I guess that's why he
sentenced me here.''

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Won't Recommend Capital-Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee said Monday that he won't recommend a capital-gains tax
cut to finance any program, including catastrophic-illness insurance
for older Americans.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., made the statement to reporters
after his committee again failed to change the insurance program,
whose financing mechanism is under heavy fire from retirees.
   There apparently is no majority in the committee for any of
several ideas for changing the income-tax surcharge paid only by
higher-income older citizens or the flat monthly premium paid by all
but the poorest beneficiaries.
   The most popular idea appears to be to let the program continue
as is, said Rep. James Moody, D-Wis.
   The committee meeting ended in disagreement, with Rostenkowski
saying he would put together a package to include catastrophic
insurance, extending several expiring provisions and miscellaneous
tax provisions, including ways to pay for them.
   But the package won't include President Bush's proposal to cut
the capital-gains tax as a way to raise revenue. When asked why,
Rostenkowski replied: ``Because I'm a Democrat.''
   Democrats generally oppose a cut in the capital-gains tax, which
applies to profits from stocks and other investments, because almost
all the benefit would flow to those with annual incomes over
$100,000.
   Bush and his advisers insist that a capital-gains cut would
actually increase government revenues by generating new economic
activity. Democrats generally argue that although a reduction would
bring in more revenue in the first year, it would lose money in
later years.
   Although the capital-gains reduction is a prime topic of
conversation by Washington lobbyists, lawmakers apparently are
getting far more mail about the catastrophic insurance enacted a
year ago. The program was designed to protect Medicare recipients
from catastrophic costs of a major illness.
   Two-thirds of the cost is paid by upper-income people 65 and
older along with their federal income tax. In 1989, the surtax can
be up to $800 per beneficiary; to pay that full amount, a single
person would have to have total income above about $42,000. Almost
59 percent of retirees would pay no surtax.
   The remaining part of the cost is paid by most recipients through
the premium they already pay for Part B Medicare, which covers
doctors' bills. For 1989, the regular Part B premium is $27.90 plus
$4 for catastrophic coverage.
   Higher-income retirees subject to the surtax contend society in
general should pay for the benefits for those retirees whose incomes
are so low they escape most of the cost.
   ``This is a total-lose situation,'' said committee member Rep.
Brian Donnelly, D-Mass, who suggested the panel may have to leave
the decision up to the House.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq blamed each other Monday for
the deadlock in peace talks that began after the Aug. 20 cease-fire
that halted their 8-year-old war.
   Iran also said the United Nations was guilty of ``negligence and
complacency,'' and had failed to ensure a lasting peace.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said the Iranians had stalled
the peace talks and used the deadlock to ``blackmail the region and
threaten its security and stability.''
   U.N.-mediated peace talks began Aug. 25, five days after the
truce, and have gone nowhere.
   In a separate development, Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's
parliament and favorite in its July 28 presidential election, said
relations with the West could improve if approached on the basis of
equality, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   A Foreign Ministry statement for the anniversary of Iran's
acceptance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 on July 18, 1988,
said the council had promised to implement the resolution, which
also is a peace plan.
   It said the commitment remained unfulfilled after a year.
   The statement, broadcast by Tehran radio, said the Security
Council's ``negligence'' was ``not only a violation of the
resolution by its authors, but also a violation of the duty of
maintaining international peace and security.''
   After several military defeats in the last weeks of fighting,
Iran suddenly accepted the year-old truce resolution. Iraq had
declared soon after passage that it would accept the resolution if
Iran did the same.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian patriarch, said
accepting the cease-fire was ``more deadly to me than poison.''
   Other provisions of the U.N. resolution include withdrawal to
prewar boundaries, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an
impartial commission to assess blame for the war.
   A fourth round of peace talks was held in May and no further
meetings have been scheduled.
   Iran's statement Monday said Iraq had refused to implement ``the
most important instruction of the resolution'' _ withdrawal to
recognized international borders _ and had ``used every possible
means to avoid honoring that commitment,'' the radio said.
   Iraqi soldiers still occupy about 380 square miles of Iranian
territory. Iran insists they leave before peace talks proceed.
   Iraq rejects a 1975 treaty drawing part of the border down the
middle of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, its only outlet to the sea,
and insists the border be altered to give it all of Shatt.
   President Hussein of Iraq, in an address marking the 21st
anniversary of his Baath Arab Socialist Party's rise to power, said
``this no-war, no-peace situation'' could not continue.
   ``It's been nearly a year and they are still refusing to end the
plight of war prisoners,'' he said. Earlier this year, Hussein
suggested the more than 100,000 prisoners held by both sides be
exchanged under a new agreement separate from the U.N. resolution.
   In an interview with the Iranian newspaper Jomhuri Islami,
Rafsanjani said Iran would would give priority to better relations
with Third World nations and reiterated the desire for good
relations with neighboring countries, IRNA reported.
   It quoted Rafsanjani, who is considered relatively moderate by
Iranian standards, as saying of the West: ``If they deal with us on
the basis of equal terms and do not wish to impose anything on the
revolution, we will deal with them on equal terms.''
   Iran needs Western money and technology to rebuild from the war.
Western analysts estimate reconstruction will cost at least $200
billion.

<HEAD>Former Pharmaceutical Exec Pleads Guilty to Bribing FDA Official</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former executive of a pharmaceutical company
pleaded guilty Monday to bribing two former U.S. Food and Drug
Administration chemists in exchange for approval of generic drug
applications submitted by his company.
   It was the latest in a series of charges and guilty pleas
resulting from an investigation into allegations that FDA chemists
accepted cash in exchange for inside information and favorable
treatment toward drug applications from generic drug manufacturers.
   Ashok Patel, 49, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., a former senior
vice president of Par Pharmaceutical Inc., faces up to two years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox also announced Monday that
Par Pharmaceutical, based in Spring Valley, N.Y., and a subsidiary,
Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., were charged with one count each of
bribery.
   The companies, through their executives, allegedly gave former
FDA supervisor Charles Y. Chang about $2,900 between July 1987 and
April 1988. If convicted, each company faces fines totaling $500,000.
   Chang, 47, of Potomac, Md., has already pleaded guilty to two
racketeering charges and could be sentenced to up to 10 years in
prison and fined $500,000.
   So far, charges have been filed against three FDA employees and
three pharmaceutical companies. In addition to Chang, another former
FDA chemist and two officials of drug companies in Colorado and New
York have either pleaded guilty or agreed to do so.
   Willcox said Patel has been cooperating with investigators for
several months. He said the investigation is continuing and
additional charges are expected.

<TEXT>
   The largest family group to visit
black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago
gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his
71st birthday.
   His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived Monday night and indicated she
did not expect Mandela, leader of the African National Congress,
would be freed soon.
   She said that opinion came from her husband, who she visited last
week after Mandela's July 5 meeting with President P.W. Botha. That
meeting sparked speculation that Mandela would be freed this year.
He is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government.
   Mrs. Mandela, referring to her earlier visit with her husband,
told reporters: ``He said from that meeting with P.W. Botha we
musn't construe as indicating his release.
   ``His release wasn't even there. In fact it was not on the agenda
at all.'' Mrs. Mandela, dressed in black as an expression of
mourning, spoke with reporters at the D.F. Malan Airport.
   She said the family normally spent Mandela's birthday at home,
fasting and praying, but members would visit him this year on his
birthday ``because he has invited us to come and share it with him.''
   The family said 14 relatives, including children from both of
Mandela's marriages, would go to Mandela's house at the Victor
Verster prison farm in Paarl, north of Cape Town. In addition to
Mrs. Mandela the group will include three of Mandela's children, one
daughter-in-law, eight grandhildren and a great-grandson.
   Mrs. Mandela showed reporters a huge cardboard birthday card in
the black, green and yellow colors of the outlawed African National
Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the government. She
said the card was made by members of the National Union of
Mineworkers.
   ``It is very nice but it is also at the same time very sad,'' she
said of the planned birthday celebration. ``After all, he is not at
home.''
   Mandela was allowed to meet last Friday with five other ANC
members convicted with him in 1964 of trying to overthrow the
government and still imprisoned in Cape Town, according to Dullah
Omar, a family friend and attorney.
   Mandela has been in prison since 1962 when he was sentenced to
five years for leaving the country illegally and organizing an
illegal strike. He was given a life sentence following the 1964
conviction.
   Omar said Tuesday's family gathering ``will be an occasion with a
strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave
Mr. Mandela to resume his lonely life.''
   Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla, 14, arrived Monday evening
from Swaziland where he is a student at a private school. Mandla is
the son of Makgatho Mandela, the prisoner's eldest son by his first
marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, who lives in the black township of
Soweto and was not expected to join the reunion.
   Makgatho Mandela came to Cape Town with his wife, Zondi, his
daughter Indaba and 4-year-old Thembela, Mandela's great-grandson.
Thembela is the grandson of Tembikile Mandela. Tembikile, Mandela's
son by his marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, died in an automobile
accident in 1970.
   Evelyn Ntoko Mase, the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who has
been imprisoned with Mandela, married Nelson Mandela in 1944. They
had four children.
   One of their daughters, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, arrived with her
three children from the United States, where she is studying for a
doctoral degree in anthropology at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
   She said, ``He (Nelson Mandela) believes that education is the
key to all doors and he would like to see all of his children get an
education; in fact all of the black children ... because you cannot
claim to want to rule the country and be the leaders of the future
if you have people who are untrained and don't have any skills.''
   Mrs. Mandela-Amuah said of her father's possible release, ``I
always firmly believe that you can't predict what the South African
government will do.''

<HEAD>Rostropovich to Play to Save Elephants; Japan Targeted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's
leading cellists, said Monday he would play a benefit recital to
help raise money to save the African elephant.
   Rostropovich, music director of Washington's National Symphyony
Orchestra, announced the Sept. 18 performance at a news conference
sponsored by conservation groups trying to draw attention to what
they called a possible ``elephant holocaust.''
   ``When I see chairs and tables made with legs of ivory, I think,
how inhuman, how barbaric,'' Rostropovich said.
   Killing for ivory has reduced the African elephant population
from 1.3 million to an estimated 550,000 in the past 10 years, said
Diana E. McMeekin, vice president of the African Wildlife Federation.
   The ivory is harvested after the elephants are killed.
   Sponsors of the concert at Washington's Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts predicted it would net at least $400,000, all to be
used for elephant conservation projects and investigation into the
network of elephant-poaching and ivory trading being outlawed by
many countries.
   Christine Stevens, president of the Washington-based Animal
Welfare Institute, described the poachers as ``totally evil but
wonderfully well-organized.''
   She predicted a fierce battle at the October meeting in
Switzerland of the 102-nation Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species ``to ensure there are no weakening'' moves
against a proposed total ban on ivory imports.
   Japan, the major ivory buyer, and Botswana, South Africa and
Zimbabwe, the major suppliers, want reservations that would allow
them to trade among themselves.
   Many African nations, led by Kenya and Tanzania, support
curtailing the ivory trade.
   Japan accounts for 40 percent of world ivory consumption and the
United States 15 percent. Japanese use carved ivory for personal
signature stamps as well as jewelry.
   In June, Japan banned ivory imports but continues to permit
shipments certified by the countries of origin. Ms. Stevens said
such a loophole would mean that ``all of the elephants in all of
Africa will be at risk.''
   President Bush issued an executive order June 5 banning U.S.
import of ivory from all countries. The West European Community has
taken similar steps.

   Patriotism rippled through a crowd of
thousands who gathered among the tumbleweeds outside a tightly
guarded Air Force plant to watch Monday's maiden flight of the B-2
stealth bomber.
   ``Great God,'' exclaimed Les Holland as the bat-winged plane
soared into the air from Air Force Plant 42 in the Mojave Desert,
where spectators had parked motor homes, trucks, sports cars and
motorcycles.
   Holland was one of the many employees of Northrop Corp., the
builder of the craft that already has cost about $22.4 billion in
development, who woke up early to watch the flight.
   The four-engine flying wing took off from a runway at Plant 42,
then made what appeared to be a perfect landing at nearby Edwards
Air Force Base.
   Air Force Capt. Tess Taft unfurled an American flag and ``The
Star Spangled Banner'' was sung on the runway by Alis Clausen,
employee of a local cable television station.
   Among the thousands outside the plant's perimeter, aviation
enthusiast John MacWhirter, a former Marine aviator in F-4 Phantoms,
gave play-by-play announcements about the takeoff over a public
address system on his truck.
   ``There was an emotional ripple, and I shouted `God bless
President Ronald Reagan,''' he said. ``It was ecstasy.'' Reagan was
a strong supporter of the B-2.
   MacWhirter had been waiting for the B-2's first flight since
January, rising before dawn on many days hoping to get a glimpse of
the craft that only recently was shown to the public.
   Others were equally enthusiastic.
   ``This was a big day for all of us,'' said George Adelmann, who
joined MacWhirter on the early morning vigils.
   ``I'm shaking. My legs are shaking. It was going right over my
head,'' said Shari Cutler of Lake Los Angeles, who brought her four
children.
   ``It was beautiful. I know the pilot's wife and I can never get a
word out of her about the stealth,'' said Barbara Resterfeld of
Lancaster.
   ``It gave me goose bumps,'' said Nancy Moore of Lancaster.

   The radar-evading B-2
stealth bomber took its maiden flight over the Mojave Desert on
Monday, impressing its pilots while crowds cheered and political
debate intensified over the costly plane's fate.
   ``If we appear a little giggly about all of this, it was a lot of
fun,'' said Air Force Col. Richard Couch, one of two pilots on the
test flight.
   The nearly two-hour flight appeared flawless to people who
watched the sinister-looking flying wing take off from
secrecy-shrouded Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale shortly after 6:30
a.m. and land at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.
   The four-engine bomber, built with advanced composite materials
and a shape that are not easily detectable by radar, flew at 10,000
feet over the Antelope Valley at three speeds, accompanied by two
F-16 fighters through a clear sky.
   The B-2 was temporarily arrayed with radar reflective material to
allow test personnel to keep track of it on radar screens.
   The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with a bulge in the
middle rather than a conventional fuselage, finally landed and
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble, stopped for several
minutes and then taxied off into a hangar.
   ``We were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft. It
was very close to the simulators,'' said Bruce J. Hinds, chief test
pilot for Northrop Corp.'s B-2 division, who flew the plane with
Couch.
   During takeoff, they intended to pitch the plane to a 7{-degree
angle before it was supposed to become airborne, but ``we never got
there,'' Couch told reporters. ``The airplane just very smoothly
came off the ground.''
   Couch called the B-2 a ``very nimble aircraft'' and said it made
a ``Grade A'' landing.
   ``I had to ask the tower if we were on the ground,'' Couch said.
   The plane needed only about 5,000 feet of the 11,000-foot takeoff
runway and the wheels remained down throughout the flight, a normal
practice for a maiden flight. The B-2 used only about 5,000 feet of
runway on landing.
   The Air Force had planned to evaluate data and nspect the plane
for about five weeks before trying a second flight. However, the
results were so heartening that the next flight will probably be
sooner, said Gen. Bernard T. P. Randolph, commander of the Air Force
Systems Command.
   ``This is a historic day in aviation,'' Randolph said. ``It
basically negates the air defenses that have been building up over
many years around the world.''
   At the Pentagon, officials issued a statement by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney on the B-2 flight:
   ``I am pleased with the success of the project to date. It is
good to see that the test program appears to validate the judgments
made previously by the Department of Defense and Congress to go
forward with the B-2.''
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has
balked at the thought of paying Northrop more than $500 million
apiece for 132 bombers.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, approving President Bush's
$305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990, stipulated
Friday that no new money be spent on the B-2 until it flew. The
Pentagon seeks $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year
and may need $8 billion in each of the three peak years of
production, 1992 to '94.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said in Washington that in spite of the
successful flight, the program is ``still in trouble in the House.''
   The B-2's maiden flight was long awaited by aviation buffs and
workers from the desert aerospace community. Thousands gathered
among the tumbleweeds outside Plant 42 and shouted ``Here they
come!'' when the great wing's dark shadow passed over. ``Great
God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   The ``Star Spangled Banner'' was sung beside the runway by Alis
Clausen, employee at a local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess
Taft unfurled the Stars and Stripes.
   ``I think it's time in the debate that we begin stressing the
capabilities of the aircraft instead of placing all ephasis on the
cost. We are a nation with global responsibilities,'' said Northrop
spokesman Les Daly, a longtime proponent of the flying wing concept.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that form part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent against the
Soviet Union.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
for several years.
   The B-2's first flight followed a series of ground speed tests.
It was supposed to fly Saturday but a low fuel pressure reading
forced a delay.
   Montgomery, the Mississippi congressman, said an amendment will
be offered in the House to stop all B-2 funding when the defense
bill comes up on the floor next week. He said the possibility of its
passing is ``realistic.''
   ``I believe what I'm leaning toward right now is to continue the
program mainly in research,'' he said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., also a member of the House
Armed Services Committee and an opponent of the stealth bomber, said
she hoped the maiden flight would not result in a blank check for
the Pentagon.
   Schroeder supports an amendment to the defense bill that would
stop production of the B-2 after 13 planes until further tests and
flights.

<HEAD>House Votes Again to Remove Interior Supervision of Park Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Monday to reduce the interior
secretary's authority over the national parks in what supporters of
the bill said was an effort to keep politics out of the
environmental decisions.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said the bill also was designed to
protect professional park employees who, he said, are being harassed
and intimidated by political appointees.
   Republican opponents of the bill, which was approved by voice
vote, said it would be vetoed by President Bush. It still must go
through the Senate before reaching the president's desk.
   A similar measure passed last year by the House was never acted
on by the Senate.
   ``The issue is to let the professionals use professional
judgments,'' said Vento, who led debate in favor the bill.
   But Rep. John Rhodes, R-Ariz., who opposed the measure, said it
was ``bad law'' that removes the park service control from one group
of political appointees by ``just putting it under control of
another set of political operatives.''
   The legislation would require the president to nominate a park
service director who would be confirmed by the Senate for a
five-year term and be answerable directly to Congress.
   The interior secretary would relinquish almost all power over the
parks, including hiring, to the director. The secretary would still
have to approve the budget of the National Park Service before
submission to the president.
   Currently, the director of the National Park Service is appointed
by the interior secretary, without senate confirmation, and may be
removed by the secretary.
   With one exception in the late 1960s, park service directors have
always been professional park managers, either from the federal
system or a state system.
   An amendment offered by Rhodes that would have eliminated all
provisions of the bill except the one requiring the director to be
confirmed by the Senate failed 148-251.
   Vento said if the final vote on passage had been by roll call,
there would have been a two-thirds majority, the margin needed to
overturn a presidential veto.
   Vento said, however, the fight in the Senate for the measure
would be tougher.
   Environmentalists clashed several times with the Reagan
administration over its supervision of the parks and alleged
dictation of National Park Service decisions.
   ``As land and resource scarcity has increased so have the
pressures of certain segments of society to take actions detrimental
to the basic legislative directives to protect the National Park
System,'' said the report from the Interior Committee which handled
hearings on the bill.
   ``Such actions have polarized opposite reactions from citizen
groups and the general public who see park resources being seriously
degraded.''
   The report said ``professional resource managers decisionmaking
has been supplanted by political decisionmaking.''
   Interior Secretary Manual Lujan, formerly the senior Republican
on the committee, was away from Washington Monday, but department
spokesman Tom Wilson said that the secretary testified against the
measure in committee hearings.
   Lujan told House Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., that he would recommend a veto if the bill passed in the
form approved by the committee, Wilson said.

   President Bush is being advised to veto any
legislation which forbids him to use money from other countries for
activities denied funds by Congress, such as helping the Contra
rebels, Sen. Jesse Helms said Monday.
   ``This doesn't even make good nonsense because Congress doesn't
have the authority to do that,'' said Helms, R-N.C., as debate
opened on an amendment offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to a pending State Department authorization bill.
   ``It is a direct, explicit and conscious attack on the separation
of powers,'' Helms said of the amendment on which the Senate will
vote Tuesday.
   ``It is nothing less than an attempt by Congress to criminalize
foreign policy.''
   ``I get the impression in the political climate in Washington
today that there is an effort to milk that Iran-Contra cow that goes
on and on and on,'' Helms said.
   The Moynihan amendment springs from disclosures at the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings that the Reagan administration
solicited funds from foreign nations to aid the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua at a time when Congress had barred using U.S. funds to
provide such aid.
   During the hearings the countries were referred to by code names
such as ``Country One'' and ``Country Two'' and the like. But it was
clear that nations like Saudi Arabia and Brunei had contributed.
   Former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, then a staff member of
the National Security Council, was described in testimony as having
been heavily engaged in such solicitation.
   The Moynihan amendment would make what North and others did
illegal.
   The amendment would provide penalties of up to five years in jail
for any officer or employee of the government who solicits funds or
material aid for a prohibited activity from any foreign government,
foreign national or U.S. citizen.
   The amendment also would cut off U.S. foreign aid to another
nation if that would have the effect of assisting the activity
proscribed by Congress.
   Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, in a letter read by
Helms, said the amendment would seriously affect the ability of Bush
or any succeeding president from conducting foreign policy.
   He said that if Congress attaches the Moynihan amendment to the
State Department authorization bill, ``we would recommend the
president disapprove the bill.''
   Moynihan said: ``There is no question about this legislation
being necessary. We went through an extensive, painful, and divisive
inquiry into practices in the executive branch which clearly
undermined the will of Congress _ but took place even so.''
   Helms contended that while Congress can bar spending tax dollars
on an executive branch policy, it cannot under the Constitution bar
the administration from finding the money elsewhere.
   He argued that the president has the power to do that as he sees
fit, and can only be punished for such action by impeachment or
defeat at the polls, not by criminal sanctions.
   But Moynihan said Congress has the right to act to prevent the
laws it passes from being circumvented.
   ``This is not just our right, it is our responsibility,'' he
said. ``We're trying to protect the presidency and the process.''

<HEAD>Severe Thunderstorms Roll Through Eastern Oklahoma, Western Arkansas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms spawning torrential rains and high winds
rolled through much of eastern Oklahoma and parts of western
Arkansas on Monday, collapsing a roof at a Tulsa airport hotel and
leaving thousands without power.
   Winds howled to 90 mph near Peggs and gusted to more than 80 mph
near Bartlesville, Okla.Sections of eastern Oklahoma received 3 to 5
inches of rain, prompting flash flood watches.
   A 15- by 20-foot section of a lobby roof at the Sheraton Airport
Hotel in Tulsa collapsed during the Monday morning downpour,
officials said. Hotel patrons, who saw the ceiling bulging downward
before it collapsed, left the area.
   The storms in Tulsa also interrupted power for up to 20,000
utility customers.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell over most of the Florida
Peninsula. In Boynton Beach, thunderstorm-generated winds knocked
down trees and power lines.
   Showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain fell over a large part
of central and east central North Dakota.
   Elsewhere, rain and thunderstorms continued over much of eastern
North Carolina and parts of eastern South Carolina. A few showers
also lingered over New England; thunderstorms were reported over
parts of northern Wisconsin.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 2\ inches at Fort Smith, Ark.; 1{ inches at Fayetteville,
N.C.; 1\ inches at Homestead, Fla.; and 1 inch at Alexandria, La.,
Fayetteville, Ark., and Joplin, Mo.
   Record-setting heat continued over west Texas; the temperature in
Midland soared to 107 degrees, beating the previous record of 103
degrees set in 1981. San Angelo tied its record high of 104 degrees
set in 1978.
   The low for the Lower 48 states Monday morning was 31 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Worcester, Mass., to 105 degrees at Phoenix.
   The national weather forecast for Tuesday called for scattered
showers and thunderstorms over the Mississippi Valley and from
Florida to southern Georgia, the eastern Carolinas and southeast
Virginia; showers and thunderstorms from southern Minnesota to
Missouri and central Mississippi and over most of Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s over most of New
England, Iowa and Washington state; over 100 degrees from southeast
Arizona to southwest and central Texas and in the interior valleys
of central and Southern California; near 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s in the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>U.S. Refuses to Sell Missile-Testing Device to India</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs comment from embassy statement, background</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has refused to sell
India a device for testing missiles, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Monday.
   ``It could conceivably contribute to the development of further
ballistic missiles,'' Boucher told reporters.
   The device is called CAVCTS, for combined acceleration vibration
climatic test system.
   Boucher said he was not aware of any protest from the Indian
government against the U.S. denial of an export license for the
device.
   But the Indian Embassy said later the refusal was unjustified
since India had already received a U.S. license to purchase the
equipment in 1985, and the device was usable only for testing
short-range missile launchers.
   An Embassy statement said the denial was based on ``alleged
concern arising out of the Missile Technology Control Regime'' that
the United States concluded in 1987. The agreement with France,
Britain, the Soviet Union, Japan and several other countries, aimed
to curb proliferation of missile technology in the Third World.
   However, the Embassy said, ``this piece of equipment is only
relevant for short-range launchers and does not attract MTCR
concern.''
   The Embassy did not explain the delay in buying the $1.2 million
device, which allowed the original license to expire.
   India has successfully tested its ``Agni'' surface-to-surface
ballistic missile, which Western experts speculated could carry a
nuclear warhead. But the Indian government continues to renounce
nuclear arms.

<TEXT>
   Large rallies are ineffective in
spreading Christianity to members of rival faiths, and the focus
instead should be on low-profile dialogue, delegates to a worldwide
evangelical conference were told Monday.
   The Rev. Martin Alphonse, a Methodist minister from Madras,
India, said at the Lausanne II conference that such dialogue ``will
not be seen as a threat to or an open assault on other faiths.
   ``By playing a low key, it will still be able to permeate the
various spheres of peoples of other faiths in a quiet but firm
way,'' said Alphonse, who lives in a predominantly Hindu city.
   The conference, which opened last Tuesday, has brought together
about 4,200 evangelical Christians from more than 160 countries to
devise ways to spread the Christian religion worldwide by the end of
the century.
   Alphonse told the delegates that they face a seemingly
insurmountable task in reaching 900 million Moslems, 690 million
Hindus, 320 million Buddhists and others by the year 2000.
   ``We are not thinking about organized conventions and
evangelistic crusades for thousands of them exclusively in one
place,'' he said. ``Such strategy may not simply work.
   ``Rather we are thinking about world evangelization by local
evangelization, by reaching a few here and a few there, thus
eventually making this gospel proliferate everywhere,'' he said.
   Colin Chapman, a lecturer in religion at Trinity University in
Bristol, England, said such quiet dialogue paralleled the style of
preaching used by Jesus and the apostles when dealing with Jews and
members of other religions in the Roman Empire.
   Chapman said it is important for evangelicals to avoid insulting
other faiths even if they find the religions erroneous and
incomplete.
   The Lausanne committee, which organized the conference, is
chaired by the Rev. Leighton Ford, a Canadian who lives in North
Carolina and is the brother-in-law of American evangelist Billy
Graham.
   Graham has used large-scale rallies, or crusades, as his
principal method for evangelizing for nearly 40 years. Graham was to
have addressed the opening session of the conference, which ends
Thursday, but he canceled because of a schedule conflict.
   Alphonse said Christianity faced resistance from other religions
because of cultural conflict, the faith's association with European
colonialism, and the aggressive activities of early Christian
missionaries.
   He said other religious groups had expected a decline in
missionary activity after the collapse of European empires after
World War II.
   ``On the contrary, most of the national churches have revived the
traditional evangelistic work and some have become much more
vigorous in it than ever before,'' he said. ``The number of converts
from other faiths to Christianity has continued to increase in
several nations in the post-colonial era and in unprecedented
measure in a few cases.''
   No figures were immediately available.
   He said Islam had attempted to resist Christian encroachments by
taking on a political aspect and had become established as a state
religion in Pakistan, Malaysia, Brunei and nations of the Middle
East.

<HEAD>Forest Service, Industry Call Environmentalist Plan Unworkable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Both the timber industry and the Forest Service
on Monday rejected a proposal offered by environmentalists aimed at
ending the fight over logging in the ancient forests of the Pacific
Northwest.
   The rejections came as lawmakers from the region sought to craft
a legislative compromise that would ensure an adequate short-term
supply of logs to keep the region's mills operating over the next 15
months and protect the old-growth forests that are prime habitat for
the rare northern spotted owl.
   The lawmakers had hoped to attach the compromise to the Interior
Department appropriations bill when it came before a Senate
appropriations subcommittee Tuesday, but the meeting has been put
off until later in the week for unrelated reasons.
   The lawmakers have made clear they will act whether or not the
environmentalists and the industry agree. The spending bill will
include funds for the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management.
   Industry representatives said the environmentalists' proposal
would be ``technically infeasible'' because its restrictions on
old-growth logging would make it impossible to meet the timber sales
levels it envisions.
   ``This is a non-starter _ an offer of terms of surrender,'' Mark
Rey, a vice president of the National Forest Products Association,
said at a news conference, adding that environmentalists had just
repackaged their previous demands.
   The environmentalists proposal would reduce the harvest over the
next 15 months to a level 400 million board feet below that of the
earlier plan and Rey said that would result in the loss of 7,000
jobs, $171 million in payrolls and $162 million in government
revenue at all levels.
   In a letter to Northwest lawmakers, F. Dale Robertson, Forest
Service Chief, said the environmentalist proposal would be
``unworkable. The timber targets are achievable with protection of
significant old-growth stands, but not under the conditions and
criteria proposed.''
   The restrictions on old-growth logging proposed by the
environmentalists would allow harvesting in mostly younger stands
and ``such areas are not capable of providing the intended sales
volume.''
   The federal government has been prevented from selling many older
stands to timber companies as a result of court injunctions won by
environmental groups, who argued the stands may be the last
remaining habitat of the spotted owl.
   Environmentalists said that despite the rejections, they were
still willing to negotiate.
   ``We think the industry ought to be doing a little more in terms
of coming up with their own proposals rather than taking cheap shots
at ours,'' said Rich Hoppe, a spokesman for the Wilderness Society.
   Hoppe said that environmentalists were a little surprised at the
Forest Service's comments as their plan was based on numbers
supplied by the agency.

<HEAD>Utah Fire Threatens Cabins, Mesa Verde Fire Rekindles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire bosses in southern Utah requested 400 reinforcements Monday
to battle a blaze threatening summer cabins, and a fire that was
declared controlled in Mesa Verde National Park rekindled and jumped
fire lines.
   Smokejumpers parachuted to a small fire in rugged terrain in
Idaho at a site so high that snow was available to fight flames.
   In addition to the requested reinforcements, 400 firefighters
were already on the Uintah Flat forest fire in the Dixie National
Forest.
   Forest Service spokesman Bevan Killpack said the fire grew to
6,230 acres by Monday, burning well into private land and moving
slowly toward several summer cabins in the Bonanza Creek subdivision
near Hatch, about 40 miles east of Cedar City.
   The fire came within an eighth of a mile of one cabin and a
quarter mile of several others, which were guarded by engine crews
as firefighters cleared brush and bulldozers carved fire lines
around them, Killpack said.
   U.S. Bureau of Land Management officials scrambled for crews to
fight two new fires elsewhere in Utah.
   However, a 118-acre blaze that neared dozens of posh homes on
Salt Lake City's east side was declared contained Sunday, and on
Monday crews doused hot spots by helicopter and with hand-carried
water bags.
   A forest fire that was declared controlled Thursday in Mesa Verde
National Park in southwestern Colorado flared up again over the
weekend and had spread to more than 360 new acres by Monday, for a
total of 3,100 acres burned in the 52,000-acre park, officials said.
   ``The humidity dropped, it got warmer and the wind picked up. The
fire kind of skittered around a little bit and skipped a fire
line,'' said John Pasquantino, fire information officer at the park.
   ``We can try and stamp on it and all, but only Mother Nature is
going to do anything to really put the thing out,'' he said.
   There were 137 firefighters on the line Monday, triple the number
working when the fire flared up Saturday. Officials estimated the
blaze was 85 percent contained, but the remaining 15 percent was on
extremely steep terrain, Pasquantino said, and containment was not
predicted until Wednesday.
   The park, which features ancient Indian cliff dwellings sheltered
in canyons, remained open, although three roads were closed.
   As last week, archaeologists worked with fire crews Monday on the
mesas above the canyons to make sure no ancient artifacts in the
park were damaged by firefighting. There were no reports of any
specific archaeological sites threatened, Pasquantino said.
   Fire bosses dropped a pair of smokejumpers into rugged terrain on
the Targhee National Forest in eastern Idaho on Monday to battle a
small lightning-sparked fire on U.S. Sheep Experiment Station land.
   ``It's so high, they have access to snow up there, and they're
going to use that,'' said Targhee spokeswoman Lisa Lew. She didn't
know the elevation but it was at least above 7,000 feet.
   The Odell Creek Fire was the latest in a spate of fires across
Idaho after a weekend of thunderstorms. All of the dozens of other
fires had either been doused or contained.

   The multiple investigations triggered by
Thomas Root's 800-mile autopilot flight while he was unconscious,
and by his bullet wound, are moving ahead on several fronts, federal
investigators said Monday.
   The 36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va., remained in
Hollywood Memorial Hospital in stable condition; a hospital
spokeswoman predicted he would be there for another week.
   Investigators with the FBI and the National Transportation Safety
Board are examining various aspects of Root's business activities
and details of his flight Thursday.
   He planned to fly his small plane from Washington to Rocky Mount,
N.C., but told air traffic controllers he was having trouble
breathing, and apparently passed out until his plane ran out of fuel
and ditched near the Bahamas.
   Military rescue crews who had followed Root's plane picked him up
from the sea. Doctors later discovered he had suffered a gunshot
wound to the abdomen; Root theorized a pistol in his plane's cockpit
may have fired when the plane hit the water.
   Laboratory tests will check for drug traces in blood samples and
also for evidence of carbon monoxide that would explain his
difficulty breathing and loss of consciousness during the flight.
Rachel Halterman of the National Transportation Safety Board said
those results should be completed by midweek.
   In North Carolina, the secretary of state's office has been
investigating security fraud allegations against a company with
which Root acted as an attorney. Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten
said Root knew he was under investigation.
   The NTSB is interviewing business associates and doing a
background check as well as interviewing pilots and members of
rescue crews who found Root.
   The FBI is investigating possible violations of criminal statutes
and will make a recommendation to the U.S. attorney here.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said his agency is checking the
situation surrounding the flight and also checking on matters
reported in Washington, Virginia and North Carolina.
   Root contacted The Washington Post after his family considered
numerous written requests for interviews, and told the newspaper
that the effects of his accident have surprised him.
   ``I'm shocked. I can't understand why this story has blown up,
beyond the admittedly unusual circumstances, to end up being a
front-page story like this,'' Root told The Post for Monday editions.
   He repeated his adamant denial that the bullet wound meant he
tried to commit suicide.
   ``As I was swimming around out there, hurting a lot, I was
thinking about my family and that I wasn't going to see them again.
And I say that to say that I don't have the ability, nerve or
stupidity to take another life _ mine or anybody else's.''
   Root added that his life insurance policy has a clause allowing
his family to collect in the event of a suicide, so it would have
been pointless for him to plan the flight to conceal a suicide.

<HEAD>More Than 50 Youths Die In Rebel Crackdown, Paper Reports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 50 youths died of suffocation
after being crammed into unused train cars for three days in a
military crackdown on rebels, a government-owned newspaper reported
Monday.
   New Vision said the dead were among 276 youths rounded up on July
10 from villages around Kumi, about 150 miles northeast of Kampala
and a region believed to be a major hideout for Uganda People's Army
rebels.
   New Vision said government soldiers locked the youths in old
train coaches where they were kept for three days, and more than 50
of them died of suffocation.
   The English-language daily said the government planned to send a
military intelligence team to Kumi to investigate the report. It did
not say why youths were targeted in the roundup.
   The London-based Amnesty International has accused Uganda's
National Resistance Army of human rights violations including rape,
torture, murder and illegal detention of civilians and says such
incidents appear to be on the increase.
   But the group has credited President Yoweri Museveni with
bringing an ``immediate end to the gross human rights violations
inflicted by previous governments.''
   Museveni came to power in 1986 after a five-year guerrilla war
and has been fighting several rebel groups opposed to his government
in northern and eastern Uganda.
   In the northern Uganda town of Gulu, rebels Thursday abducted 40
people, killed one, robbed police and military personnel of their
weapons, and stole drugs from the hospital, New Vision reported.
   Two nurses were among the captives who were made to carry the
rebels' loot, said the newspaper.
   The rebels were believed to be members of the Holy Spirit
Movement, which has been harrassing and torturing civilians and
looting the area around Gulu since the beginning of the year.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with afternoon testimony. No Pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Dortch, Jim Bakker's former top
deputy, and not former Bakker aides David and James Taggart actually
ran PTL during its heyday, defense witnesses testified Monday.
   PTL founder Bakker ``had agreed to turn the reins over to
Dortch,'' Charlotte attorney John York testified. ``In my
experience, David (Taggart) was never a power figure. He was just a
mouthpiece for Jim.''
   York, a member of the law firm that served as PTL's general
counsel, was one of the first witnesses called by defense attorneys
for the Taggart brothers. The Taggarts are charged with evading
$487,000 in income taxes during their years at PTL.
   Prosecutors say the two men diverted $1.1 million in ministry
funds to their own use.
   York and the former assistant secretary to the PTL board said
Dortch wielded much of the authority at PTL.
   Dortch, York said, once ordered him to leave a PTL board meeting
just before bonuses for ministry executives were discussed.
   Sylvia Watson, who served as the assistant board secretary in the
early 1980s, said she resigned in 1982 after Dortch ordered her to
stop writing into the minutes who made the motion to pay bonuses.
   York said he once met with David Taggart and outside accountants
who were auditing PTL when Taggart explained that he took large cash
advances on ministry credit cards because he served as the ``bank''
when the Bakkers traveled.
   Don Hardister, who was Bakker's bodyguard for seven years,
testified that David Taggart once carried $25,000 in a briefcase on
a trip with the Bakkers.
   ``You've got to realize there were 10 to 15 people who were
getting expenses from that money,'' said Hardister, one of seven
defense witnesses to testify Monday afternoon. ``I got $5,000 to
$7,000 of that amount for my staff.''
   Bakker, Hardister said, lived an opulent lifestyle and insisted
on carrying $1,000 in cash in his billfold at all times. He said it
was Taggart's responsibility to make sure Bakker always had 10 $100
bills.
   The prosecution's final witness, Internal Revenue Service agent
Charles Mauney, said David and James Taggart used $150,000 in cash
advances on PTL credit cards and $140,000 in ministry checks for
their personal expenses in 1985.
   Mauney said the government did not challenge an additional
$320,000 in questionable PTL payments made to the brothers in 1984
and 1985.
   For 1984, Mauney testified, the Taggarts did not pay any taxes on
$48,000 in additional income. The goverment decided not to challenge
$208,000 on cash advances on PTL credit cards, PTL checks used to
pay off the defendants' personal credit card accounts and the use of
PTL credit cards to purchase personal items.
   Mauney said the Taggarts had $523,354 in unreported taxable
income in 1986 and $260,000 in 1987.
   He testified the total unreported taxable income for the two
brother was $1.2 million ffrom 1984 to 1987. David Taggart owed
$264,911 in back taxes; James Taggart owed $260,576.
   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as piano
players. Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, was promoted to
Bakker's top personal aide and James Taggart, 35, became PTL's
interior decorator.
   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the television
ministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987 following
revelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.
   Beginning July 5, testimony from dozens of New York shopkeepers
and friends of the Taggarts showed the defendants went on spending
sprees in the most exclusive stores in New York, Florida, California
and Europe.
   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts also used money donated to the
tax-exempt ministry to buy a $640,000 condominium in New York's
exclusive Trump Tower.
   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in
prison and face fines totaling more than $1 million.
   Bakker and Dortch are scheduled to go on trial in Charlotte on
Aug. 28 on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.

   The United States should pursue travel to
other planets rather than joint space ventures with the Soviet
Union, Alan Shepard, the first American in space, said Monday.
   Shepard, one of 12 Americans to walk on the moon, disagreed with
Apollo 11 moonwalker Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, who said Saturday during
a trip to Huntsville that America should pursue joint missions with
the Soviet Union and possibly Japan.
   Shepard on Monday visited the Space and Rocket Center, a tourist
attraction, for festivities celebrating the 20th anniversary of
America's moon landing.
   Speaking from what he described as an engineering perspective
rather than a political one, Shepard said: ``I would rather see us
develop the technology to have planetary travel _ manned and
unmanned. I think our space technology level, in general, is ahead
of the Soviets.''
   He said the United States should find things other than
technology to share with the Soviet Union.
   Shepard rode a Huntsville-built Redstone rocket into space on May
5, 1961, as the American space program rushed to catch the Soviets.
   After recovering from an inner ear disorder that temporarily
grounded him, Shepard returned to space in February 1971 on Apollo
14 and became the fifth man to walk on the moon.
   Shepard said his first trip, though brief, remains his favorite.
   Pointing to a model of the Redstone rocket at the Space and
Rocket Center, he said, ``From the standpoint of pure gut
excitement, obviously riding that baby for the first time had to
take the prize.''
   Turning to his moon trip, Shepard said his famous swing at a golf
ball on the moon's surface was not spontaneous, as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration made it appear at the time.
   ``We practiced in the suit. We worked out all the safety
aspects,'' he said.
   Now 65, Shepard lives in Houston, where he is a commercial real
estate developer.

<HEAD>Philippine Aid Increased by Subcommittee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee Monday evening approved a
$14.4 billion spending bill for military, economic and development
aid to foreign countries after boosting money for a ``mini-Marshall
plan'' for the Philippines.
   The Appropriations Committee's foreign operations panel added $30
million to the Philippines aid program, called the Multilateral
Assistance Initiative, bringing the total proposed U.S. share to
$160 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   But that total still was $40 million below the amount Secretary
of State James A. Baker III pledged for the program at a recent
Tokyo meeting with other nations participating in the development
effort.
   In another concession to the Bush administration, subcommittee
chairman Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., shifted $128 million from a
variety of development programs to military aid grants. But the
resulting total of $4.6 billion for military aid still fell well
below Bush's request of $5 billion.
   The measure also was altered to earmark $15 million to pay for a
package of incentives Bush announced last week in Budapest to
encourage economic and political reforms in Hungary.
   ``I think we have made a considerable amount of progress,'' said
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who got into an argument with Obey
when the panel met last week and broke up without acting on the bill.
   As usual, Israel and Egypt get the lion's share of U.S. aid as a
continuing reward for their agreement to the Camp David peace
process. Israel would get about $3 billion in military and economic
aid, Egypt about $2 billion.
   Money for the Export-Import bank, which subsidizes overseas sales
of big-ticket items like airplanes for U.S. manufacturers, was cut
by $60 million to $615 million.
   The bill must be approved by the full committe before action by
the House.

   Typhoon Gordon ripped signs from buildings,
knocked down trees and blew scaffolding off buildings Tuesday,
injuring 31 people, authorities in this British colony said.
   Packing winds that gusted up to 115 mph, the storm earlier forced
troops to evacuate thousands of Vietnamese refugees from tent camps.
   The storm killed 15 people and left thousands homeless in the
Philippines. It also caused close to $20 million in damage in that
country, officials said.
   Schools, courts and banks in Hong Kong were closed and more than
70 flights were delayed at Hong Kong airport. Several roads were
blocked by fallen debris or dangerously dangling signs.
   State-run radio said most of the 31 injured were hit by debris
falling from buildings. None were reported in serious condition.
   On Monday, the army evacuated about 11,000 Vietnamese boat people
from tent camps to emergency accomodations. Thousands of workers
were allowed to leave work early and jammed subways and buses as
they tried to get home.
   Tuesday morning, Hong Kong's normally bustling streets were
empty. Few cars or pedestrians were on the roads. Firemen evacuated
some families from low-lying areas because of flooding.
   The observatory said Gordon was the strongest typhoon to take aim
at the colony this year, and it predicted the storm would dump at
least 4 inches of rain Tuesday.
   Ferry service between between Hong Kong and Kowloon peninsula as
well as to outlying islands was suspended. Ferries between between
Hong Kong and the neighboring Portuguese territory of Macao also
halted service.
   Fishing junks sought shelter behind seawalls in the harbor.
   Most public transport ground to a halt, and the government opened
up 78 typhoon shelters for residents seeking refuge from the strong
wind.
   On some outlying islands, farmers fought against time as they
attempted to harvest their fields. About 12 people were rescued from
one outlying island after a crane collapsed on a stone house.
   In the Philippines, Gordon killed at least 15 people and left
thousands homeless before roaring across Luzon Island into the South
China Sea, officials said.
   The government's Office of Civil Defense said the dead included
at least eight children swept away by floodwaters of the Amburayan
River, near Bangar, 160 miles north of Manila.
   Nine other people were reported missing in the Bangar area,
official said.
   Four others were killed when heavy rain triggered landslides near
the mountain resort of Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.
   In the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan, officials said more than
1,500 families fled their homes to escape flood waters and more than
1,400 homes were destroyed.
   Crop damage in the two provinces was estimated at $15.8 million.
A bridge linking the two provinces also was heavily damaged by the
typhoon, officials said.
   Gordon was the strongest typhoon to strike the Philippines this
year. It slammed into Luzon, the main Philippines island, early
Sunday with winds of up to 116 mph.
   Meanwhile, strong winds and heavy rain whipped up by a second
tropical storm buffeted Manila and the western coast of Luzon,
hampering rescue operations from Typhoon Gordon.
   Tropical Storm Hope was reported Monday about 490 miles
east-northeast of Batanes, the country's northernmost province, and
was headed toward Japan's Ryukyu Islands at 12 mph with maximum
winds of 47 mph.
   Although the storm was well north of the Philippines, the
government weather service said it triggered monsoon storms that
drenched Manila and other areas of Luzon with heavy rain.
   Philippine Airlines canceled two domestic flights because of
Monday's storm, and major highways linking Manila with northern
Luzon were impassable because of floods.

<HEAD>Graddick Aides Plead To Reduced Charge, One Says Graddick Approved
Bugging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY REEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two aides to a former state attorney
general pleaded guilty Monday to charges stemming from his 1986
gubernatorial battle, with one saying the candidate approved the use
of state equipment to spy on political foes.
   Andy Yeomans, who admitted to a misdemeanor charge of aiding in
the use of state-owned property for political purposes, said former
state Attorney General Charlie Graddick endorsed electronic
surveillance at state Democratic Party headquarters and at a
telephone bank run by Graddick's opponent in the 1986 Democratic
runoff, then-Lt. Gov. Bill Baxley.
   Yeomans' co-defendant, Don Bekurs, pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor charge of misapplying state property. Bekurs was accused
of taking eavesdropping equipment from the attorney general's
office, while Yeomans was accused of implementing the bugging.
   Graddick, an investment banker who is considering a return to the
political arena in 1990, did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment Monday. He previously has denied wrongdoing in his
campaign.
   District Attorney Jimmy Evans declined comment on whether charges
were being considered against Graddick, who reportedly is thinking
about a campaign for lieutenant governor or attorney general.
   Yeomans and Bekurs, a former assistant to Graddick, had been
scheduled to go on trial Monday on felony theft charges stemming
from the use of the state-owned bugging equipment.
   Yeomans reached a plea-bargain agreement with prosecutors before
the trial began, and Bekurs' plea to the reduced charge came after a
jury was seated.
   Yeomans told reporters after his guilty plea that Graddick
approved of using state-owned electronic bugging equipment at
Democratic Party headquarters and at a telephone bank operated by a
firm he said was working for Baxley.
   Yeomans said workers at the phone bank called people and asked
them such questions as whether they knew certain candidates were
endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, but they never mentioned Baxley.
   Baxley, a Birmingham attorney, acknowledged having a phone bank
during the race but denied any political trickery.
   ``The Graddick folks are the ones who did all that kind of
stuff,'' said Baxley.
   Yeomans said that although Graddick never listened to any of the
tapes made in the bugging operations, aides kept him informed about
what was overheard.
   The battle between Baxley and Graddick helped spell victory for
Republican Guy Hunt, who trounced Baxley in the general election to
become Alabama's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.
   Yeomans, a private detective in Birmingham, faces a maximum
penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine. However, his
attorney, David Cromwell Johnson of Birmingham, said prosecutors
would recommend only a $50 fine.
   Bekurs could be sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000,
but there was no word on a possible sentence to be recommended by
Evans' office.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican and Poland restored full
diplomatic ties on Monday, the first such relations between the Holy
See and one of the Warsaw Pact countries that tried to muzzle
organized religion after World War II.
   The move comes two months after Poland's Parliament granted legal
recognition to the Roman Catholic Church, following 15 years of
permanent working contacts between the Holy See and the communist
government.
   The communists broke diplomatic relations when they came to power
in 1945. Monday's announcement, made by the Vatican and Poland's
state-run news agency, set ties at the ambassadorial level.
   Polish-born Pope John Paul II, who himself negotiated with
Poland's communist rulers when he served as archbishop and cardinal
of Krakow, disclosed a week ago that he planned to send an envoy to
Poland soon, an indication that restoriation of relations was near.
   In overwhelmingly Catholic Poland, the news was hailed by both
church and government.
   Stefan Staniszewski, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said it
``is a very important fact that crowns a long process of
normalization of relations between the state and the church.''
   The Polish government sought diplomatic ties with Rome to improve
its standing at home and abroad. For a while some Polish bishops
reportedly had opposed the idea, fearing the government would go
directly to the Vatican to deal with church-state issues.
   But on Monday, the bishops expressed ``the deep conviction that a
proper development of relations will influence the realization of
citizens' rights in Poland and open a new field of church activities
with benefits for the whole society.''
   The re-establishment of ties marked one of the greatest successes
of the Vatican's policy of ``ostpolitik,'' which has sought to win
concessions for the church by a cautious dialogue with communist
officials.
   The church has also seen major improvements in its relations with
Hungary and the Soviet Union since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
instituted his reforms.
   The pope is planning a visit in 1991 to Hungary, which recently
expressed interest in diplomatic ties with the Holy See. Gorbachev
is expected to meet the pope during a trip to Italy this fall.
   Such dialogue would have been nearly unthinkable after World War
II, when officially atheistic communist governments tried to
suppress the church.
   In Poland, the regime confiscated property, arrested priests and
placed Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski under house arrest during the
Stalinist era.
   Conditions eased for the church when party leader Wladyslaw
Gomulka relaxed controls in 1956. Pope John Paul II, then Bishop
Karol Wojtyla, went on to play a key role in formulating the Polish
church's moderate but firm demands for religious freedom in
communist countries.
   In recent years, the church has played a key political role in
Poland.
   It was instrumental in arranging the negotiations between
Poland's communist authorities and the opposition that led to an
historic April accord on political and economic reform.
   The church also maintains close links with Solidarity, the first
independent labor movement in the East bloc. John Paul has been an
outspoken supporter of the union federation, which was legalized in
April after a seven-year ban.
   The pope has closely followed political events in his homeland,
requesting detailed reports, giving instructions to Poland's church
hierarchy and discussing the political situation with Polish bishops.
   While the presence in Poland of a papal nuncio, or ambassador,
was not expected to have a major effect on day-to-day church
affairs, the nuncio will likely have strong symbolic importance.
   He will be a reminder to the government of its promises, and a
symbol of an institution considered to have far broader popular
support than the communist government.
   There was no immediate announcement on the name of the Vatican
envoy. There has been speculation it could be Archbishop Gabriel
Montalvo, a Colombian who is papal nuncio to Yugoslavia.
   Poland was Christianized in 966 and has always considered itself
a bulwark of Western Christianity in the East. The church kept alive
Polish identity in the centuries when the country was split among
Russians, Austrians and Prussians before 1918.
   In June 1987, during the last of his three papal trips to Poland,
the pontiff declared it was ``abnormal'' for a predominantly
Catholic country to lack full ties with the Vatican. The Holy See
has relations with 117 other countries.
   Non-aligned Yugoslavia is the only communist country in Eastern
Europe with Vatican ties. The Vatican also has full relations with
Cuba.
   The last papal ambassador to Poland left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939,
at the outbreak of World War II.

   A Quebec Superior Court judge on Monday
upheld an injunction won by a pregnant woman's ex-boyfriend
preventing her from having an abortion.
   ``A conceived child that is not yet born is a human being under
Article 1 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms,'' and has
the right to life guaranteed every person, said Justice Jacques
Viens.
   He said the mother, Chantal Daigle, faced a difficult and painful
problem, but that the court had to rule in favor of the fetus.
   ``I feel like a victim,'' said Ms. Daigle, 21. ``I still have
hope and it is still my choice. ... I have more rights than a
20-week-old fetus.''
   Her lawyer planned to appeal the ruling Wednesday. Ms. Daigle
told reporters outside the courthouse that she will wait until the
appeal is heard before taking action on the abortion.
   Ms. Daigle's ex-boyfriend, Jean-Guy Tremblay, 25, hugged his
lawyer and anti-abortionists who had come to the courthouse to hear
the judgment.
   ``I intend to raise the child but with her,'' said Tremblay, who
won the injunction in the superior court July 7.
   Henri Kelada, a lawyer representing Tremblay, said the ruling
will have ``an impact on doctors giving abortions, and women will be
more cautious about getting pregnant.''
   Ms. Daigle's lawyer, Daniel Bedard, said the ruling, if not
overturned on appeal, will mean that anyone can intervene on behalf
of the fetus and say that it has rights.
   ``This means no more abortions and means women will have to be
silent,'' he said.
   Bedard had argued that the judge's job is to ``apply the law, not
create it.'' He said the injunction should be quashed since there is
no law to base it on.
   The Supreme Court of Canada last year struck down the country's
abortion law, which permitted abortions under certain conditions.
Canada now has now criminal law governing abortion.
   The case is the third of its kind this month to grab headlines
and re-ignite the abortion debate in Canada.
   In Toronto last week, Barbara Dodd had an abortion hours after
the Ontario Supreme Court quashed an injunction obtained by her
ex-boyfriend, Greg Murphy. In Winnipeg, a 20-year-old single mother
had an abortion shortly after a July 6 court decision struck down an
injunction obtained by the woman's ex-boyfriend.

<HEAD>East Germany Warns Against West Germany's Republican Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany said Monday that if the West German
government includes the ultrarightist Republican party in a ruling
coalition the move might pave the way for ``Hitler's successor.''
   Neues Deutschland, the official daily of East Germany's Communist
Party, called on West Germany to outlaw the party, which made strong
showings in regional elections in recent months.
   ``Whoever trivializes the danger of neo-Nazis or even considers
the neo-Nazis as future partners in a coalition must reckon with
being seen in the world as paving the way for Hitler's successor,''
Neues Deutschland, said.
   The Republicans, led by former Nazi SS trooper Franz Schoenhuber,
concentrate on nationalist themes. They advocate stiff reductions in
the number of asylum-seekers allowed to stay in West Germany and
strict limits on foreign workers.
   Schoenhuber has said his party speaks out for German interests
and supports constitutional law.
   Earlier this month, West German Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said membership in right-wing extremist groups last year
increased 12.8 percent in the nation of 61 million and may have
surpassed 30,000.
   The Republicans earlier this year gained seats in local
legislatures in West Berlin and Frankfurt and won six seats in the
European Parliament on June 18.
   Most of the party's gains were at the expense of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union and its
Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union.
   Kohl's Christian Democrats have expressed concern about national
elections scheduled for December 1990 but say they rule out forming
a coalition with the Republicans as a means of staying in power.
   Schoenhuber, however, added to speculation about a possible
coalition by saying at a recent party meeting ``we are in the
fortunate position of being a wanted bride and not a flirting
bridegroom.''
   Neues Deutschland claimed that a ``debate'' about a
conservative-Republican coalition showed West Germany has not come
to terms with German's Nazi past.
   ``It is clear that the ideology of Nazism, chauvinism, the racism
between the Rhein and Elbe (rivers), North Sea and the Alps has a
noticeable basis,'' the newspaper said, referring to key boundary
lines in West Germany.
   Schaeuble has said West German officials will meet in September
to determine if the Republican Party should be labeled an extremist
organization. If it should be ruled extremist the party could be
kept under surveillance by the Verfassungschutz, the country's main
domestic intelligence agency.

   Archaeologists using radar mapping Monday
found subtle signs of underground disturbances that could be the
century-old remains of the victims of admitted cannibal Alferd
Packer.
   ``We don't have for you the knife in the bone, but we have subtle
indications that we are in the right place,'' said James Starrs, a
George Washington University law professor heading the expedition.
   As residents and reporters watched, 13 archaelogists and other
scientists looked for clues to determine how the five gold seekers
died during the bitter winter of 1874 and whether their remains were
consumed by Packer.
   The search concentrated on a 50-by-50 foot section of Deadman's
Gulch where it is believed the bodies of the five men were buried.
The equipment detects rocks, depressions and other anomalies by
shooting radar beams underground.
   Starrs said a ``rather demonstrable blip'' was detected near the
suspected graves.
   ``It's subtle, but after years of looking at this type of data, I
feel confident there has been some disturbance in the area,'' said
engineer Stan Smith, who conducted the radar mapping.
   The scientists plan to begin digging Tuesday in areas singled out
through radar mapping.
   Starrs is 90 percent sure that the bones of the victims lie
beneath a boulder roughly marking the gravesite in the gulch, which
lies between Cannibalism Plateau and Round Top Mountain about 2
miles south of Lake City.
   A grave marker honors the five men ``who were murdered on this
spot early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources
of the San Juan country.''
   Packer, a harness maker from Utah, led the party of five into the
San Juan Mountains in search for gold. He told authorities in April
1874 that Shannon Bell, a member of his party, killed the others
with a hatchet while Packer was away from camp, looking for an
escape route from the mountains.
   Packer said he killed Bell in self defense and that he was forced
to eat the remains of the other victims to survive.
   Packer escaped from custody, but was captured in 1883 in
Cheyenne, Wyo. He was convicted of killing one of the prospectors,
but that sentence was overturned by the Colorado Supreme Court.
   He was retried for all five murders, convicted of manslaughter
and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was paroled in 1901 and died
April 24, 1907.
   In the years to follow, Packer's admitted cannibalism provided
plenty of joke fodder and made him a bizarre folk-hero in Colorado
and the United States.
   Although Starrs is confident the group will locate the bones,
Walter Birkby, curator of physical anthropology at the Arizona State
Museum in Tucson who is on the dig, said he was unsure whether there
were any bones to find.
   The dig differs from usual practices of archaeologists, who tend
to be secretive about the location and progress of their research.
However, Starrs said his goal to raise $10,000 to fund the
expedition has not been reached, so he and his assistants have
encouraged press coverage of the event.
   Starrs assembled a team of anthropologists, archaeologists and
pathologists for his expedition near Lake City, about 170 miles
southwest of Denver.
   Starrs believes the bones will be in good condition.
   ``From the bones we will be able to see bullet holes and
hatchmarks where the skinning knife might have scraped the bones.
We'll be able to tell if the victims were cannibalized, if they were
struck by a hatchet blow, if they were really near starvation,''
Starrs said.
   The group has set aside this week to search for the bones. Later
this month, its findings will be sent to the Arizona State Museum at
Tucson for analysis.
   Next month, Starrs plans to rebury the bones and restore the
gravesite. The results of the expedition are scheduled to be
released early next year.
   As the scientists worked, about two dozen residents watched while
sitting in lawn chairs with coolers packed with refreshments.
   Most were amused by the expedition and one joked that he thought
the group probably would unearth Elvis Presley belt buckles instead
of bones.
   One resident, Byrne Smith, said he believed that Shannon Bell,
one of the gold seekers, killed his companions and was later killed
himself by Packer.
   ``I don't disagree that Packer probably was a liar, but I'm not
sure he was literate and he might have signed a confession he
couldn't read,'' Smith said. ``It will be interesting to find out if
there is any corroborating evidence because there are so many
stories.''

<TEXT>
   A retired colonel testifying in the spy
trial of a Turkish man said Monday a U.S. soldier accused in the
case attracted attention at an Army base by buying an expensive car
for cash.
   Retired Col. Kenneth Roney's testimony came on the opening day of
the U.S. District Court trial of Huseyin Yildirim, 61, who is
accused of scheming with Army Warrant Officer James William Hall III
to provide military secrets to the Soviets and East Germans.
   Roney said then-Sgt. Hall was ``singled out'' to him at Field
Station Berlin in Germany in 1986 because he owned a $21,000 1985
Volvo 760 GLE. Roney, the base's commander, was considering buying
the car.
   Questioned about the effects of the alleged conspiracy, Roney
said he noticed toward the end of his command that there was a drop
in the amount of material coming to the Berlin listening base from
Eastern bloc sources.
   Yildirim, who worked as a civilian mechanic on an Army base in
Berlin, was identified in court documents as the man Hall identified
as his conduit of classified national defense documents to East
German agents.
   Hall, in the Army since 1976, spent most of his career in Europe,
working as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and
code messages.
   Prosecutors said Roney's testimony was important because it
showed apparent excessive spending by Hall, who made $20,000 a year.
   In opening arguments earlier in the day, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Fred Kramer talked about military tensions between the East and the
West, and said NATO forces are vastly outnumbered.
   ``What is required to equalize the balance is information,''
Kramer said after jury selection was completed. ``Intelligence in
the modern world is not James Bond stuff. It never was.''
   The trial is being held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest.
   Kramer said for the first time that Hall, who was court-martialed
earlier this year, will be a government witness against Yildirim.
   In his opening argument, Yildirim's attorney, Lamar Walter, said
his client ``did not participate in this conspiracy to the extent he
should be charged.''
   ``I know some of you read spy novels. You never know what the
conclusion is until you read the last chapter,'' Walter told the
jury, adding that Hall did most of the work.
   Yildirim, who has been held in seclusion since his arrest at his
Belleair Beach, Fla., home in December, speaks little English and
was accompanied by an interpreter in the courtroom.
   Hall, 30, an intelligence analyst in the 24th Infantry Division,
was court- martialed at Fort McNair near Washington, D.C., in March,
and pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage
and failing to obey Army regulations.
   He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, fined $50,000 and
dishonorably discharged.
   Yildirim is charged with conspiring with Hall to provide
classified information from 1983 to 1988. Hall was named as an
unindicted co-conspirator in the civilian indictment.
   Army intelligence experts said the operation funneled information
about the West's electronic eavesdropping capabilities to East
German and Soviet agents for more than six years. They said the case
appeared to have inflicted serious damage to surveillance efforts in
Europe.
   Army officials began investigating last summer after being tipped
that Hall, recently promoted from staff sergeant to warrant officer,
was living above his military salary of $20,200.
   Hall admitted to Army officials he received more than $100,000
from 1983 to 1988 to provide classified documents to Eastern bloc
agents.

   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony
Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   There, Bush will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.

   A lucrative consulting business as a registered
foreign agent helped fuel the lavish lifestyle of Craig J. Spence,
the flamboyant lobbyist now under investigation in Washington's male
prostitution scandal.
   Justice Department records show that Spence, a former television
reporter with political connections in the Orient, was paid
thousands of dollars by Japanese business and political interests in
the 1980s to open the right doors in Washington for his clients.
   Spence, 48, has been linked by The Washington Times to a
homosexual prostitution ring that is under investigation by U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens and the Secret Service.
   The Times, citing credit card records, reported that Spence spent
as much as $20,000 a month on male escort services run by the ring,
which was raided by police in February. It also quoted unidentified
male prostitutes and others as saying Spence had his house bugged.

threatening to cloud the goodwill message their leaders want to send.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, who was to meet
Tuesday with a federal judge in Virginia and hoped to show the
miners' desire to return to work, called for an end to unauthorized
pickets and a monthlong wildcat strike.
   Most UMW locals east of the Mississippi River met during the

   Maine lobstermen are laying three times as
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in
test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't
increased in 20 years.
   Marine biologists from the University of Maine and Bigelow
Laboratory in West Boothbay are conducting a 10-day research cruise
next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual
catch.
   The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist
biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation
will lead to bigger catches.
   Lobster production is vital to Maine's economy, not least because
of its contribution to tourism.

   Paul Adams says he has James Watt to thank _ or
blame _ for the spotlight the low-key inspector general at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development finds himself under

   ``News is driven by personalities,'' Adams said last week. ``I
think absent Jim Watt this thing would have been quickly forgotten.
He's such a controversial individual, a lightning rod.''
   Adams finds himself ensnarled in controversy as the problems at
the multibillion-dollar agency during the Reagan administration come
under scrutiny by Congress, the Justice Department and new HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Adams and his investigators and auditors reported several years
ago on many of the abuses now under investigation. Some of those
doing the investigating, particularly members of Congress, say Adams
should have done more to bring attention to the problems.

   Randall Dale Adams refuses to let bitterness
spoil his enjoyment of freedom, even though he served 12{ years in
prison and came within three days of being executed for a murder he
didn't commit.
   ``I hate what happened,'' said Adams, 40, freed in March from a
Texas prison after an appeals court set aside his conviction. ``But
each day is like being granted another day to walk upon the Earth
and bring peace to my family.
   ``If I did hold feelings of bitterness or revenge, I will ruin
whatever future I do have. If you come within three days of being
executed, you better know who you are and you better throw your
animosities out the window.''
   Adams was convicted in the 1976 shooting death of a Dallas police
officer. The case was documented in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which questioned the testimony of prosecution witnesses including
David Ray Harris, who is on death row in Texas for another killing.
In the film, Harris virtually confessed to the 1976 shooting.

   The radar-evading B-2
stealth bomber took its maiden flight over the Mojave Desert on
Monday, impressing its pilots while crowds cheered and political
debate intensified over the costly plane's fate.
   ``If we appear a little giggly about all of this, it was a lot of

   The nearly two-hour flight appeared flawless to people who
watched the sinister-looking flying wing take off from
secrecy-shrouded Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale shortly after 6:30
a.m. and land at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.
   The four-engine bomber, built with advanced composite materials
and a shape that are not easily detectable by radar, flew at 10,000
feet over the Antelope Valley at three speeds, accompanied by two
F-16 fighters through a clear sky.

``I hope to be able to testify at the appropriate time.''

protection in refusing to testify. Other witnesses in the

   Scientists began radar mapping part of
``Deadman's Gulch'' on Monday in an attempt to find the century-old
bones of five gold seekers and determine whether they were victims
of admitted cannibal Alferd Packer.
   Under the watchful eyes of residents and reporters, 13
archaelogists and other scientists looked for clues to learn how the
five men died during the bitter winter of 1874 and whether their
remains were consumed by Packer.
   James Starrs, a George Washington University law professor who is
heading the expedition, is 90 percent sure that the bones of the
victims lie beneath a boulder roughly marking the gravesite in the
gulch, which lies between Cannibalism Plateau and Round Top Mountain
about two miles south of Lake City.
   A grave marker honors the five men ``who were murdered on this
spot early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources

   As much as Godzilla stomps buildings and eats
telephone wires, he'll never measure up to Ultraman, the benevolent
bug-faced alien who's spent 23 years battling bizarre monsters from
outer space.
   Noboru Tsuburaya says the time has come for audiences around the
world to see the other side of his father, Eiji Tsuburaya, the man
who created the reptillian Godzilla, Japan's most infamous movie
monster.
   That other side is Ultraman, who Tsuburaya says is still the
ultimate Japanese superhero, and the special-effect wizard's most
important legacy.
   ``Ultraman will be a much greater hit than Godzilla ever was,''
said the younger Tsuburaya, now president of the production company
that owns rights to the superhero.
   So confident is the 53-year-old Tsuburaya, that he is preparing
to set Ultraman loose in the most difficult market of all _ the
United States. A new 13-part series is to be syndicated next year by
New York-based Teletrib.
   ``America is the home of the entertainment industry, and though
Japan exports material goods, it lags behind in pop culture,'' he
said. ``Ultraman will change that pattern.''
   Rights to broadcast an old Ultraman spin-off series in North
America have been purchased by Turner Broadcasting System, and
translation of the dialogue has already been completed. Ultraman
will also be shown in the European market, primarily France, later
this year.
   And just who is this Ultraman and what is his story?
   Ultraman and other inhabitants of several planets in the M78 star
cluster have been sent to protect Earth from attack by
interplanetary intruders and Earth-born mutants, which range from
giant crayfish to fluffy snowmen.
   Many of the monsters come from Tokyo Bay, making the series a
statement against pollution and radiation, Tsuburaya said. ``The
monsters aren't all bad, but the wasteful, polluting people who
created them are.''
   Each installment ends with spectacular fights, usually in drab
industrial areas in Tokyo with lots of buildings to smash and
electric lines to break, after Ultraman transforms himself into a
130-foot, 35,000-ton giant.
   For the animated export to America, Tsuburaya has elaborated on
his father's idea, having a Stars-and-Stripes clad Ultraman enter a
special base through Abraham Lincoln's mouth in Mount Rushmore.
   Aside from the cosmetic changes, the Ultraman story is universal,
Tsuburaya said. ``He is a Japanese superhero and an international
superhero.''
   After debuting on the Tokyo Broadcasting System network in July
1966, the Ultraman series was followed by seven spinoffs, including
``Ultra Seven,'' ``Ultraman Returns'' and the animated ``Ultraman
80,'' which went off the air in 1981. The network still airs weekly
reruns.
   Over the years, Ultraman and his ultrarelatives have done battle
with more than 600 monsters, including Godzilla.
   ``But the TV producers had to promise to change the monster's
name and design to get permission to use the Godzilla suit from the
movie studio which owns his rights,'' Tsuburaya said. Ultraman, of
course, won the fight.
   Like Superman's problem with kryptonite, Ultraman has a weakness:
as a giant he burns up energy at an incredible pace and can only
remain ultrasized for three minutes at a time.
   Myojo Foods used that shortcoming in TV ads starring Ultraman to
promote its three-minute instant noodles. The superhero has also
endorsed a bank and publicized a booklet on national defense.
   Tsuburuya says sales of Ultraman products, including diapers,
chopsticks, golf bags and cigarette lighters, have quadrupled over
the last three years.
   ``Sales of Ultraman goods alone annually bring in revenues in the
1 billion yen ($7.6 million) range,'' he said. ``If he's a hit in
America, that could easily increase by one digit.''
   In March, Ultraman starred in three Tokyo Broadcasting System
television specials _ a movie, a prime-time dramatization of how he
was created and a the-making-of-Ultraman documentary.
   Tsuburaya has other big plans for Ultraman.
   He envisions a theme park where a 330-foot Ultraman will beam his
smile _ and cable TV signals _ over the surrounding countryside.

   Linda Leary was president of civic groups and
donated time to causes _ to all appearances a well-to-do,
community-minded woman.
   One son, Paul Heilbrunn, was a commodities broker and columnist
for a local business journal. The other, Richard Heilbrunn, lived on
a farm outside town.
   But all three now are being held in an Austrian jail, fighting
extradition to face charges they ran a marijuana-smuggling ring so
big that authorities say the people hired to count money were told
to not bother with $1 bills.
   Leary and her sons left the United States in 1985, two years
before their November 1987 indictment. They weren't arrested until
May _ Leary was released but re-arrested this month after the U.S.
government protested _ and attorneys on both sides of the case say
it could be years before they are tried.
   ``At this point it's completely in the hands of the Austrian
government,'' said Deputy U.S. Attorney John Thar. ``Obviously, I
would feel better if I were in control, but that's just the way it
is.''
   Thirty-four people were named in the 136-page indictment
outlining what federal authorities said was one of the largest
marijuana-smuggling rings ever uncovered. It allegedly touched 11
states and moved at least 250,000 pounds of marijuana; employees
counted as much as $15 million at a time.
   The family knew it was under investigation _ Paul Heilbrunn had
testified before a grand jury _ so ``it wasn't terribly surprising
that they fled,'' said U.S. Attorney Deborah Daniels. ``Anybody that
has that much money and knows there is an investigation is a likely
flight suspect.''
   Daniels and her staff bided their time, waiting for officials in
Washington to process hundreds of pages of documents at the Justice
Department, translate them into German and move them through the
State Department to Austria.
   The three were first arrested May 24 in Austria under the
International Convention of Narcotics. There is no U.S.-Austria
extradition agreement.
   ``They had no indication they were going to be taken into
custody,'' said Bernard L. Pylitt, an Indianapolis attorney
representing Leary. ``I have no idea what the Austrian government is
going to do in this case.''
   Paul Heilbrunn, who shares a home near Salzburg with his wife and
two children, ``believes if he returns to the United States he will
not get a fair trial,'' said Linda Pence, his attorney here. ``The
attitude toward drugs is such that it clouds everyone's minds as to
guilt and innocence.''
   ``We're very hopeful the Austrians will give them their
release,'' Pence said. ``Paul did not flee, he did not leave that
country at all. He knew an extradition request was pending. He's not
going to flee.''
   Pylitt and Pence said they did not know if Richard had an
attorney here.
   Leary and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of
federal authorities, but to all appearances they were unlikely
criminals.
   Leary, 58, had been president of the Indianapolis League of Women
Voters and the local chapter of the National Council of Jewish
Women. She was ``an outstanding community citizen,'' said Robert
Davies, a family attorney who was acquitted in March of
money-laundering and conspiracy in the case.
   ``She did a lot of things for the community. She was in every
organization,'' Davies said. ``She was in leadership positions. She
gave the position of being a well-to-do, community-spirited person.''
   Paul Heilbrunn, 35, was a ``very charming, bright guy,'' Davies
added.
   However, authorities say Paul led the ring in partnership with a
man Thar identified as Jeffrey B. Collins, an escapee from a Florida
Prison. Richard was one of three lieutenants immediately under the
two partners, Thar said. Leary helped manage money laundered by
dummy companies in the Bahamas and Panama.
   The indictment says the ring imported at least 140,000 pounds of
pot in 1985 alone, storing it on a farm in northern Indiana and near
Ann Arbor, Mich. When robbers stole 6,000 pounds from the farm,
eight employees were given voice stress tests. The loss ultimately
was absorbed by the Heilbrunns, Collins and unindicted
co-conspirators Richard I. Bernstein and Charles E. Stocksdale.
   The ring operated in Indiana, California, Connecticut,
Washington, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida,
Michigan and Virginia, according to the indictment.
   Leary faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to distribute
marijuana, money-laundering and interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering. Paul faces 26 counts, including conspiracy to import
and distribute marijuana and running a continuing criminal
enterprise. Richard, 38, faces nine counts.
   However, they could not be prosecuted on 21 tax-related charges
if they are extradited under provisions of the International
Convention of Narcotics. Eight of Leary's counts are tax-related, as
are 10 of Paul's and three of Richard's.
   ``We're in the waiting process,'' said Daniels, who nonetheless
is happy with other results in the drawn-out case.
   ``I think we've been real successful. We've convicted everyone
we've gotten our hands on. The people who've fled to Austria, there
was nothing we could do to stop that, and we have every reason to
believe they'll be extradited.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans think they have a promising target
in challenging what they call the permanent Congress _ even though
the numbers show a turnover rate that doesn't match their
description.
   Those records of changing House membership and high re-election
rates indicate that Republican problems go deeper than the incumbent
re-election advantages now under GOP fire.
   It is true that House incumbents have the advantage when they
seek new terms, and that they almost always have. Those odds
confront the GOP minority with a particular problem, but it is not
new business. House incumbents usually have won, from the beginning.
The incumbent return rate was overwhelming 35 years ago, in the last
elections that awarded the Republicans control of the House.
   ``Today, incumbents stay in office for decades, amassing huge war
chests to scare off strong challenges in election after election,''
President Bush said in proposing legislation to overhaul campaign
finance laws and curb free congressional mailing privileges. ``This
is not democracy at all.''
   But Speaker Thomas S. Foley counters with records showing the
shifting makeup of a House in which 55 percent of the seats are held
by people elected since 1980. Only 19 percent of House members were
in office 15 years ago.
   Besides, he adds with a smile, what's wrong with incumbency and
experience in Congress? After all, they're valued in other lines of
work.
   The re-election rate for incumbents is overwhelming, 98.3 percent
in 1988, 98 percent in 1986. But it was 97 percent in the 1968
elections, and it has been over 90 percent in every election but one
for the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Research
Service of the Library of Congress. Nor has the number of incumbents
seeking re-election changed markedly; it has ranged between 85 and
95 percent in most 20th Century elections.
   ``As long as we retain 99 percent re-election of incumbents,
we're going to have scoundrels, because power does corrupt,'' Rep.
Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said in a speech on
that GOP theme. ``How many of you think the founding fathers
intended for Congress to be a lifetime event, unless you're
incredibly corrupt or stupid or you happen to die? Otherwise you're
just re-elected automatically.''
   Some of those founding fathers were still around when the rate of
return for House incumbents seeking re-election hit its record high:
100 percent, in the elections of 1792.
   In the 1952 elections, the last time Republicans won control of
the House, 91 percent of the members who sought re-election won new
terms. When they lost it in 1954, the incumbent re-election rate was
93.1 percent.
   The advantages of incumbency have grown in the era of television,
political action committees and exploding campaign costs. But the
Library of Congress numbers show trends that have been fairly stable
since World War II.
   The numbers do not dampen the rhetoric.
   ``I think there's a growing prairie fire out there where people
are going to rise up and say `Hey, we'd like these elections back in
our hands,' '' said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, who heads the
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. ``We'd like a House of
the people again instead of the house of incumbents which it has
become.''
   ``In 1989, you were 16 times more likely to be defeated if you
were a provincial leader of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union
than if you are an American congressman,'' Gingrich said.
   Foley said the Republicans' real concern stems less from a
permanent Congress than from frustration at their seemingly
permanent minority status in the House. The lineup now stands at 257
Democrats, 175 Republicans, with special elections coming for three
vacant seats that were held by Democrats.
   The speaker said incumbent advantages can't be the real reason
because Democrats hold their own or better in contests for open
seats, in which no incumbent is involved. In competition for open
seats in the last four elections, there has been no net change in
party strength, he noted. In special elections during that period,
the Democrats made a net gain of one seat.
   Foley said each party might do well to take a lesson from the
other _ Republicans on the way to compete for House seats and
Democrats on the national campaign skills vital in presidential
elections, since the GOP has won five of the last six.
   The Washington congressman jokes that if the Democrats do manage
to elect a president they'll probably have to hire a Republican
consultant to tell them how to put on an inauguration.
   But he said the Democrats do a better job in the localized
politics of a House district, in recruiting House candidates, and in
serving constituents. The ability to deliver on that latter task is
one of the key advantages of incumbency. That serves the majority
Democrats well, especially in relatively conservative districts. In
1988, Democrats won 136 House seats in districts carried by Bush.
Only 12 Republicans were elected to the House in districts that
voted for the Democratic presidential ticket.

   It's summer and Americans are on the road
enjoying new places. And burglars are out searching for the vacant
houses left behind.
   For many people the perception of a burglar is someone breaking
into a home in the dark of night, but that isn't always the case,
the FBI reports.
   More home burglaries occur in the daytime than at night, and in
nearly one-fourth of the cases the crook simply gets in through an
unlocked door or window, the FBI has found.
   Many cases are simply crimes of opportunity, with people knocking
on doors and, if there is no answer, trying the door. If it opens
they go in and help themselves, police explain. If the door is
locked, they go on to the next house.
   That means a simple thing like making sure the door is kept
locked can prevent a burglary, certainly a cost-effective measure if
ever there was one.
   Of course, that means all doors, not just the front door. Make
sure there are locks on windows and attic, basement and garage
doors, too.
   If you are unsure about where your home may be vulverable, check
your local police department _ many departments will conduct free or
low-cost home security audits and make suggestions for improvement.
   One of the things they stress is to never leave keys available
outside the home.
   Once upon a time people left keys in mailboxes or under doormats
with little fear, but no more. Today thieves know all the obvious
places to look and check them out quickly.
   The Insurance Information Institute, which is interested in crime
because its members wind up paying for many of the losses, suggests
making the home look lived-in while you are away.
   For example, ask neighbors to collect mail and newspapers and
have someone mow the lawn.
   In addition, get automatic timers for the lights and set them to
turn lights on and off in different rooms at different times to make
it look like someone is home.
   A telephone answering machine can be a good idea, too. That way
thieves aren't tipped off by an unanswered ringing phone. Turn off
automatic garage door openers while away.
   The insurance group urges putting ladders away and says to be
sure not to advertise your vacation in the newspaper society columns.
   Valuables should be locked in a safe or safety deposit box. The
costly items should be inventoried with photos for use in making
insurance claims and identifying the items in the event of theft.
   Electronic equipment is among the most popular with crooks, so
make a mark on it to identify it later. For example, many people
engrave their Social Security number on a metal part of the product.
Electric engraving tools can be rented or borrowed from many police
departments or purchased at a reasonable price.
   Finally, when coming home from vacation check the house before
going in. If there is any sign of entry, go to a neighbor's house
and call the police _ the last thing you want to do is walk in on a
burglar in the act.

   With all the police and all the arrests, New Yorkers still name
drug abuse and crime as the city's greatest problems. ``It would not
be fair to lay the total responsibility on the mayor and the Police
Department,'' Reppetto says. Still, ``The question is, could they
have responded in a better way?''
   At a minimum, Koch's response is true to form: Hiring more
employees to address problems has been his consistent practice, says
Charles Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget
Commission, another independent watchdog group.
   The city's budget has grown from $13.6 billion the year before
Koch took office to $25 billion now, and most of it goes for
compensation, Brecher says. City employment has risen from 195,176
to 231,982.
   Brecher says such wide-scale hiring has serious flaws. ``There
has been a tendency to associate more workers with better services,
and that has not proven to be the case,'' he says. ``Delivery of
services has not improved in proportion to the amount of money put
into them.''
   The problem, Brecher says, is that Koch's approach shifts the
focus off productivity and innovation. ``You have to give him good
marks for keeping the budget balanced,'' he says. ``But less good
marks for spending the money wisely.''
   City spending under Koch has been funded largely by dint of a
steady economic upswing. Property values have soared and real estate
development, particularly in midtown Manhattan, has boomed, in part
with the help of city-supplied tax benefits.
   One result has been a drastic cut in so-called ``single-room
occupancy'' hotels _ the cheap and dreary tenements that housed the
poorest of the poor. ``The city has lost 70,000 SRO units in the
last 12 years,'' says Robert Hayes, counsel to the Coalition for the
Homeless, an advocacy group. ``That is a gaping hole that hasn't
been filled.''
   Today, the coalition estimates, 70,000 to 90,000 people are
homeless in the city. When polls ask about New York's greatest
problem, homelessness invariably is the third most-cited issue,
after drugs and crime.
   ``There are many, many people of great affluence who are
suffering great spiritual angst as they step over prone bodies
literally on the streets,'' Hayes says. ``Homelessness, apart from
the tragedy for homeless people, is sapping vitality from the entire
city.
   ``It's demoralizing..It raises questions that are very
fundamental about our ability as a society and a government to deal
with problems. It's not that in 1977 there were no problems. But the
visibility of homelessness as a chronic assault on our
self-confidence did not exist.''
   The city faces other pressing problems that did not exist, or
were not so severe, at the dawn of the Koch administration. Acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, with its enormous demands on the health
care system, was unknown. The bridges and highways were not
crumbling so badly; racial tensions were not so great; the public
education system had not deteriorated so badly.
   Now polls put Koch _ after overwhelming re-election victories in
1981 and 1985 _ as the underdog in this year's contest. As he
campaigns, Koch points to a list of programs he has initiated to
address the city's problems, and he argues that his experience never
was so needed as now.
   His opponents promote their own initiatives, from appointing a
drug czar to building schools with billions in bonds. But when it
comes to the voting, first in the Sept. 12 primary, the decision
will reach to the past as well as the future, comprising a judgment
on the words Koch spoke in January 1978.
   ``We are the trustees of a national treasure _ the city of New
York itself,'' the new mayor said. ``History will hold us
accountable for how well we live up to that trust. We must not let
this city dwindle and diminish. We must not fail.
   ``The mistakes of the past are past. We have been tested and the
testing will continue. But we have survived. And soon we will begin
to flourish.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Something happened to Xavier Suarez after he was
elected mayor of Miami. He developed a taste for politics. From his
base as the boss of a culturally diverse city, the Cuban-born Suarez
has become a strong political influence in Hispanic circles. Here's
a mayor of a troubled city whose star appears to be on the rise.

   Xavier Suarez gained national attention when he was
elected as Miami's first Cuban-born mayor. Around here he quickly
gained a reputation as the ``pothole mayor,'' competent but dull in
the land of ``Miami Vice.''
   He was considered by many to be an unimaginative technocrat,
seemingly uncomfortable in public and lacking the urbane,
high-profile style of his predecessor.
   Suarez steered away from the foreign policy issues that often
dominate the local news media, saying his job was not to overthrow
Fidel Castro but to get the garbage picked up.
   That was four years ago. No one calls Xavier Suarez boring
anymore.
   From a $5,000-a-year job which carries no actual executive powers
because Miami has a city manager system, Suarez has built a
political empire.
   His influence has spread from Dade County to the state capital
and Washington, as well as to Latin America.
   With the departure of San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros from
politics because of personal problems, Suarez is one of the
highest-profile Hispanic politicians in the United States.
   Re-elected in 1987 with 62 percent of the vote, Suarez last year
was under serious consideration to become Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development. This year he was the only mayor in the White
House team of observers sent to monitor the elections in Panama. He
often meets with Latin heads of state and travels to Latin countries
as a speaker.
   Suarez also claimed national attention for his personalized role
in trying to ease the Overtown race riots in January.
   In a poll conducted by a veteran Democratic consultant in
February, Suarez got 76 percent overall approval ratings from
Miami's three major ethnic groups _ blacks, Hispanics and ``Anglos.''
   ``He's close to unbeatable,'' says Raul Masvidal, the banker
defeated by Suarez in 1985.
   Still officially independent, Suarez has allies in both major
parties.
   With all this political clout, what's next for Xavier Suarez?
   ``A U.S. Senate seat would always be interesting,'' Suarez says.
``A high-level administration position. It would take a pretty high
level to get me out of here. Someday, governor. To manage a $23
billion budget and do it efficiently would be challenging.''
   Suarez has an easy explanation for how he moved so far so
quickly: He's still at heart a pothole mayor interested in
efficiency, and he's learned that the most efficient way to get
things done is with political networking and pressure.
   ``I used to say: `I'd rather beg forgiveness than ask
permission.' It seemed better to let everybody else follow. Now I
have found that it's a lot easier to have people agree with you. You
get things done a lot quicker.''
   Also, he has found he has more of a taste for politics than he
realized.
   He learned that his own popularity is a commodity with value
beyond getting him re-elected easily and enabling him to dream of
statewide office.
   ``If you have good ratings in the polls, you're in a position to
negotiate with both parties,'' Suarez says. ``You can exert a lot of
influence, but you have to win a lot.''
   Suarez, a Villanova-trained engineer, Harvard-educated lawyer,
had lost three city elections before 1985. He and his associates
aren't losing many these days.
   In 1987, Suarez backed the opponent of his chief nemesis on the
city commission, fiery anti-Communist Joe Carollo. The son of a
nuclear physicist imprisoned by Castro, Suarez said it was time to
get city meetings away from exile politics and onto current concerns.
   Suarez built a coalition on the city commission after Carollo was
ousted. That enabled him, The Miami Herald reported, to go through
the two city commission meetings in January without losing on a
single one of the more than 100 votes in each meeting.
   Last year, Suarez backed candidates who ousted three county
commissioners who had a total 44 years in office among them. He also
backed several judges, legislators, and cabinet officials in their
successful election campaigns.

   He decided to stay out of the Miami area's Aug. 29 special
congressional election to fill the seat left by Rep. Claude Pepper's
death at age 88.
   A visitor to Suarez's office three days after Pepper's death
found him in the middle of alliance-forging.
   Phones rang every few minutes: Republican Party leaders, a state
representative interested in running, political consultants.
Finally, Suarez agreed to support Republican state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen for Congress, state Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart for her
seat.
   Suarez stresses, though, that people who assume he will become a
Republican when he decides to run for a partisan office could be
mistaken. On foreign policy, he is more in line with current
Republican philosophy, as are most Cuban-Americans, but his domestic
policy viewpoints run to liberal Democrat, as do most of the
nation's other Hispanics.
   Democratic Party state chairman Simon Ferro, a friend, says he
doesn't consider Suarez a Republican and hopes to have him run under
the Democratic label someday.
   Suarez clearly relishes his new-found political standing, which
sometimes evinces the stubborn streak that drove him to spend weeks
in 1983 searching for his car that was stolen. After two months,
Suarez spotted his blue Impala parked in front of an apartment, got
his keys, and ``re-stole'' it.
   There are those who whisper that Suarez's clout has gone to his
head.
   He angered some legislators this year with a strongly worded,
threatening letter demanding their support for a 2 percent food and
beverages tax (which later passed).
   Told someone is canceling an appointment with him, Suarez says:
``Tell him that's the last appointment he gets with me.'' Told U.S.
Rep. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, has been courting influential Cubans
for support of his 1990 gubernatorial bid, Suarez snorts: ``He
hasn't talked to me yet.''
   While voicing ambitions beyond Miami, Suarez says he still has
much left to do here. He streamlined the government of what he
called ``the city that doesn't work'' in his 1985 campaign that saw
the defeat of incumbent Maurice Ferre. But as the January riots
showed, work remains to be done in the inner cities he pledged to
make a priority.
   Suarez has sheaves of statistics to show progress made in adding
housing, spurring businesses and improving services in the
impoverished black neighborhoods, but he concedes more needs to be
done to lift the spirits and hopes there.
   Suarez drew praise by walking virtually unprotected through riot
areas, and his ratings among blacks were strong in the poll taken by
Sergio Bendixen. He said Suarez was in a unique position among
Cuban-American politicians because of his cross-ethnic appeal.
   Getting away from Miami's ethnic-bloc politics has been a major
goal. He opened a press conference with Hispanic journalists by
warning there were two questions he wouldn't answer: ``What's it
like being the first Cuban mayor?'' and ``How do you compare
yourself with Henry Cisneros?''
   ``I'd rather just talk about being mayor of Miami,'' Suarez said.
   That job, though, turned out to include being a special figure in
Latin America, just as Ferre had been and Suarez had scoffed at.
Nearly all Latins view Miami as something of a suburb, he explained,
a place to shop, to invest, to get medical service, to cut deals, to
catch up on what's going on in the region. The Miami news media is
followed throughout Latin America, Suarez said.
   ``I did take a low profile on international issues at first. I
wanted to batten down the hatches and get the city moving,'' Suarez
says. ``Now I realize you can do it totally parallel to being
mayor.''
   For now, he will run for re-election in November, this time to a
four-year term after two two-year terms. He hopes to see voter
approval of a strong-mayor system, and also a strong-county mayor
system.
   He, his wife and four young children are planted firmly in Miami,
Suarez says, for the near future.
   ``It's a very exciting city,'' concluded its not-so-dull leader.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's the gadfly of Ticonderoga, N.Y., a man who
carries a grudge a long way. While serving time in prison for
possessing an unlicensed gun, John Wright took to studying lawbooks.
Two decades later, he put his legal skills to work, seeking revenge
against those who put him in jail in the first place. He fought to
the state's highest court and won, much to the chagrin of town
officials.

   John Wright has never forgiven police in
this historic Adirondack community for their role in sending him to
prison for two years in the 1960s.
   But he didn't just get mad. He got even. He got more than even.
   The 61-year-old self-taught lawyer sued to get six members of the
nine-member police force, including the chief, fired because they
weren't trained and tested properly.
   The town fought him every step of the way, but finally gave up
this year when New York state's top court ruled they were wrong and
Wright was right.
   The police chief became a former police chief.
   ``Twenty years ago I would have gone out and knocked these guys
silly with my fists,'' says Wright, who lives and works out of two
trailers around the corner from the site of a famous Revolutionary
War battle. ``Now I just take the lawbooks and get them that way.
It's better.''
   His neighbors in Ticonderoga are amazed _ not to mention annoyed
_ at how far Wright carries a grudge.
   His story began in 1963. Strapped for a job, he came to the
Adirondacks from New Jersey to work at a bar owned by his mother. He
said people in the rugged mountain area, naturally suspicious of
outsiders, were ``out to get me'' from the start.
   About two years after Wright moved in, Horace Snow, then a state
police officer, and his colleagues raided the bar and arrested
Wright for possession of an unlicensed gun. Wright didn't dispute
the charge, although he considered his sentence of 3{ to 7 years
excessive.
   During Wright's ``2 years, 2 months and 28 days'' in prison, his
mother's tavern burned to the ground in a mysterious fire that was
never solved, he says.
   Once out of prison, Wright worked in an auto parts store and
maintained an uneasy truce with police. He continued an interest in
law that began with a correspondence course in prison, taking
classes at Adirondack Community College.
   The auto parts job didn't work out. Wright, whose wife is a
school cook, raised money by renting out other trailers on his
cluttered property. In 1981, Wright fought with a tenant who didn't
pay her phone bill, holding the woman's stereo and television set
hostage until he got his money.
   He also got arrested on grand larceny and possession of stolen
property charges. Although the charges were eventually dropped,
Wright didn't forget.
   Instead, the amateur lawyer retreated to his second trailer,
stuffed with hundreds of second-hand lawbooks and a home computer.
   By then Snow, retired from the state police, was chief of the
small police force in this community of 5,500 people on the northern
edge of Lake George. Studying laws and personnel records, Wright
noticed that Snow didn't have two years of supervisory experience
and didn't take a civil service examination _ both required of
prospective police chiefs by state law. He said Ticonderoga also
didn't properly advertise the position when the job opened.
   Wright also discovered that the town's three part-time police
officers and two full-time constables hadn't taken required civil
service examinations before they were hired.
   So, he sued.
   A state trial court in Essex County agreed that the three
part-time police officers should be fired. But the court said Snow
and the other two officers could stay on.
   Town officials fired the three officers, then quickly rehired
them as constables. Wright filed an appeal.

<TEXT>
   Ticonderoga thought so little of Wright's case that the town
lawyer didn't even drive to Albany to argue the case before the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court. Wright made his case
before the justices himself.
   In July 1988, the appeals court judges accepted Wright's
arguments. Calling Snow's qualifications ``questionable,'' they
ruled he should be fired. The three new constables should also be
let go because they were doing work they didn't have authority to
do, the court said. The other two officers had to go as well.
   The town then hired an Albany attorney to take the case to the
Court of Appeals, New York state's highest court. But in February,
the court refused to hear the case, letting the ruling of the lower
appeals court stand.
   The following month, Ticonderoga's town board reluctantly fired
Snow and the others.
   Needless to say, Wright is not very popular at city hall.
   ``Personally, I'm not very fond of him,'' says Robert Dedrick,
the town supervisor. ``He's certainly caused the town of Ticonderoga
a lot of problems.''
   Dedrick is reluctant to say more because Wright has already filed
a slander suit against him for calling him an ``s.o.b.'' in a
newspaper article. Wright has also harassed town officials with a
series of other lawsuits and requests for information about various
town board decisions filed under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Dedrick says Ticonderoga hasn't added up how much Wright's
lawsuits have cost the town.
   Wright estimated he's spent $20,000 on the cases. He bought a
copying machine and his bookshelves literally sag under the weight
of all his law books. He can't tell how many times he's had to
travel two hours to Albany to file papers and do research. All for
revenge.
   ``It's a personality struggle that's frozen town government,''
says Fred Herbst, editor of the local weekly newspaper, the Times of
Ti. ``The town government has accomplished virtually nothing in the
last year and a half.''
   Ticonderoga persisted in fighting Wright because ``you don't like
to see people lose their jobs,'' Dedrick says. The town currently
has five police officers and is advertising for others. A
three-member police commission runs the department.
   While there's some sentiment against Ticonderoga pursuing the
case when the courts said the town wasn't following the rules,
there's not much sympathy for Wright, Herbst says. Most people are
annoyed the gadfly didn't look at the ``big picture'' of what his
fight meant to the town, the newspaper editor says.
   Oddly, one person who says he's not angry at Wright is the
62-year-old Snow, currently unemployed. He says no one in law
enforcement has a grudge against Wright and he's baffled at why
Wright thinks they do.
   ``I'm not too bitter about it,'' Snow says. ``I'm that type of
person. He did his thing. As far as I'm concerned, out of every bad
comes some good.''
   Snow won't say why police went into the bar where Wright was
arrested in the first place. He said Wright had gotten a court order
sealing the police records in the case and he won't wouldn't violate
it.
   Wright, meanwhile, is taking no chances. He has strung
high-intensity spotlights around his property, convinced that
someone will come late at night to avenge his legal victory. He has
six loaded shotguns in the small trailer where he lives and he
carefully locks his doors.
   ``You can't buy satisfaction like this,'' said Wright, who
dismisses those who say he took a grudge to extraordinary lengths.
   ``They did everything they can to me,'' he says. ``They put me in
jail. They burned my mother's bar down...It's just like a dog _ if
you tie him up and beat him every day, when you finally untie him,
he's going to bite your leg off at the knee.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Banc d'Arguin National Park in Mauritania
presents a striking marriage of the Sahara Desert and the sea. The
islands in northwestern Africa are teeming with birds, the water is
rich with fish, while the mainland and its dunes are practically
devoid of biological life. And getting there is an adventure in
itself.

   A trip to Mauritania's desolate Banc
d'Arguin National Park begins with a moonlit ride down the beach
where the Sahara Desert presses tightly against the Atlantic Ocean.
   It takes a determined tourist to visit this park. It's only 125
miles north of Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott, but then Nouakchott
itself is only 500 yards from the edge of the vast Sahara.
   The Banc d'Arguin is 4,635 square miles of sand and sea
containing one of the world's finest bird sanctuaries. The Bay of
Arguin, with its underwater prairie of sea plants, is teeming with
marine life ranging from breeding food fish to seals and turtles.
Inland is only trackless desert.
   There are no roads to the park. There are no roads in the park.
No hotels. No restaurants. No fresh water. The Tourism Ministry in
Nouakchott doesn't have much information about the park or how to
get there.
   And getting there, as they say, is half the fun.
   The easiest solution is to locate one of the several Nouakchott
outfits that rent four-wheel-drive vehicles, with drivers. Fill it
up with gas and they will take you anywhere. But be sure to pack all
the fuel, food and water you'll need for the duration of the journey.
   Setting out at 8 p.m., Ahmed, the driver, followed a barely
discernible track for about 20 or 30 miles into the desert north of
Nouakchott, finally breaking out on the beach. He flies along the
water's edge on the hard sand, disturbing only an occasional bird.
There are no troublesome turns to worry about. There is little
danger of getting lost. Just keep the Atlantic on the left and the
dunes on the right.
   Occasionally a jackal appears in the headlight beams, searching
the seashore for a dinner of fiddler crabs.
   The jackal is the only wild mammal still roaming the region in
large numbers. A few dorcas gazelles remain. The dama gazelle and
oryx disappeared in the 1960s, about the same time the last ostrich
was seen. The cheetah left 30 years ago. Most of these animals were
victims of long and severe droughts.
   Scattered along the beach between Nouakchott and the entrance to
the park at Nouamghar are a few tiny villages of Imraguen fishermen
who have plied these seas for centuries. As the tide comes in, Ahmed
recommends a halt. He stops at the village of Tiouilit, a dozen or
so slapdash homes made of bits of wood and corrugated iron.
   Several villagers welcome three visitors to Tiouilit, and over
endless glasses of sweet tea they gab till long after midnight
before allowing their guests to sleep on the straw-matted floor.
   Talk is simple, close to home, unpretentious. One learns that in
Tiouilit women are not allowed to go into the ocean. If they do,
there will be no more fish, and the village will suffer.
   Up early, we head again for the beach. The pink rays of the
rising sun wash over the dunes of the vast Sahara as they sweep down
to the Atlantic.
   In the flyblown huddle of cement buildings that make up
Nouamghar, the park lieutenant is located. For tourists, the entry
fee is $38 _ expensive, but for a good cause. After a courtesy call
on the local prefect, we're back on the road.
   The going really gets tough here. Heading inland across the
desert, Ahmed follows the merest hint of a track. Sometimes it's
smooth and straight, sometimes sand-swept. Finally, it disappears,
as eventually does the horizon, behind a cloud of blowing sand.
   The last 15 miles into Iouik is by dead reckoning.
   Village chief Ahmed Baba greets his visitors warmly. There is tea
_ the long Mauritanian ritual of continuous pouring and repouring _
a bit of dried fish ripped into strips, a few peanuts, and
discussion about the price of a boat to the bird islands.

<HEAD>IOUIK, Mauritania: bird islands.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 28 families of Iouik are shark fishermen. A boat taking
tourists to the bird sanctuaries means a boat that won't catch any
sharks. The bargaining is hard.
   Mohammed Zaidan, captain of the lateen-rigged sailboat, eases his
craft out to sea as one of his two crewmen attends to first things
first _ getting the teakettle on.
   Past the huge Tidra island, Zaidan sails on for two hours to a
series of smaller pieces of land. Flamingos wade offshore. Pelicans
too. Several species of stern, cormorants, sea gulls.
   Landing at the flat, sandy Ner island, covered with scrub
vegetation, a huge flock of spoonbills warily edges away from the
approach of humans. The birds don't fly away, but as the barefoot
visitors quietly make their way across the island, whispering and
snapping photographs, the birds,ff at
6:37 a.m., with two F-16 fighter jets giving chase through the still
and cloudless desert sky.
   It landed here at 8:30 a.m. after performing test maneuvers over
the Mojave Desert. The plane landed perfectly on the runway's center
line at Edwards, where the space shuttles land after returning from
orbit.
   The bat-winged bomber, 69 feet long with a 172-foot wingspan,
quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble or waver, idled for
several minutes and then taxied into a hangar. The B-2 will remain
at Edwards for further tests.
   The plane's landing gear remained down during the flight, as is
standard practice on test flights in case of malfunctions.
   ``We were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft,''
Northrop test pilot Bruce Hinds told a post-flight news conference.
   Co-pilot Air Force Col. Richard Couch, said the plane came
smoothly off the ground, was ``very nimble'' in flight and
``rock-steady'' on landing.
   The pilots said the landing was so smooth they had to ask the
tower if they were down. Tests included three different speeds.
   The stealth bomber's only previous flights have been on a
computer flight simulation; Air Force and Northrop officials say no
other aircraft has been tested more thoroughly without having been
flown.
   The flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber, which
is already 18 months behind schedule. At a budgeted price of $500
million each _ the Air Force wants 132 of the planes _ it is the
most expensive warplane in history.
   A key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding
until the plane proves itself in the air.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday. ``It is far too
expensive to be a stealth taxi.''
   As the plane took off this morning, the ``Star Spangled Banner''
was sung on the runway by Alis Clausen, a member of the staff of a
local cable TV station. Air Force Capt. Tess Taft unfurled the Stars
and Stripes, which was held by a tearful Linda Tokish.
   Thousands of civilian stealth watchers gathered among the
tumbleweeds outside the Palmdale plant shouted ``Here they come,
here they come!'' as the great flying-wing's dark shadow passed
over. ``Great God,'' exclaimed Northrop employee Les Holland.
   ``I'm shaking. My legs are shaking. It was going right over my
head,'' said Shari Cutler, who came with her four children.
   ``It feels great. It feels just fantastic. A lot of work has gone
into this. Millions of man hours, with people working seven days a
week, 24 hours a day. We feel just great,'' said Air Force Col.
Douglas Kennett.
   ``I was overcome with emotion. I was so thrilled when I saw the
wheels go up. I'm just so excited to know that it's up there now and
I pray that it lands safely,'' Taft said.
   ``This represents the technology of tomorrow,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``It gives us the opportunity to stress deterrence. ... It
represents a new generation of technology and it's the way you're
going to see airplanes look tomorrow.''
   The bomber's maiden flight had been scheduled Saturday, but a low
fuel pressure gauge reading aborted the flight.
   After the flight was canceled, workers checked the aircraft and
discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the
bomber's fuel system. The problem was fixed, but no other details
were available, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Fergeson.
   The B-2 is designed to carry nuclear bombs, and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aging fleet of B-52
bombers that have formed part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent since
the 1950s.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane undetectable by enemy radar. Though
the bomber is still being developed, stealth fighters have operated
several years.

   Tim Reid is back with his wife, Daphne Maxwell
Reid, in a new CBS television show that for the first time he can
say is really his own.
   He and his wife not only star in the stylish romantic mystery,
``Snoops,'' but he helped create it. As co-executive producer, he
also controls every aspect of the show.
   One thing he wanted was a racially mixed crew.
   ``Rarely in this town do people have an opportunity to work in an
integrated environment,'' Reid says. ``When I did `Frank's Place,'
45 percent of the people behind the camera were black. This will
probably be more than that.
   ``We have blacks at every level. We have black writers and black
directors and I especially made it a point to find a black woman
writer with experience. People keep telling me you can't find
experienced blacks. I found them. My job is to find qualified people
in areas of production closed to women and minorities.''
   Reid says it's necessary to find enthusiastic people to make a
show a success.
   ``In the pilot I remember there was no way we could get one
shot,'' he says. ``But I saw people pull together and go the extra
mile. In television, you have to give 150 percent to get a show on
the air and keep it on the air. It has to have a special spark.''
   In ``Snoops,'' Reid and his wife play Chance and Micki Dennis, an
offbeat professional couple in Washington that always seems to
stumble upon a murder. He's a criminology professor at Georgetown
University. She's chief of protocol at the State Department.
   The sophisticated, crime-solving couple and their clever repartee
are in the mold of ``The Thin Man,'' ``Mr. and Mrs. North,''
``McMillan and Wife'' and ``Hart to Hart.''
   Reid, when he is asked about the comparison to ``The Thin Man,''
says, ``I hope so.''
   His wife and co-star adds, ``We talked about that concept. We
loved Nick and Nora Charles and the fact that these things happened
within their lives. They didn't go out looking for things. We loved
their repartee. It will be stylish. I think it's in tune with the
times. Families and romance are back.''
   Daphne Reid, a former fashion model who was the first black woman
on the cover of Glamour magazine, will be attired in the latest
fashions for her job and for the many diplomatic parties they will
attend. Reid's character is described as an ``eccentric
conservative'' who will wear vests.
   ``Snoops'' will be the first time a black woman has starred in a
one-hour drama since Teresa Graves was in ABC's ``Get Christie
Love'' in 1974-75. If the series goes past 22 episodes, it will be
the first time a drama with a predominantly black cast has been
renewed.
   Reid was on several television shows in the 1970s, including the
short-lived ``Richard Pryor Show,'' but it was his role as disc
jockey Venus Flytrap on ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' that made him famous.
After that, he was detective Downtown Brown on ``Simon &amp; Simon,''
then in ``Frank's Place.''
   ``Frank's Place'' was one of the best shows of the 1987-88
season, but it was moved frequently on the schedule by CBS and never
caught on with the audience. In that show, Reid was a New England
college professor who inherited his father's Creole restaurant in
New Orleans. The show was called a ``dramady,'' a mixture of drama
and comedy.
   ``Hugh Wilson, who created `Frank's Place,' is doing a more
commercial show this season with `The Famous Teddy Z,''' Reid says.
``I'm doing a more commercial show with `Snoops.' It'll have more
mass appeal and the stories will be lighthearted. You have to
entertain. I think `Frank's Place' forgot that.''
   Daphne Reid says, ``We want to portray a black family because we
are one. We want people to see a black family and have something for
the community to root for. What the world knows of black families is
what they see on television. We want them to see all aspects.''
   Reid will also be seen this fall in John Frankenheimer's ``The
Fourth War,'' which also stars Roy Scheider, Harry Dean Stanton and
Jergen Prochnow. He had previously worked with director
Frankenheimer in ``Dead Bang,'' starring Don Johnson.
   Reid says he will have a segment on each show featuring a
Washington street kid. ``I want him to do something positive,'' he
says. ``We had some difficulty finding one for the pilot because
every kid we auditioned was middle class.''
   Despite the resemblance to ``The Thin Man,'' Reid says there will
be no dog. ``We won't drink as much, either,'' he says. ``I will
also do anything I can to avoid a drug story. If we do anything at
all it will be about rehabilitation.''
   Reid created the show with writer Sam Egan.
   ``We were looking for an occupation for Daphne's character,
something stylish and glamorous,'' he says. ``We went on vacation to
the Bahamas and ran into two sisters, Dickie and Fuzzy. Dickie
worked for the State Department and that's how we came to make her
head of protocol. Then when we filmed the pilot we picked a house in
Georgetown and it turned out to be only a few doors from Dickie's
house.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   For Richard Backus, the workweek starts twice _
on Tuesday, when he begins the first of eight performances in ``The
Cocktail Hour,'' the off-Broadway hit by A.R. Gurney, and on
Thursday, when he starts writing a new script for ``As the World
Turns,'' the television soap opera.
   ``I've gone from a chaotic actor's life to suddenly becoming a
very methodical person,'' Backus was saying the other day in his
Upper West Side apartment, where he does his writing.
   Last October, the actor was hired as one of five dialogue writers
for ``As the World Turns,'' the venerable soap opera which has been
running five days a week on CBS since 1956. At the same time last
fall, he took a job as standby for Bruce Davison in ``The Cocktail
Hour,'' which concerns a son who has written a play about his
parents and wants their permission to get it produced. Six months
later, when Davison left the show, Backus took over the role of the
son.
   ``It means that I literally do nothing else except do the play
and then come home to write,'' Backus says.
   Soap opera writing is a highly disciplined, tightly structured
craft. On ``As the World Turns,'' head writer Douglas Marland, a
respected veteran of the daytime drama wars, plots the show over the
long term. He is supported by what are called breakdown writers, who
do the plot narratives. They write what will happen on a given day.
   These highly detailed scenarios are turned into dialogue by a
third group of writers, including Backus. He writes one script, the
equivalent of a one-act play, each week.
   The writing is regimented in precise segments. According to
Backus, each episode of the hour-long ``As the World Turns''
contains a prologue and seven acts, made up of from 20 to 25
carefully plotted scenes.
   ``Each scene ends with a little something to make you go on to
the next scene,'' he says. ``Each act ends with a little something
to make you sit through the commercials and watch the next act. The
final act always has three parts, each one a little cliffhanger. And
then each Friday show has an especially good cliffhanger to make
sure you come back on Monday.''
   Backus begins a new script each Thursday after receiving a plot
breakdown. He tries to get most of the show written by Friday
afternoon, but may have to polish up a scene or two over the weekend
between the three performances of ``The Cocktail Hour'' he gives in
two days.
   The finished script is turned in to the producers on Tuesday, a
day Backus usually reserves for reading new breakdowns and scripts
by the other dialogue writers, as well as watching taped episodes of
the show, something he is required to do by contract.
   ``In a way, it's a real factory, but it's amazing how creative it
is within the format,'' Backus says. ``But what Douglas cares about
and what drew me to the show initially is that he deals with serious
issues and you get to watch people grapple with real problems. And
he deals with the problems long term. There are no miracle cures.''
   ``As the World Turns,'' set in the mythical Midwestern town of
Oakdale, is more of a straightforward domestic drama that doesn't
rely on mystery, crime or the bizarre for its plots. It focuses on
character and consequently uses a lot of experienced stage actors,
such as Kathleen Widdoes, Larry Bryggman, Elizabeth Hubbard and
Patrick Tovatt.
   Until he started writing for ``As the World Turns,'' the
44-year-old Backus had never written professionally. Born in
Goffstown, N.H., and educated at Harvard, he made his living as an
actor, working in New York theater, an occasional movie, in
television and on soap operas, including a stint on ``As the World
Turns'' several years ago.
   New York first noticed him in 1972 in the play ``Promenade,
All!'', for which he won a Theater World award, and later in a
critically praised revival of O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' at
Broadway's Circle in the Square in which he played the 16-year-old
juvenile lead at age 30.
   Coincidentally, it was a Gurney play, ``Children,'' that first
got Backus interested in soap operas. In 1976, while waiting tables,
he auditioned for the play but didn't take the job because the pay
was too low and he had a family to support. Backus told his agent to
get him on a soap, so he could afford to do the acting that he
wanted to do.
   Backus watched ``As the World Turns'' regularly for a year before
he suggested to its then-producer Robert Calhoun that he wanted to
write for it. He submitted sample scripts and was accepted by
Calhoun and Marland. Calhoun, in fact, told him that actors make
good soap opera writers.
   ``It's more a process of turning a short novel into working
dialogue,'' Backus says. ``It's very close to what an actor does
when he gets a new play and makes it work on stage. So if you have a
good background in acting, you have a sense of what works.
   ``I now think soap operas combine the best of stage with the best
of film. A stage play like `The Cocktail Hour' is able to focus in a
short time on a very cathartic moment in someone's life. The
wonderful thing about soap operas is that they can deal with
characters over a long period of time. You get a sense of the real
immediacy and familiarity that you do, to a certain extent, on the
stage because it's alive performance.''

   ``The Accidental Tourist'' (Warner Home Video. VHS, $89.98. Rated
PG)
   
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' was a lumbering exercise on the large
screen, and becomes even more narcoleptic on the small screen at
home.
   It was one of the year's most overrated movies with one of the
year's most overrated performances, namely that of Geena Davis who
won an Academy Award as supporting actress for her portrayal of a
free-spirited dog trainer.
   Based on the acclaimed novel by Pulitzer Prize-winner Anne Tyler,
the movie illuminates the world of a finicky travel writer named
Macon Leary (William Hurt) who is thrown into a tailspin when his
wife (Kathleen Turner) leaves him.
   He takes his dog to a rather bizarre trainer, Muriel (Davis), who
does more than merely mold the pooch. Macon's reluctant and
accidental romance with Muriel forms the meat of this very spare
tale.
   Tyler's novel was a sophisticated and bittersweet romp,
interspersed with travel notes from all over. What's translated to
film, however, is a studied, boorish examination of unglued people
that takes far too long to say nothing. And yes, there are travel
notes from all over and they just might be the most interesting
thing about the film.
   Hurt speaks like he has marbles in his mouth and looks like he
really wishes he were someplace else. Davis speaks like her jaw's
been wired shut; her dialogue comes out as clipped, chirpy phrases.
There is nothing special about her performance. If anything, it's
grating.
   Tyler took the reader on an excursion of sorts, through family
relations, through introspection, through the human comedy of
living. Too bad the tale went through the Hollywood Cusinart and
turned into a Slushy.

   ``Salaam Bombay!'' (Virgin Vision. English subtitles. VHS-Beta,
$79.95. Unrated)
   
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is a heartrending look at the homeless street
children of Bombay, India. But its meanings and nuances transcend
that exotic locale.
   The film, which won a number of international film awards in
1988, is a riveting portrayal of how 20th century societies,
including so-called civilized ones, are devouring their young,
alternately selling them, or selling them short.
   Producer-director Mira Nair traveled the streets of Bombay,
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt, drugs and
prostitution. She decided to tell their story, not with actors, but
with children she gathered from those very backstreets.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is the story of 10-year-old Krishna. Abandoned
first by his mother, then by the traveling circus he joins, he
travels to Bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back to his
mother.
   Krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads to
a murder. But somehow, almost miraculously, he keeps a child-like
empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes. He befriends a
desperate drug addict, and comforts an abject 16-year-old sold by
her own mother to a brothel.
   The film's producers decided to use proceeds to establish
learning centers for the street children of Bombay and Delhi.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is not rated. It has no objectionable language
or sexual encounters, but the themes of street life are nonetheless
unvarnished.
   It is a truly exceptional film.

   ``Images'' (O.M. Records) _ Georganne Cassat, harp.
   
   Like some of the larger planets in our solar system, Marcel
Tournier's Images for harp are heavy in atmosphere. The music covers
the gamut of harp effects. These short pieces sound a little like
Debussy piano etudes, though less complex. They were unquestionably
written by a harpist _ the liner notes call Tournier one of the most
important harpists and harp composers of the 19th and 20th centuries
_ and a judicious one at that. We can be thankful he doesn't indulge
in too many of those sweeping runs such as the kind used as a
backdrop for movie flashbacks.
   These pieces, presented here as a whole for the first time, are
fairly simple and pleasant to listen to. They have quaint titles
such as ``Moonlight in a Pool,'' replete with rippling run effects,
and ``Children by the Christmas Crib,'' which nicely evokes the
choir sound of a Christmas carol.
   Cassat is an accomplished harpist who more often than not avoids
the sometimes annoying over-plucked quality of solo harp
performances. She has an excellent sense of dynamics, offering a
constant interplay of soft and loud passages.
   Her brief biography oddly points out that she has ``brought the
music of the harp to some of the leading Royal Houses in Europe and
the Orient.'' Has royalty traditionally been deprived of harp music?
And do those kings and queens feel properly grateful? Maybe playing
this disc can make our living rooms feel a bit more regal. It
certainly lends a little atmosphere.

   ``Cycles'' (Capitol) _ The Doobie Brothers
   
   Give one of the world's most popular bands six years off, and
it's amazing how many fresh ideas they'll come up with _ hardly any.
   If that's a revelation, it's the only one shed by ``Cycles,'' the
Doobie Brothers' first album since 1983, and their first studio
album since 1980.
   Five of the six Doobies who reunited for ``Cycles'' were with the
band when they first hit the Top 40 in the early 1970s, and much of
the music here sounds like the Doobies of that period. That means
boogie guitars, tight harmonies and plenty of percussion.
   The music is professionally played, but the formula is too
familiar to generate much excitement. And most of the material _
especially the feeble first single, ``The Doctor'' _ fails to match
the Doobies' best songs of the past.
   Still, there are moments of merit. Guitarist Tom Johnston's
``Wrong Number,'' an anti-cocaine song, has a stirring lyric. ``I
Can Read Your Mind'' offers a lovely vocal counterpoint by Patrick
Simmons and could have been an outtake from ``Minute by Minute,''
perhaps the band's best album.
   But ``Cycles'' sounds used rather than new. The guitar riff from
the Doobies' chestnut ``China Grove'' kicks off ``The Doctor''; the
riff that opens the oldie ``Listen to the Music'' begins ``Need a
Little Taste of Love.'' Maybe this album should've been called
``Recycles.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Real Billy Crystal Stands Up in Romantic Comedy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've seen him as Sammy, Grace, Tina and
Fernando. Now the real Billy Crystal, more or less, stands up in a
romantic comedy directed by his best friend, Rob Reiner.
   Some friend. Reiner talked to other actors before offering ``When
Harry Met Sally ...'' to his pal.
   ``It was awkward,'' Crystal recalls, ``because when the project
came to me, it wasn't as best friends. It was, `I think you should
do this film.' I knew he had seen other people, and I was just like
dying. I didn't know the script, I just knew the age group and who
the guy sort of was, and I thought, `Well, why isn't he giving it to
me?'
   ``When he called me up to say, `You got to do the movie,' he
said, `I had to go through the process of seeing other people that
any director would do. I wanted you to do it, but I just had to make
sure.'
   ``I said, `I don't know if it's any good; I have to read it and
make sure.' I called afterward and said, `I have to do it. But we
got to start working together.'''
   Nora Ephron (``Heartburn'') had written a script about a couple
who meet over the years and test his theory that men and women can't
be real friends ``because the sex thing gets in the way.'' A lot of
the material stemmed from Reiner's own experiences with dating after
the breakup of his marriage to actress-director Penny Marshall.
   ``My job was to get Rob out (of the script) and me in _ or Harry
in,'' said Crystal. ``It was awkward playing moments that I knew had
happened to Rob in his life, and he was on the other side of the
camera watching me.''
   Having been married for 18 years, Crystal could not contribute
his dating experiences. But he did inject a bit of Billy into Harry.
   ``I think in the sense of humor, the deflection of his pain,'' he
said. ``Any of us who do comedy know, or just in life find, that a
laugh is the best medicine. This character, more than any other I've
played, is me.''
   Meg Ryan plays Sally in the film, which also features Carrie
Fisher and Bruno Kirby as the couple's best friends.
   Unlike his pal, Robin Williams, who performs maniacally in
interviews, at restaurants and on street corners, Billy Crystal is
reflective when he doesn't have a mike in front of his mouth. Next
year marks his 20th year as an entertainer, and he was asked about
the milestones in his career.
   ``You mean millstones?'' he cracked lamely.
   ``I guess the first was in 1975, being bumped from the first
`Saturday Night Live' as a guest, which hurt a lot. Six months later
I was on `Soap.' Wonderful show. Four years playing the same
character. Fine experience working with the talented actors and
actresses in that show. Learned a lot about acting there.
   ``My own TV show was canceled in '82, but I learned a lot about
myself on that show,'' he said. ``I took about two years to do
nothing but make myself a better performer. I didn't do much
television. I wasn't doing films at all _ I wasn't asked. I went on
the road just to make myself better.
   ``I went back to `Saturday Night Live' as a host in '84, which
was a personal vindication. Then coming on as a regular in '84-'85.
Everyone said, `What are you doing that for? You don't need to do
that.' I had to do that. I could do the things I'm doing now, but I
didn't have a place.''
   During that memorable ``Saturday Night Live'' season, Crystal
stretched himself with on-the-nose impressions of Sammy Davis Jr.,
Tina Turner, Grace Jones and, most famously, Fernando Lamas. Film
work followed: ``The Princess Bride'' (with Reiner), ``Running
Scared,'' ``Throw Momma From the Train'' and ``Memories of Me,''
which he co-wrote and co-produced.
   ``I don't give up,'' he said. ``I'm a little bit of a pit bull
with myself. If something's bothering me about the work and where I
want to be in the business, I just latch onto something and I don't
let go until it gets better. I've always had that survival feeling.
   ``When `Memories of Me' didn't do well, that hurt a lot, because
I liked that movie. I took it personally. But it made me work harder
and better, and I could see what I didn't like in my performance.
I'm better in `When Harry Meets Sally ...' You just have to keep
re-examining yourself and always think that one thing is a step
towards the next one.''

<HEAD>The Artists: ``It's All Involved in the Genes''</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BENKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN PATRICIO, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From her first moments of awareness as
a small child, Henriette Wyeth knew she would be a great artist, and
it wasn't just because her father was an American master.
   Her powers of observation were evident early. Photos taken when
she was a few months old show her focused intently, fascinated, on
whatever was at hand. She constantly drew, had read her first work
by William Shakespeare (``Henry VIII'') by the age of 7, studied at
the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and was renowned as a
portraitist by 16.
   At 81, she is the first lady of American art.
   Newell Convers Wyeth _ N.C. Wyeth as he is known for his classic
book illustrations and countless other works of art _ was the first
to recognize his daughter's gifts and later those of her famous
brother, Andrew.
   The Wyeth children grew up in the nurturing shadow of a giant,
where both environment and heredity were optimum. Of the five, three
are artists, one a composer who also paints and the other an
inventor who holds 23 patents.
   ``We had the most extraordinary life, really. We were well
disciplined, we had the best music and our father talked about
everything in the world _ and with such enthusiasm!'' Wyeth says.
``And we were all ... hanging on every word, looking for the first
flowers in spring, and that is the way it ought to be for children.''
   She paints nearly every day in her studio at Sentinel Ranch, the
adobe hacienda to which her late husband, artist Peter Hurd, brought
her on their honeymoon in an overheated Nash on a moonlit night in
1929.
   Her subsequent move to New Mexico from the Brandywine River
Valley of Pennsylvania was against her father's wishes.
   ``He felt I should not let marriage interfere with my painting,''
she says.
   She didn't. As Mrs. Hurd, Henriette Wyeth never stopped finding
the essential, haunting character of whatever she painted _ from her
still lifes of pumpkins and squash to the ethereal ``Death and the
Child.'' Her portraits, particularly, zero in on the subject's inner
truth, whether or not the subject might want the truth told.
   ``If you really absorb them _ the way this nose is constructed or
that shoulder drops _ you become the person. I think I have a
feeling about the truth of people when I meet them,'' she said
during an interview in the courtyard of her ranch in south-central
New Mexico.
   Wyeth, who counts early American master Benjamin West among her
ancestors, says she always knew she was an artist.
   ``We all drew, and I was quite certain I would be splendid. Even
without my father, I think I would have gone ahead and done my
damnedest.
   ``It's all involved in the genes,'' she said. ``All our grandsons
_ everybody _ is painting.''
   Despite what might seem obviously inherited gifts, genetic
transmission of artistic talent remains a largely unexplored
scientific field, says Erika Stephens, a Harvard population genetics
researcher.
   ``One of the major difficulties with artistic ability is it's
hard to define,'' Stephens said in a telephone interview from
Cambridge, Mass. ``These are complex traits. It's highly possible
there is some genetic basis for some part of what's involved in
being very musical or being able to paint, but since nobody has been
able to define the traits narrowly enough, we just don't know. ...
Most of us have a strong intuitive feeling that there's something
there, but there's not enough scientific work.''
   Wyeth says: ``I think if you really inherit something tangible,
it manifests itself. As a child, I went after flowers and colors.''
   In a letter to his mother in March 1912, when his daughter was
just 4{, N.C. Wyeth reported she was ``astounding in her powers of
perception. ... Henriette drew a picture of a Japanese lily bulb we
have here, and it was fabulously well done.''
   Polio contracted when she was 3 has left her with a gnarled right
hand. It barely slowed her down.
   ``I can't hold a piece of charcoal in my right hand,'' she says.
``I'm drawing with my left hand and painting with my right hand.''
   She uses a wrist-braced aluminum walking stick to get around
because she injured a hip in a horseback riding accident 16 years
ago.
   How hard is she working?
   ``It's intensive,'' she says. ``I used to be cross-eyed at
lunch.''
   ``I think I've been doing some of my best work,'' she adds.
   Henriette Wyeth, born in Chadds Ford, Pa., on Oct. 22, 1907, her
father's 25th birthday, was educated in a Montessori school and
later the art academy in Philadelphia. But her real teacher was N.C.
Wyeth.
   ``He constantly played down any success, and yet as a teacher he
couldn't have been more patient, warm and stimulating,'' she says.
   She started formal art lessons when she was 11, mostly charcoal
studies of spheres and pyramids as skewed by shadows and light.
``There was this excitement over how the light would hit it. There
was always excitement and reverence _ and also cold criticism.''
   Wyeth's portrait subjects have included her father, her children,
her grandchildren, brother Andrew, husband Peter, actress Helen
Hayes, former first lady Pat Nixon and others as varied as the
rolling landscape around San Patricio. She says Tricia Nixon so
disliked the portrait of her mother for its wistfulness that she
asked Wyeth to change it. The artist gently refused.
   She is not afraid to speak her mind, and is outspoken on such
topics as childhood, feminism and television.
   ``Now, you have to go to that hideous Disneyland, watch violence
on TV,'' she says. ``It's a horrible blunting experience for
children now. I haven't painted any children in 10 to 15 years
because today's children _ they are so deadpan.''
   Of feminists: ``I think they are absolutely on the wrong track. I
think they are throwing everything worthwhile in a woman's life out.
Out!''
   Women, she says, ``should read to their children, forget the slim
hips, be happy. The more a woman gives to people and the busier she
is, the far happier she is.''
   The same could be said of men, she said, ``except I think it's
even more important for a woman. We have a marvelous warmth and
intuitive understanding, adaptability and sense of humor.''
   She cites the late Georgia O'Keeffe as an example of a strong,
independent woman who was capable of singlehandedly changing the
world. The two artists were friends.
   ``People think of her as cold. She wasn't that way at all,''
Wyeth said, noting O'Keeffe's charitable donations to Indians,
various museums and the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.
   The last time she saw her, O'Keeffe was with her assistant, Juan
Hamilton, and one of his small sons.
   ``The boy was rambunctious _ punching and pulling at her in the
car,'' Wyeth recalled, but O'Keeffe tolerated the child's behavior
without any sign of annoyance.
   ``I reached across and kissed her hand. That was the last time I
said goodbye to her.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Buster or David _ He's Hot</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the 1950s, in Bugaloosa, La., a boy was
born to Beauregard and Beulah Poindexter, the famous song-and-dance
team; they named the child Buster.
   As the Poindexters toured the South, young Buster built up a
large following, giving uncanny impersonations of Carmen Miranda and
Louis Armstrong while drinking water out of a martini glass and
telling jokes with the skill of a seasoned veteran.
   But on Easter Sunday in 1959, Beauregard was shot in a crooked
game of hearts by a man in a Stetson hat named Staggerlee, the
bullet shredding the queen of spades.
   Buster's desperate mother learned that actress Tallulah Bankhead
needed an assistant, and the Poindexters moved to New York.
   No one knows what happened to Beulah Poindexter after that, but
Buster resurfaced in the 1980s at a New York club called Tramps,
drinking real martinis and performing standards and new songs
dressed in tie and tails.
   Audiences, young and old, responded to Poindexter, and in 1987
the singer released his debut album, ``Buster Poindexter,'' a lively
collection of rock, jazz and soca that included the hit single
``Hot, Hot, Hot.''
   And so the imaginary life of Buster Poindexter goes.
   He's really David Johansen, former singer for the seminal punk
band The New York Dolls, and now a part-time actor (``Married to the
Mob'') who recently spoke of his two very different careers and
personalities.
   ``Buster's timeless,'' Johansen said. ``People who like the New
York Dolls dig what I'm doing now. The thing about Buster I dig is
that little kids like it, 5-year-old kids, 3-year-old kids. It's
like a character they can relate to.''
   On Poindexter's new album, ``Buster Goes Berserk,'' he covers
``All Night Party,'' a '60s dance hit suggested by his baby sitter,
Wilson Pickett's ``International Playboy'' and an obscure reggae
song, ``Poor People.''
   ``I'm prone not to record well-known songs; you can judge them
against something else,'' said Johansen, who reluctantly covered The
Animals' classic ``House of the Rising Sun'' on his first record.
   ``I'm in this network of people who make tapes of old stuff _
different genres of music. I make some of the best soca tapes in the
world. I got this guy in L.A., Fast Freddy, the mambo king; he makes
some unbelieveable stuff.''
   Johansen grew up in Staten Island, N.Y., in the '60s and listened
to all kinds of music, especially rhythm and blues.
   ``There were two soul stations,'' Johansen recalled, ``WWRL in
Manhattan and WNJR in Newark (N.J). WNJR, instead of just playing
the slick kind of soul songs, also played a lot of Southern soul _
Solomon Burke, Little Walter. Plus, I used to listen to (disc
jockey) Murray the K, and I'm a big fan of WBAI's `World Dance
Party.'''
   The New York Dolls broke up after just two records, but
anticipated the English punk movement and American new wave scene of
the '70s with their combination of crude energy and ironic
intelligence. Johansen pursued a solo career, but tired of life on
the road.
   ``I used to live in the back of a van, which isn't so good for
your back, or your liver,'' he said. ``We'd been traveling eight
hours a day in a van and you'd go nuts, especially if you're going
to talk to some heavy metal guitarist all day. You'll go bananas _
some guy who's in love with George Jetson's daughter, and you're
trying to explain to him that it's a cartoon.''
   Performing as Buster was meant originally as a temporary escape,
but the act's popularity _ especially on New Year's Eve _ made
recording an album a logical step.
   ``When I started it was just two guys: a piano player and me.
Then a drummer joined us, a guitar and bass,'' he said. ``I was just
going to do it for a month of Mondays at Tramps. We kept doing it
because people liked it. It built very naturally. We added the horns
and percussion and then decided to make the record.''
   His fast songs recall hot summer nights in New York, with crowds
spilling out of nightclubs into the streets, but Poindexter also
switches moods with an occasional ballad, such as ``Deep in a
Dream.''
   ``My sense leans towards fun stuff, but I like to have a little
pathos as well. I see all kinds of images. The beach, all kinds of
stuff. The airport. I normally do a ballad at the end of the show.
For your third encore you do a ballad, otherwise people will never
leave.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Hank the Cowdog Rides Again</HEAD>

   Just when you thought the old formula
Westerns were getting to be about as tired as a team of oxen
crossing Death Valley, a new Western hero comes to the rescue.
   Hank the cowdog.
   Hank, head of security at a Texas Panhandle spread in Ochiltree
County, earns his keep protecting the ranch from such villainous
creatures as dog-killing coyotes, egg-sucking foxes and a one-eyed
killer stud horse.
   In the 12 books chronicling his adventures, Hank the cowdog
solves myriad ranch mysteries while engaging in such traditional
canine pursuits as barking at the mailman, chasing a winsome collie
named Beulah and sleeping in his gunnysack bed.
   The cowboy canine is the creation of author and ex-cowboy John R.
Erickson, who has sold more than 200,000 Hank books since 1983. The
latest, ``Hank the Cowdog: The Fiddle-Playing Fox,'' was published
in February by Texas Monthly Press. The 13th volume in the series,
``Hank the Cowdog: The Wounded Buzzard on Christmas Eve,'' is
scheduled to be out this fall.
   ``I don't mind working for a dog,'' joked Erickson, 45, whose
scholarly manner is a far cry from his protagonist's homespun
character.
   A former Harvard Divinity School student who quit his studies
just three hours shy of a master's degree, Erickson spent 15 years
having his historical novels rejected by New York publishers, then
turned to writing for the San Angelo-based Livestock Weekly magazine.
   ``I ran out of ideas and I did a story about a dog which I
thought would be fun,'' Erickson said. ``I picked a dog named Hank
who belonged to the neighbors and who I had known when I was
ranching up in the Oklahoma Panhandle.''
   Erickson made the circuit of small-town church groups and civic
clubs, reading his stories aloud.
   ``The one that people singled out as their favorite was this Hank
story, so I decided I should give Hank a book all to himself,''
Erickson said. ``I didn't know whether I could sustain the story for
that length, but it worked.''
   He founded Maverick Books Inc., and got artist Gerald L. Holmes
to illustrate the book, which was published in 1983.
   The book, in which Hank tires of ranch life and joins up with a
band of outlaw coyotes, became such a success that Erickson created
another Hank adventure.
   For a long time, he said, he didn't think there was anything all
that special about the flop-eared cowdog with the self-appointed
role of ferreting out ranch mischief-makers. And Erickson, who has
written more than 20 other books, mostly about Western life, never
anticipated the popularity of the series.
   Hank's popularity has spawned audio tapes, a Hank fan club,
T-shirts and posters. The first Hank book was made into a 30-minute
cartoon on CBS television's ``Storybreak'' series. Erickson even
publishes a catalog of Hank spinoffs, including two volumes of
``Hank the Cowdog's Greatest Hits.''
   The author has written more than 20 songs to accompany the taped
stories, and performs all the character voices, ranging from Hank's
brainless sidekick Drover to Sally Mae, the ranch matriarch who
always suspects Hank as the perpetrator of any trouble on the spread.
   Playing the banjo and accompanied by Trev Tevis on other
instruments, Erickson has Hank singing everything from the raucous
``Daddy Packed His Suitcase 'Cause Momma Was a Mean Old Bag'' and
``Every Dog Has His Day'' to the tender love song ``My Heart Goes
Wild for You'' and ``The Curse of the Incredible Priceless Corncob.''
   Supplementing the books with audio tapes appealed to Erickson
because his writing style is heavily influenced by storytelling.
   ``One of the major tasks of a young writer is to find the voice
he's most comfortable with that can express what he wants,'' he
said. ``I tried on a lot of voices before I began imitating the way
the cowboys told stories. That's when my stories really began to
click.''
   Erickson uses a folksy, conversational style in the tales, all
told by Hank himself.
   Some of the cowdog's zany adventures are inspired by the author's
own cowdog, a blue heeler named Sophie, as well as the antics of his
three children.
   ``A lot of those Hank episodes come from experiences that I've
had or seen on ranches,'' he said. ``Some of them come from my
observations of dogs. I grew up with dogs, and I used to sleep, eat
and play, do everything with my dog.''
   Erickson's humorous depictions of ranch life were drawn from
eight years spent working as a cowboy on ranches in Oklahoma and
Texas. His stint in the publishing business lasted through the
production of 10 Hank books before Texas Monthly began publishing
the books a year ago.
   Changes made by the new publisher included printing books in
larger type for children.
   ``The original Hank audience was all adults, but somewhere along
the line that changed,'' he said. ``We didn't do anything
different.''
   Erickson no longer worries about running out of Hank plots.
   ``It's great fun writing the Hank stories,'' he said. ``I'll go
on writing them as long as I'm having fun. I don't ever want it to
turn into a job, because I think the strain would show.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: The Circle Goes On</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen years ago, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band
put out the record ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken.''
   Today, the newest LP from the Long Beach, Calif., folk rockers is
``Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume 2.'' The new, double LP
entered the Top 10 on the country best-selling charts in July and is
climbing the pop charts. Two singles from it, ``Turn of the
Century'' and ``And So It Goes,'' the latter with John Denver, are
on the country chart.
   Guitarist and founding band member Jeff Hanna recalled in an
interview that it was then-manager Bill McEuen who had the idea for
the first ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' album.
   ``We were hippie musicians from California, considered a rock
band, getting together with elder statesmen of country music. I
hadn't yet had my 23rd birthday,'' he said.
   ``There was definitely a generation difference. I think
sociologically we were bridging a gap, too. The record was viewed as
helping break down some barriers.''
   Country musician Earl Scruggs and his sons, Randy, Gary and
Steve, came to one of the band's concerts and they struck up a
friendship.
   ``That became the seed that became the first `Circle' album,''
Hanna said.
   Scruggs helped get other country musicians to play on the album.
The only one who declined, Hanna recalls, was Bill Monroe. ``He
didn't think his fans would understand him playing music with a rock
'n' roll band.
   ``We've done concerts with Bill in the last few years. It wasn't
personal animosity, I guess. I'm glad it wasn't.''
   All the guests from the first album who are still living are on
the new one except for Doc Watson who is semi-retired. They are Roy
Acuff, Jimmy Martin, Vassar Clements and Earl and Randy Scruggs.
   Recording was done in Randy Scruggs' studio in Berryhill, Tenn.,
last December and January. ``There were usually two or three great
tracks. We let the artist choose. We didn't splice,'' Hanna said.
The entire album is acoustic.
   Johnny Cash sings on the opening ``Life's Railway to Heaven.''
   ``We put him first because in Europe a couple of years ago he
said if we ever did another `Will the Circle Be Unbroken,' he'd be
happy to appear on it,'' explains Bob Carpenter, who plays keyboards
and accordion in the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
   ``We did a couple of shows with them in Europe,'' Hanna said.
``June Carter went on about how much Mother Maybelle loved us. She
called us `them dirty boys.' We got a kick out of that. They were
the guardians of traditional country music. That gave the idea a
blessing.''
   But they didn't rush into it because they wanted to get it right.
   ``The first time was all traditional tunes, honky-tonk blues,
Hank Williams songs,'' Carpenter said. ``This time, we asked people
to bring in songs, traditional or traditional sounding. We're
looking at where country music stands now.
   ``Our manager read a story that Bruce Hornsby said if he was on a
desert island he'd want the `Will the Circle Be Unbroken' album. We
called him up for this and he jumped at the chance.'' Hornsby
reworked his own ``The Valley Road'' into bluegrass.
   Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman perform ``You Ain't Going
Nowhere,'' which they recorded in 1969 on one of the first folk-rock
albums, the Byrds' ``Sweetheart of the Radio.''
   Levon Helm, whose music in the Band is now considered country,
and John Denver, who had recorded songs by Dirt Band members but
never recorded with them, were invited. There are also appearances
by John Prine, Emmlylou Harris, Paulette Carlson of Highway 101,
Michael Martin Murphey and Rosanne Cash in a duet with John Hiatt.
   ``June Carter was in the booth singing backup with her sisters on
`Life's Railway to Heaven' and she said, `I could swear I hear
Mama's guitar.' Anita or Helen had brought it in. She recognized the
sound without seeing it,'' Hanna said.
   When they made the first ``Circle'' album, the group felt it had
to be on its best behavior. ``I think Roy Acuff was especially
reticent about what was going on. He came in when we were doing the
Merle Travis sessions. We were auditioning for him. He told us
making the new record was more fun than the first time around,''
Hanna said.
   When pop radio stopped playing country rock in the late 1970s,
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band went Nashville. One of its last pop hits
was ``An American Dream'' in 1980. Its first country single, on
which Ricky Scaggs played, was ``Long Hard Road'' in 1982.
   ``We've had 15 consecutive top 10 singles on the country
charts,'' Hanna said.
   The band's last album for Warner Bros. was ``More Great Dirt,''
out in January. ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' is its first for
Universal.
   For the last two years, since John McEuen left, the band has been
a quartet with Hanna, Carpenter, drummer Jimmie Fadden and guitarist
Jimmy Ibbotson. Hanna has donated the washboard he used for both
`Circle' albums to the Country Music Hall of Fame.

   While Paramount Communications Inc. appeals a
judge's decision allowing Time Inc. to proceed with a $14 billion
tender offer for Warner Communications Inc., lawyers and corporate
executives have begun studying the opinion to see how it might
affect transactions between other firms.
   Friday's decision by Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T.
Allen disputed the claim by Paramount _ which is trying to buy Time
in a $12.2 billion hostile tender offer _ that Time directors put
the company up for sale when they agreed to a friendly stock-swap
merger with Warner last March.
   The Delaware Supreme Court later agreed to hear the case. If
Paramount loses there it will pave the way for Time and Warner to
merge, forming Time Warner Inc., the world's largest communications

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Says Iran Will Develop Gas Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hashemi Rafsajani, widely expected to be
Iran's next president, says he plans to focus the country's economic
future on developing its vast natural gas reserves, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   It quoted Rafsanjani, Iran's Parliament speaker, as saying in an
interview with the radical Jomhuri Islami daily published Sunday
that Iran should intensify exploitation of its gas reserves ``as the
best and richest sources of energy.''
   This should be a key part of Iran's post-war reconstruction
program, he said.
   Iran has natural gas reserves estimated at 700 trillion cubic
feet, the second largest reserves in the world after the Soviet
Union. But these have been largely left untapped.
   Building up gas as a major export and energy source most likely
would involve major foreign financial and technological assistance,
indicating that Rafsanjani could be planning to revive his efforts
to rebuild Iran's links with the West.
   His moves to end Iran's isolation suffered a setback in February
with a radical resurgence triggered by British writer Salam
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini charged blasphemed Islam.
   With Khomeini's death June 3 and the ascendance of Rafsanjani's
so-called pragmatists, the prospect of renewed moves to patch up
differences with the West has emerged again.
   The newspaper apparently did not elaborate on Rafsanjani's
remarks regarding gas.
   But Western and Iranian economic analysts have noted in recent
months that Iran's leaders must make decisions soon on a major
restructuring of the economy to take the country into the 21st
century.
   The most crucial decision, they say, is whether Iran will
continue to base its economy on the long-term value of its oil with
costly investment, or focus on gas, which energy specialists believe
will be in more global demand than oil in the decades to come.
   Iran has rebuilt much of its oil industry, which was badly
damaged in the eight-year war with Iraq, and is seeking to develop
new fields.
   But because of aging equipment and high production costs, Iran's
current oil output is about 3 million barrels a day, and experts say
it cannot produce any more than that economically. This makes Iran
prey to price fluctuations since it cannot compensate for price
drops by boosting output.
   Some industry specialists estimate that for every $1 drop in the
price of a barrel of oil, Iran's revenue from oil exports tumbles by
$2 billion a year.
   Oil provides 90 percent of Iran's foreign exchange earnings.
   Rafsanjani noted in the interview that the Iranian economy is in
poor shape.
   He confirmed estimates by analysts that industry is running at
only 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity ``due to a shortage of
materials, energy and parts,'' and that there has been massive waste
of resources in the first decade of the Islamic revolution.
   Most analysts agree that the Iranian leadership must move fast on
economic strategy.
   Before the revolution, Iran could feed itself. Now because of
poor economic management, failure to carry out land redistribution
following the revolution and an urban drift away from rural areas,
the country has a food import bill that runs $2 billion to $3
billion a year.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T To Exchange Stake In Olivetti For Share Of Holding Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. says it
will end its six-year partnership in Italian computer maker Ing. C.
Olivetti and Co. in exchange for a stake in Olivetti's parent
company.
   AT&amp;T said it agreed to swap its 22.2 percent stake in Olivetti
for a more liquid 18.6 percent interest in Compagnie Industriali
Riunite SpA, or CIR, a key holding company of Italian financier
Carlo De Benedetti.
   The swap amounts to exchanging a $735 million Olivetti stake for
a $635 million CIR holding, based on current share prices, the
telecommunications company said. Executives said that probably
little or no cash would change hands.
   The complex financial transaction was announced Saturday at a
joint news conference here by De Benedetti, chairman of both CIR and
Olivetti, and Robert Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T.
   The deal signals a first-ever diversification for AT&amp;T outside
the high-technology industry. In addition to its stake in Olivetti,
CIR has major interests in financial services, publishing,
mechanical engineering and auto parts.
   As a result of the transaction, CIR will consolidate its control
of Olivetti by raising its stake to 40 percent, and, following a
number of capital increases, will raise as much as 2.65 trillion
lire, or the equivalent of $1.9 billion, in fresh funds for De
Benedetti's financial empire.
   One of the planned capital increases will be arranged by
Olivetti, which hopes to raise the equivalent of $900 million in
support of its expansion plans.
   The two executives admitted that the original 1983 AT&amp;T-Olivetti
relationship, which combined an original 25 percent stake by AT&amp;T in
Olivetti with a wide-ranging technological and commercial agreement,
hadn't lived up to expectations. AT&amp;T said it paid about $260
million for its original stake.
   Under the 1983 accord, AT&amp;T bought Olivetti personal computers
for resale under it own name in the United States, but these sales
have seriously slumped over the past few years.
   Allen told the news conference that the alliance with CIR gives
AT&amp;T ``a sizeable investment in a broad base of European buinesses.''
   He declined to comment on whether this diversification by AT&amp;T
outside the high tech field would be followed by similar moves.
   Both executives said the upgrading of AT&amp;T's financial alliance
with Olivetti to the level of the holding company wouldn't alter the
commercial relationship between the two groups.
   They said that Olivetti will continue to supply AT&amp;T with
personal computers for sale in the United States even though AT&amp;T
agreed earlier last week to jointly develop personal computers with
Intel Corp.
   Likewise, Olivetti will continue to sell AT&amp;T minicomputers in
Europe and is expected to sell AT&amp;T's Starlan local area network.
   De Benedetti said the restructuring of the alliance with AT&amp;T
doesn't mean Olivetti is looking for another partner. He denied
recent newspaper reports that Olivetti was negotiating a partnership
with a European computer company.
   AT&amp;T will be represented on CIR's board with three seats,
including one reserved for Allen. The alliance will last for at
least five years.
   The De Benedetti holding company has assets throughout Europe
valued at about $4.69 billion. It had a profit of $280 million last
year.
   The 40-percent Olivetti shareholding is CIR's single largest
investment, accounting for about 30 percent of its total holdings.
Financial investments represent about 15 percent of its invesments,
publishing about 14 percent, auto parts 12 percent and mechanical
engineering 3 percent.

   The stock market declined slightly today, backing
away from the post-crash highs it reached last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.12 to 2,549.70
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 370 up, 526 down and
503 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.38 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the market gained ground in each of the first nine sessions of
July through the end of last week, the debate intensified over when
the rally might be due for at least a brief pause.
   But analysts said that mood of skepticism actually served to keep
the advance going, by keeping the flow of potential buying power
into stocks at a slow but steady pace.
   Brokers said the new week began with an added element over
caution over the impending monthly report Tuesday on the nation's
international balance of trade.
   The data for May are expected to show an increase in the trade
deficit to $9 billion or more from $8.3 billion in April.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down ] at
43[; McDonald's, down \ at 29~; General Electric, down \ at 54], and
American Express, down [ at 34}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.06 to 185.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .41 at 368.53.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.50 to a new
post-crash high of 2,554.82, extending its gain for the week to
66.96 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the

   Business inventories rose 0.7 percent in May
while sales were virtually flat, the government said today in
further signs of slackening economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May
following a 0.8 percent rise in April.
   Business sales, meanwhile, increased a minuscule 0.02 percent to
a seasonally adjusted $517.9 billion after rising 2.0 in April.
Sales had held steady in March after falling 0.9 percent in
February, the steepest decline since January 1987.
   The May business activity produced an slight increase in the
ratio of inventories to sales. It was 1.50, meaning it would take
1.50 months to exhaust inventories at the May sales pace. The ratio
stood at 1.49 in April and 1.51 in March.
   When not accompanied by increases in sales, rising inventories
could threaten a recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back
production until stockpiled goods are sold.
   The May figures were further signs of a slowing economy, prompted
by Federal Reserves credit-tightening measures designed to halt
inflation. Business inventories often rise during periods of slow
economic growth as production outpaces demand.
   The Commerce Department's retail sales figures for June,
releasedlast Friday, showed a 0.4 percent decline as consumer
spending remained sluggish, particularly for cars and other more
costly durable goods. Sales also dropped 0.1 percent in May,
producing the first monthly back-to-back drop since the
September-October period of 1987.
   The automobile industry has seen a recent buildup of unsold
vehicles and the Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.9
percent in May. It said sales were off 1.8 percent from April.
   Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5
percent. Manufacturers sales fell 0.2 percent and retailers were
down 0.1 percent.
   On the other hand, all categories showed an increased inventories
in May. Manufacturers' backlogs were up 0.6 percent, retailers' rose
0.9 percent and wholesalers' climbed 0.8 percent.

   Thousands of union coal miners returned
to work today, but some wildcat strikers continued their protest,
threatening to cloud the goodwill message their leaders want to send.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, who was to meet
Tuesday with a federal judge in Virginia and hoped to show the
miners' desire to return to work, called for an end to unauthorized
pickets and a monthlong wildcat strike.
   Most UMW locals east of the Mississippi River met during the
weekend and approved Trumka's request, which he issued Friday.
   ``I'd say the vote was 99 percent to return to work,'' Nick
Molnar, president of District 2 in Pennsylvania, said today. The
district has 3,500 miners at 52 sites in 23 counties.
   In southern West Virginia and western Kentucky, however, wildcat
strikers again disrupted coal production today.
   ``Man, they're upset,'' said Danny Wells, a district board
representative in UMW District 17, the nation's largest with 6,000
miners. ``They are just upset with Trumka's call. They feel that's
nothing been won yet.''
   About 2,850 Peabody Coal Co. miners in West Virginia remained off
the job today, company spokesman Tom Clarke said.
   ``It's my understanding that all of our mines outside of West
Virginia with the exception of the Camp Complex in Kentucky are
working,'' Clarke said.
   Trumka's back-to-work order applied everywhere except District
31, in northern West Virginia, Monday through Wednesday and in
District 6, in eastern Ohio and West Virginia's Northern Panhandle,
from Wednesday through Friday. The union didn't explain the
exeptions.
   Up to 46,000 miners in 10 states began wildcat strikes June 12 to
support 1,900 other UMW members who have been striking the Pittston
Coal Group Inc. since April 5.
   Pittston was struck in part for its refusal to sign a contract
guaranteeing full medical benefits for pensioners and prohibiting
mandatory overtime and Sunday work.
   The wildcat strikers also were protesting what they say were
excessive fines and jail terms imposed on UMW members and supporters
picketing Pittston Coal headquarters in Lebanon, Va.
   Coal companies in states other than Kentucky and West Virginia
reported no problems today, although their employees were unhappy
over the back-to-work order.
   ``This situation at Pittston is not over, so naturally there is
some unhappiness,'' said Jerry Jones, president of UMW District 12.
``Everybody has the same sentiments and feeling.
   ``But Trumka has asked everybody to return to work as he tried to
get the sides back to the bargaining table, which is what we are
doing.''
   Illinois miners returned to their jobs early Saturday at some of
the state's 40 unionized mines that had scheduled weekend work.
   Miners working a shift beginning at midnight reported without
incident to the Central Ohio Coal Co. surface mine, which covers
parts of four counties and employs 700 miners, said Pete Carpenter,
a clerk at the mine office, near Cumberland in Guernsey County.
   Alabama and Indiana miners also began returning to work during
the weekend. Missouri and Virginia miners had ended wildcat protests
last month.
   In West Virginia, however, pickets showed up outside a Hobet
Mining Co. operation near Holden, about 60 miles south of
Charleston, and UMW employees refused to cross the picket line. The
story was the same at Island Creek Coal Co. mines in West Virginia
and Kentucky.
   ``I don't reckon they'll be working,'' said a guard at Island
Creek's Elk Creek No. 10 mine near Emmett, W.Va. Mine officials
contacted said only that work hadn't resumed.
   Island Creek's Hamilton Mines Nos. 1 and 2 and its Ohio No. 11
mine _ all in western Kentucky _ also didn't reopen with the
midnight shift, as had been scheduled.
   Many miners and their leaders say they are encouraged that U.S.
District Judge Glen Williams had written to Trumka and Paul Douglas,
chairman of The Pittston Co. _ parent of Pittston Coal _ and asked
for Tuesday's meeting to discuss why negotiations broke down last
month.
   It was unclear whether Douglas, who has refused previous meetings
with Trumka, would attend.
   ``The people and Mr. Trumka have to prove that the union is
sincere about wanting a fair contract,'' said Lewis Blankenship,
president of UMW Local 7970 at Coal Mountain. ``With the letter that
Judge Williams sent, we want to show that we're willing to work.''
   A union official speaking on condition of anonymity said many of
the wildcat strikers in West Virginia actually are striking Pittston
employees. Under federal labor law, those miners are banned from
picketing other sites.

   A lengthy drilling spurt stumbled slightly this
week as the number of oil and gas rigs working in the United States
dropped by five to total 820, halting a seven-week trend, according
to Baker Hughes Inc.
   The company said there is no obvious reason for the decline in a
year that has defied common drilling trends.
   ``We don't think the weather would explain the decline in all of
these states. Some people have suggested that what we need to see
are higher natural gas prices,'' Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge
said Monday.
   ``But there are a lot of things this year that don't make a lot
of sense,'' he said. ``We saw little drilling in March when you
normally expect firmer prices, and then we saw some recovery in
April when you usually get declining prices.''
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana posted the biggest
decline this week with nine fewer rigs, followed by New Mexico,
seven; Oklahoma, six; and North Dakota, two.
   Texas was the biggest gainer with nine additional rigs, followed
by Ohio and Michigan, two; and Colorado, one. California,
Pennsylvania and Wyoming were unchanged for the week.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather was the dominant feature in the market, particularly a
National Weather Service forecast released after the close of
trading Friday that called for above-average precipitation and
below-average temperatures for the next 6-10 days.
   The July soybeans contract, at the center of last week's storm
over a possible attempt to corner the market, was 16{ cents lower.
   But weather clearly was at center stage this morning, as
evidenced by the fact that new crop soybeans were bid even lower
than the old crop contracts, and corn was falling the daily trading
limit lower across the board.
   On the open, wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 6 cents to
a limit-down 10 cents lower, with July at $2.50 a bushel; oats were
9 cents to 10 cents lower, with September at $1.49 a bushel; and
soybeans were 17{ cents to 29{ cents lower, with July at $6.86 a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .70 cent higher, with August at
72.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .63 cent
higher, with August at 83.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .1 cent
to .5 cent higher, with July at 47.70 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .2 cent to .85 cent lower, with July at 29.15 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. will buy the
retail brokerage offices and customer accounts of Thomson McKinnon
Inc. in a transaction announced today that replaces a full merger of
the securities firms.
   Prudential Securities Group on Friday called off its plan to
purchase all of Thomson McKinnon, which could have created the
nation's third-largest brokerage operation.
   The deal, announced June 13, was canceled after Prudential
discovered problems with Thomson McKinnon's financial records,
including a reported $80 million difference between its liabilities
and assets.
   But negotiations over the weekend yielded the retail brokerage
deal, under which Prudential-Bache will take over Thomson McKinnon's
154 branch offices and 2,000 brokers. Prudential-Bache is the
brokerage arm of Prudential Securities, which in turn is owned by
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   ``When it became clear a merger was not feasible, rather than
parting ways, we worked together to develop this new arrangement,''
Prudential-Bache Chairman George L. Ball and Thomson McKinnon
Chairman J. Ronald Morgan said in a joint statement.
   People familiar with the deal said today that Prudential-Bache
would pay $60 million for the offices and accounts plus $60 million
over three years as part of an incentive package to keep Thomson
McKinnon brokers from leaving.
   Prudential-Bache also said it plans to purchase about a 5 percent
interest in Thomson McKinnon Asset Management LP, the firm's only
publicly traded entity, which operates its money and investment
management business.
   Prudential-Bache said it will distribute mutual funds managed by
Thomson McKinnon Asset Management.
   Thomson McKinnon, founded in 1885, has struggled since the 1987
stock market crash and repeatedly entered into sale negotiations
with other major Wall Street firms.
   Last October, Thomson McKinnon, the nation's ninth-largest
brokerage, said it was looking for a buyer to purchase the 23
percent stake in the privately held company owned by the Hartford
Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp. Thomson McKinnon, considered a
mid-size brokerage, has 4,700 employees.
   Thomson McKinnon said they planned to sell the firm's remaining
assets, such as its capital markets, Hong King and administrative
operations, in the coming months, marking an end to the firm.
   Prudential-Bache, the nation's fourth-largest securities firm,
has about 16,000 employees and more than 320 offices worldwide. The
deal adds to Prudential-Bache's exisiting retail sales force of
about 6,000.

<HEAD>London Buses Hit by Strikes, Widespread Industrial Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of London's famous red buses were off the
roads on Monday as another strike by maintenance engineers stopped
them leaving their depots.
   The 24-hour stoppage over pay was one of a string of walkouts
creating the worst industrial unrest of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's 10 years in power.
   Railwaymen, city hall employees and dock workers were also
striking or engaged in sporadic walkouts and firefighters at
London's Heathrow airport were discussing a strike which could close
the world's busiest international airport next week.
   Unions were angered by pay hikes lagging behind a national
inflation rate of 8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nation European
Economic Community, while dock workers were demanding retention of
national bargaining.
   The capital faced more travel chaos on Tuesday in a fifth
combined one-day strike that would all railway trains in Britain and
the London subway.
   The National Union of Railwaymen, which has started weekly
one-day strikes, was meeting to discuss a revised pay offer by the
British Rail board, which hiked its rejected 7 percent increase to
8.8 percent last week.
   The train crews' union, the Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen, has banned voluntary overtime and rest-day
working indefinitely, causing cancelation of trains.
   British Rail was hoping Monday's negotiations might get Tuesday's
strikes called off but union leaders said that was unlikely as there
would not be time to ballot their members.
   A three-day strike over pay by 500,000 white collar workers
employed in public services by city halls throughout Britain was set
to start at midnight Monday, the third walkout in three weeks.
   The city hall strikes stop care services for children and the
elderly, shut slaughterhouses as meat inspectors are not available
and close local tax offices, museums and libraries.
   On the seventh day of an indefinite national docks strike at 60
of the country's 162 ports, dock workers' leaders from Belgium,
France and West Germany were expected in London to discuss possible
solidarity action at European ports.
   The visitors were meeting at the headquarters of the 1.4 million
member Transport and General Workers Union, Britain's largest labor
union. The union organized the strike in support of demands that
port employers maintain national bargaining after the abolition of a
government system guaranteeing dock workers' jobs whether they had
cargoes to handle or not.
   The union said the International Transport Workers Federation
called the one-day conference to discuss the British strike and that
the Dutch had already asked their members to organize sympathy
action.
   The 80 firefighters at Heathrow airport were balloting over
strike action in protest at the airport's rejection of their claim
for a 20 percent pay hike.
   A spokeswoman for the management said: ``The airport has to have
fire cover for operations, so potentially operations could shut down
if there was a strike.''

   About 2,000 Georgia-Pacific plywood workers
returned to work today after a week-long strike ended with
ratification of a new contract, a company spokesman said.
   ``The picket lines went down in Arkansas on Sunday afternoon, and
the rest in Mississippi were down by late evening,''
Georgia-Pacific's Terry Hadaway said. ``We do have a ratification of
the contract by all of the locations involved.''
   In Arkansas, boilers at plywood plants in Crossett and Fordyce
were re-started early today, and workers returned for shifts at 6
a.m. and 7 a.m., Hadaway said.
   About 1,000 workers were on strike in Arkansas and an equal
number walked out at G-P plants in Louisville, Taylorsville, and
Gloster, Miss., Hadaway said.
   Plants at all five cities should be back in full production
within a couple of days, the spokesman said.
   The strike began last Monday. It idled most operations at the
Arkansas and Mississippi plants, although processing of green veneer
continued under supervision of management employees, Hadaway said.
The plants would have routinely been closed on Saturday and Sunday,
meaning five days of production were affected.
   ``Our goal was to get people back to work as quickly as possible.
With the union's help, we accomplished that,'' Hadaway said.
   Union officials and Hadaway said strikers approved a new contract
proposal in voting Sunday. The four-year contract calls for pay
increases of 3 percent each year and allows for one-time bonuses to
some workers who are losing time-and-a-half pay on Sunday.
   The original offer called for a 2 percent increase the first,
second and fourth years of the contract and a 3 percent hike only in
the third year.
   The pay hikes are retroactive to June 1.
   Workers on the second and third shifts will get 208 times their
classified hourly pay rate and boiler, maintenance and electrical
department workers will get bonuses equal to 104 times their
classified hourly rates, officials said.
   The old contract expired June 1, but negotiators continued talks
for more than a month until they broke off July 7. Georgia-Pacific
representatives made the company's latest offer during two days of
negotiations with union representative last week at Vicksburg, Miss.
   Some union members, however, were disappointed.
   ``We're getting less now than we were in 1985 and 1986,'' said
Eloise Harris, who works in the gluing department. ``I think it
should have been more.''
   The loss of Sunday premium pay upset Lloyd Williams, vice
president of the Crossett union.
   ``It means a big loss to me in wages,'' Williams said. ``It's a
big loss to me and my family and a big gain for them (the company).
The bonus won't make up for it.''
   When the strike began, Hadaway said the company would shut down,
at least temporarily, the plants which manufacture southern pine
plywood for residential and commercial construction.
   Before the contract, the minimum hourly pay at the plant was
$7.90.

   Product liability causes as much as $80 billion
to change hands each year, for insurance, courts, damage awards,
legal fees, expert witnesses and the like.
   But less than 50 cents on the dollar goes to anyone who is
injured, says Peter W. Huber, a legal scholar, in a report just
published by the Center for the Study of American Business.
   Roughly 60 percent is siphoned off by the system's overhead,
according to Huber, adding that ``in most states you would be
prosecuted for fraud if you ran a charity with 60 percent overhead.''
   That isn't the half of what Hubert, a businessman and attorney in
private practice, as well as a senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute for Policy Research, has to say about the system.
   Not only does most of the money evade the victim, he says, but it
can be shown that the system does little to improve product safety
and, in fact, might lower it.
   On top of this, he adds, it thwarts production of useful
products. Small-plane manufacturers, for example, have been so
devastated by liability problems that safety advancements have been
slowed rather than hastened.
   ``It would seem that most private pilots have not read the legal
theorists,'' he says, ``because most _ this pilot certainly included
_ are begging Washington to cut back on their right to sue.''
   The Center, founded by Murray Weidenbaum, chief economic adviser
in President Reagan's first term, published Huber's comments after
he lectured earlier this year at the Washington University School of
Law, St. Louis. The center is based at the university.
   To most people, Huber acknowledged, $1 billion is just a lot of
zeros. But relate the liability insurance cost to the prices of
specific products and the impact becomes starkly real.
   Liability insurance, he contends, is $100 of the cost of a $200
football helmet, $20,000 on the $60,000 price of a small plane, $11
on a certain childhood vaccine that sells for $12, and $20 on a $100
household ladder.
   The insurance payoff to victims _ decimated though it is by
overhead _ is uniquely regressive, he says. It is bad enough that so
much is siphoned off by the system, but the system also rewards the
rich much better than the poor.
   ``Wealthy people get much more insurance of the liability system
than poor people, because liability covers lost income and,
increasingly, such things as `hedonic damages' _ payment for the
loss of the pleasures of life,'' Huber says.
   ``Donald Trump and Donald Trump's chauffeur pay the same
liability premium when each one buys a stepladder, or a car, or a
vaccine,'' he continues, ``but the benefits they get are very much
proportional to their quite different wealth and social status.''
   Huber is well qualified to address the subject and offer
recommendations _ he holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering as
well as a law degree.
   First, he says, we must rebuild and attempt to rely on the
principles of contracts, ``rediscovering some basic notions like
consent, assumption of risk and other features of a bilateral,
before-the-fact choice.''
   If principles of contract are unacceptable, he suggests we might
give more power to the opinions of prudent, competent experts. Full
compliance with standards established by such people, he says,
should be allowed as a defense.
   Finally, he contends that society would be well served if
insurability were restored to the system by attacking features that
have made many products uninsurable, and because of this, less
available to the public.
   These include runaway non-economic damages that insurers dare not
cover, such as punitive, pain and suffering, etc., and loose
interpretations of cause-effect and scientific evidence.
   He suggests far too much reliance is placed on the courts. Too
often the courts are asked to determine liability after the product
is sold, sometimes years later. Better, suggests Huber, to define
conditions in advance.

<HEAD>Mute Button: Another Weapon Against Advertising?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of worrying about ``zappers'' who use
remote controls to make rapid-fire channel switches during
commercials, television advertisers are facing another weapon: the
muting button.
   Some advertisers sound off against prospective muters, or deny
that they exist, but som industry observers claim the muting threat
is having an impact on the modern commercial.
   ``You can see how much more entertaining commercials are now.
That I feel is an indication that they are quite concerned, that
they can't just present the product,'' said Camille Elebash, an
advertising professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
   ``My guess is that the button has had a modest effect, no doubt
about it. It's one of the factors influencing the reformatting of
commercials, making commercials look more like rock videos,
sportscasts or newscasts,'' said Everette Dennis, executive director
of the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University.
   Bobby Calder, a professor of marketing and psychology at
Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management called the
mute button's impact obvious.
   ``The traditional way (of advertising) is to very early on get
attention, identify the product, but that may be precisely the kind
of activity that signals people to turn off the sound,'' he said.
   Advertisers can fight back, says Calder, with the same tactics
they use against zapping, such as building interest slowly, telling
some kind of story, or creating a commercial so cute that viewers
just want to watch it.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. made such an attempt during this year's Super
Bowl, with a series of commercials featuring a game between teams of
animated beer bottles labeled Bud and Bud Light. If sports fans
watched the last spot, they knew Bud eked out a last-minute victory.
   One recent campaign for Goodyear had no spoken words at all. Made
by Hill, Holliday, Connors &amp; Cosmopoulos Inc., the commercials
flashed a series of images and questions, such as ``Are you ready
for a change?'' accompanied by a hard rock musical track.
   John F. Farrell, executive vice president and chief creative
director for Hill, Holliday, said the threat of remote control
muting had no influence on the campaign's style.
   Zenith Electronics Corp. included a mute button on the first
remote control device, introduced in the 1950s, and on every remote
control the company issued thereafter.
   One 1957 Zenith advertisment even urged consumers to ``just touch
a button to shut off the sound of long, annoying commercials while
the picture remains on the screen.''
   In 1989, an A.C. Nielsen survey showed 72 percent of a
4,000-person sample owned remote control mechanisms, compared with
29 percent of a survey group in 1985.
   Still, while zapping gained attention several years ago, many in
the advertising industry turn a deaf ear to the concept of consumer
muting.
   ``My gut tells me that its a non-issue. I just don't believe that
people do that,'' said Allen Banks, a media director for Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi DFS Advertising Inc.
   According to a 1986 survey by Television Audience Assessment, 40
percent of 3,000 day-time viewers sampled missed commercials, but
muting or changing the channels accounted for only about 5 percent.
   Other advertisers said they recognized the power of the mute
button, but were resigned to its use.
   ``While zapping is more of a boredom mechanism, muting seems to
be an issue of someone has something else to do. I think at that
point we've lost them anyway,'' said Bill Oakley, the creative
director on the Budweiser account and vice president of Darcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles-St. Louis.

<HEAD>Ford Recalls Nearly 2 Million Cars and Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 2 million Ford Motor Co. cars and
light trucks were recalled Monday because of problems with emissions
systems and the possibility of engine fires.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker said owners of 296,000 1984 Ford
Escort and EXP and Mercury Lynx automobiles were being notified that
cracks in their cars' cylinder heads could leak oil onto exhaust
manifolds.
   Also, owners of 222,000 1985{ model Escort and Lynx cars were
being told that a rocker-cover gasket, also called a valve gasket,
could leak allowing oil to drip on the manifolds.
   Both conditions could cause engine fires, the company said.
   The 1985{ Escort and Lynx vehicles were introduced late in the
model year. Ford did not designate any Escort or Lynx cars as 1985
models.
   Ford spokesman Michael Parris said the company received two
reports of hand burns, most likely sustained when the owner was
putting out the fire. He did not know the severity of the injuries
or have an estimate on how many engine fires were caused by either
problem.
   Another safety recall involved about 28,000 1989 Ford Ranger and
Bronco II four-wheel-drive vehicles with automatic locking
front-wheel hubs. The company said some of the vehicles may have
been built without a locking key in the left front hubs, which could
cause the left front wheel to fall off.
   The company also said it was recalling about 1.4 million 1985-87
cars to correct a problem with their emissions control systems.
   The problem stems from the fuel injectors, engine control modules
or catalysts.
   Included in the recall are 1985-87 Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz
cars with 2.3-liter and 2.3-liter high output engines, 1986-87 Ford
Taurus and Sable cars with 2.5-liter engines and 1987 Ford Escort,
Mercury Lynx and Ford EXP vehicles with 1.0-liter engines.
   The company said testing by Ford and the California Air Resources
Board showed that hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions passed
acceptable limits.
   Ford said the emissions recall would be phased in because of the
number of vehicles involved. Notifications would be sent first to
owners in California.
   Inspection and repairs in all of the recalls would be performed
at no cost to the customer.

<HEAD>NCR Corp. Says Earnings Fell 2 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCR Corp. said its earnings fell 2 percent in
the second quarter, hurt by a stock-repurchase program, increased
research and development spending and the strength of the dollar.
   Net income declined to $110.4 million from $112.4 million a year
earlier. Earnings per share, boosted by the reduction in shares
through repurchases, rose 4 percent to a record $1.42 from $1.36 in
the same period last year.
   A drop in earnings per share in the first quarter had broken a
string of record quarterly earnings per share that began in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
   Second-quarter revenue totaled a record $1.53 billion, a 2
percent increase from last year's $1.50 billion. The revenue growth
occurred even though NCR's returns were hurt by the impact of the
stronger U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies, NCR Chairman
Charles Exley Jr. said.
   For six months, net income was $171.5 million, an 8 percent
decline from $186.6 million for the first half of 1989, NCR
reported. Earnings per share for the six months ended June 30 were
$2.17, down 3 percent from last year's $2.23. Revenue for the six
months was $2.778 billion, even with $2.778 billion last year.
   NCR reported buying 3.9 million shares of its common stock during
the first half of the year, leaving 6.1 million shares authorized
for future purchase in an ongoing program.

<HEAD>GE Earnings Up 16 Percent in 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., citing increased
productivity and demand for its products, on Monday reported its
second-quarter earnings rose 16 percent on a 14 percent increase in
revenue.
   The company said its profit rose to $972 million, or $1.08 a
share, from $835 million, or 93 cents a share, in the second quarter
of 1988.
   Consolidated revenues were $13.5 billion for the quarter, up from
$11.9 billion a year ago.
   For the first six months, the company had earnings of $1.82
billion, or $2.02 a share, up 17 percent from $1.56 billion, or
$1.73 a share, a year ago.
   Consolidated revenues for the half year were $25.4 billion, up 14
percent from the $22.4 billion for the first six months of 1988.
   ``Continued strong earnings performance was spurred by GE's
second-quarter operating margin rate _ 12.1 percent _ a record for
any quarter in our history,'' said GE chairman John F. Welch Jr.
   ``This performance resulted from sustained company-wide
productivity, as well as excellent volume increases in many of our
businesses,'' he said.
   Welch cited strong sales for GE jet engines and a resurgence in
the company's electrical generating equipment as key factors in the
earnings increase.
   GE has $2.4 billion in orders for power equipment. The company
also received $4 billion worth of orders for its jet engines,
bringing its backlog to $13 billion.
   The company said its broadcasting operations posted a strong
increase in operating profit on higher revenue from its NBC
television network and improved margins.

   The stock market struggled to some spotty gains
in slow trading today, getting a little more mileage out of its July
rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 66.96 points last
week, added 5.31 to 2,560.13 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 703 up, 702 down and 535
unchanged.
   As the market gained ground in each of the first nine sessions of
July through the end of last week, the debate intensified over when
the rally might be due for at least a brief pause.
   But analysts said that mood of skepticism actually served to keep
the advance going, by keeping the flow of potential buying power
into stocks at a slow but steady pace.
   Brokers said the new week began with an added element over
caution over the impending monthly report Tuesday on the nation's
international balance of trade.
   The data for May are expected to show an increase in the trade
deficit to $9 billion or more from $8.3 billion in April.
   Marion Laboratories led the active list and jumped 8 to 33\ on
word that Dow Chemical plans to acquire a chunk of Marion stock at
$38 a share, increasing its stake in the company to 67 percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.53 to 185.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.19 at 369.31.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 109.42 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A National Weather Service calling for above-average
precipitation and below-average temperatures for the next 6-10 days
sent the markets into a tailspin and most fell the daily trading
limit shortly after the opening bell.
   The July soybeans contract, which occupied the center of last
week's storm over what some viewed as an attempt by Italian
agribusiness giant Ferruzzi to corner the market, was 30 cents lower
at the close.
   But traders said weather clearly was at center stage, and they
noted that new crop soybeans were hit just as hard as the old crop
contracts, and that corn was down the limit and wheat sharply lower
as well.
   On the close, wheat was 7 cents to 8} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was 9 cents
to 12 cents lower, with July at $2.47} a bushel; oats were 9} cents
to 12 cents lower, with July at $1.38{ a bushel; and soybeans were
28 cents to 30 cents lower, with July at $6.73{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Texas Air Reportedly Discussing Boeing Jet Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. has little choice but to pursue a
reported $2.8 billion purchase of new jets, despite the
strike-induced bankruptcy at one of its major subsidiaries, industry
analysts said Monday.
   ``An ongoing Texas Air will need to have aircraft which are
competitive with other carriers and that are able to meet any noise
standards to be imposed,'' said James Carey, an analyst at
Washington-based Airline Economics Inc.
   ``Therefore, they have to raise the capital to make this
replacement to be competitive. All airlines do.''
   Texas Air, parent company of Continental and Eastern airlines, is
one of only two major U.S. carriers which have not announced major
jet purchases within the past several months.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting airline and aerospace industry
sources, reported Monday that the Boeing deal would involve the
purchase of 50 new 737-300s with options on 50 more with delivery
dates as early as 1991.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said Monday the company has been
talking to aircraft vendors, but would not confirm the Boeing
discussions.
   ``What we've been saying all along is that we are always
reviewing our options and talking to various suppliers,'' Kent said.
   Analysts said the narrow-body planes would be used mainly by
Houston-based Continental, which completed a bankruptcy
reorganization three years ago. The airline posted losses of $718
million last year and $255 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Eastern currently is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
supervision in the wake of a machinists strike that virtually shut
down the Miami-based airline.
   Robert J. Joedicke, an advisory director on the airline industry
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said analysts have known about the
Texas Air-Boeing discussions for some time.
   ``All they're doing is basically reserving a position for
deliveries five years down the road,'' Joedicke said. ``Prudence
would say they would have to have some aircraft on delivery by the
early 1990s.''
   ``It's something I would view more as insurance,'' Joedicke said,
adding he would be more surprised if Texas Air were not negotiating
a deal.
   Analysts said Texas Air could face a serious problem unless it
buys more planes because of expected noise limits that will restrict
the use of older jets and an average four- to five-year wait for
airplane deliveries.
   In the past, Texas Air has purchased new aircraft under a
sale-leaseback arrangement in which the parent company leases its
planes back to its subsidiaries, and analysts described that as a
likely scenario under current negotiations with Boeing.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez declined comment Monday on the
Texas Air talks, saying the Seattle-based company allows its
customers to announce purchases.

<HEAD>London Stock Exchange to Investigate BAT Trading Before Hostile Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London's Stock Exchange indicated Monday it will
conduct a routine investigation into trading of BAT Industries PLC
shares and options that took place before last Tuesday's hostile $21
billion bid for the British conglomerate.
   Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, joined by British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry
Packer, offered the equivalent of $13.69 a share in securities for
BAT, which quickly rejected the bid.
   ``We really don't discuss individual cases,'' said a spokeswoman
for the stock exchange, who wasn't identified in accordance with
British practice.
   But she said ``We would automatically investigate in a bid of
this size...particularly where there is unusual volume movements or
other suspicious factors that would alert our attention.''
   Prices and trading volume in both BAT shares and options surged
in the two trading sessions immediately ahead of the bid
announcement.
   The offer represents the second-biggest corporate takeover
attempt ever, trailing the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
earlier this year. BAT, the world's biggest tobacco company, also
has interests in retailing _ including the Saks Fifth Avenue and
Marshall Field's department stores in the United States _ paper
making and financial services.
   BAT shares climbed 31 cents a share in moderately active trading
last Monday, the day before the bid was announced, after advancing
29 cents the previous Friday.
   The shares rose $3.33 to close at $14.51 the day of the bid.
   On Monday, the shares finished at $14.15, up 3 cents.
   In options trading, 9,864 BAT options contracts changed hands
last Monday, representing an underlying volume of 10 million shares,
the spokeswoman confirmed. That accounted for nearly a quarter of
the options market's total volume that day. Last Tuesday, another
11,161 contracts were traded, she confirmed.
   The average daily volume in the previous week had been around
2,000 contracts, including the 4,000 contracts traded on Friday,
also an unusually active day, she stated.
   An investigation into BAT trading could take months. Even after
its conclusion, the exchange itself is unlikely to disclose the
outcome.
   ``We never officially comment,'' the spokeswoman said.
   While the stock exchange regularly engages in such probes, it is
unable to bring charges. Instead, it submits its findings to the
Department of Trade and Industry, which then decides whether or not
to prosecute.

<HEAD>Boise Cascade Profit Up 4.3 Percent; Great Northern Up 5.7 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. said Monday its second-quarter profit rose
4.3 percent, while another wood products company, Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp., said its eranings rose 5.7 percent for the period.
   Boise Cascade, based in Boise, Idaho, said its second quarter
earnings totaled $75.3 million, or $1.68 a share, up from $72.2
million, or $1.59 a share, during the same April-June period a year
ago.
   Second-quarter sales rose 8.3 percent to $1.09 billion from $1.01
billion a year earlier.
   For the first half of 1989, Boise Cascade earned $153.5 million,
or $3.42 a share, up from $140.7 million, or $3.06 a share, a year
earlier. First-half sales rose 8.3 percent to $2.19 billion from
$2.02 biliopn a year earlier.
   Chairman John Fery said an 18 percent increase in sales volume in
the office products segment coupled with the strongest performance
of the building products sector in two years offset a decline in
income from Boise Cascade's dominate paper products segment.
   Paper products, which account for 60 percent of the company's
sales, suffered during the spring from softness in the newsprint
market, higher wood chip costs in the Pacific Northwest and
maintenance downtime at several mills, Fery said. A gain from the
sale of the company's Specialty Paperboard Division was offset by
signing bonuses included in labor contract settlements at mills in
Alabama and Minnesota.
   Great Northern Nekoosa, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it earned
$90.2 million, or $1.63 a share, in the second quarter, up from
$85.3 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $988.4 million, up 15.3 percent from $856.9
million a year earlier.
   For the first six months, net income rose to $183.5 million, or
$3.32 a share, up from $163.6 million, or $2.98 a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales for the first six months rose to $1.97 billion from $1.70
billion.

   The dollar declined against most major currencies
except the Japanese yen in sluggish U.S. trading Monday, reversing
course after heading higher on overseas markets.
   Gold prices closed with minor changes. On the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose 20 cents to $371
a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of
$370.30 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, down 20 cents from
Friday's late bid.
   Peter Wild, a senior currency trader at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co.,
said a cautious mood prevailed in the foreign exchange markets with
participants reluctant to trade heavily before the U.S. merchandise
trade report for June is issued Tuesday. Volume was very light, he
said.
   The Commerce Department report on the country's merchandise trade
balance frequently influences the dollar's value and has an impact
on financial markets.
   Some economists say the dollar's strength this year could cause a
deterioration in the balance, pushing the U.S. deeper into deficit
in its trade with the rest of the world.
   Dealers on foreign markets described trading as nervous but the
volume of activity was heavier than in the United States.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 2.03 yen to a closing 141.53 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 141.95 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 141.43 yen, up from 140.85 Friday.
   The British pound fell to $1.6075 in London from $1.6125 late
Friday. Sterling fetched $1.6150 in New York, compared with Friday's
late level of $1.6050.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.9030 West German marks, down from 1.9125; 1.6445
Swiss francs, down from 1.6515; 6.4555 French francs, down from
6.4890; 1,380.00 Italian lire, down from 1,385.00; and, 1.19065
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1917 Canadian.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late rates
Friday included: 1.9138 West German marks, up from 1.9030; 1.6540
Swiss francs, up from 1.6455; 6.4890 French francs, up from 6.4575;
2.1580 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1400; 1,387.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,378.50, and 1.1905 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1916.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Gold bullion was bid at $372.20 a troy ounce late Monday in
London, up from late Friday's $370.50. In Zurich, the bid was
$370.75 an ounce, unchanged from late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 61 cents to close at a bid of
$372.02 an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $5.29 a troy ounce, up
from $5.25 late Friday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.263 a troy ounce, up from Friday's
settlement of $5.207.

<TEXT>
   Several of the nation's largest bank holding companies reported
differing results Monday, with second-quarter earnings down at Chase
Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. but up at Security
Pacific Corp.
   Chase, second to Citicorp in total assets, said its earnings fell
38.8 percent from mainly because of special factors that boosted
earnings in the year-earlier period.
   Third-ranked J.P. Morgan, parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.,
said its earnings fell 9.8 percent, hurt by its sharply higher cost
of funds during the period.
   Fifth-ranked Security Pacific said its earnings rose 20 percent
due partly to strong growth in domestic loans.
   Bad loans to Latin America continued hampering the banks'
results. U.S. bank regulators in June required banks to charge off
20 percent of their loans to Argentina.
   New York-based Chase reported a profit of $137 million, or $1.31
a share, down from $224 million, or $2.45 a share, a year earlier.
The 1988 second quarter included an after-tax gain of $69 million
the sale of an interest in Cain Chemical Inc. and the use of $35
million in federal tax benefits.
   Net interest income in the quarter increased to $791 million from
$782 million a year earlier, largely because of interest payments by
borrowers in Brazil, partly offset by non-payment by Argentine
borrowers, Chase said. Other operating income totaled $491 million,
down from $569 million a year earlier.
   For the first six months of 1989, Chase reported a profit of $269
million, or $2.59 a share, down from $501 million, or $5.53 a share,
a year earlier. The 1988 results included $120 million in after-tax
gains from asset sales and the use of $75 million in tax benefits
plus the income from the Cain sale.
   Net interest income for the first half rose to $1.62 billion from
$1.55 billion a year earlier. Other operating income for the first
six months totaled $911 million, down from $1.20 billion a year
earlier.
   Chase's new provisions for possible credit losses totaled $150
million in the second quarter, level with a year earlier, bringing
the total new provisions in the first half to $300 million, also
level with a year earlier.
   New York-based J.P. Morgan said its second-quarter profit fell to
$206 million, or $1.09 a share, from $229 million, or $1.23 a share,
in the comparable 1988 period.
   Net interest income fell to $316 million from $383 million a year
earlier, while non-interest income rose to $485 million from $376
million a year earlier.
   Morgan said earnings for the first six months of the year
declined to $386 million, or $2.05 per share, from $510 million, or
$2.75 per share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   For the six-month period, net interest income fell to $614
million from $824 million a year earlier, while non-interest income
rose to $879 million from $811 million a year earlier.
   Morgan's total of non-performing loans rose to $1.84 billion as
of June 30 from $1.62 billion a year earlier. Of that, loans to
Brazil accounted for $1.04 billion and loans to Argentina accounted
for $473 million.
   The company made an additional provision of $35 million for
credit losses in the quarter, compared to a provision of $30 million
a year earlier, bringing the total new provisions this year to $45
million, down from $80 million a year earlier.
   For the three months ended June 30, Los Angeles-based Security
Pacific said its net income totaled a record $184.5 million, or
$1.58 a share, up from $154.3 million, or $1.36 a share, in the
year-ago period.
   Net interest income rose to $732.2 million from $662.2 million a
year earlier, while non-interest income rose to $449.7 million from
$410.7 million a year earlier.
   For the first six months of 1989, Security Pacific's earnings
rose 21 percent to $363.8 million, or $3.12 a share, from $301.5
million, or $2.66 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   Net interest income for the first six months rose to $1.47
billion from $1.29 billion a year earlier. Non-interest income rose
to $881.3 million from $831.7 million a year earlier.
   Security Pacific Chairman Richard J. Flamson III said that in
addition to domestic loan growth, the holding company benefited from
an overall increase in non-interest income and slow growth in
non-interest expense.
   Security Pacific's portfolio of non-performing loans rose to
$1.64 billion as of June 30, down from $1.74 billion a year earlier.
   The company added $111.6 million to its reserve for credit losses
in the quarter, compared to a provision of $79.3 million a year
earlier, bringing total new provisions this year to $222.9 million,
up from $157.9 million a year earlier.

   Oil and gasoline futures prices advanced Monday
on largely technical factors.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate oil, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, picked up 13 cents to close at $20.45
a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading. On Friday, the
contract fell 3 cents.
   Home heating oil rose 1.10 cent to close at 50.43 cents a gallon
after falling 0.11 cent on Friday, and wholesale unleaded gasoline
rose 0.24 cent to settle at 57.08 cents a gallon after slipping 0.62
cent on Friday.
   Richard Kane, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said
technical factors were largely the moving force Monday. Trading was
light, he said.
   In the gasoline market, some traders were squaring their
positions in advance of Tuesday's scheduled release of oil and gas
inventory figures by the American Petroleum Institute.
   In the crude market, Kane said there was more interest in
September and subsequent contracts _ which were up about 44 cents _
as the August contract is nearing its expiration.

<HEAD>Eastern Says Court Filing On Schedule Cutback Is Inaccurate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eastern Airlines said Monday that a bankruptcy court
filing inaccurately indicated the company's August schedule would be
more than 15 percent smaller than earlier announced.
   However, a spokeswoman said, the strikebound airline was
reviewing its schedule and adjustments were possible.
   Eastern, in a federal bankruptcy court filing last week in New
York, indicated its August schedule would have 330 daily flights,
compared with the 390 it had announced previously.
   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization March
9, five days after Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions
went on strike and left it at 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule
of nearly 1,100 daily flights.
   Pilots union officials said Monday the disclosure proved Eastern
could not live up to its announced efforts to rebuild without the
unions.
   But Eastern officials in Miami expressed surprise Monday at the
figure, which was included in documents requesting release of $100
million in funds held in escrow.
   ``The 330 figure is inaccurate,'' said spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak. ``The number will be corrected.''
   Ms. Ceremsak said no cancellations had been made for the August
schedule.
   ``We're reviewing all of the schedule on a daily basis and any
adjustments are going to be minor and within a small period of time
in August,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   Eastern has begun reorganizing as a smaller carrier under a plan
that includes the sale of some $1.8 billion in assets to help pay
off its creditors.
   The company more than doubled its daily schedule in July to 220
flights daily and said it would be up to 390 flights daily.
   ``On Aug. 1...Eastern intends to further increase operating
levels to 330 departures a day,'' said a July 13 court application
filed by Eastern attorneys.
   Eastern unions, which support a buyout by Chicago options trader
Joseph Ritchie as an alternative to the downsizing, have argued that
Eastern doesn't have the trained personnel, particularly pilots, to
make its rebuilding plan work.
   ``We told you so. They're short pilots and they can't do it,''
said Gary Greksa, spokesman for the Eastern pilots union local, said
of the apparent schedule buyback. ``Buyer beware. They left people
stranded at the gates in March, and they'll do it again.''
   Eastern's request for $100 million also calls for $50 million
immediately, saying Eastern needs the money by the end of the month.
   Fewer than 300 of Eastern's 3,800 union pilots have come back to
work since the March 4 strike.
   Meanwhile, Eastern has hired 835 pilots, 559 of whom still are in
training. The company said 215 are flying, and 61 have flunked out
or left its round-the-clock training program.
   Eastern, which once flew into 102 cities, plans to rebuild its
schedule to 65 cities by Aug. 1 and 77 cities by the end of the
year. The August schedule requires 580 pilots for 390 daily flights.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Monday it is considering
legal action against Camp, the Spanish cleaning products company,
following reports that Camp had been sold to a West German company
despite a signed sales agreement with Procter valued at 31.7 billion
pesetas, or $264.1 million.
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Spanish representative Eduardo Baeza said in a
prepared statement that the household products manufacturer based in
Cincinnati, Ohio, had concluded a sales agreement with Camp in June
that included a down payment of 1.5 billion pesetas.
   Baeza, calling the situation ``an authentic financial scandal,''
said Procter &amp; Gamble learned Monday from press reports of the sale
of Camp to Joh A. Benckiser GmbH for 36 billion pesetas.
   Baeza said the purchase agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble included
the stipulation that Camp would not talk or negotiate with other
interested buyers.
   In Cincinnati, Procter &amp; Gamble's Patrick Hayes said, ``P&amp;G has
not taken any legal action against Camp. We are considering legal
action. It's one of our options.''
   Delvico Bates, public relations representatives of the West
German firm in Spain, said in a statement Monday the sale took place
Monday but that details had not been made public.
   The statement said Camp, founded in 1934, made 30 billion pesetas
in sales last year in household and industrial detergents and
ingredients for cosmetics.
   Baeza said company owners Albert, Jose and Juan Camp notified the
Economy Ministry's Foreign Transaction Division June 27 of the
agreement of sale with Procter &amp; Gamble and received the go-ahead
July 10.
   Baeza said the Camp brothers failed to show up for an appointment
at an attorney's office last Friday to finalize the sale.
   Procter and Gamble has been in Spain for 20 years. Benckiser's
Spanish operation distributed the water treatment products Calgon
and Calgonit.

   Grain and soybeans futures prices plummeted Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade as a forecast for cooler, wetter weather over the
next 10 days eased traders' fears of supply tightness through the
summer.
   On other markets, coffee was sharply lower on news that Colombia
was lifting nearly all taxes on its exports to become more
competitive in the newly deregulated marketplace; heating oil led a
modest rally in the petroleum futures complex; and cattle futures
climbed in anticipation of a government report expecting to show
fewer animals on the feedlots.
   After the close of trading Friday, the National Weather Service
released a forecast calling for above-average precipitation and
below-average temperatures over the next 6-10 days, especially in
the western cornbelt region. Corn and soybeans tumbled at the
opening bell at the BOT and most contract months for both
commodities locked down the daily trading limit.
   ``The grain prices have been carrying a substantial amount of
risk premium for fear of another drought,'' said Rich Feltes,
director of commodity research for Refco Inc., Chicago. ``But people
are coming around to the idea that we're not going to have the
persistent heat and dryness that characterized last year.''
   Traders remained split over whether last week's order by the
exchange forcing market players to liquidate large positions in July
soybeans still affected the market.
   The BOT's board of directors ordered all holders of such
contracts to reduce their positions to 3 million bushels by the
close of business Tuesday and to 1 million by Thursday, when the
contract goes off the board.
   The move was widely interpreted as an effort to prevent Italian
agribusiness giant Ferruzzi SpA from cornering the soybean market.
The company has acknowledged contracting for delivery of some 24
million bushels while slightly less than half that amount remains
accessible, but said it needs the beans for export business and to
keep its processing plants working.
   Ferruzzi lost a court fight last week to block the BOT action,
but said it intends to return to court and seek monetary damages for
losses tied to the forced liquidation.
   Those who suggested the fallout from Ferruzzi's fight with the
exchange had already been figured into prices noted that the July
contract, which has no daily trading limit, only slid 26 cents,
compared to 30 cents in the new crop months.
   They also noted that the limit-down move in corn and oats pointed
to weather as the culprit for Monday's slide.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 11\ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.84 a bushel; corn was 10 cents to 12 cents
lower, with July at $2.47{ a bushel; oats were 10 cents to 12 cents
lower, with July at $1.38{ a bushel; and soybeans were 26 cents to
30 cents lower, with July at $6.77{ a bushel.
   Coffee was .03 cent to 1.03 cents lower on the New York Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with July at 86.85 cents a pound.
   Analysts said a trading skirmish is shaping up in the wake of a
July 3 move by the International Coffee Organization abolishing
export controls on the commodity.
   ``Without the umbrella of the ICO, there is going to be some
adjustments by the big exporters,'' said Arthur Stevenson, who
tracks the soft commodities for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
New York. ``The byword now is `market share' and you're going to see
some aggressive strategy to retain and build on it.''
   Gold settled 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher on the Comex, with
July at $371 a troy ounce; silver was 5.6 cents to 6.4 cents higher,
with July at 526.3 cents a troy ounce. Platinum was 70 cents to a
$1.30 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with July at
$508.70 a troy ounce.
   Heating oil was the star performer on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It settled .19 cent to 1.1 cents higher, with August at
50.43 cents a gallon; crude oil was 13 cents to 44 cents higher,
with August at $20.45 a barrel; and unleaded gasoline was .24 to .97
cent higher, with August at 57.08 cents a gallon.
   Some analysts said the surge may be speculation that a report
Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute will show inventories
are lower.
   Livestock analysts were looking for bullish numbers Tuesday as
well _ these from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on how many
animals were placed on feedlots this past month.
   Live cattle were .28 cent to .97 cent higher, with August at
72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to .92 cent higher,
with August at 83.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to
.60 cent higher, with July at 47.65 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent to .80 cent lower, with July at 29.07 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Dow Chemical To Acquire 67 Percent Of Marion Laboratories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF BUZBEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. will acquire 67 percent
of the stock in Marion Laboratories Inc. under a tentative
transaction announced Monday.
   The total cost of the deal for Dow is difficult to estimate. The
closing price of Marion's stock Monday indicates that the market
values Marion's 155 million shares at $5.2 billion.
   The deal, if completed, will create a new publicly traded company
consisting of Marion Laboratories and Cincinnati-based Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, which is now a Dow Chemical subsidiary.
   The new company, although majority-owned by Dow Chemical, would
be based in Marion's hometown of Kansas City and would be called
Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
   ``It's just a wonderful opportunity,'' said Larry Wheeler,
Marion's vice president of communications. ``This gives us a chance
to remain a publicly traded company and yet gain access to one of
the strongest research institutes in our industry.''
   In the first part of the transaction, Dow would buy 39 percent of
Marion's 155 million shares of common stock at $38 a share, or $2.3
billion. Later it would issue new shares of Marion to Dow, giving
Dow 67 percent of Marion's then outstanding shares.
   Dow would pay for the newly issued shares by turning Merrell Dow
over to Marion and issuing a new class of Dow securities that
provide for payments by Dow to Marion shareholders based on Marion's
stock price at the time.
   Marion's stock jumped $8.25 a share to $33.50 in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading. But it remained below the $38 a share
offered by Dow for 39 percent of the stock, indicating that
investors are skeptical about the per-share value of the second half
of the deal.
   Dow's stock fell $1.50 a share to $88.37{ on the Big Board.
   Wheeler said Marion had been looking at a number of different
opportunities in the last few months and chose Dow Merrell because
its products would not overlap with Marion products. Dow has
concentrated on respiratory and central-nervous system products,
while Marion focused on cardiovascular and urology.
   Ewing Kauffman, who founded Marion in 1950, and his family
support the transaction and will tender their shares to Dow, Newcom
said.
   The Kauffmans now control 23 percent of Marion stock. Kauffman is
co-owner of the Kansas City Royals.
   Wheeler said managers of Marion Merrell Dow would be drawn from
the management of both companies. No layoffs are anticipated, he
said.
   Jon Braatz, an analyst with B.C. Christopher Securities Co. in
Kansas City, said, ``It's a good thing for Marion and all parties
concerned. There are a lot of happy faces today.''
   Marion, with 3,500 employees, had earnings of $150 million last
year on sales of $752 million.
   Its sales exploded in the early 1980s thanks to the drug
Cardizem, which brought in $441 million of the company's revenues
last year.
   Marion has been selling Cardizem tablets for angina patients
since 1982, and this year received FDA approval and began selling
the sustained-released form of the drug to treat high-blood pressure.
   But its stock has never fully recovered the value lost in the
stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Since then, the stock has
dipped at times below $20 a share, when it had previously been
trading in the $30 and over range.
   Scott Stevenson, another B.C. Christopher analyst, said some
investors had been concerned that Marion did not have any other
significant products under development in preparation for losing
exlusive rights to Cardizem SR in 1992. It recently bought a 20
percent share in US Bioscience of Philadelphia, which has eight
cancer treatment drugs under development.
   Dow Chemical is based in the Detroit suburb of Midland. Merrell
Dow is based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<HEAD>HSN Records Third Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Shopping Network Inc., the
nation's leading shop-by-television retailer, said Monday it lost
$5.9 million in its third fiscal quarter, and blamed legal expenses
associated with its current civil trial with GTE Corp.
   The loss for the three months ended May 31 contrasted with a
profit of $6.4 million, or 7 cents per share, for the comparable
period in 1988.
   The loss for the latest period included an extraordinary
after-tax gain of $1.8 million from the repurchase of $13 million in
long-term obligations.
   Third-quarter revenue slipped 2.4 percent to $178.7 million from
$183.2 million a year earlier.
   ``This was a disappointing quarter,'' said Roy M. Speer, HSN
chairman and CEO. ``However, electronic retailing, HSN's core
businss, remains profitable on a fundamental basis.''
   The video retailer said its earnings reflected a $9.3 million
increase in general and administrative costs in the latest quarter
over the year-ago figure, including $4.9 million in legal expenses.
   HSN and GTE went to trial June 19 in a case in which the HSN
accused the telecommunications firm of inadequate service and faulty
equipment and GTE countersuing alleging slander. The case is
expected to last six-to-eight weeks.
   HSN's nine-month earnings fell to $11.2 million, or 12 cents per
share, from $14.6 million, or 17 cents a share, last fiscal year.
   The latest results include an extraordinary after tax gain of $7
million from buying back $37.6 million in long-term obligations.
   Nine-month revenue rose 4.4 percent to $586.9 million from $562
million a year earlier.

   Buckingham Palace canceled a royal carriage
procession for a visiting Arab president as Londoners girded for
more transport strikes and travel chaos Tuesday.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration is beset by a
new wave of militancy by unions, ranging from local government
workers and dock workers to firefighters at London's Heathrow
Airport.
   The executive committee of the National Union of Railwaymen met
Monday and rejected a management offer of an 8.8 percent pay
increase and said Tuesday's planned 24-hour strike, the union's
fifth one-day stoppage in five weeks, will be held.
   The 24-hour stoppages have brought the national rail network to a
halt on each occasion.
   ``The British Rail board's offer of an 8.8 percent increase in
basic pay is unacceptable. The effect of that is that the strike
from midnight (Monday) is on,'' the union's general secretary, Jimmy
Knapp, told reporters.
   The union is seeking a 10 percent raise for its 75,000 members.
The board, which runs the state-owned railroads, initially offered 7
percent but then increased that to 8.8 percent.
   Knapp said the issue of low pay would not be solved by the
board's latest offer.
   Rail employees are among Britain's lowest paid industrial
workers. Average earnings, including overtime, amount to the
equivalent of $471 a week for train drivers and $325 for the others.
   Earlier Monday, leaders of the train crews' union, the
17,500-member Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and
Firemen, accepted British Rail's 8.8 percent pay increase offer and
called off their ban on rest-day and overtime work.
   Scores of London's famous red double-decker buses were off the
roads Monday as a 24-hour strike by maintenance engineers stopped
them leaving their depots.
   The stoppage over pay could be extended to Tuesday to coincide
with a planned walkout by 10,500 London subway workers _ their 11th
one-day stoppage in 15 weeks.
   About 10,000 parking spaces will again be made available Tuesday
at two royal parks in central London, Hyde Park and Regent's Park.
Many commuters have already booked hotels and taxis and some
companies have hired coaches.
   Buckingham Palace said it canceled a royal carriage procession
Tuesday for United Arab Emirates President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan, which would have closed some of the capital's busiest
roads, ``in view of the uncertainties about traffic congestion.''
   The president will travel by car from Heathrow Airport to Queen
Elizabeth II's residence at the start of his four-day official visit.
   Eighty firefighters at Heathrow were discussing a strike that
could close the world's busiest international airport next week. The
airport has rejected their claim for a 20 percent pay increase.
   ``The airport has to have fire cover for operations, so
potentially operations could shut down if there was a strike,'' a
management spokesman said.
   Britain's inflation rate has risen sharply in the last year to
8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nation European Economic
Community.
   A three-day strike over pay by 500,000 white collar workers
employed in public services by city halls throughout Britain was set
to start at midnight Monday, the third walkout in three weeks.
   The city hall strikes stop care services for children and the
elderly, shut slaughterhouses as meat inspectors are not available
and close local tax offices, museums and libraries.
   On the seventh day of a national dock strike at 60 of the
country's 162 ports, dockworkers' leaders from Belgium, France and
West Germany said they would urge 38,000 dockworkers not to handle
cargo from strike-bound ports.
   The 1.4 million-member Transport and General Workers Union,
Britain's largest labor union, organized the strike in support of
demands that port employers maintain national bargaining after the
abolition of a government system guaranteeing dockworkers' jobs
whether they had cargo to handle or not.

<TEXT>
   The world's leading supplier of the most
sophisticated computer simulation systems raised the stakes Monday
in the U.S.-Japanese battle over the rapidly expanding market for
supercomputers.
   Evans &amp; Sutherland of Salt Lake City unveiled the ES-1 at its
Mountain View, Calif., research facility, touting it as the first
``truly'' general purpose supercomputer. It has the equivalent power
of more than 60 IBM 3090 computers, machines at the high end of the
IBM line.
   Jean-Yves Leclerc, president of the company's computer division,
said its design, a modification of parallel processing that
significantly enhances performance, will greatly expand the
commercial applications of supercomputers, a market expected to
reach $9 billion by 1993.
   ``It's efficiency, price, performance, and ease of programming
will make top-end supercomputer performance available to a much
broader range of users,'' Leclerc said in a statement.
   The trend toward better-performing supercomputers is driven by
the need of scientists and engineers to perform mathematical
modeling. Improved computer modeling represents a qualitative leap
forward in science and engineering and could have a major impact on
every technical discipline from drug research to integrated circuit
design.
   ``What we need are high-performing systems that are reasonably
cost-efficient and interactive,'' said Roger Anderson, a computer
research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
near San Francisco.
   If the company's machine lives up to its claims, it would be a
welcome development in that direction, Anderson said.
   The ES-1, which in some functions can run 1.6 billion operations
per second, will cost $2.2 million to $8 million.
   Its high-performance capabilities are due to the fact that its
eight processors are independent, allowing in some operations a 50
percent improvement in efficiency, said Bob Stevens, vice president
of marketing for the company's computer division.
   The computer runs on an enhanced version of the popular Unix
operating system, allowing users to modify programs while the system
is running, an option not generally available to supercomputer
users, Stevens said.
   The entry of E&amp;S into the international supercomputer market is
another sign that American companies are upping the ante in their
battle with Japanese manufacturers, which control about a quarter of
the market. However, the company's main competitor is Cray.
   To show it is serious in dominating the supercomputer market,
Japan's NEC Corp. in April claimed it had developed the world's
speediest such machine, capable of 20 billion operations per second.
But NEC was quickly upstaged when NCube Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.,
unveiled a machine that can do up to 27 billion operations per
second.
   The United States leads in the development of parallel
processing, which allows machines to divide large problems into
smaller ones and work on them simultaneously.
   The key to ES-1's performance is a ``moderately'' parallel
architecture that allows each of its 16 computational units per
processor to either work together or independently on problems
submitted by other users. Each computational unit has the power of a
mini-supercomputer, the company said.

<HEAD>CenTrust Sells 63 Branches to California Thrift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CenTrust Bank said it agreed to sell nearly all its
branches Monday to Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly Hills
for more than $100 million.
   The Miami-based savings and loan is selling 63 of its 71 branches
and all of the accounts in those brances to Great Western Bank, a
Great Western Financial subsidiary. The branches have $2.4 billion
in deposits.
   The move comes as CenTrust seeks to restore its financial health
and alleviate concerns of federal and state banking regulators.
   CenTrust will be left with eight branches and $800 million in
deposits. The deal will give Great Western the largest branch
network in Florida.
   ``By more than doubling our retail banking presence in Florida,
this transaction will give us the largest savings branch networks in
California and Florida, the two best growth markets for retail
banking in the country,'' said James F. Montgomery, chairman of
Great Western.
   Curtis Cravelli, executive vice president of retail banking at
Great Western, said the giant thrift hasn't achieved the clout it
wants in Florida, despite acquiring more than 30 offices in the
state from other S&amp;L's.
   After the CenTrust deal, Great Western will have 114 offices in
Florida and more than $4 billion in retail deposits.
   Great Western's parent firm has assets of $36 billion. Its
capital, which is a measure of its financial health, is well above
minimum federal standards.
   For CenTrust, the move ultimately will give the S&amp;L the money it
needs to meet federal standards for net worth, the company said.
   CenTrust's asset base will drop to $6.4 billion. But its net
worth will rise to 4 percent of assets _ putting it in compliance
with federal standards.
   The $100 million proceeds will also help rid CenTrust of a
sizable chunk of its past losses that it has been carrying on the
books and writing off slowly.
   CenTrust grew from the ashes of the insolvent Dade Federal
Savings in the early 1980s. Chairman David L. Paul, in part using
investments in high-yield securities known as junk bonds, built
CenTrust into one of the nation's largest thrifts.
   It is perhaps best known for its brightly lit headquarters
building that dominates the downtown Miami skyline.

   The Philadelphia and American stock exchanges are
discussing either a full or partial merger, The New York Times
reported in Tuesday's editions.
   Under the plans, which are in the preliminary stages, either the
exchanges would be combined outright or they would merge their
options-trading operations, the newspaper reported, quoting
unidentified sources.
   The merger discussions are fueled by a recent rule adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the trading of equity
options, the sources said.
   Under the rule, which will be phased in over the next few years,
multiple exchanges would be able to trade an equity option, unlike
the current system in which each option is allotted exclusively to
an exchange.
   The largest market for options currently is the Chicago Board of
Options.
   An option is a right to buy or sell a block of stock at a certain
price within a stipulated time.
   The Times said its sources told it that the Philadelphia exchange
was growing increasingly worried that the rule would take away its
options business since, in competition with other exchanges, the
Philadelphia exchange would likely be in the weakest position
because its market share is smaller than the American exchange and
the Chicago Board of Options.
   A full merger of the two exchages would be the first in this
country in decades, industry officials said. Under that plan, the
Philadelphia exchange would be operated as a branch of the American
exchange, which is based in New York, the Times' sources said.
   Negotiations on the possible merger have been going on for about
a month, the Times said.
