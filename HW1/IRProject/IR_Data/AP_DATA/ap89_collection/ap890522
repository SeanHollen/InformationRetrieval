<TEXT>
   A magazine reported Monday that a
bomb maker for a Palestinian group suspected in the Pan Am Flight
103 bombing was freed 15 days after his arrest in West Germany
because he works for the country's intelligence service.
   Stern magazine said Marwan Khreesat, 44, was arrested in October
after raids in Neuss and in Frankfurt, but was allowed to go free
the following month and returned to Jordan, where he was born.
   ``Five weeks later, a radio bomb of the type that Khreesat had
built in Neuss blew up in the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,'' the
Hamburg-based publication said.
   The New York Times, in Tuesday's editions, quoted unidentified
U.S. officials in Washington as confirming the report.
   But a spokesman for the intelligence agency,
Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND, denied the report, saying of
Khreesat:
   ``He has never been an agent for BND and he is not one now.''
   The spokesman declined to discuss other aspects of the report.
He spoke on the condition of not being identified.
   A spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office said
Khreesat was released because investigators could not find enough
evidence to hold him.
   Khreesat is believed to be the bomb maker for the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, or PFLP-GC, Stern
said.
   British, U.S., and West German news reports have mentioned the
Syrian-based group as a prime suspect in the bombing of New
York-bound Pan Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21. All
259 people on board and 11 on the ground were killed.
   Stern said its report was based on information provided by two
high-ranking security officials it did not identify.
   It said Khreesat was among 16 suspected Palestinian terrorists
arrested in West Germany in October. Police seized large quantities
of weapons and explosives in the raids, including a bomb-rigged
radio cassette recorder.
   A similar device is believed by British investigators to have
caused the Pan Am explosion.
   Stern said Khreesat was responsible for making ``radio bombs for
attacks on planes'' for PFLP-GC.
   West German officials say they have no evidence linking PFLP-GC
members arrested in West Germany to the Pan Am bombing.
   Only two of the 16 arrested in October remain in custody.
   Stern said its report is to appear in Wednesday's editions of
the magazine. The publication released the report in advance to
other news media on Monday.

   Hundreds of Chinese college students demonstrated around the
United States on Sunday in support of the pro-democracy uprising in
their homeland, and East Coast protesters said they no longer
recognized China's government.
   ``Lots of the students are crying. ... I feel like crying, too.
I feel so sad and so angry,'' protest organizer Dong Lu said during
a somber rally by about 300 students at the Chinese consulate in
New York.
   ``In the near future the Chinese (government) may win the game,
but history tells us that the butchers of democracy are doomed in
the end,'' the Hunter College graduate student added.
   The demonstration came as hundreds of thousands of protesters
led by students occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square for a third
day. A reported ultimatum by Premier Li Peng passed without any
sign of a military crackdown.
   Rallies also were held in Lawrence, Kan.; Houston, Philadelphia
and Washington, D.C. Thousands turned out for protests in several
cities Saturday.
   In Beijing, students have led the largest uprising in the
40-year history of the People's Republic of China. The United
States is host to about 40,000 students from that nation.
   In New York on Sunday, three demonstrators met with consular
officials and delivered an open telegram.
   ``We 10,000 Chinese students in New York City and the East Coast
of the United States are on the side of the Chinese people,'' the
telegram said.
   ``We no longer recognize the Chinese government led by Li Peng
as a legal administration in China, and we pledge our complete
disobedience to such a hostile government towards the whole Chinese
nation,'' it said.
   The telegram called for Li's replacement, and said the Chinese
army should ``stand on the people's side and refuse to suppress the
democratic campaign.''
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Chinese consulate said
officials had no comment.
   About 100 people marched for three hours at the University of
Kansas, carrying signs with such messages as ``No Crackdown,'' ``No
Violence'' and ``We want freedom of speech.''
   Students, former students and faculty members from China, Taiwan
and the United States urged U.S. leaders to voice their support for
democratic reforms in China.
   ``It's important that we realize the U.S. did not achieve its
independence alone,'' said Beth Chao, an American married to a
former Chinese student. ``We got help from the French and other
people. It's our responsibility to help others.''
   In Houston, about 50 students from Louisiana rallied in front of
the Chinese consulate. A letter calling for an end to martial law
in Beijing was handed to Xian Bin Li, who is in charge of Chinese
students in the region.
   The demonstration followed a rally by about 800 people in
Houston on Saturday.
   In Philadelphia, about 50 Chinese students from Temple
University, Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania
carried banners and chanted English and Chinese in a peaceful
protest on the Temple campus, officials said.
   In Washington, where about 3,500 students demonstrated Saturday,
four people from Hong Kong and five Americans held a rally in front
of the Chinese Embassy.

   Two small fishing boats were caught in
the swift current flowing over a spillway into a bayou, leaving at
least two people dead and three others presumed drowned Sunday.
   Police said two men had been fishing from a boat tied to a post
near a dam spillway where water from D'Arbonne Lake dumps into
Bayou D'Arbonne. The lake is unusually high because of recent
storms.
   The men untied the boat to return to shore but their motor would
not start and the boat began drifting toward the dam, authorities
said.
   They said the men managed to grab brush about 30 yards from the
spillway and people in a second boat threw a line to them.
   When the men grabbed the rope, both boats were swept into the
swift current.
   The bodies of a man and woman found Saturday were identified
Sunday as Albert Bradshaw, age unknown, of Grambling and Pamela D.
Trammell, 35, of Ruston.
   Two men and a teen-ager who were missing and presumed dead
Sunday were identified as Mike Osborne of Grambling, Carey
Trammell, 58, of Ruston and Harold D. Trammell, 14, of Ruston.

<HEAD>Soviets Open Sakhalin Island to Japanese Tourists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-seven Japanese left by ship for Sakhalin
today, becoming the first group of Japanese tourists to visit the
Soviet island since the end of World War II, local officials said.
   Tatsuo Hamamori, mayor of Wakkanai on Japan's northernmost
island of Hokkaido, was among the tourists who left the city for
Kholmsk, a city on southern Sakhalin, aboard a Soviet ship this
morning.
   ``I hope today's voyage will pave the way for a regular ferry
service linking (Japan with the Soviet island) ... and which will
contribute to promoting exchanges of people, culture and goods,''
Hamamori said in a nationally televised interview before the ship's
departure.
   A territorial dispute over a group of islands near Sakhalin
seized by the Soviets in the closing days of the World War II has
blocked efforts to conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty,
technically leaving the two nations at war.
   The Soviet claim to Sakhalin is not now disputed by Japan, but
total recognition is being withheld by the government until the
return of the other islands, known in Japan as the ``northern
territories.''
   Though this is the first group of tourists allowed entry,
relatives of Japanese buried on Sakhalin have in the past been
allowed to visit the island.
   The Times Travel Agency, a private Japanese tourist agency
sponsoring the tour, said seven more trips from Wakkanai are
scheduled this year. It said the tourists will tour the southern
part of Sakhalin during their five-day stay.
   Last Monday, some 240 Japanese tourists left from a separate
Japanese city by ship for Vladivostok, a major Soviet far east
port, also for the first time since 1945.

   A fearless fowl named Judy refused to be
cooped up following a record-setting flight at the 18th annual
International Chicken Flying Contest.
   Judy flew 542 feet, 9 inches Saturday to win the contest at the
Bob Evans Farm in southeast Ohio. Her flight shattered the
10-year-old mark of 302 feet, 8 inches and won $1,100 for her
owner, John Salyers.
   But Salyers was unable to bring Judy to the trophy stand to
share in the award ceremony. During her flight, Judy swept over the
flying course, an adjacent field, and so far into the nearby woods
that Salyers was unable to find her.
   ``I lose one or two every year that way,'' said Salyers, who has
entered chickens in the meet for nine years. ``Two years ago, I had
the longest flier here and I never did find that chicken.''
   The rest of the 228 contestants were not as anxious to flout the
law of gravity.
   The average chicken entered the mail-box launching chute,
flapped its wings hysterically and settled on the ground a few feet
away.
   Salyers said he had no secret for training flying chickens.
   ``I don't mistreat them,'' he said. ``They're pretty wild. I
just go out and say, `Shoo!' That scares them, I guess, and they
take off. But there's no training a chicken so you'll know which
one will fly and which won't.''

   Federal revenuers have taken the
moonshine out of the New Straitsville Moonshine Festival.
   The New Straitsville Betterment Association had a temporary
permit from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to
make moonshine whiskey for the last seven festivals, but that has
been lifted.
   ``The bureau says they can't legally give us a permit to make
moonshine when they're trying to stop it,'' said Kenny Burgess Jr.,
secretary of the association.
   The 19th annual festival runs Wednesday through Monday in New
Straitsville, a south-central Ohio community which for years called
itself the moonshine capital of the world.
   Of the 47 stills smashed by federal revenuers in the 1930s in
Perry County, 32 were in or around New Straitsville, Burgess said.
   Festival organizer Betty St. Clair said she needed permission
from the bureau just to make the mash, a concoction of cracked
corn, sugar, yeast and water that is run through the still.
   ``I think it's silly. There are no free samples,'' she said of
the decision to halt the moonshine.
   Ms. St. Clair remembers being asked by a policeman where she was
from during a trip to the 1934 World's Fair in Chicago.
   ```New Straitsville?' he said. `Oh, you're from down there where
they make that good moonshine,''' she said.

   A hard-bound edition of ``Gone With The
Wind,'' with signatures of 23 cast and crew members from the
legendary MGM film, was sold for $20,000 at a Hollywood auction at
the Ebell Theater.
   Other remnants of Hollywood's heyday auctioned Saturday included
a jacket worn by Elvis Presley and tap shoes worn by Fred Astaire,
said Barry Vilkin of Camden House Auctioneers Inc.
   ``Some people buy from the heart when money's no object,''
Vilkin said. ``Maybe that's another explanation why these things
sell for as much as they do.''
   The 1938 edition of Margaret Mitchell's Southern romance novel
belonged to actor Fred Crane, who played Brent Tarlton, one of the
twin's vying for Scarlett O'Hara's affection in the movie's opening
sequence.
   The book was valued at $25,000 to $30,000.
   Vilkin said at least 350 guests were on hand when a vest worn by
Clark Gable in ``Gone With The Wind'' sold for $3,800, nearly
double its estimated value. A Civil War coat worn by Gable went for
$6,000.
   Vilkin declined to identify the bidders.
   ``I think movies are a common denominator amongst all of us no
matter what we do. We all have great memories,'' Vilkin said. ``In
Southern California, where the industry started ... these things
are thrown away. It's amazing the stories I've heard.
   ``One guy told me, `My basement got flooded. That's where I had
all the stuff stored.' I'm hoping to flush out the treasures that
are out here before they get destroyed. We have so little of the
vintage Hollywood of the '30s and '40s.''
   A bidder paid $9,000 for the black patent leather tap shoes worn
by Astaire in ``The Gay Divorcee,'' and someone paid $5,000 for a
jacket worn by Presley in ``Double Trouble.''
   A 126-page script from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' dated July 5, 1938,
sold for $15,000.

   When Tennessee-based Whittle Communications
started beaming a news program with commercials into six high
schools last winter, educators were outraged.
   This spring, when Ted Turner and the Discovery Channel each
promised schools commercial-free cable news and documentary
programming, many of those same people applauded.
   Those reactions left the impression that the presence or absence
of Snickers or blue jeans ads was the only concern school officials
have about classroom TV programmming.
   But there are other issues.
   One is time, ``a school's most precious commodity,'' said Ernest
L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement
of Teaching.
   Hardly a week passes that some study doesn't demand that public
schools raise test scores and teach more math, or science, or art,
or values, or safe sex _ all of this, presumably, to be shoehorned
into the same 180-day school year.
   The 12-minute-a-day Channel One news show that Whittle offers is
the equivalent of six classroom days a year, one of which would be
commercials alone.
   Manya Ungar, president of the National PTA, and others say that
because classroom time is so precious, educators should be sure
that TV programs support, rather than supplant, the curriculum.
   ``If there are ways to provide this technology when, where and
how the teacher feels it best enhances instruction, discussion and
comprehension, then it is to be applauded,'' Ungar said. ``If it
doesn't, it's a detriment.''
   Few educators outright oppose classroom TV. Nearly two-thirds of
all school districts now have some link to cable programming,
according to a National School Boards Association survey.
   But television has inherent shortcomings as an educational
technology, many still believe, especially compared to
microcomputers.
   ``Television is not the preferred technology in most
instances,'' said Scott Thomson, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals. ``It has a cost
advantage over film.
   ``But microcomputers are far more powerful educationally than
television because they are individualized and they are interactive.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he continued, ``the public thinks we are
against technology when we say we're not that impressed with
television. But in many ways it is outdated. Research shows it is
not that effective.''
   At least some of these problems can be overcome.
   Kentucky won praise this school year when it financed the
nation's first statewide educational satellite system. Public TV
station KET's ``Star Channels'' features hardware that allows
students all over the state to communicate with a televised teacher
at the touch of a button.
   The announcement last week of ``Assignment: Discovery,'' to
debut Sept. 18, followed Turner's announcement that his Cable News
Network will begin running a 15-minute current events show called
``CNN Newsroom'' on Aug. 14.
   The Discovery Channel's proposed classroom TV offering is
getting favorable early notices.
   Teachers would be free to tape Discovery programs and use them
when and however they see fit.
   Discovery Channel's forte is documentaries, and school officials
said they were excited at the prospect of supplementing lessons
with clips that would bring history alive in the classroom as no
textbook could.
   ``In a social studies class, I can imagine a teacher saying, `I
want you to watch John F. Kennedy give his `Ich Bein Ein Berliner'
speech,'' said Gary Marx, a spokesman for the American Association
of School Administrators.
   The group has blasted Whittle's commercial Channel One, but has
praised Discovery Channel.
   But the debate over classroom commercials masks another
fundamental issue: the decadeslong failure of government and
educational systems to harness technology to enhance student
achievement.
   In effect, commercial broadcasters like Whittle are being blamed
for stepping into that void and wanting to make a profit. And the
school officials pointing accusing fingers at Christopher Whittle
for his commercials are the very ones who have largely escaped
blame for doing little about the technology void that private
entrepreneurs now seek to fill.
   ``I think it's a scandal that we're so far into these
technologies and yet they remain so unconnected with schools,''
said Boyer. ``Education is still standing in the wings, lamenting
its abuses.''

<HEAD>Poll: Americans Favor Broad Measures to Curb Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans would accept an array of encroachments
on their lives to help clean up the environment, such as a ban on
aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling, a poll has found.
   The Media General-Associated Press survey of 1,084 adults found
broad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise, and
that government, businesses and average Americans are not doing
enough to combat it.
   Three-quarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in
the United States are too weak, and majorities favored urgent
government action, no matter what the cost, to protect the nation's
drinking water.
   Large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all
major oil facilities and at oil- and coal-burning power plants,
even if those measures would raise the price of oil, gasoline and
electricity.
   Environmental concerns were heightened by the nearly 11 million
gallons of oil spilled by the tanker Exxon Valdez off Alaska in
March.
   But the poll, conducted by telephone May 5-13, found concerns
went beyond the issue of oil tanker safety.
   The highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal, in
which 63 percent supported urgent action by the government
regardless of the expense. Next was the related issue of the
pollution of drinking water, with 52 percent favoring urgent
action, cost aside.
   On the issue of household waste, 20 percent said their
communities now require them to separate and recycle glass, cans
and paper refuse. Of the rest, an overwhelming 87 percent said they
would support such a requirement.
   Respondents also favored new steps against air pollution.
Seventy-five percent backed a ban on household aerosol products; 60
percent supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid; and 58 percent
favored a ban on non-radial tires, which release more rubber into
the air than do radials.
   Those proposals are among the steps suggested for Southern
California by a regional air quality board in March. Other measures
in that plan won less support nationally: Respondents were split on
parking restrictions in cities to discourage driving, and 59
percent opposed banning gasoline-fueled garden appliances.
   Still, 72 percent supported strict pollution controls on oil-and
coal-burning power plants, even if that would raise the price of
power. Smokestack controls are another feature of the Southern
California plan.
   In an issue related to the Exxon Valdez disaster, 81 percent
said new safety rules and emergency cleanup teams should be in
place at all major oil facilities, even if that raised the price of
oil and gasoline.
   Responses were less certain on whether the federal government
should issue new drilling permits. Forty-five percent opposed new
drilling off the coasts of California and Florida, while about 35
percent favored new drilling there and 20 percent were unsure.
   Opposition was greater to oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which also is being considered. Sixty
percent were opposed and only about a quarter were in favor, with
the rest unsure.
   Overall, 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased
during the past decade. And in a measure of its personal impact,
nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the beach last year
because of beach pollution.
   Concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political
lines. Residents of the nation's most densely populated areas were
the most apt to see anti-pollution efforts as inadequate and to
favor new steps.
   Respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around for
the nation's pollution problems. Forty-two percent said businesses
are doing a poor job of keeping the environment clean and 36
percent said ``only fair.''
   Similarly, 83 percent rated the federal government's
environmental record as only fair or poor, as opposed to good or
excellent; 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and
local governments' environmental records; and 79 percent said most
Americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the
environment clean.
   The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points,
was conducted by the AP and Media General Inc., a communications
company based in Richmond, Va., that publishes the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, The Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune
and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV stations WXFL
in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in Jacksonville, Fla.

   After initial anxiety following the Red Army's withdrawal and
the guerrillas' Jalalabad offensive, President Najib's government
is displaying a new optimism in its ability to stand alone against
the mujahedeen guerrillas.
   Western countries had predicted the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors, would overwhelm the Afghan armed forces within weeks or
at least a few months of the Soviets' departure on Feb. 15.
   Although these predictions have not come true, the United States
has rebuffed proposals by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
a mutual cut-off of weapons and stepped-up efforts for a cease-fire.
   ``They say, `We should give the mujahedeen more time,' but they
have had time and they have nothing to show. They have no power.
They can only fire rockets,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said.
   He said President Bush should accept that the guerrillas will
not bring down the Soviet-backed government and that a negotiated
peace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused by
the United States.
   The guerrilla attack on Jalalabad, which Kabul claims was
orchestrated by neighboring Pakistan's top military and civilian
officials, was based on the assumption that Afghanistan's
fifth-largest city would fall quickly, clearing the way for a push
on Kabul.
   But government forces defending Jalalabad have proved their
morale was not sapped by the Soviet withdrawal. And the mujahedeen
have not yet shown themselves capable of transforming from
hit-and-run fighters to a cohesive force able to mount a
conventional assault on a heavily defended city.
   The guerrillas' failure to capture Jalalabad and other major
cities appears to have strengthened feelings among government
troops that the war has become a do-or-die affair.
   ``As long as the Russians were here, there was confusion among
the people about what we were fighting for,'' a 30-year-old soldier
in Jalalabad said recently. ``Now we know. We are fighting as
Afghans, and the fighting is for our future.''
   After failing for nine years to win the war with 115,000
soldiers and a mighty modern arsenal, the Kremlin now professes a
desire to play peacemaker. It has called for a broad-based
government in which Najib's Soviet-style party would play a role _
but not the only role.
   Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador, predicted the military
stalemate and increasing diplomatic pressure will oblige the United
States to begin talks on ending the bloodshed.
   More than 1.3 million Afghans _ nearly one-tenth of the
country's pre-war population of 15 million _ have been killed.
Another 5 million have fled across the borders to Pakistan and Iran.
   ``By the end of summer, I think there will be a change of mind,
a change of this policy of `give war a chance,' '' Vorontsov said.
   Many foreign diplomats in Kabul, including from nations friendly
to the West, also said they believe the United States will feel
increasing pressure for a settlement.
   China already has promised Moscow it will halt arms supplies to
the guerrillas when current contracts expire, Chinese and Soviet
diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
   And on Sunday, Najib offered a dozen guerrilla field commanders
full autonomy in their regions if they stop fighting the government
and help end the 11-year-old civil war.
   Iran, anxious to repatriate its 2 million Afghan refugees, also
appears to be shifting toward a negotiated peace. That leaves only
the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia _ the guerrillas'
other major backers _ committed to ending the fighting.
   A diplomat from a non-communist, pro-Western nation said:
``Najib has proven he is tough, organized and that he won't run.
The longer the Western countries try to ignore him, the stronger
they're going to allow him to become. In two or three months' time,
he could well be a hero.''
   A common preference for a settlement seems to rest with an
ill-defined compromise: a government that is neither as ruthless as
the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has been since
it seized power in 1978, nor as committed to Islamic fundamentalism
as some of the most powerful guerrilla groups are.
   Events of the last decade have provided little nourishment for
middle-of-the-road politics and seem to leave the task of finding a
compromise up to those on the outside, such as the United Nations
or the superpowers.

   Actor Martin Sheen is miffed at ``certain
irresponsible media personalities'' for the way they reacted to his
declaration as honorary mayor of this star-studded beach community.
   Sheen shook up some of his neighbors by designating Malibu a
nuclear-free haven for the homeless and aliens. On Sunday, he had
more to say.
   ``I regret that my concern for the poor and the environment was
so dishonestly misinterpreted and misused to perpetrate a cruel
hoax on 4 million Americans who are already broken beyond any
measure of understanding,'' Sheen said in a statement.
   ``I am deeply troubled and profoundly saddened by certain
irresponsible media personalities who have abused their power to
gain ratings by treading on misery and suffering.''
   Sheen's declaration last week was a bit ill-received.
   Johnny Carson poked fun at it in his monologue on NBC's
``Tonight'' show, and the marquee at the Malibu Inn and restaurant
briefly read ``Dump Martin Sheen.''

   Gumshoes trying to crack the case of why ABC's
``Moonlighting'' was canceled have at least two suspects _ Bruce
Willis and Cybill Shepherd.
   The show's stars apparently spent much of their time arguing
with each other and with the series' creator, Glenn Gordon Caron,
said an ABC official quoted in this week's People magazine.
   ``They were working in a pressure cooker,'' said the official,
who was not identified.
   The tongue-in-cheek detective series had its final episode
earlier this month, after four seasons spiced with snappy repartee
and double-entendres. It made a star of Willis and was a comeback
vehicle for Shepherd.
   But the show's real turnaround came with Shepherd's 1987
pregnancy, which plagued her with sickness and left her unable to
work the show's long hours.
   And when Willis lost interest, one writer told People, the show
was doomed.
   ``Cybill may have been erratic, but Bruce had always been the
motor that drove the show. Once Bruce stopped caring, it became
very hard on everyone,'' said the writer, who also was not
identified.

   Actor David Keith, who played
former Oliver North in a TV miniseries, is facing charges of
drunken driving for a collision with another car, officials said.
   Keith, 35, was speeding when he hit a car making a U-turn around
midnight Saturday, injuring a woman riding in the other car, Los
Angeles County sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said.
   ``He was charged with the more serious felony violation because
of the speeding and the injury,'' the deputy said.
   Ducoulombier said Keith's blood alcohol level was tested at more
than 0.18 percent, 0.08 percent higher than the level defining
drunken driving.
   He was freed early Sunday after posting $2,500 bail, the deputy
said.
   Keith played North in the miniseries ``Guts and Glory: The Rise
and Fall of Oliver North,'' which was broadcast last month and
early this month.

   Prince Philip says the dream of rebuilding
London's Globe Theater began as a ``slightly crazy notion'' but
will become a tribute to William Shakespeare.
   The effort to raise $33 million to recreate a replica of the
theater, where the Bard made his debut as an actor, is a ``grand
scheme,'' the Duke of Edinburgh told reporters Sunday.
   The prince was the guest of honor at a dinner where actor Sam
Wanamaker and representatives of the Shakespeare Globe Centre
finished a U.S. fund-raising tour. Wanamaker initiated the
restoration project.
   The prince said Wanamaker persevered over those who wanted to
build houses on the site, adding that the idea was initially
considered a ``slightly crazy notion.''
   The Globe replica is scheduled to open in 1992 on Shakespeare's
birthday, April 23. The original Globe was built in 1599; it was
destroyed in 1613 when a cannon fired during a performance of
``Henry VIII'' set fire to the thatched roof. It was rebuilt in
1614 but torn down in 1644 for tenement housing. Today the site is
an empty lot.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Proxmire Still Moving Fast After Senate Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The platform of the Washington subway station
is crowded and former Sen. William Proxmire is striding so rapidly
through the cavernous space that he could almost be said to be
running.
   Flashing lights and a far-away rumble signal the approach of a
train.
   Proxmire is out of position. He moves from a rapid walk to a
dash, darting inside a car just before the doors close with an
automated whoosh.
   It's not an isolated event. It's a routine.
   ``I pace up and down carrying a heavy brief case,'' the
73-year-old Wisconsin Democrat says. ``I do a sprint right at the
very end.''
   Proxmire was once the country's most celebrated long-distance
amateur runner.
   For decades he ran flat out _ ``I never jogged'' _ the five
miles between his home in Cleveland park in Northwest Washington
and his Senate office on Capitol Hill.
   ``I can't do that anymore,'' he says. ``I've got a bum knee.''
   So he exercises, rides his stationary bike, and strides the
length of lengthy subway platforms.
   ``One great heart specialist says the secret is that you've got
to keep moving, got to keep moving,'' the former senator says.
   On this particular day, like most days, Proxmire goes to work in
a tiny cubicle attached to the Robert M. LaFollette Sr,
Congressional Reading Room in the Library of Congress.
   The room has a special significance for him.
   He held LaFollette's seat in the United States Senate for 31
years, ever since he won a special election to replace the late
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy in 1957.
   The cubicle is equipped with a chair, bookshelves, a telephone
and typewriter. It is not equipped with a view. A computer terminal
is expected soon.
   Not much room, not much equipment, for a man who until last
December commanded a large office suite in the Dirksen Senate
Office Building and a personal and committee staff of dozens.
   ``When you're in the Congress you really get support,'' Proxmire
says. ``I loved the Senate, but I don't very much miss it.''
   ``What I do miss is the clerical staff, the secretarial support,
the schedulers, the researchers.''
   In retirement, Proxmire is pretty much of a one-man band, with
an occasional boost now and then from former staff members. He does
his own typing.
   And he is gingerly returning to what he calls ``my first love,
journalism.''
   An early job, in 1949, was as a reporter with the Capitol Times
in Madison, Wis. He was fired after a series of run-ins with
management.
   But now he's back.
   Proxmire is launching a twice-a-week newspaper column under the
auspices of United Features Syndicate. He says that one of the 40
or 50 subscribers signed up so far is The Capitol Times.
   Proxmire launched his column last week with a news conference at
the National Press Club in which he resurrected his Golden Fleece
Award, perhaps the most successful political public relations
device of its era.
   The Fleece will be a monthly feature of the Proxmire column,
carrying on a tradition that, beginning in March 1975, continued
for 165 consecutive months with citations for what Proxmire
considered examples of conspicuous government waste, and an
occasional award of merit for a positive action that saved money or
spent it well.
   ``Just because I'm out of the Senate doesn't mean we have to
abandon a device that does something to cut down spending in this
time of fearful budget deficits,'' Proxmire says.
   Proxmire also is planning a book.
   Subject: debt, government debt, business debt, household debt.
   Proxmire, former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has
been predicting a sharp recession for years: ``I think when the
recession comes it's likely to be a real killer, a depression _ and
that is because our debt is so enormous.''
   He has been working up to the book by using debt as the theme of
dozens of speeches around the country.
   At the press club news conference, Proxmire was asked if he, as
a former Banking Committee chairman, had ever considered giving
himself a Golden Fleece for failing to spot and stop the pattern of
abuses that grew into the multibillion-dollar savings and loan
scandal.
   There were so many mistakes by so many people ``that you'd have
to have a barrel of fleeces, including one for the chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee,'' he replied.
   ``I'll let other people give me a fleece, rather than commit
suicide,'' Proxmire said.

<HEAD>Wright Says Rules Were Changed on Him in Mid-Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's televised defense
against ethics charges this week will be that the rules were
changed in mid-stream, but even his own lawyers give him less than
an even chance of winning quick dismissal of the case.
   Wright's lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets of
charges brought against their client by the House ethics committee
should be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moral
climate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent.
   ``We are hoping for a clear interpretation that the rules
haven't changed on us,'' Wright said.
   But Wright's lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied
and give the speaker less than even chance of winning a pre-emptive
dismissal of the charges.
   William C. Oldaker, one of Wright's lawyers, said last week that
in a best-case scenario, the odds of succeeding with such a motion
would be 50-50; in this case, he conceded that the odds could be
something less than that.
   And a growing number of House Democrats are saying that while
the ethics process is important, it may ultimately prove irrelevant
to the speaker's political fortunes.
   ``It would be nice if he could be in a position to defend his
case on the merits before he has to face the question of what the
political consequences are,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who has
argued that the rules are on Wright's side.
   Stephen D. Susman, a hard-nosed trial lawyer brought in this
month to bolster the defense team, is expected to argue that the
committee misapplied the rules in two ways:
   _In charging Wright with evading limits on outside earned income
through bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,''
the panel ignored a rule specifically exempting book royalties from
the limit.
   House rules place a cap on money earned from speaking fees at 30
percent of congressional salary. The ethics panel said that in
seven instances, Wright sold bulk quantities of books to groups he
had spoken to, and that the sales were really disguised speaking
fees which he otherwise wouldn't have been able to accept.
   ``No rule of the House, no advisory opinion, no prior cases and
not one shred of legislative history ... supports the outside
special counsel's revisionist approach to the copyright royalty
exemption,'' the lawyers argue in a statement.
   _Charges that Wright improperly accepted $145,000 in improper
gifts from George Mallick, a Fort Worth real estate developer and
business partner of the speaker, are based on a finding that
Mallick had a direct interest in legislation before Congress.
   Over a period of nearly 10 years, Mallick gave Wright and his
wife, Betty, use of a car and a condominium in Fort Worth, and from
1979 through 1984 paid Mrs. Wright an $18,000-a-year salary. The
committee found reason to believe those amounted to gifts, and that
Mallick had a stake in legislation because of his many investments.
House rules bar acceptance of more than $100 in gifts annually from
any such person.
   An ethics committee advisory opinion defines the direct interest
standard as ``a distinct or special interest in influencing or
affecting the federal legislative process which sets the individual
or organization apart from the general public.''
   Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan, the ethics committee's special
outside counsel in the case, will defend the panel's rules
interpretation at the hearing Tuesday.
   The dismissal motion essentially asks the ethics committee to
abandon rules interpretations it earlier had decided to accept.
Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., last week characterized
the panel's original decision as ``very well founded.''
   Wright's defense team is not challenging, at least for the
moment, charges that he failed to report the Mallick benefits as
gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms, a relatively minor
concern.
   Following the hearing, expected to take about six hours, the
committee will meet later in the week to rule on the dismissal
motion. Any remaining charges then would become the subject of a
disciplinary hearing.
   Wright and his advisers, hoping to avoid prolonging what has
become a daily barrage of negative news stories and new
allegations, are expected to ask that the committee begin the
trial-like hearing immediately. Dixon has said the hearing would
probably take more than a week. The panel then would rule on
whether the charges have been proved with clear and convincing
evidence, and could recommend sanctions to the full House.
   The House is free to accept, reject or modify the
recommendation, but many lawmakers say it is most likely that the
chamber would simply accept whatever the ethics panel suggests.

   A new Agriculture Department analysis shows
that farmers and ranchers with cow-calf operations, the foundation
herds that form the bedrock of the nation's beef business, will
probably make money again this year.
   But the detailed figures by the department's Economic Research
Service include some sour notes regarding capital improvements that
could affect the long-term financial health of the cattle industry.
   The analysis also includes some mixed outlook figures for hog
producers, who saw market prices drop sharply last year. Even sheep
producers are feeling a pinch.
   If only cash flow is considered, the cow-calf operators are in
pretty good shape, economists Hosein Shakpouri and Terry Crawford
said in their report. But when costs of capital replacement are
included, the situation is much less encouraging.
   The report compares estimated 1988 production costs and net
returns with those projected for 1989.
   Last year's drought ``severely affected'' all livestock
producers, the report said. Spending on feed jumped 28 percent from
1987, while gross cash receipts from livestock sales increased only
3 percent.
   On the average, the ``gross value of production'' of one beef
cow totaled $348.18 in 1988. That was up from $313.70 in 1987. The
projection for 1989 is $346.06 per cow.
   The values were construed by including allowances for calves and
culled cows, and converting them to a one-cow figure.
   Cash expenses, ranging from feed to taxes, insurance and
interest, also were prorated on a one-cow basis. Those added up to
$296.77 last year, up from $255.84 in 1987. The projection for 1989
is $306.26 per cow.
   Thus, after deducting cash expenses from gross values, the
cow-calf operator this year may have an average cash return of
$39.80 per cow, down from $50.46 in 1988 and $57.86 in 1987, the
report showed.
   But if an allowance for capital replacement of buildings,
equipment and other facilities is included, the tidy per-cow net
``profit'' disappears. In this case, the report said, the operator
could lose an average of $41.79 per cow in 1989, compared with
losses of $26.69 in 1988 and $17.72 in 1987.
   ``Cash returns, before and after a charge for the replacement
capital, are key indicators of producer supply response,'' the
report said. ``A positive cash return is an incentive for producers
to continue or even expand their operation; a negative cash return
is often regarded as a signal to discontinue production.''
   However, the report added, the figures are averages, and there
are producers who fare better or worse. Some individual operators
may expand when most do not. Also, they can make substitutions in
production items in different proportions than allowed in the
analysis.
   The cash return, or residual, reflects the cash flow available
for paying family living expenses, repaying debts and replacing
machinery, equipment and buildings.
   ``In the short-term, producers may defer machinery and equipment
purchases or repairs if the farm is producing little income or is
in an unfavorable tax position,'' the report said. ``But over the
long run, operators must replace and maintain the buildings and
equipment typically used in the operation.''
   The report said the projected decline in net returns to cow-calf
operators this year is ``due primarily to higher wintering
expenses.'' Higher feed costs and a small increase in the market
price of fed beef ``would lower the price cattle feeders can pay
for feeder cattle'' in 1989, which will help depress cow-calf
returns.
   Looking at the hog situation, the report said farrow-to-finish
operators, who account for about 80 percent of the slaughter hogs
produced, saw 1988 gross value of production drop to an equivalent
of $42.87 per 100 pounds from $51.30 per hundredweight in 1987.
This year's value was projected at $41.23.
   Cash expenses, meanwhile, jumped to $41.64 per hundredweight in
1988 from $34.07 in 1987. This year cash expenses were projected at
an equivalent of $44.44 per hundredweight.
   Consequently, last year's cash return to farrow-to-finish
operators averaged $1.23 per hundredweight, down from $17.23 in
1987. This year, hog farmers are expected to lose $3.21 per
hundredweight.
   After allowing for capital replacement, hog producers lost $5.89
per hundredweight in 1988, compared with a profit of $10.34 in
1987. This year's loss was shown at $10.64 per hundredweight.
   ``Sheep production has consistently been one of the most
profitable livestock enterprises in the past 18 years,'' the report
said. ``Nevertheless, U.S. sheep producers experienced a sharp
decline in their cash returns in 1988 as sheep production
increased. Higher feed costs, as well as lower lamb prices eroded
their financial positions.''
   The average value of sheep production 1988 was reported at
$65.56 per ewe in 1988, down from $73.05 in 1987. The value for
1989 was projected at $63.98 per ewe. Cash expenses were $46.38 in
1988, $44.66 in 1987 and projected at $47.67 in 1989.
   As a result, net cash returns averaged $19.18 per ewe in 1988,
compared with $28.39 in 1987 and a 1989 return projected at $16.31.
   With allowances for capital replacement, sheep producers were
shown at a profit of $11.12 per ewe in 1988 and $20.60 in 1987. The
projection for 1989 was $7.90 per ewe.

   Last September, Jennifer Cohen thought
France was a blob on the eastern tip of the Soviet Union. Last
week, the 12-year-old could draw a map of the world _ from memory.
   For more than a decade, Shady Hill School teacher David J. Smith
has been sending seventh-grade geography whizzes into a society
where, according to a recent Gallup Poll, one in seven Americans
can't find the United States on a map of the world.
   ``You can't get anywhere underestimating the ability of a
seventh-grader,'' Smith said. ``They can accomplish enormous things
if you set them a task they can break into manageable pieces.''
   Without consulting an atlas, this spring's crop of pupils has
already outlined the continents with startling accuracy.
   On Jennifer's map, the sinuous curve of the Americas, the
Scandinavian hump, even the six states of Australia were correctly
proportioned on a Mercator grid. Now she is filling in countries,
cities, mountains, and rivers, even adding the names of Soviet
republics.
   At 12, Jennifer is trying to remember facts that would stump
most college pupils: whether Wellington is the capital of New
Zealand, and whether to put it on the island's north or south.
   ``The hardest part is Greenland, and all the little islands on
the top of Canada,'' she said.
   At the beginning of the school year, Smith hands his pupils a
blank sheet of paper and asks them to draw everything they know
about the world.
   Most of the sheets are returned with little more than vague
circles and squiggles.
   The problem isn't limited to younger students. A 1988 Gallup
Poll commissioned by the National Geographic Society found
Americans ages 18 to 24 knew less about the world than their
counterparts in nine countries.
   Smith keeps those embarrassing first efforts so pupils can
proudly compare them to their memory maps at year's end.
   He teaches geography at the approximate rate of a continent
every two weeks.
   At the end of the year, students spend six weeks making practice
maps and three weeks creating their memory maps. Some children who
rarely speak in class produce maps so beautiful that their parents
frame them, Smith said.
   Though Shady Hill is a private school, Smith thinks his teaching
method would work elsewhere if educators allot the subject enough
time.
   ``It's important that they know about America's place in the
world,'' he said. ``But what's really important is that it's a
nine-month project in an age of instant gratification. They leave
here with a sense of what they're capable of.''

   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was charged April
17 by the House ethics committee with 69 instances of violating
House rules, and new allegations have since arisen in news reports.
Wright denies having committed ethical violations. Here is a
rundown on the charges:
   BOOK SALES _ The ethics committee charged that on seven
occasions, Wright sold bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' to groups to which he had given speeches. The
panel contends that Wright improperly disguised speaking fees,
which are limited under the rules, as royalties, which are not.
   LEGISLATIVE INTEREST _ The committee charged that Fort Worth
real estate developer George Mallick, by virtue of his extensive
financial holdings, had a direct interest in legislation before
Congress. That would make benefits Wright and his wife received
from Mallick from 1979 to 1988, totaling $145,000, improper under
the rules.
   GIFT REPORTING _ The committee charged that the benefits,
including Mrs. Wright's $18,000-a-year salary from 1979 through
1984, and use of a 1979 Cadillac and a Fort Worth condominium, were
not reported as gifts on Wright's annual financial disclosure form,
as required.
   SABINE LAKE _ Ethics investigators are still looking into
whether Wright received improper proceeds from a 1988 investment in
a Texas gas drilling venture. Known as the Sabine Lake Prospect,
the venture yielded Wright's blind trust a quick $170,000 profit,
even though the well has so far proven dry. Doug Jaffe, a San
Antonio businessman who arranged the investment, is seeking to sell
training aircraft to the Pentagon.
   JEWELL ENTERPRISES _ Wright borrowed $100,000 to invest in a
now-defunct business that bought and sold nursing homes. Although
he ultimately lost his money, at one point he reportedly received
$23,000 in dividends unavailable to other investors, and got help
paying the interest on his loan. The ethics panel still is
examining the transactions.
   PACIFIC INSTITUTE _ Former employees of a Seattle, Wash., firm
that sells motivational programs say Wright's wife Betty did little
or no work for the $36,000 salary she received from 1985 to 1988.
Her boss at the time insists she performed satisfactorily. Wright
used the Congressional Record to print a glowing endorsement of a
videotape his wife had helped produce for the firm. The ethics
panel is believed to be taking a look at these events, as well.

<HEAD>Bush Says NATO Dispute Could be Settled Pre-Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says the dispute over
short-range nuclear weapons that has split NATO could be resolved
before next week's 40th-anniversary meeting of the alliance.
   ``I think great progress has been made'' in efforts to reconcile
U.S.-West German differences over possible negotiations on the
missiles, Bush said Sunday during a joint news conference in Boston
with French President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``I think that we could well have this resolved before the
summit,'' Bush said.
   Still, the dispute remains a ``vexing question'' and ``there are
strong-willed people from strong countries, and they each have an
opinion,'' he said after he and Mitterrand gave back-to-back
commencement speeches at Boston University.
   ``One way to guarantee there will not be progress is to lock
each other in, in public statements,'' Bush added.
   The United States, after first opposing Bonn's suggestions for
early U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing short-range missiles in Europe,
has sent a counterproposal to West Germany agreeing to accept such
talks in principle in the future, according to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   However, the United States first wants to see the Soviets reduce
their conventional-force edge, a position Bush reiterated Sunday.
   In his commencement address, Bush said that ``though hope is now
running high for a more peaceful continent, the history of this
century teaches Americans and Europeans to remain prepared.''
   Mitterrand, who has generally agreed with the U.S. position,
said his role was not that of a mediator between the United States
and Germany on the issue.
   ``Obviously, I'd be happy if views can be reconciled and I
believe, I think, that they can be reconciled,'' he said.
   Mitterrand, in response to a question, refused to agree with a
statement last week by White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
that Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev was acting in a ``drugstore
cowboy fashion'' in making a succession of arms-control proposals.
   ``I think that one must be wary of caricatures. Mr. Gorbachev is
worth very much more than that,'' Mitterrand said.
   In his own commencement speech, delivered in French and
translated in segments to an estimated audience of 31,000 in Boston
University's Nickerson Field, Mitterrand praised Gorbachev along
with Bush and former President Ronald Reagan for their combined
efforts to reduce the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons.
   Mitterrand also called for all nations to join in framing ``an
emergency plan to save the environment. ... The death of the
environment is our death,'' he said.
   Bush, at the news conference, said: ``I heard his clarion call
for cooperative action on the environment, and I salute him for
that.''
   Bush had entertained Mitterrand at his oceanside vacation home
in Kennebunkport, Maine, for the weekend.
   After the Boston University appearances, Bush bade the French
leader farewell at a military departure ceremony at Boston's Logan
Airport, where Mitterrand boarded his Air France supersonic
Concorde for the return trip to Paris.
   Bush then traveled to Greenwich, Conn., where he visited his
ailing 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, for about an hour
and a half. Mrs. Bush is recovering from a mild stroke. Bush
returned to Washington Sunday evening.
   In Boston, Bush met with his vanquished 1988 Democratic
presidential challenger, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. The
two shook hands at a pre-commencement reception.
   Dukakis, applauded vigorously by the hometown audience when he
was introduced later in the stadium, also shared the dais with Bush
during the commencement ceremonies.
   In his commencement speech, Bush was sharply critical of recent
comments by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the
Soviets' ``commitment to destroy SS-23 missiles under the (1987
treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons) may be
reversible.''
   ``The Soviets must surely know the results of failure to comply
with this solemn agreement. Perhaps their purpose was to divide the
West on other issues. Regardless, it is clear that Soviet `new
thinking' has not yet totally overcome the old,'' Bush said.
   Shevardnadze made the comments in response to U.S. proposals to
upgrade and extend the range of the American-built Lance
short-range missiles, which are not covered by the treaty on
intermediate-range missiles.
   Bush also said the United States has consulted with the
government of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to come up
with an agreement with West Germany that would avoid a clash over
the short-range missile flap at the May 29-30 NATO meeting.
   Britain, like the United States, has strongly opposed East-West
talks on cutting NATO's nuclear battlefield weapons at this time.

<HEAD>Boston Cardinal Urges Students to Skip AIDS Classes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic cardinal said an AIDS education
program in the Boston public schools will increase students' risk
of getting the disease, and has urged parents not to allow their
children to participate.
   In a letter read at weekend Masses in Boston parishes, Cardinal
Bernard F. Law said the lessons planned for students in seventh
throught 12th grades over the next six weeks ``could place our
children in danger, both moral and physical.''
   ``The curriculum presents various issues of sexual behavior in a
valueless, amoral context,'' Law wrote. ``It admits a
permissiveness in sexual behavior which is not acceptable to a
great many citizens of the city, is certainly unacceptable for
Catholics and which increases the children's risk of gettting
AIDS.''
   The schools plan to offer two 45-minute lessons stressing
abstinence and shunning intravenous drug use as the best way to
prevent AIDS. Instructors will tell students who are sexually
active to use condoms. Parents who object may exempt their children
from the classes.
   Law warned that ``students as young as 13 will ... be given
explicit instructions in the use of condoms. Sexual abstinence
cannot be taught if at the same time detailed directions on how to
use condoms are presented as an alternative.''
   He said the archdiocese will offer its own ``value-centered''
AIDS education program this summer.
   Some school leaders disagreed with Law's evaluation of the
program.
   ``It is fine for him to take moral positions, but young people
have not abstained from sexual activity,'' said School
Superintendent Laval S. Wilson. ``That's the reality we deal with
in the public schools.''
   ``They are not all Catholic, but Protestants, Jewish,
Buddhists,'' said Jean McGuire, a school committee member. ``They
have a right to know how to protect themselves from any sexually
transmitted disease.''
   A Protestant leader, the Rev. Warren M. Brown, pastor of the
Columbus Avenue A.M.E. Zion Church and chairman of the Black
Ecumenical Commission, said that like Cardinal Law, he was
concerned that ``parts of the curriculum send a mixed message to
young people.''
   ``But the cardinal's position fails to take into consideration
the fact that the problem already exists,'' he added.
   Two years ago, a plan for pilot school health clinics that could
have prescribed birth control devices was derailed by political and
religious foes.

<HEAD>Martha's Vineyard Residents Don't Know What's Worse: Tourists or
Skunks.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TISBURY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's springtime on Martha's Vineyard and
the locals are girding for what's become an annual influx of
arrogant, offensive pests who walk the streets at night and hang
out at restaurants.
   It's not tourists. It's skunks.
   Hordes of the ``black cats with white tails'' have inhabited the
island, taking up residence under houses, rummaging through
restaurant garbage, intimidating vacationers, terrorizing pets and,
frankly, stinking up the place.
   ``They're really bold and brassy. You can see them on the main
streets, you can see them walking around anywhere,'' said Diane
Goodale, animal control officer for the Vineyard Haven section of
town. ``If you're fishing at night, they'll just come right up to
you.''
   Dead fish along the shore, ground nesting birds and plenty of
woods make the island an ideal habitat for skunks. And state
wildlife officials and animal control officers in the island's six
towns say their telephones don't stop ringing in the springtime
when baby skunks are born and the warm weather makes the beasts
more active.
   Fin Miller was the man many residents hired from 1982 until his
retirement in 1987 to rid their property of the raccoons, skunks
and feral cats that were giving them headaches.
   During that five-year period, he said, he trapped nearly 500
skunks. Another trapper was said to have caught about 300 a year
during the period.
   ``I found they're partial to Devil Dogs and Twinkies. People
used to call it junk food but I used to call it skunk food,''
Miller said. ``I could catch a skunk on any place, except the
Presbyterian church steeple. They haven't gotten up there yet.''
   Many islanders swear that, at least since Colonial times, no
skunks were on the island before the late 1950s. How they returned
to Martha's Vineyard is a touchy matter involving old allegations
that have flourished into local lore.
   Legend has it that the skunk population was revived when
Vineyard Haven native Craig Kingsbury brought two unscented skunks
_ one male and one female _ and set them free to roam with the
oxen, cattle and goats on his farm some 30 years ago.
   Kingsbury, 77, swears it's not true.
   He blames vacationers for bringing baby skunks and raccoons over
as pets and abandoning them on the island when the cuddly critters
got big and nasty. The old farmer said he was accused by his
neighbors because a family of abandoned skunks took up residence on
his property.
   ``The skunks moved in on my farm and I didn't bother them, kill
them, or have a fit over them. I just left them alone,'' he said,
and laughed at the typical city vacationer's fear of wildlife.
``Anything bigger than a field mouse puts them in a trauma.''
   But the rumors persist.
   ``For some reason there's always a dead skunk in front of his
house. If you don't see them, you can smell them,'' Goodale said.
   The 100-square-mile island has few predators to control the
skunk population.
   ``They only have one natural enemy, and that has four wheels,''
said Peter Kazlauskas, operations manager of the island's trash
disposal agency.
   Sandra Lucas of the state's Environmental Police said the
problem is really part-skunk and part-people. She said if residents
could learn to cap their garbage, close up basement windows and not
bother the skunks people could coexist with the mammals.
   Wildlife workers occasionally are called to come to the aid of a
skunk found stumbling along with a head trapped in a yogurt
container or jelly jar. But more often, they get complaints.
   Lucas' favorite comes from people who call to say their dog was
sprayed while he was out running around the neighborhood.
   ``They violate the leash law, their dog gets sprayed, and they
want me to kill the skunk,'' she said.

   Family and friends of Ferdinand Marcos were
heartened by news that the former Philippines president was alert
and responding to medication, an aide said.
   Marcos continued to rally on Sunday, said a spokesman for St.
Francis Medical Center, stressing that his condition remained very
critical.
   Marcos, 71, was undergoing kidney dialysis, had a respirator to
help him breathe and was hooked up to a monitoring system, said
Eugene Tiwanak, the hospital's assistant adminstrator.
   Arturo Aruiza, a top aide who has been with Marcos much of the
time since a surgical procedure was performed Thursday to prepare
him for dialysis, said Marcos has shown the will to live.
   ``The will to fight, the determination, he has that,'' Aruiza
said.
   Marcos is able to mouth words to his doctors and family, and
responds with a smile when his wife, Imelda, and children, Irene
Araneta and Ferdinand Jr., hold his hand and speak to him, Aruiza
said.
   Marcos was alert and conscious and seemed to be responding to
medication to fight a bacterial infection, Tiwanak said. But he
added:
   ``I didn't say he improved. I said his condition is such that he
appears to be rallying, but I'm cautioning always that it's very
episodic and can drop _ just as I'm standing here, it can get
worse.''
   Marcos still has a fever, but not as high as a few days ago,
Tiwanak said.
   Aruiza said cautious optimism had replaced some of the despair
that prevailed Thursday.
   ``Even the hospital wanted to know our arrangements for the body
then,'' Aruiza said. ``They said their morgue could only keep a
body for a certain number of days. It was very morbid.''
   Marcos and his wife have lived in exile in Hawaii since fleeing
the Philippines in February 1986 after a civilian revolution swept
Corazon Aquino to power.

   Here are excerpts from the joint news conference
Sunday by President Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand:
   BUSH ON CHINA:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom
of the press, and clearly, we support democracy. I don't want to be
gratuitous in giving advice, but I would encourage restraint. I do
not want to see bloodshed. We revere the model of Martin Luther
King in this country for his peaceful protest, and so I might
suggest a familiarization with that for the people in China, and I
would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible in order
to see more democratization and to see a peaceful resolution of
this matter.
   ``We have been in touch with our ambassador on this very key
question. I think this perhaps is a time for caution, because we
aspire to see the Chinese people have democracy, but we do not
exhort in a way that is going to stir up a military confrontation.
We do not want to have a situation like happened in Burma, or some
other place. And so, as we counsel restraint, and as we counsel
peaceful means of effecting change, that is sound advice. And I
think to go beyond that and encourage steps that could lead to
bloodshed would be inappropriate.
   ``I don't think that it would be appropriate for the President
of the United States to say to the demonstrators and the students
in Beijing exactly what their course of action should be. That is
for them to determine. They know the United States' commitment to
democracy, to the commitment to freedom, to the aspiration we have
that all people will live in democratic societies. But I'm not
about to suggest what I think they ought to do except to spell out:
peaceful, and continue to fight for what you believe in, stand up
for what you believe in, but ... beyond that, I cannot go.
   ``There's certainly an enormous expression on the part of many
people -- students and others -- for change, for movement toward
democracy. I lived there. I saw a society totally different than
the one that exists in China today. China has moved in some areas
towards democracy. Now, the quest is, and the appeal from these
kids, is to move further ... But I am not going to dictate, or try
to say from the United States, how this matter should be resolved
by these students. I'm not going to do it.''

   Mitterrand: ``I think that we have now the elements of ideas
that could form a decision that will be taken just in a week's
time. And I think that the decision that will be taken will be
found positive from the point of view of all members of the
alliance ... The important thing is that the unity of the -- the
general interest of the alliance should prevail, and it will.''
   Bush:
   ``I think great progress has been made ... We are in active
consultation with the Germans and others ... I think that we could
well have this resolved before the summit.
   ``There are strong-willed people from strong countries, and they
each have an opinion. But my role has been to try, behind the
scenes, to be helpful for working this problem out. And I should
salute the President of France as he has tried to be
extraordinarily helpful in working this problem out.''

   President Bush's sister injured three police
officers in a minor car accident en route to hear her brother speak
at Boston University's commencement.
   The officers had been directing Nancy Bush Ellis to a parking
area Sunday morning near the campus where 30,000 graduates and
their families were gathering to hear Bush and French President
Francois Mitterrand deliver the keynote addresses.
   Mrs. Ellis stopped to talk to the officers after she encountered
a roadblock. She put the car in reverse and the car suddenly
lurched backward and struck the officers, police said.
   ``One officer was hit in the knee with the car's fender, another
was hit by the door as it flung open, and a third was swept back
about 10 feet by the door itself,'' said Linda Orlando, a police
spokeswoman.
   Mrs. Ellis' Audi sedan then bashed into a police truck stationed
at the roadblock, Orlando said.
   Two of the officers sustained minor cuts and bruises and the one
who was swept back 10 feet sustained minor head and neck injuries,
Orlando said. All three men were treated at a hospital and released.
   Investigating officers reported there was no apparent negligence
on the part of Mrs. Ellis and no charges were filed, Orlando said.
   ``All's well that ends well, so to speak,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ellis did not answer a message left on the telephone
answering machine at her suburban Boston home.

   They may have been just yards from two world
leaders, but many graduating seniors were less than awestruck
during Boston University's 116th commencement.
   The presence of President Bush and France's President Francois
Mitterrand at Sunday's graduation caused a mixed reaction among the
roughly 5,400 graduates.
   ``We had to throw away the champagne bottles,'' said graduating
senior Dave Wheeler, 21, who received a degree in political
science. ``But I guess it is worth the trade-off if it means having
the president here.''
   Mary Hansel, 22, a graduating senior from Rochester, N.Y., said
some in her class thought Bush and Mitterrand would overshadow them.
   ``Some of the people fear it takes away from us,'' Hansel said.
``But mostly it is exciting. Most people can't believe we are
here.''
   But if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary
pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation, many of the
more than 30,000 alumni, friends and relatives in the packed
audience were thrilled.
   Some, like Saul Holtzman, 72, a member of the class of 1939,
came from Albuquerque, N.M., for the ceremony.
   ``It's great _ really exciting,'' said Holtzman, sitting with
other members of the 50th reunion class on Nickerson Field, which
was festooned with French flags. ``It's a lot different from 50
years ago. (Republican presidential candidate) Alf Landon was our
speaker then.''
   Adel Anbar, 23, a graduating senior, said his parents traveled
from the small Persian Gulf nation of Qatar when they heard that
Bush and Mitterrand were the featured speakers.
   ``It was a good reason for my parents to come,'' said Anbar.
   Bush and Mitterrand, and their wives, Barbara Bush and Danielle
Mitterrand, were welcomed with applause and cheers.
   The heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for
Democratic Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who has been under siege since
his failed presidential campaign for the state's fiscal crisis.
   Some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the
words, ``Bush Knew'' on their mortar boards. A few held up protest
signs when Bush began his address.
   ``I'm wearing this because Bush knew about the Contras but went
ahead and made Oliver North the scapegoat,'' said Claire Connelly,
22, a graduating senior from south Boston. ``It's an imperialist
presidency and Bush shouldn't be here.''
   Another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the
stadium, protesting Bush administration policies.
   But most of the students, a number of them holding tiny French
and U.S. flags, said they were pleased with the commencement. They
often interrupted Mitterrand's speech, cheering the French
president's exhortations for a better environment when he said,
``The earth is our planet, let us save it.''
   Wheeler, who will be attending law school, said most students
were glad Bush attended the graduation.
   ``We're all pretty bourgeois,'' he said.

   Up to 40,000 people in St. Louis rallied to demonstrate their
hope the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 decision that
legalized abortions, and more than 100 anti-abortion protesters
were arrested in Cleveland.
   In Pittsburgh, about 4,000 people sang and prayed, carrying
balloons and placards during an anti-abortion rally in the city's
Market Square. The protesters paraded through the downtown shopping
area in a light rain Saturday during the 10th Annual Greater
Pittsburgh March for Life.
   The St. Louis demonstrators gathered at Kiener Plaza on Sunday
without incident and no arrests were made, said police Lt. Roy
Miller.
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally in St.
Louis. But several police officers at the scene and pro-choice
supporters disagreed with the official crowd estimate. They said
only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were on hand.
   In Cleveland, 119 protesters were arrested Saturday outside of
two abortion clinics. They were charged with aggravated disorderly
conduct, resisting arrest and criminal trespassing.
   Edward J. Heben Jr., a lawyer representing the protesters, said
his clients planned to plead innocent to all charges today in
Cleveland Municipal Court.
   St. Louis demonstrators marched several blocks through downtown,
some holding balloons and banners. One teen-age girl carried a sign
saying, ``Thanks, Mom!''
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court heard arguments in a Missouri abortion case that
could be used to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized the procedure in 1973.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in
that case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use
of public funds.
   Loretto Wagner of Missouri Citizens for Life said rally
organizers hoped to impress the Supreme Court with the number of
people who attended the St. Louis event.
   During the rally, about 85 pro-choice supporters stood across
from Kiener Plaza. One woman carried a giant white coat hanger with
the messages ``Never again'' and ``Keep abortion safe and legal.''
   ``We just wanted to be a thorn in their side, to keep them
honest,'' said Brooke Petersen, a board member of the Missouri
affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The anti-abortion rally was sponsored by Missouri Citizens for
Life, along with the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee, the Christian
Action Council and Clergy for Life.

   American troops face a greater threat of
becoming involved in war because of guerrilla insurgencies in such
places as Central America, Peru or the Philippines than from
tensions with the Soviet Union, a Pentagon specialist says.
   ``That's the real threat. It's the real war,'' William Olson,
deputy assistant secretary for defense for low-intensity conflict,
said in a recent interview. ``But it's very difficult to go to the
American public and convince them that a country that has a
population less than Cook County, Illinois, is a threat to national
security.''
   Olson and others say Pentagon strategy for the past 40 years has
focused on possible confrontation with the Soviet Union, leading in
turn to an emphasis on massive troop deployments and expensive,
hi-tech weapons. They say the Defense Department's failure to
concentrate more on guerrilla wars left the United States
ill-prepared to deal with such low-intensity conflicts, which Olson
says can pose ``a threat to our economic interests, a threat to
political values, a threat to the survival of our friends and
allies.''
   Congress, noting the importance of the issue, in 1986 mandated a
special office to coordinate low-intensity conflict and special
operations. It called for a new command, an added assistant
secretary of defense and a special board within the National
Security Council.
   Since then, legislators have given high marks to the military
for moving ahead with the special operations command, which unites
the elite units of the Army, Air Force and Navy at MacDill Air
Force Base in Florida. But they point to foot-dragging surrounding
low-intensity conflict policy.
   ``Three problems are most glaring: the lack of interest in
low-intensity conflict which is most pronounced in non-defense
activities, major conceptual shortcomings, and the lack of
interagency coordination,'' four of the Senate proponents of the
legislation said in a Jan. 25 letter to Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft,
President Bush's national security director.
   ``Unfortunately, opposition within the Executive Branch has
blocked meaningful implementation of these important reforms,'' the
letter signed by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., John Warner, R-Va., Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and William Cohen, R-Maine, said.
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, of the House Committee on Armed
Services, said ``institutional opposition'' at the Pentagon delayed
the appointment of an assistant secretary of defense. Former
Ambassador Charles S. Whitehouse assumed the office in June 1988
but already is stepping down due to the change in administrations.
   Military and legislative sources said the leading candidate is
James R. Locher, an aide to Nunn, and that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has sent Locher's name to President Bush for approval.
   ``He's the only man for the job,'' retired Army Col. George
Talbot said of Locher. ``Of all the possible men who could make the
cut, Locher is the one.''
   Talbot was Olson's predecessor as Pentagon policy specialist for
low-intensity conflict from May 1987 to October 1987. He said he
quit because the Pentagon ``didn't want an activist guy'' and few
policy makers understand what guerrilla wars involve.
   ``In a very short time we get fed up,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It's not what the professional warrior class wants to
do. That's why we're no good at it.''
   Army Col. Ed Smith, in a position paper about low-intensity
conflict last year, said it is ``total war'' and described it as
``an armed conflict in a Third World country that affects national
security interests _ a conflict which has the potential to involve
U.S. armed combat forces.''
   Smith preferred the term ``high-probability conflict'' and
defined it as ``our Marxist-Leninist foes exploiting a U.S.
vulnerability _ the seams between the Department of State,
Department of Defense, and Congress created by regulatory missions
and statutes.''
   Guerrilla wars, such as those being fought today in El Salvador
and Peru, generally involve low levels of combat with weaponry no
more sophisticated than rifles or mortars. By definition, so-called
conventional wars use advanced fighter jets, tanks and missiles.
   Part of the U.S. armed forces program for low-intensity conflict
has been to train, equip and support foreign military forces. In
the case of El Salvador, 55 American advisers train the Salvadoran
military to combat a leftist guerrilla insurgency.
   ``The whole thrust of our low-intensity conflict policy is to
avoid the commitment of U.S. forces,'' Olson said. ``There is no
consensus in U.S. involvement in these small wars.''
   He said the military traditionally has cited tensions with the
Soviet Union to justify huge military outlays and sophisticated
weaponry. Soldiers, in turn, he added,received encouragement to
pursue careers in the infantry, cavalry or artillery rather than
the elite special operations forces.
   Kasich, however, said low-intensity conflict is the ``big
challenge'' and added: ``It doesn't matter if everybody understands
it. What matters is that you have people in the Senate and Congress
who support it.''

<HEAD>Oprah Winfrey Gives $1 Million To College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey received an honorary
doctorate from Morehouse College and gave $1 million to establish a
scholarship at the private men's college.
   ``The world awaits what you have to give,'' she said after
receiving an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree during
commencement ceremonies Sunday. ``The pressure is on.''
   Ms. Winfrey said she established the Oprah Winfrey Endowment
Scholarship Fund because she felt she should share her good
fortune. She chose Morehouse because the students and faculty
treated her warmly during a January 1988 visit, including sending
her a sweatshirt, she said.
   ``I wear that sweatshirt like I know everybody at Morehouse,''
she said. ``Now that I have this doctorate, people are going to
have to get a special dispensation to talk to me.''
   The college is distinguished by at least one famous graduate,
Martin Luther King Jr.
   King's son, Dexter, also attended the school, which is the site
the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel.
   Earlier Sunday, Ms. Winfrey told the congregation at West Hunter
Street Baptist Church, near downtown Atlanta, that she tries to
keep a positive attitude because to do otherwise ``damages your
spirit.''
   Ms. Winfrey recounted stories from her youth while speaking to
an overflow crowd, calling her life ``a long journey from just a
little colored girl to an African-American woman.''
   ``I, like a lot of people here, spent a lot of time trying to be
somebody I was not,'' she said. ``I spent a lot of time trying to
be Diana Ross ... then trying just to be someone supreme and to
stop somebody in the name of love.''
   She said that because of her celebrity status, she is exposed to
vicious rumors, which she tries to ignore.
   ``Every single negative thing you do damages your spirit,'' she
said. ``It keeps you from flying. The reason so many people can't
fly is because they've got too much garbage in their wings.''

<HEAD>Gas Price Hikes Slow, Rise Only a Penny a Gallon in Past Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average price of gasoline rose a penny a
gallon in the last two weeks, the smallest increase since the
Alaska oil spill sent gas prices soaring, an analyst said.
   For all grades of gasoline, pump prices rose to $1.1843 per
gallon between May 5 and Friday, Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   Wholesale prices dropped only about one-third of a cent per
gallon during the same period, according to the most recent
Lundberg Survey of 13,000 gasoline stations.
   ``This is the highest overall price seen for the nation since
January of 1986, just before the world oil price competition cut
world oil prices in half,'' Ms. Lundberg said of retail prices.
   But the recent price hike was the smallest since the March 24
grounding of the Exxon Valdez _ an environmental disaster that
briefly closed the Port of Valdez, temporarily cutting crude oil
supplies and sending prices soaring by 10 cents per gallon.
   That was followed by another nickel-per-gallon increase as of
April 21, Ms. Lundberg said.
   Heavy competition among wholesalers accounts for the small size
of the latest increase, she said.
   ``Wholesalers and refiners, knowing full well that the recent
prices were rapid and surprising to many consumers, are trying very
hard to tow the line and not to lose sales,'' she said.
   Normally, prices continue to rise during the high-consumption
summer season, so the price slowdown may not be a trend, Ms.
Lundberg said.
   ``It is possible that a lull in gasoline price rises will occur,
but it cannot be expected because demand seems strong at a time
when gasoline supplies are not in surplus,'' she said.
   Prices at self-serve stations were $1.0905 per gallon for
regular unleaded, $1.2415 for premium unleaded and $1.0742 for
regular leaded.
   Full service prices were $1.3358 cents per gallon for regular
unleaded, $1.4536 for premium unleaded, and $1.3109 for regular
leaded.

<HEAD>India Successfully Test Fires Its First Ballistic Missile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India crossed the threshold of ballistic
missile capability today by successfully test-firing its first
medium-range surface-to-surface missile into the Bay of Bengal,
news reports said.
   The missile was fired from the seaside launch site at Chandipur,
about 750 miles southeast of New Delhi, United News of India said.
   The 7.5-ton missile has a range capability of about 1,500 miles,
sufficient to hit targets as far as Iran, Hong Kong, China and
islands near the equator to the south, western military officials
said.
   It can also hit any target in neighboring Pakistan. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars in the past 42 years.
   Defense experts say the missile's one-ton payload capability is
more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead.
   The test firing was India's third attempt at launching the Agni
missile, whose name means ``fire'' in the ancient Sanskrit language.
   The first firing, scheduled for April 20, was postponed by
last-minute problems with the ignition system. A second launch, set
for May 1, was canceled after an error in one of the rocket's
sub-systems.
   By successfully firing the missile, India joined the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain in ballistic
missile capability.
   United News of India said 11,000 people living in 13 villages
near the launch site were evacuated from their homes Sunday evening
as a security measure. The villagers have protested the test-firing
for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if
more launches are held at Chandipur.
   Britain, India's colonia ruler, first used the site in 1893 to
test ammunition. The Indians turned it into a missile test range in
1986 because of an unusual feature _ it faced the Bay of Bengal and
during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles, enabling faster
and easier recovery of shells and other short-range projectiles.
   The bay also has light commercial and naval traffic.
   India has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for
peaceful purposes.
   Western military experts in New Delhi questioned the stance from
a military standpoint, however.
   ``You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a
conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``But if you are using a nuclear warhead, the exact target does
not matter,'' he said. ``I am not saying that the Indians are going
to use a nuclear warhead, but the question is why not.''
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and Western
nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic
weapon in one week.
   India says its nuclear program is intended for non-military
purposes, such as generating power. The test firing of the
intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, was only ``a
technology demonstration of the country's capabilities,'' according
to the government.
   India previously test-fired three surface-to-surface and
surface-to-air missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles.

<HEAD>Building Not Budging Despite Demolition Attempts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks in these parts don't have to go
all the way to Pisa to see the Leaning Tower after a stubborn
high-rise refused to collapse despite two demolition blasts.
   ``We've got one building leaning and one building leaning
against it,'' Police Maj. John Power said Sunday. ``It's a
hazardous condition and I don't know what could happen.''
   A cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the 10-story building
about 8:30 a.m., but the structure remained standing. Patrolman
John Egan said demolition crews were unsure why the implosion
failed to work.
   The demolition experts, who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in
the first implosion, fetched 36 pounds of more explosives for the
second try. This time, part of the building tipped slightly and
leaned against another tower, but the structure remained standing.
   Power said a few families living nearby would have to find
somewhere else to stay until the building was brought down.
Residents without a place to go would be accommodated, officials
said.
   Stephen O'Rourke, head of the city's housing authority, said it
could take two weeks for the wrecking crews to dismantle the
listing building.
   The Providence Housing Authority had planned to tear down the
complex and build smaller buildings for housing. City officials
felt that tearing down the deteriorating towers would be cheaper
than renovation.
   The tower and two others are the subject of a federal suit filed
by Project BASIC, a housing advocacy group, against the housing
authority. U.S. District Judge Raymond Pettine allowed the tower to
be demolished after architects ruled that the building, when being
prepared for demolition, was made unsafe.

<HEAD>Dollar Hits 19-Month High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massive dollar buying, spurred partly by unrest in
China, pushed the U.S. currency to a 19-month high today, while
stock prices gained moderately.
   The dollar's closing of 140.45 yen, up 1.68 yen from Friday's
close of 138.77 yen, marked the first time the dollar had closed
above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987.
   The dollar opened at 139.37 and ranged between 139.35 yen and
140.65 yen in heavy trading. With only a slight pause last Friday,
it has climbed 6.01 yen since May 11.
   Dealers said dollar buying also was encouraged by the dollar's
continued rise despite intervention by the Bank of Japan. The
central bank sold an estimated $2 billion.
   ``The unrest in Beijing was the direct motivation for the dollar
buying,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Dealers also mentioned political uncertainty in Japan, where the
ruling party has been unable so far to find a successor for Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who is resigning over an
influence-peddling scandal.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 144.65-point gainer on Friday, added another
65.90 points, or 0.19 percent, closing at 34,067.86.
   Securities dealers said many investors were waiting on the
sidelines to watch developments in exchange rates and in the
domestic political situation.
   Trade volume in the first section was estimated at 550 million
shares.
   ``Until the market environment clears, we can hardly predict the
market direction right now,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers attributed the slight gain in the Nikkei index to rises
in overseas stock markets last week.
   ``The market itself is ready for another rally, and we just have
to wait for the environment to calm down,'' the dealer said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Peter Evans, who appeared on Broadway
and in the television series ``9 to 5,'' has died from
complications of AIDS at age 38.
   Evans died Saturday at Century City Hospital, a nursing
supervisor confirmed Sunday.
   Acclaimed for a wide range of roles that included musical comedy
and classical theater, he made his New York theater debut in 1975
in David Storey's play ``Life Class.''
   In 1976, he was hailed for his performance as Richie in David
Rabe's ``Streamers.'' The performance won him the 1976 Clarence
Derwent Award and a nomination for a Drama Desk Award as
outstanding actor.
   He played opposite Maggie Smith in Tom Stoppard's ``Night and
Day'' on Broadway in 1979.
   He appeared in the films ``Arthur'' and ``Imposters'' and on
television in ``A Life in the Theater'' and the PBS series ``Best
of Families.''
   For the last several years, he had played the character of Russ
Merman on the TV comedy series ``9 to 5.''
   A native of Englewood, N.J., Evans graduated from Yale in 1972
and studied three years at the Central School of Speech and Drama
in London.
   Survivors include his parents, Dudley and Caroline Evans of
Demarest, N.J.; a brother, John Randall Evans of Severna Park, Md.;
and a sister, Elizabeth Temple Evans of Portland, Maine.

<HEAD>Chinese Students in U.S. Start ``Newslift,'' Denounce Peng</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Protesters in San Francisco started a ``newslift'' and East
Coast demonstrators said they no longer recognized China's
government as Chinese college students in the United States
expressed support for the uprising in their homeland.
   ``If the present government is still in power when we return, we
may suffer,'' said Liang Yongsheng, 38, a musicology student from
Beijing studying at Stanford University. ``There'll be a heavy
shadow hanging over all of us. But we can't worry about that. It's
too important for us to stand up and speak out now.''
   Rallies also were held this weekend in New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago and Lawrence, Kan.
   Students in the San Francisco Bay area have started using
telephones and facsimile machines to send information to
pro-democracy demonstrators in the Chinese capital. The effort,
dubbed an emergency ``newslift,'' began after Chinese government
officials declared a news blackout late Friday.
   ``People there know far less about what's going on than we do,''
said Yu Tau, president of the Chinese Students and Scholars
Friendship Association at the University of California at Berkeley.
   The support from Chinese college students in the United States
came as hundreds of thousands of students and supporters occupied
Beijing's Tianamen Square for a third day today. An ultimatum
issued by Premier Li Peng passed without any sign of a military
crackdown.
   In New York on Sunday, about 300 Chinese students delivered an
open telegram to the Chinese consulate pledging support for
protesters in Beijing and ``our complete disobedience to such a
hostile government.''
   ``Lots of the students are crying ... I feel like crying, too,''
said Dong Lu, a graduate student at Hunter College. ``I feel so sad
and so angry.''
   Three of the protesters met with Consul General Tang Uyu-Boo and
delivered an open telegram on behalf of 10,000 Chinese students on
the East Coast, Dong said.
   ``We no longer recognize the Chinese government led by Li Peng
as a legal administration in China, and we pledge our complete
disobedience to such a hostile government toward the whole Chinese
nation,'' the telegram said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Chinese consulate said
officials had no comment.
   Students in Beijing have led the largest uprising in the 40-year
history of the People's Republic of China. The United States is
host to about 40,000 students from that nation.
   In Montana, a leading Chinese dissident said Li will be forced
to resign by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Liu Binyan, a former high-ranking official at the People's
Daily, said several Chinese provinces and eight government
ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are refusing
to support Li Peng's government.
   Liu, an outspoken critic of corruption in government, was ousted
from the Chinese Communist Party in 1987, but is still vice
chairman of the Chinese Writers' Association. Liu said he remains
in close telephone contact with top-ranking officials in the
current government.
   He was at the University of Montana in Missoula to speak at a
human rights conference today.

<HEAD>Crockett and Tubbs Ride off Into Sunset After Solving Last Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crockett and Tubbs solved their last case on
NBC'S ``Miami Vice,'' tossed in their badges after breaking all the
rules and rode off, more or less, into the sunset alive and well.
   The rumor was that either Sonny Crockett, played by Don Johnson,
or Ricardo Tubbs, played by Philip Michael Thomas, would die in the
final two-hour show, which was broadcast Sunday night. But both
survived several gunfights, winding up five years on the air.
   As the hip, stylish series ended, Tubbs was preparing to return
to New York. Crockett was heading South.
   Crockett said, ``I'm going where the water's warm, the drinks
are cold and I don't know the name of the players.''
   Their final case was a suicide mission to a Latin American
country to snatch a dictator during a revolution. As usual, they
were double-crossed at every turn, but still came out the winners.
   In the finale, they took on federal agents trying to spirit the
dictator away to freedom in violation of an agreement that he would
turn informer on his drug-dealing partners.
   Their own police chief was on the Colombian payroll and was
killed. The dictator died as Crockett and Tubbs shot down his
seaplane when it was taking off on the Miami waterfront.
   ``Miami Vice'' made quite a splash with its debut in September
1984. Johnson and Thomas portrayed two dashing vice-squad
detectives on Florida's Gold Coast. They dressed in expensive
pastel-colored clothing, drove a Ferrari and solved their cases in
glamorous settings to the accompaniment of pulsating rock music.
   Johnson became a sex symbol as the macho detective who wore a
three-day growth of beard and no socks. He parlayed his fame into a
budding film career. Edward James Olmos also gained a movie career
from his role as the mystical, taciturn Lt. Castillo.
   The glitz soon wore off. After the first year, the stories
became mere excuses for Crockett and Tubbs to tool around in
nighttime Miami as the lights bounced off their Ferrari or as
backdrops for the fashion show.
   In the final season, at the insistence of NBC, the scripts were
improved, but the ratings continued to slip.
   At the beginning of the last season, executive producer Michael
Mann made preparations to end the show. He said he wanted the
series to go off in as stylish a manner as it had gone on.
   Last season, Crockett married a rock singer, played by Sheena
Easton, but after several shows she was killed. The current season
opened with Crockett believing he actually was his undercover alter
ego, drug dealer Sonny Burnett.
   Guest stars on the series over the years included singers Phil
Collins, Little Richard, James Brown, Ted Nugent and the Fat Boys.
Convicted Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy also made an
appearance, as did Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca.

<TEXT>
   Gilda Radner, a star in the early ``Saturday
Night Live'' comedy show who died at age 42 after a lengthy battle
with cancer, talked about confronting ``the Big C'' in her
forthcoming autobiography.
   ``I got a little cocky,'' she writes in ``It's Always
Something,'' due out in June. ``I always had a twinkle in my eye as
though I'd touched the face of God ... I was plenty full of myself.
   ``What I've learned the hard way is that there's always
something you can do. In some cases, death seems more desirable.
But there is always something you can do.''
   The creator of such memorable television characters as New
York-street smart reporter Roseanne Roseannadana, speech-impeded
talk show host Baba Wawa and out-of-sync editorialist Emily Litella
died of ovarian cancer Saturday with husband Gene Wilder at her
side.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with the cancer in 1986, died in
her sleep at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman
Ron Wise.
   She had radiation therapy and other treatments, including
surgery, as recently as February. She re-entered the hospital
Wednesday, Wise said.
   The comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that
``cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world.''
   In her book, Miss Radner writes that she did not see cancer in a
humorous light at all times, but there were moments.
   ``The next thing you know, I'm kind of running down the street
with my arms spread out in this raincoat yelling in a Captain
Midnight voice, `Cancer Woman,' look at her go!''
   In recent years Miss Radner appeared in several movies, but was
best known for roles in sketches on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,''
with such stars as Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Laraine
Newman, Garrett Morris, Bill Murray and the late John Belushi.
   The show brought her an Emmy Award for outstanding performance
by an actress in a variety series.
   On Saturday's show, host Steve Martin _ visibly choked with
emotion _introduced a 1978 clip in which he and Miss Radner did a
comic dance. ``You know, when I look at that tape I can't help but
think how great she was and how young I look,'' Martin said.
``Gilda, we miss you.''
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' Aykroyd said through a
spokeswoman. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Miss Radner had a ``very natural effervescence that seemed to
come out of her during those five years,'' Morris said. ``It was
just an electric thing that would even help you get through a
performance if you were down.''
   A Detroit native, Miss Radner attended the University of
Michigan and began her entertainment career in the Toronto Company
of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the ``Second City''

   She was chosen for the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live''
in 1975, and stayed with the show until 1980.
   She met Wilder in 1981 on the set of the movie ``Hanky Panky''
and the romance blossomed three years later while making ``The
Woman in Red,'' which was written and directed by Wilder.
   A return to television as a special guest on ``It's Garry

<TEXT>
   Gilda Radner's classmates and teachers remember
how she made them laugh long before her zany characters on
``Saturday Night Live'' made the nation laugh.
   While the show business world paid homage to Radner, 42, who
died Saturday in Los Angeles after a three-year battle against
ovarian cancer, the comedian was recalled by those who knew her in
her native Michigan.
   ``Her sense of humor was constant and engaging,'' said Richard
Burgwin, a retired University of Michigan drama professor. ``When
she was a student in Ann Arbor, we sort of got a free `Saturday
Night Live' every day because of that bubbling attitude toward
life, and it was original.''
   Radner ``was a wonderful fountain of wit and joy,'' Burgwin said
in a telephone interview from his home in Bradenton, Fla.
   Betty Irwin remembered the time in high school when Radner acted
like her ``Saturday Night Live'' co-star, Chevy Chase.
   ``There was a play once, `The Mouse That Roared,''' said Irwin,
a classmate of Radner's at the Liggett School in Grosse Pointe.
``She was upstairs in the dressing room trying to get dressed. Lee
Jenkins was the queen (on stage). Gilda lost her balance and
literally rolled down the stairs and onto the stage.
   ``She began ad-libbing right away,'' Irwin said. ``The teacher
behind the stage was just having a fit because she couldn't follow
the script. It was really cute.''
   Born in Detroit, Radner attended the all-girls Liggett School
and graduated in 1964.
   In her freshman year, Radner performed with her school choir
with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra at Ford Auditorium. In her
junior year, she transferred to Detroit Mumford High School and
worked as a volunteer at Sinai Hospital.
   ``Actually I was going to teach retarded kids. I used to work
with the emotionally disturbed in Detroit,'' she told the New York
Daily News in 1977.
   She returned to Liggett for her senior year, then enrolled at
the University of Michigan as a drama student. She left without
obtaining a degree.
   ``I think she was bored, quite frankly,'' Burgwin said. ``There
are performers who need and want training, and there are others who
are themselves, and ready to go.
   ``I think Gilda made the right judgment. What we had to give was
not what she needed.''

<HEAD>200,000 Rally in Yerevan, Call for Ouster of Armenian Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200,000 people rallied in the Armenian
capital of Yerevan and called for the ouster of the southern
republic's top three leaders, a local activist said today.
   Sunday's demonstration also called for a resolution of the
longstanding conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian
enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan, Rafael Popoyan
said in a telephone interview.
   More than 90 people were killed last year in ethnic clashes over
Nagorno-Karabakh, which many Armenians want annexed to their
republic.
   The demonstrators called for the replacement of Armenia's
Communist Party chief and the republic's president and premier.
   The crowd decided to halt a 4-day-old general strike at schools
and many businesses in anticipation of Thursday's inaugural session
of the country's new Congress of People's Deputies, Popoyan said.
   He said Armenia's deputies to the body would meet today or
Tuesday to discuss plans for asking the congress to take on the
problem of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   If the congress fails to respond, the strike may be renewed,
Popoyan said.

   The nation's heartland was hit by a rash of thunderstorms today
as a band of East Coast storms lost its punch.
   Thunderstorms were clustered in northern Oklahoma, central and
eastern Kansas and southern and central Missouri. Other bands of
thunderstorms were moving out of eastern Arkansas into western
Tennessee and northern Mississippi.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of an upper level
weather system were scattered across eastern South Dakota and
southeastern North Dakota.
   Thunderstorms that developed ahead of a cold front in the East
produced severe weather in North Carolina Sunday evening and then
weakened as they moved out to sea.
   Showers developing ahead of the same cold front fell in eastern
Maine and off the coast of Massachusetts this morning.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
much of the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys and Gulf Coast
states to Florida; scattered showers in northeastern New York state
and northern New England; and rain spreading into the Pacific
Northwest.
   Predicted highs: 60s along the northern California coast and
from the Pacific Northwest to northwest Montana; near 90 in
Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana; 90s in the southern Plains; 95
to 105 in southwest Texas and the desert Southwest; and 70s to 80s
across most of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 84 at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Roulette wheels came to rest and the
last card was turned onto the blackjack felt at Elsinore's Atlantis
Casino Hotel today as it became the first New Jersey casino closed
under state order.
   When dealer Stan Kowal dealt his last hand at 3:47 a.m., more
state gaming regulators were in the casino than customers, and
gamblers were saying ``Good luck'' to Atlantis employees.
   The state Casino Control Commission last week determined the
gaming hall's $144 million debt was too big a risk to the
industry's integrity to allow continued play on Atlantis'
three-tiered casino floor.
   Only subtle signs indicated casino employees were working their
last shift. A blackjack dealer taped a small ``Goodbye'' note to
his table, and some floor supervisors wore black-tinged carnations.
   At the craps table, Larry Fishman threw out the last set of dice.
   ``I enjoyed myself here for seven years,'' he said. ``I wanted
to do it for sentimental reasons, I guess.''
   Atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981,
when it opened as the Playboy Hotel &amp; Casino.
   In November 1985, Atlantis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, but when a reorganization plan was finally implemented
in September 1988, the losses continued to mount.
   The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the arm of the state
attorney general's office that polices the industry, reported that
the Atlantis was losing money at the rate of $56,000 a day.
   At the division's recommendation, the commission voted in April
not to renew Atlantis' regular casino license and appointed a
conservator.
   At least 1,000 of the hotel's 2,000 workers are affected by the
casino closing.
   Near the slot machines, mechanics gathered to console each other
this morning.
   ``Ordinarily, we'd be fixing machines, but it doesn't matter
now,'' said one mechanic who would identify himself only as John.
``It took me a year and a half to get this job, and now I'm out
looking again.''
   The fate of the casino rests in the hands of the casino
commission. Although developer Donald Trump has an agreement to
purchase the place from Elsinore Corp. for $63 million, the
state-appointed conservator, Joseph M. Nolan, has recommended that
Trump's agreement be rejected.
   Nolan argued that the deal was signed after he was in place as
conservator, and that higher bids have been made.
   He also suggested that Trump, who already owns two casinos and
is building a third, would wield too much economic power if he
bought the Atlantis and converted it into a luxury non-casino hotel
as planned.
   The Atlantis closing does not necessarily mark the end of the
legalized gambling ``experiment'' to rejuvenate the decaying
resort, said Marvin B. Roffman, a gaming analyst with the
Philadelphia investment house of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   But it does forewarn of other impending closures, he said.
   ``They'd better get used to these failures,'' he said. ``There's
going to be a bunch of them, simply because the casino industry is
so strung out now on debt. Last year's debt was over $2 billion,
and this year's will be even higher.''

   At a rally attended by tens of thousands, Boris
Yeltsin and other reformers elected to the new Soviet congress were
cheered as they swore to substitute their radical agenda for that
of the Communist Party.
   ``If, at this historic moment that is so important for the
future of our country, we permit the apparatus to dictate to us as
it has in past decades, we will not advance, but sink back into the
swamp from which we'd only begun to extricate ourselves,'' Yeltsin
told Sunday's rally.
   The Communist Party, whose members constitute 80 percent of the
new Congress of People's Deputies, convened a session of its
policy-making Central Committee today to work out its plans for the
body, which meets in inaugural session Thursday.
   But many of the 2,250 members of the new congress are
independent-minded Communists, and it was not known if they would
follow the party line.
   Yeltsin, a one-time Moscow party boss, is himself a member of
the party's 251-member Central Committee and at Sunday's rally he
and his anti-establishment colleagues called for contested
presidential elections and urgent action on the economy.
   He demanded that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev give a public
accounting of the first four years of his reforms during the
opening session. Only then should the congress decide if Gorbachev
should be re-elected president, Yeltsin declared.
   The reformers' talk of specific legislative proposals indicated
they may try to create a congress with far greater power than
Gorbachev may have intended. According to legislation approved last
fall, the body would have just one regular session a year and elect
from among its members the president as well as the smaller,
working parliament, the Supreme Soviet.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov told Sunday's rally that
the congress itself, not the Supreme Soviet, should be the supreme
legislative authority.
   The congress, directly elected by the people and a number of
official organizations, includes hundreds of reformers.
   It is not clear if the reformers constitute a large enough
faction to win selection to the working parliament.
   The party's intentions remained unclear. All 12 full members of
its ruling Politburo were elected deputies but it was not known if
they intend to serve in the Supreme Soviet as well.
   Many Soviets hope the congress will take swift action on
problems ranging from empty store shelves to the unresolved ethnic
conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   The radical tone of Sunday's rally, which drew an estimated at
30,000 people, was demonstrated by the loud cheers that greeted
Deputy Alexander Tolstoukhov's suggestion that ``we should elect
true people's power with a true people's president: Yeltsin!''
   Yeltsin was ousted as Moscow party boss in November 1987 and
lost his seat on the party's ruling Politburo after he criticized
the slow pace of Gorbachev's reforms.
   He made a comeback in the March congressional elections,
however, when his anti-establishment platform captured almost 90
percent of the vote in Moscow.
   Yeltsin on Sunday called for convening an ``extraordinary party
congress'' that would be empowered to replace old guard Communists
on the Central Committee and Politburo.
   He said a group of 39 deputies elected to represent Moscow in
the new congress has drafted its own agenda for the session and
demands ``radical decisions'' on reviving the stagnant economy,
guaranteeing social justice and developing a more open society.
   Yeltsin said that only after addressing that agenda and
evaluating Gorbachev's performance should the congress proceed ``to
elect the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from
among alternative candidates.''
   Gorbachev was unanimously elected to that post without an
opponent on Oct. 1. But that election was by the Supreme Soviet,
which has until recently been a rubber stamp legislature.
   Two prosecutors who have been accused of abusing their office in
conducting a probe of alleged official corruption also addressed
the rally to deafening cheers.
   Nikolai Ivanov, who was accused of slander after he said
publicly the names of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev and former
Politburo member Mikhail S. Solomentsev came up in his probe,
called for a wider investigation of former high officials.
   Fellow prosecutor and deputy Telman Gdlyan said the party and
government apparatus ``is scared by the people.'' The Soviet Union,
he said, ``is in the very depths of an economic, political, moral
and legal crisis.'' He demanded that apparatchiks ``give up power
to the people.''

<BYLINE>Two Leading Politicians Charged with Bribery in Recruit Scandal
^By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors filed bribery charges today against two
leading politicians, the first elected officials formally accused
in the Recruit influence-peddling scandal.
   Prosecutors said the two received donations and highly
discounted stock shares from the Recruit Co. in exchange for using
their political clout to help the company's magazine publishing
business.
   Charged were Takao Fujinami, 56, a former Cabinet minister and
member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and Katsuya
Ikeda, 52, former secretary general of the opposition Komeito, or
Clean Government Party. They were not taken into custody.
   The bribery charge carries a seven-year prison sentence.
   Before today, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen had been charged in
the scandal, which has eroded public trust in politics.
   Last month, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he would resign
to take responsibility. The Liberal Democrats still are searching
for a successor; most of the party's senior members have been
linked to the scandal.
   Prosecutors questioned Fujinami and Ikeda several times last
week, and their homes and offices were searched on Thursday.
   Ikeda, a former journalist and four-term member of Parliament's
lower house, said in a statement today that the charges ``are not
the truth. They are a fabrication of reality.''
   Fujinami said today that he would resign from the governing
party, Kyodo News Service reported. Ikeda announced last week he
would resign from Komeito and Parliament.
   Fujinami, the chief government spokesman in former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet and an eight-term member of
the lower house, was widely considered a rising star among Liberal
Democrats.
   He has acknowledged that an aide bought 12,000 shares of stock
in a Recruit subsidiary at discounted prices in 1986 and then
profited by about $215,000 when the stock was listed for public
trading and rose rapidly in value. Fujinami used a portion of the
profit to buy a house in Tokyo, according to news reports.
   Fujinami, a former labor minister, also reportedly received
about $640,000 in political donations from the company.
   Ikeda has admitted that his brother bought 5,000 shares of stock
in the Recruit subsidiary and profited by about $70,000. Ikeda
allegedly received $100,000 in donations from Recruit.
   Both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock
transactions.
   Prosecutors say profits from the transactions were deposited in
the politicians' bank accounts.
   They say Ikeda and Fujinami used their political influence to
persuade government officials to continue a ``gentlemen's
agreement'' among government agencies and private companies on a
uniform date for the hiring of graduating college students. Recruit
believed the agreement was crucial for the sale of its employment
magazines, prosecutors say.
   Prosecutors now have completed the bribery investigation in the
scandal and now will focus on illegal political donations made by
Recruit, an information services and publishing conglomerate, news
reports said.
   Japanese law limits the amount of money that companies can
donate to politicians. A company the size of Recruit is restricted
to about $110,000 in political donations a year.
   Prime Minister Takeshita has acknowledged that he received about
$1 million in donations from Recruit betweeb 1985 and 1987.
   The Liberal Democrats last week agreed to the opposition's
demand that Nakasone testify before Parliament about any links he
may have to Recruit. He is expected to testify on Thursday.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Curiosity is luring
tourists to America's oldest national park a year after fire
scarred roughly half of its 2.2 million acres.
   ``I haven't been here since I was a kid,'' said John Gurrad, of
Albuquerque, N.M. ``If the fires hadn't happened, I wouldn't have
come here.''
   Robert Barbee, superintendent of the 117-year-old park, said
Saturday that predictions that curiosity would attract visitors
appeared to be coming true.
   ``There was great concern early on because reservations were
down,'' he said. ``But that has reversed itself. In April, our
reservations were 29 percent above last April. I am convinced we
are going to have an excellent season.''
   Officials for TW Recreational Services, the park's chief
concessionaire, report bookings at the Old Faithful Inn, the only
lodging open during the park's early spring season, were running 5
percent ahead of projections.
   Sharon Roe, front office manager, said all 327 rooms have been
booked since May 14.
   Some areas that were burned are erupting in the reds, yellows
and oranges of wildflowers, although many areas remain blackened
from the fires.
   ``I didn't think it would be as bad as what I read,'' said Larry
Long, a park visitor. ``And I don't think it is. I think it will
get better over time.''
   On Saturday, NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw, speaking at a conference
of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, defended news coverage of the
fires. He said the impression the park was destroyed was reached
largely by the news audience itself.
   ``Too many people think of a national park as a city park,
except larger,'' he said. ``The same popular perception applies to
fires. They think of flames only as a destructive force. When there
are fires in a national park, to most people, that is not good
news.''
   Visitors on Saturday said they did not believe the fires took
anything away from the park's basic beauty.
   ``I think a lot of it here is still really pretty,'' Gurrad
said. ``But there are going to be some pretty ugly spots, too.
There are some spots that are really dead.''

   The People's Liberation Army, once rooted in
rigid communist ideology, was making a transition from
revolutionary force to modern army when it was confronted by the
surprising strength of the pro-democracy movement.
   Although the imposition of martial law makes the demonstrations
in Beijing illegal, solidiers have been reluctant, unable or
ordered not to halt them.
   Young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the
capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened
intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic
reform. Some flashed V-for-victory signs when their trucks
retreated away from the city.
   It has become even harder to decipher how senior military
officers were reacting to the most serious challenge to the social
order the Communist Party has faced in its 40-year rule.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's one remaining official post is as
head of the Central Military Commission, and it is believed to have
been Deng who ordered the crackdown on the student movement.
   The 84-year-old Deng is certain to have the support of other
older officers who served in the old Red Army and continue to
regard the People's Liberation Army as the last bastion of
revolutionary integrity.
   Less certain is the backing of younger officers, the PLA's new
ranks of professionals who may share some of the students' concerns
about the slow pace of political reform in China.
   The PLA played a major role in restoring order during the
chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fighting between
different leftist factions brought China to the brink of civil war.
   Since then, however, the nation's trust in the ideological
purity of the PLA has begun to slip.
   In the early 1980s, the army abandoned Mao Tse-tung's concept of
a guerrilla ``people's war,'' in which the army would beat back an
attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor.
   Deng has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since
1985, when China fielded 4.2 million soldiers. He has brought back
a ranking system abandoned for 23 years, emphasized better training
and sought to create a modern military force.
   The PLA, however, has been saddled with severe budgetary
restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic
modernization programs. About two-thirds of defense industry
factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost
national production and exports.
   From 1950 to 1980, defense spending accounted for 17.2 percent
of China's state expenditures, the PLA says. In 1988, it received
only 7.49 percent of the budget. Defense spending in actual terms
is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation.
   In the past, PLA ranks were filled with young people attracted
to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of
escaping rural poverty. PLA members still command respect, but the
low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more
difficult.
   In well-off rural areas, families commonly pay off local
officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment.
   One recent report in the official media said the army is ending
up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who
have criminal records.
   Many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to
civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts
young people have come to expect. Such recruits are now listening
with sympathy when students their own age chant ``the people's army
belongs to the people.''

   Republican mayoral candidate Ronald Lauder says
his campaign has a right to question the link between Panamanian
dictator Manuel Noriega and Rudolph Giuliani, Lauder's rival for
the GOP nomination.
   Giuliani, Manhattan's former federal prosecutor, recently joined
the law firm White &amp; Case, which lists Panama as a client. The firm
has said it has done no work for Noriega himself.
   A Lauder commercial depicts side-by-side pictures of Giuliani
and Noriega, who has been indicted in Florida on drug trafficking
charges. An announcer says: ``Rudy Giuliani is being paid almost $1
million by the law firm that represents Panama's drug dictator
Noriega. That's incredible. That's Rudy Giuliani.''
   Giuliani on Saturday called the spot ``a lie _ an outrage to me
and my family.''
   His spokesman, Charles Perkins, said the law firm ``has never
worked for Manuel Noriega, and Rudy Giuliani's salary is nowhere
near $1 million.''
   Retorted Lauder, ``Everything I've read over the years is that
Noriega is Panama.''

   Three men linked to a radical
Palestinian group suspected in the Pan Am bombing over Scotland
have been charged with attempting to bomb Israeli and U.S. airline
offices, according to news reports.
   Two other men also linked to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command have been arraigned on
charges involving robberies in the Stockholm area, the Sunday
reports said.
   The PFLP-GC, a splinter group opposed to Yasser Arafat's PLO, is
suspected of being behind the bombing of New York-bound Pan Am
Flight 103, which expoded over Scotland in December, killing 270
people.
   The five men were arraigned on Saturday. They were detained in a
roundup of 15 people by security police on Thursday. Police have
refused to comment on the case or say whether the other 10 were
released.
   Three of the men were charged with suspected complicity in a
1985 terrorist attack on a Danish synagogue and the attempted
bombings of Israeli and U.S. airline offices, according to the news
reports.
   The Dagens Nyheter daily quoted a prosecutor as saying police
identified the fingerprints of one of the suspects from a bag used
in an unsuccessful bomb attack on the Israeli El Al airline office
in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1985.
   One person was killed and about 20 injured in the bombings of a
synagogue and the Northwest Orient Airlines office in the Danish
capital the same year. Other bombings linked to PFLP-GC occurred at
an El Al office in Amsterdam in 1985 and Northwest Orient in
Stockholm in 1986.
   The three suspects in the bomb attacks were arraigned in a
district court in Uppsala, where news reports said the PFLP-GC ring
was based.
   The other two were arraigned south of Uppsala in Stockholm on
charges of making illegal threats and receiving stolen goods,
according to the reports.

   Two rival Tamil rebel groups battled
in a northern jungle, and at least 51 people were killed, the
military said today.
   Guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest
Tamil rebel organization, attacked a camp of the People's
Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam in Mannar district, 140
miles north of Colombo, said the military officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   The fighting lasted all Saturday night, and at least 51 people
were killed, the officials said, quoting intercepted radio
communications.
   The two groups have been enemies since the People's Liberation
Organization accepted a 1987 peace accord offering limited autonomy.
   The Liberation Tigers rejected the accord and continued to fight
for an independent Tamil nation. But recently they accepted a
government offer for talks, and five rebel leaders are negotiating
with officials in Colombo.
   Tamil guerrillas began their separatist war in 1983, claiming
they were discriminated against by the island nation's majority
Sinhalese.

<TEXT>
   Sixty lawmakers from the governing
Nationalist Party demanded today a halt to all private contacts
with China to protest the communist government's hard line against
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``We should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland
until the Chinese communists lift martial law and end any military
crackdown,'' the legislators said in a statement to the government.
   On Saturday, Chinese Premier Li Peng imposed martial law in
Beijing and ordered troops to end massive protests that have spread
through China the past month. His hard-line policy has encountered
resistance, and reports from Beijing on Monday said military
leaders have opposed it.
   The Taiwan lawmakers said the Nationalist government should
offer to open direct trade and shipping links between the rival
nations if China cancels the crackdown order and acknowledges the
protests are ``patriotic and democratic.'' The legislature, which
is dominated by the Nationalist Party, has 297 seats.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a
civil war on the mainland, continue to claim they are the
legitimate government of all China. They are technically still at
war with the Chinese communists, and they have refused to have any
direct contacts with the mainland government.
   But in the past two years, they have pursued a flexible policy
that has allowed Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade
through third countries.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said on Sunday that Taiwan
would continue to pursue its flexible policy but would reassess it
if the situation on the mainland deteriorates and threatens to
endanger Taiwan residents.
   Legislator Huang Chu-wen, who initiated the statement signed by
60 lawmakers, said a successful military crackdown could set back
democracy on the mainland by 20 years and ``we would miss a good
opportunity to reunite (China) peacefully.''
   The Nationalists ended 38 years of martial law in 1987. They say
China and Taiwan, considered a Chinese province by both the
Nationalists and communists, should be reunited under a democratic
system.
   The legislators said they will submit their statement to the
lawmaking Legislative Yuan for discussion Tuesday and then relay it
to the government Cabinet.
   Also Monday, Hu Chin-heng, 35, a clerk at the Ministry of
Communications, began a three-day hunger strike in Taipei to
protest what he described as ``Taiwanese indifference'' to the
democracy movement in China.
   Hu, a native Taiwanese, staged his strike at a park dedicated to
the late President Chiang Kai-shek, who led the defeated
Nationalists to Taiwan from the mainland. Chiang died in 1975.
   Students and faculty at some universities have signed petitions
supporting the democracy movement in China, but there have been no
major public rallies.

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops in the occupied Gaza Strip
detained more than 250 Moslem fundamentalists and seized a cache of
automatic weapons in the biggest arrest raid since the Palestinian
uprising began, the army announced.
   In the occupied West Bank today, unidentified gunmen fired three
shots at police in the center of Bethlehem, police and army
officials said. One shot hit a police car, but no one was injured.
   Israel radio said soldiers at a hitch-hiking post in the Negev
desert reported gunmen in a passing car shot at them today. They
were not hit.
   The shootings and discovery of the weapons cache came amid
mounting concern over Palestinian threats to step up violence and
end a policy of not using guns in the 17-month-old uprising.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, the deputy army spokesman, said there
recently has been an increase in Palestinians' use of firearms.
   ``We see it as a grave development,'' he said in an interview.
   Elsewhere today, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in a
clash in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Dir El Balah. And six women
were hurt by metal pellets fired by soldiers in the West Bank town
of Tulkarem, Arab reports said.
   In clashes on Sunday, soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians
and wounded at least 25, according to hospital reports. The deaths
raised to 496 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied lands began in December 1987.
Twenty-two Israelis have been slain.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of the army's central command,
said the arrest operation in the Gaza Strip was a ``decisive blow''
to Hamas, an organization of Moslem fundamentalists.
   ``In the long term ... there will be a reduction of violence in
the area,'' Mordechai said in comments broadcast on Israel radio.
   Hamas, which means ``zeal'' in Arabic, takes a harder line than
the Palestine Liberation Organization in seeking an Islamic nation
that would exclude the existence of a Jewish state. Many of its
leaders oppose peace negotiations with Israel.
   An army announcement said security forces confiscated 18
weapons, including pistols, U.S.-made M-16 and Soviet Kalashnikov
automatic rifles, Israeli Uzi submachine guns and Swedish Karl
Gustav rifles.
   The statement said Hamas members fired at an Israeli car and an
Israeli man digging a well in Gaza in March 1988. The group also
was blamed for throwing an explosive device at Israeli soldiers.
   According to the army, Hamas planned anti-Israeli
demonstrations, firebombed shops of storekeepers who violated
strike orders by the uprising leadership and killed Arabs suspected
of collaborating with Israel or those who were involved in drugs
and prostitution.
   About 45 suspected collaborators have been killed in the
uprising.
   Mordechai said that among those detained was Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas who was accused of ordering
beatings and shootings of suspected collaborators.
   Yassin, who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, had been
sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1984 after being convicted of
having knowledge of concealed weapons. He was released in a
prisoner exchange in 1985.
   The raids against Hamas were conducted during a six-day curfew
in the Gaza Strip that confined some 700,000 people to their homes.
   The army lifted the curfew on Sunday but few Gazans went to
their jobs in Israel because of a strike ordered by leaders of the
uprising.
   There was increased concern that Palestinians had escalated
their rebellion.
   A leaflet published this week by pro-PLO activists called on
Palestinians to kill an Israeli soldier or settler for every
Palestinian killed by Israeli soldiers.
   Last week, three Palestinians fired on Israeli troops in a West
Bank village, killing one soldier and wounding seven before they
were killed. It was the first gun battle of the uprising.
   Mohammed Abbas, the chief of a radical PLO faction, also called
for the use of firearms by Palestinians in an interview published
in the Kuwaiti daily Al Watan on Sunday.
   The United States has accused Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas,
of involvement in the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship
Achille Lauro in which an American, Leon Klinghoffer of New York,
was killed.

<TEXT>
   The teachers strike in the nation's
second-largest school district entered its second week today after
weekend talks broke down.
   Union representatives walked away from the bargaining table
after two hours Sunday night.
   ``It's been a waste of time,'' said Wayne Johnson, president of
United Teachers-Los Angeles. ``I think that their whole agenda now
is not to bring about a satisfactory solution. Their whole agenda
is to break UTLA.''
   No formal talks have been scheduled in the dispute, which has
crippled the 500,000-student district since May 15, when the union
representing 22,000 of the system's 32,000 teachers, counselors,
nurses and librarians walked out.
   The strike is the district's first since a 23-day walkout in
1970.
   School board President Roberta Weintraub said the district had
boosted its offer of a 21.5 percent raise over three years to 24
percent, contingent on the district getting a share of a $2.5
billion state tax windfall.
   The teachers call that contingency unacceptable and are
demanding 26 percent.
   Many students have stayed out of the classrooms. Students in
some schools were put in auditoriums because there weren't enough
substitute teachers.
   Teachers earn between $23,440 and $43,319 a year.

   The Soviet Union said today it will cut sharply
the number of British employees in Moscow, apparently in
retaliation for the expulsions from Britain of 11 Soviets accused
of espionage.
   Britain said on Sunday that it secretly ordered the expulsion of
eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists on Friday. On
Saturday, the Soviet Union retaliated with an identical set of
expulsions of Britons.
   The Soviets took the diplomatic rift a step further today.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasmiov told a news
conference that the number of Britons accredited in Moscow and the
number of Soviets working for Britons would be reduced from 375 to
205.
   The new limit for British employees would be equal to the number
of Soviets now permitted to work in Britain.
   The British Embassy had no immediate comment on Gerasimov's
statement.
   Gerasimov did not say how long the reductions would take, or who
exactly they would affect.
   In London today, the Soviet Embassy said Britain provoked the
dispute with its expulsions on Friday.
   Embassy Counselor Lev Parshin called the expulsion order
``deplorable, unfriendly and provocative'' and said it ``remains to
be seen'' how the dispute will affect Anglo-Soviet relations.
   He denied that the expelled Soviets had done anything wrong.
   Britain on Sunday said its expulsions were legitimate, though it
did not give details, and that the Soviet response was unjustified.
Independent Television News radio said the Soviets had been caught
spying on military installations.
   Both countries expelled eight diplomats and three journalists
and each was was given 14 days to leave.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the British Broadcasting
Corp. she was disappointed Britain had to expel the Soviets, but
``we gave them the chance and they have not taken it and they have
revealed their true nature.''
   She said Britain had hoped a new era was being ushered into the
Soviet Union by President Mikhail Gorbachev, but ``many things are
still the same.''
   The rift came at a time of improved relations between the
nations. The two leaders enjoy a good personal relationship, and
Gorbachev received a warm greeting when he visited London in early
May.
   One of the expelled journalists, Sunday Times correspondent
Angus Roxburgh, denied spying and said he was angry with London and
Moscow over ``being caught up in the latest diplomatic chess game.''
   ``Why do the British have such a predilection for expelling
Soviet spies? Presumably there are as many Russians engaged in
`impermissible activities' in West Germany, France or the U.S., yet
expulsions from those countries are much rarer,'' he wrote in The
Times today.
   The other journalists expelled on Saturday, Jeremy Harris of the
British Broadcasting Corp. and Ian Glover-James of Independent
Television News, also denied improper conduct.
   ``I'm not guilty of any spying, lawbreaking or any impermissible
activity,'' he said.
   BBC's deputy director-general, John Birt, said the BBC would
``vigorously resist'' Harris' expulsion.
   The British Foreign Office accused the Soviets of ``incompatible
activities,'' diplomatic parlance for espionage.
   Foreign Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe called Britain's action ``a
measured action in respect of established misbehavior.'' Britain
had ``incontrovertible evidence'' of wrongdoing by the expelled
Soviets, he said.
   Asked why the British government kept its expulsions quiet, the
Foreign Office spokesman said, ``We look at these on a case-by-case
basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity.''
   The opposition Labor Party said Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
government had kept a ``bizarre and inexplicable silence.''
   ``The British public deserve a lot more information before they
will accept that this is justified,'' said party spokesman George
Robertson.
   The diplomatic row was the biggest between the two countries
since 1985, when both expelled 31 diplomats, journalists and other
representatives. In 1971, Britain expelled 105 Soviets.
   The Soviet move against Britain on Monday could mirror action it
took against the United States in the middle of a spying dispute in
October 1986. In that case, the Soviets stripped the U.S. Embassy
of 260 Soviet employees who handled many of the mission's
non-diplomatic jobs.
   Since then the U.S. Embassy has operated without Soviet
employees.

   Seventy-five potential jurors began filling out
questionnaires today for the trial of Pat Swindall, a two-term
Republican congressman who lost his seat while under the cloud of a
perjury indictment.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman has said he wants to try to
seat a jury before ruling on Swindall's request to move the trial
out of town.
   A judge aborted Swindall's first trial six months ago after
Swindall campaign mailings proclaiming his innocence arrived at the
homes of at least two jurors.
   Freeman set aside the entire day to complete the questionnaires
and allow lawyers to study the answers. Questioning of prospective
jurors was set for Tuesday.
   Swindall, who acted as his own attorney last fall, is
represented this time by Richard Hendrix, a former federal
prosecutor.
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal
grand jury. Each charge carries 10 months to five years in prison.
   The trial could determine his political future. The 38-year-old
conservative has said he would like to run against Democratic Sen.
Sam Nunn in 1990.
   Swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury in 1988 when he
said he did not remember being told that an $850,000 home mortgage
loan he was seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds.
   Swindall negotiated the loan with a money broker who turned out
to be an undercover federal agent, and the prosecution has a
recording of the agent telling Swindall he had a ``gut feeling''
drugs were involved.
   In October, Swindall, running for re-election and hoping to
clear his name, waived his right to file pre-trial motions and got
an immediate trial.
   But Judge Robert Vining aborted the trial.
   Swindall lost his seat in Atlanta's eastern suburbs to Democrat
Ben Jones on Nov. 8.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study a
federal regulation aimed at saving the government time and money
when it mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients.
   The court said it will study a ruling in a Colorado case that
struck down the regulation.
   The regulation applies to two Social Security programs: old age,
survivors and disability insurance benefits and supplemental
security income.
   Adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services, the rule
covers instances in which the government at different times
overpays and underpays benefit recipients.
   The rule allows officials to balance the overpayments against
underpayments, arriving at a net amount that is either owed the
government or the recipient.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver, ruled
last August that the regulation is illegal because it may operate
to deprive needy recipients of the chance to keep overpayments.
   The appeals court ruling applies to recipients in Colorado,
Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Federal appeals
courts elsewhere have handed down conflicting rulings.
   The 10th Circuit court said federal law requires that the
government abandon recovery of overpayments when a recipient is
blameless or if returning the extra benefits would cause the
recipient serious hardship.
   The appeals court rejected government arguments that allowing
recipients to keep the extra money is an unfair windfall.
   ``An overpaid beneficiary who does not have to repay excess
benefits is not receiving a windfall but rather is benefitting from
Congress' express provision that recovery (by the government) must
be waived in appropriate situations,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department laywers said
the appeals court misunderstood the way the disputed regulation
works. They said the rule would not deprive needy people of the
opportunity eventually to keep the extra money.
   The government said the regulation would spare the government
from paying out millions of extra dollars automatically and then
going through an elaborate procedure to recover some of the money.
   Government lawyers said that from 1981 to 1986 an average of 4.7
million people each year received too much or too little due to
errors in the retirement and survivor's insurance program alone.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Everhart, 88-1323.

<TEXT>
   Mass murderer John Wayne Gacy, convicted and
sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys and young men, lost
a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices rejected arguments that Illinois' death penalty law
wrongly gives county prosecutors ``complete and unguided discretion
to determine whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases.''
   Gacy's appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial
because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert
psychiatric witness for the defense.
   Both arguments were rejected by the Illinois Supreme Court last
Sept. 29.
   The high court's action came without comment other than a
dissenting statement by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, who oppose capital punishment under all circumstances.
   No one in U.S. history has been convicted of killing more people
than Gacy.
   Police found 29 of Gacy's victims in the crawl space beneath his
Norwood Park Township home in Chicago. Four more had been in nearby
rivers.
   Prosecutors said the murders were committed over a three-year
period beginning in 1975.
   Gacy said he strangled all but one of the 33 by wrapping rope
around their necks and twisting it with a stick. He sexually
assaulted some of the victims before killing them.
   A Chicago native, Gacy lived in Springfield, Ill., and in Iowa
before returning to Chicago in the early 1970s to start a
successful remodeling business. He often hired teen-age boys.
   Gacy, who received death sentences for 12 of the murders and
life terms for each of the remaining 21, now resides at Menard
Correctional Center in Chester, Ill.
   A January execution date was postponed, and no new date has been
set. The last execution in Illinois occurred in 1962.
   Gacy's name surfaced briefly in the 1988 presidential campaign
when a pamphlet distributed by Illinois Republicans contended that
Gacy would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed
his crimes in Massachusetts under Gov. Michael Dukakis'
administration.
   Dukakis labeled the pamphlet ``garbage,'' and Gacy later wrote
to state Republican officials to complain about what he called the
``sleazy'' tactic.
   The case is Gacy vs. Illinois, 88-6828.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Shield Chicago from Being Sued Over Airport Noise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to shield
Chicago from being sued for monetary damages in state court for
allegedly allowing excessive noise and air pollution at O'Hare
International Airport.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that could
allow such lawsuits.
   Chicago owns and operates O'Hare, one of the world's busiest
airports. Lawyers for the city said the number of flights in and
out of O'Hare is projected to rise to over one million a year by
1995.
   Lawrence Bieneman, who since 1967 has lived in suburban
Bensenville, sued the city and various other defendants in federal
court over O'Hare. The suit included allegations that Bieneman's
constitutionally protected property rights were being violated and
that the airport was a nuisance.
   A federal trial judge threw out the entire lawsuit, but the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said last Dec. 13 that the judge had
gone too far.
   The appeals court ruled that Bieneman should have a chance to
prove the nuisance and other state tort law claims in an Illinois
court.
   Such a lawsuit is not pre-empted by federal law, the appeals
court said.
   The Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that state and local regulations
of airports and air travel generally must yield to federal control.
The court said an airport may not be charged with negligence or
creating a nuisance for conduct that complies with federal laws and
regulations.
   But the 1973 decision did not involve a government-run airport,
and a now-disputed footnote to that ruling said, ``We do not
consider here what limits, if any, apply to a municipality as a
proprietor.''
   In Bieneman's case, the 7th Circuit court said, ``Neither the
Constitution nor the Federal Aviation Act, as amended by the Noise
Control Act of 1972, determines how Illinois apportions its
governmental powers.''
   The appeals court said the 1973 Supreme Court ruling allows
states to govern the operation of publicly owned airports. It
ordered that Bieneman's suit be dismissed without prejudice so he
could pursue his case in state court.
   In Chicago's appeal, lawyers for the city argued, ``With jet
travel comes noise and with such noise come attempts by state and
local governments and by individuals such as Bieneman to limit
noise.''
   ``To the extent such state and local measures pertain to noise
from planes in flight,'' the appeal said, ``they run afoul of the
federal regulatory scheme and of considerations of interstate
commerce.''
   The justices today also rejected a separate appeal by Bieneman
seeking to revive his constitutional claims, and a third appeal by
numerous airlines operating out of O'Hare.
   The cases are Chicago vs. Bieneman, 88-1496; Bieneman vs.
Chicago, 88-1497; and Amerian Airlines vs. Chicago, 88-1670.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Former Chicago Councilman Convicted of Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a former Chicago councilman convicted of fraud for conspiring
illegally to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case of
Thomas E. Keane to set guidelines on when some people may challenge
their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those
convictions.
   Only Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in
Keane's case.
   Keane, 83, was paroled in 1978 after nearly two years in prison.
   Lower courts said, in effect, Keane now has too little at stake
to mount such a challenge.
   The Bush administration, although agreeing with the lower
courts, nevertheless urged the justices to hear Keane's appeal.
Justice Department lawyers said the case should be used to resolve
a recurring conflict among federal courts.
   For example, former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel's conviction
under the same federal anti-fraud law was overturned by a federal
judge in 1987 after Mandel was released from prison. The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.
   The Bush administration has an appeal pending before the high
court that seeks to reinstate Mandel's conviction, which stemmed
from a scheme to help friends who owned a racetrack in return for
more than $380,000 in gifts.
   In the case acted on today, Keane was convicted in 1974 of mail
fraud. Prosecutors said that while a city councilman he formed a
secret partnership to acquire tax-delinquent property at Cook
County scavenger sales.
   The prosecutors said Keane used his influence as chairman of the
city council's finance committee to reduce tax liens on the parcels
and then convinced friends at public agencies to buy the parcels at
more than their market price.
   There was conflicting evidence at the trial as to whether Keane
made a profit from his efforts. A separate state court trial
concluded that Keane did not make any money.
   The jury in the federal trial was told it could convict Keane of
fraud without finding that he made any profit or that the taxpayers
suffered a tangible loss.
   A guilty verdict could be based on a finding Keane defrauded the
citizens of Chicago of their intangible right to his faithful and
loyal services, the jury was told.
   After his federal conviction, Keane was sentenced to prison and
fined $27,000.
   Years after he was freed and completed his parole, the Supreme
Court ruled in 1987 that a federal mail fraud conviction may not be
based on a defendant's defrauding the public of its intangible
right to honest and impartial government.
   The justices said there must be some tangible loss suffered by
taxpayers.
   That ruling prompted Keane to go back to the federal courts to
have his conviction overturned. He also sought return of the
$27,000 fine.
   A federal judge threw out Keane's challenge, and the decision
was upheld last July by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said too little was at stake for the courts to
expend valuable resources to consider the challenge years after
Keane had served his time in prison.
   The $27,000 fine ``is a sunk cost rather than a continuing
disability producing additional injury as time passes,'' the
appeals court said.
   It also said the harm to Keane's reputation does not ``justify
the investment of judicial time necessary to decide whether he is
entitled to vindication.''
   Keane might have been convicted of mail fraud even if the jury
were told to base its verdict on a tangible loss of property, the
7th Circuit court added.
   ``No one can accept without unease the thought the legal system
tolerates erroneous convictions,'' the appeals court said. But it
said, ``At some point the judicial system must close old files and
turn to the future, regretfully accepting the risk of error lest
the quest for perfect justice becomes the enemy of adequate
justice.''
   Justice Department lawyers said even though they agreed with the
7th Circuit court ruling the Supreme Court should review the matter.
   Other appeals courts erroneously have made it easier for
convicted criminals who have completed their sentences to challenge
their convictions, the government said.
   The case is Keane vs. U.S., 88-1178.

<HEAD>Year's Third Condor Hatching Ups Species Count to 31</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials believe the endangered
California condor is on the rebound after the hatching of a fourth
bird bred in captivity.
   Kaduku, whose Konkow Indian name means ``very strong being, both
physically and spiritually,'' became the 31st known condor when it
popped out of its shell Sunday at the San Diego Wild Animal Park
without much help from keepers.
   The chick weighed in at 5.8 ounces. Its aqua-colored egg was
laid on Easter.
   ``This is the first time in two decades that there have been
more than 30 of the birds,'' said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. ``We
expect a lot more hatches next year.''
   All known California condors, which are North America's largest
land birds with wingspans up to 9{ feet, have been captured in
hopes of rebuilding their numbers to the point where the species
can be reintroduced in the wild.
   Seventeen of the birds are at the Wild Animal Park; the 14
others are at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Molloko, the first captive-bred condor, which hatched last year,
remains in good health, as do all three chicks produced this year,
Hanscom said.
   Another egg is expected to hatch in about two weeks. Next year's
mating season, more of the condors will have reached sexual
maturity.
   Handlers feed the chicks using lifelike condor puppets to keep
the birds from becoming attached to humans.
   The number of the black carrion-eaters dwindled dangerously low
because of shooting and pesticide poisoning.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T's Largest Union Authorizes Strike; Saturday is Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of AT&amp;T's largest union voted
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract with the
telecommunications giant is not reached by Saturday, union
officials said today.
   The Communications Workers of America did not release a
breakdown of the vote authorizing its executive council to call a
strike, with the date to be determined by union President Morton
Bahr. CWA represents about 130,000 American Telephone and Telegraph
Co. employees.
   ``At this stage, AT&amp;T has yet to seriously address issues of
concern to our members, particularly the issue of employment
security,'' Bahr said in announcing results of the secret-ballot
authorization vote.
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which
represents about 40,000 AT&amp;T employees, is negotiating jointly with
CWA and is conducting a strike authorization vote.
   ``We're united with CWA,'' IBEW President John Barry said in a
statement released with the CWA results. ``Together our members are
determined to win jobs with justice and a contract worthy of the
skills and productivity of our members.''
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said the CWA vote was not surprising and
expressed hope a strike could be averted.
   ``It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give the
leadership such authorization,'' spokesman Herb Linnen said. ``It
doesn't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hard
week, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic
that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work
stoppage.''
   The negotiations began in late March but have stalled over a
company proposal to shift more health care costs to employees. The
two sides also have significant differences on pay, according to
union officials.
   The company was expected to make its formal contract offer to
the unions early this week. The current contracts expire at 11:59
p.m. EDT Saturday.
   CWA officials have given mixed signals about whether a strike
would be called immediately if the deadline passed without a new
contract agreement. If the unions and company appear close to an
agreement the unions likely would extend the deadline by a day or
two.
   Even if the two sides remain substantially short of a new
contract, many union leaders believe the unions will not
immediately strike but instead will implement a plan for a
nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T long-distance service, a move they
say will cost the company upwards of $10 million a month.
   Under this scenario, union leaders say they would at first rely
on the boycott to pressure AT&amp;T into concessions and if no
significant progress was made they then could catch AT&amp;T off guard
with a strike.
   Indeed, a CWA statement today stressed that a strike ``is only
one of several tactics to achieve a fair contract.''
   The boycott plan calls for labor unions and related
organizations, which predominantly are AT&amp;T customers, to
temporarily switch their long distance calls to non-union US Sprint
by using Sprint's local access number. The unions and the AFL-CIO
also have pledged to urge their major vendors to boycott AT&amp;T.
   This year is the first time CWA and IBEW have negotiated
jointly. Three years ago CWA struck AT&amp;T for 26 days, but the
company was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants open
because the IBEW agreed to work provided its members were given any
added benefits CWA won through its strike.
   That bitter experience, which came in the first contract talks
after the AT&amp;T breakup, led to the agreement to negotiate jointly
this year. Bahr and Barry have promised that their unions will
stick together in the event of a strike.

   A man making his first sky dive died
after he jumped in the wrong position and his parachute failed to
open, an instructor says.
   Jack Reilly, 28, of Bellmore was fatally injured Saturday at
Spadero Airport. He and 18 others had just completed a sky-diving
class.
   Ray Maynard, president of Skydive of Long Island Inc., said
Reilly jumped out of a plane at about 3,000 feet. Jumpers are
attached to a ``static line'' that automatically pulls the chute
from its pack, he said.
   Reilly jumped in the wrong position, causing the parachute to
not fully open, then waited too long to pull his reserve chute,
which opened about 300 feet from the ground, Maynard said.
   Maynard said each student is given 5{ hours of lessons; 2{ hours
of classroom time and three hours practicing jumps from a mock
airplane.
   ``When the instructors feel that a student is not confident they
will not let him jump, but Reilly seemed confident and (we) felt he
was very good,'' Maynard said.
   He said his company has been at the airport for seven years and
that it was the first fatality.

<HEAD>Court Limits Federal Judges' Power to Exclude Evidence in Pennsylvania
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited federal
judges' power to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence from
civil trials, ruling against a young Pennsylvania man who lost his
arm in a car wash accident.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Paul Green's product-liability
lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the
sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about Green's
criminal record.
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said federal
rules of evidence require judges ``to permit impeachment of a civil
witness with evidence of prior felony convictions regardless of
ensuant unfair prejudice to the witness or the party offering the
testimony.''
   Federal judges may exclude evidence only when it is a criminal
defendant who might be harmed by it, Stevens said in interpreting a
particular rule of evidence.
   Green was 19 when he lost his arm in a June 23, 1984, accident
at the Lemoyne Minit Car Wash near Harrisburg, Pa. At the time,
Green was on work-release employment from the county prison.
   He had reached into a towel-drying machine that his suit alleged
was defective. The machine tore Green's right arm completely off at
the shoulder.
   He sued the drying machine's manufacturer, Bock Laundry Machine
Co.
   At trial, Bock's lawyers were allowed to tell jurors through
cross-examining Green that he had been convicted of several
felonies, including burglary and statutory rape.
   Green's lawsuit was tried in federal court because Bock is not
based in Pennsylvania, but in Toledo, Ohio.
   A jury ruled for Bock, and a federal appeals court upheld the
manufacturer's trial victory. The appeals court said the trial
judge had no discretion to exclude such evidence in a civil, or
non-criminal, trial.
   Today, the Supreme Court agreed. ``No error occurred when the
jury in this product-liability suit learned through impeaching
cross-examination that plantiff Green was a convicted felon,''
Stevens wrote.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   They said the federal rule of evidence in question should allow
trial judges ``to consider the risk of prejudice faced by any
party, not just a criminal defendant.''
   Writing for the three, Blackmun said: ``This case should have
been decided on the basis of whether the Bock Laundry Machine Co.
designed and sold a dangerously defective machine without providing
adequate warnings.
   ``The fact that Paul Green was a convicted felon ... has little,
if anything, to do with the issues. We cannot know precisely why
the jury refused to compensate him for the sad and excruciating
loss of his arm, but there is a very real possibility that it was
influenced improperly by his criminal record. I believe that this
is not a result Congress conceivably could have intended.''
   The case is Green vs. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 87-1816.

   Jury selection began today in the trial of
U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens on charges he had sex with an underage girl.
   The 58-year-old Republican had no comment as he entered the
courtroom. He has denied the allegation and claimed the girl's
mother tried to extort money from him.
   Lukens was indicted Feb. 23 on a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. Lukens,
who is divorced, was accused of having sex with the 16-year-old
girl in his Columbus apartment last year.
   By mid-morning, four potential jurors had been questioned about
their knowledge of the case and whether their opinion had been
swayed by publicity over the weekend about the trial and a plea
bargain offered by Lukens.
   A source said Lukens had offered last week to plead guilty if
references to sexual contact were removed.
   If convicted, Lukens could receive up to six months in jail and
a $1,000 fine.
   A Columbus TV station on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly recorded
videotape that showed Lukens apparently offering a government job
to the girl's mother after she asked him why he was ``messing
around'' with her daughter.
   Lukens told Anna Coffman he did not know her daughter was a
teen-ager, according to the tape, made by WSYX at a Columbus
fast-food restaurant.
   The four-term congressman has vowed to serve out his term, which
expires in 1990.
   Last week, a 35-year-old sexual molestation case allegedly
involving Lukens was reported by Detroit TV station WJBK. It
reported that Lukens, then a salesman, was arrested in Michigan in
1954 on suspicion he had molested a girl.
   The station, citing unidentified police sources, said the case
was dropped because the child's parents refused to press charges.
   Lukens said only that there was no case.

   This community deep in the rugged
Appalachian coal fields wants to use its bloody past to bring in
tourists.
   ``We can do the same kind of thing that Tombstone's (Ariz.)
done,'' said Mayor Johnny Fullen, whose town this weekend marked
the anniversary of a fatal 1920 shootout between miners' union
sympathizers and coal company guards.
   This town near where West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia meet
also was in the middle in the late 1800s when the Hatfields and the
McCoys began their feud.
   Tombstone is known for the gunfight at the OK Corral, won by
Marshal Wyatt Earp and his brothers.
   ``What happened here in history wasn't pretty,'' said Robert
McCoy, a former mayor and member of the Matewan Development
Center's board of directors. ``But it was important nationally.
Frankly, I'm perplexed as to why this part of history has been
neglected by the state.''
   On Friday, the town of 800 marked the massacre with a talk by
Lon Savage, author of ``Thunder in the Mountains,'' issued a
walking tour brochure and met with state, federal and community
officials to find ways to preserve the town's past.
   This summer, two historians from West Virginia University will
spend 10 weeks in Matewan taping 50 oral histories, and Marshall
University's Center for Regional Progress will conduct a survey of
the town's tourism potential.
   Local officials also are thinking of opening the town's first
motel.
   ``West Virginians should be proud of their history,'' the mayor
said.
   The body count for the 1920 shootout has not been definitively
settled, but estimates place the toll at two miners, seven
detectives and the mayor, all killed in a hail of gunfire along the
railroad tracks behind a hardware store.
   Nineteen people were indicted, none convicted. A key figure,
Police Chief Sid ``Two-Gun'' Hatfield, a descendant of clan leader
Anderson ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield, was gunned down outside the
courthouse where he was to stand trial.
   Until recently, ``everyone was sort of secretive'' about the
Matewan Massacre, which was the subject of the 1987 movie
``Matewan,'' Fullen said.
   ``I guess the people involved were still here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thailand Protests Burmese Military Incursion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand today summoned the Burmese
ambassador and protested a large-scale incursion by Burmese troops,
who crossed the border during an offensive against Karen rebels.
   Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops entered northern
Tak province Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai forces
fired artillery at the Burmese soldiers and killed at least six of
them, Thai officials said.
   The Burmese soldiers crossed the border 240 miles north of
Bangkok to attack the Kaw Moo Ra rebel camp along the Moei River.
   The director-general of the Foreign Ministry's political
department, Thep Devakul, lodged the protest with Burmese
Ambassador Nyunt Swe, according to government spokesman Suvit
Yodmanee. Suvit said Thailand demanded compensation for the
incursion, but relations with Rangoon remain ``fairly cordial.''
   ``We consider it serious as far as Burmese troops coming in and
violating the territorial integrity of Thailand, but it was a very
short period and they were actually trying to eliminate the Karen''
rebels, he said.
   In a telephone interview, Nyunt Swe said he told Thep he had no
details from his government about the incident. He said relations
between Bangkok and Rangoon ``are very good.''
   In the past, the Thais have given sanctuary to Karen rebels who
have long been trying to overthrow the Burmese government and who
maintain bases along the Burmese-Thai border. Burma's government
last year killed hundreds of people to crush a popular uprising for
democracy. After some of the student leaders of the uprising joined
the rebels, the government vowed to crush the insurgency.

   Jessica McClure gave a thumbs-up to a TV
movie about her 58-hour ordeal in a well, but the toddler's father
says he came off too scruffy.
   ``I should have played myself,'' Chip McClure said after
watching the ABC movie ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica
McClure'' on Sunday night.
   McClure said he knew he didn't always look his best during his
daughter's rescue in October 1987 from an abandoned backyard well
in which she had become wedged. ``But I didn't look that scruffy,''
he said of actor Will Oldham.
   ``I did a better job at the press conference in Hollywood. And
he could have shaved the sideburns and the beard and I would have
been a lot happier,'' McClure said.
   Roxanne Zal played his wife, Cissy, and Laura and Jennifer
Loesch played Jessica, now 3 years old.
   The subject of the film gave it a ``thumbs up,'' McClure told
the Dallas Morning News.
   ``She's real interested in it,'' he said. ``She knows it's her
they're talking about. I told her this was going to be a scary
movie and if she didn't like it, we could turn it off.
   ``But she's not scared at all,'' her father said. ``She says,
`That's you, mommy, and is that you, daddy?'''
   McClure said he was hopeful that 19 months of media attention
would end with the showing of the TV movie.
   Robert O'Donnell, one of two rescuers who pulled Jessica from
the hole, said the actor who played him, Whip Hubley, ``is a little
bit stockier than myself. He'd never have fit in the shaft.''
   Other residents portrayed in the movie were happier with it.
   ``It's kind of weird to see yourself on TV but how many times
does something like this happen to you? Now we can just sit back
and enjoy it,'' said police Sgt. Andy Glasscock, the first rescuer
on the scene.
   Glasscock watched the movie with other rescuers, their families
and friends. Some couldn't help shouting out advice to characters
in the movie.
   ``Cissy, look in the hole!'' one viewer shouted as Jessica's
movie mother looked around the yard for her missing daughter.

<HEAD>Panama Opposition Leaders Draw Cheers In Campaign-Style Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's three top opposition leaders
drew cheers from hundreds of workers as they toured a dozen
factories today, rallying supporters in defiance of a government
ban on demonstrations.
   ``We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one by
one,'' said Guillermo Ford, the candidate for second vice president
in the May 7 election.
   The opposition, which international observers say won the
election by a 3-1 margin, has been rallying support in this nation
of 2.5 million to gain recognition of its claimed victory.
   The Organization of American States last week approved a
resolution critical of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as head of
the Panamanian Defense Forces holds real power in Panama, and
called for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Noriega-controlled government nullified the elections. The
opposition has asked the OAS to help reverse that order, and the
organization is sending a delegation to Panama on Tuesday to
investigate.
   Ford; Guillermo Endara, the opposition presidential candidate;
and vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon were greeted
enthusiastically today at each stop in one of Panama's largest
industrial parks.
   Today was the third consecutive day the candidates rallied the
opposition without interference from the government despite its ban
on ``marches, meetings, public demonstrations or caravans of
vehicles.''
   The ban lasts until June 5, when the OAS delegation is due to
report back to the organization's headquarters in Washington.
   On Sunday, the candidates received raucous applause from 1,000
worshipers at a church 20 miles west of Panama City.
   On Saturday, the three made their first campaign-style
appearances since they were assaulted by Noriega's paramilitary
forces on May 10, touring a series of marketplaces in and near the
capital.
   That tour was the opposition's first attempt to rally against
Noriega since Wednesday, when a general strike fizzled.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and
Tobago, along with OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are due
in Panama on Tuesday to try to promote a resolution of the crisis.
   The candidates on Saturday met with U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.
   Murtha, leader of a team of U.S. observers appointed by
President Bush that declared the election fraudulent and Endara the
winner, was in town to visit U.S. troops and confer with officials.
   Murtha issued another in a series of U.S. and opposition signals
to the Panamanian Defense Forces that a coup against Noriega would
be welcome.
   Bush ``is not interested in punishing the PDF,'' Murtha said.
``He is interested in dealing with the PDF. The target of our
dismay is the leader of the PDF.''
   Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United
States in February 1988 but has withstood all efforts by Washington
to have him removed.
   He denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S. plot to
renege on its treaty to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of 1999.

<HEAD>Court Makes Some Lawsuit Deadlines More Flexible for Prisoners in
Michigan Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made deadlines for the
filing of civil rights lawsuits by some prison inmates more
flexible.
   The court unanimously ruled in a case from Michigan that states
may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal
suits.
   The justices reinstated a suit by Tyrone Victor Hardin, who said
his rights were violated when for six months in 1980 and 1981 he
was placed in solitary confinement at Southern Michigan State
Prison. Hardin said he became aware in July 1984 that prison rules
entitled him to an administrative hearing before he was placed in
solitary.
   Hardin, representing himself, filed a federal suit in 1986. But
the judge threw out the case on the ground that Michigan requires
such a suit be filed within three years of the alleged injury.
   The Supreme Court said today the judge also should have applied
a Michigan law which suspends the deadline for prisoners. The law
permits a suit to be filed within a year after the inmate is
released.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in his opinion for the high court,
said suspending the deadline for inmates may be intended to help
prisoneers ``loathe to bring suit against adversaries to whose
daily supervision and control they remain subject.''
   Stevens also said inmates, as long as they remain confined, may
have great difficulty proving allegations that their rights were
violated.
   A state's decision to suspend the deadline for filing suit in
such cases is consistent with federal civil rights law aimed at
protecting prisoners, he said.
   The case is Hardin vs. Straub, 87-7023.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to shield the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church from being sued by two
former members who say they were duped into joining it.
   The court also turned down an appeal by mass murderer John Wayne
Gacy, convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys
and young men.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that religious
freedom protects the church against allegations of ``brainwashing''
and fraudulent recruiting.
   David Molko and Tracy Leal told similar stories in court papers
of how they became ``Moonies'' in California and how
``deprogramming'' led them to quit.
   Molko was 27 when he graduated from Temple University law school
in 1978 and decided to visit San Francisco.
   Soon after arriving there in 1979, he was approached by two men
at a bus stop who told him they belonged to an international
community of socially conscious people.
   Molko went to dinner with them, and later joined a group that
went to a farm outside the city. He said that in the ensuing days
he and others at the retreat were kept to a tight schedule of
lectures, group discussions and calisthenics.
   He said he had no time to himself and, at least at the outset,
even was accompanied to the bathroom by a group member.
   Molko said he asked group members several times whether the
organization was a religious one and was told it was not. It was
not until the 12th day _ after the group arrived at another retreat
called ``Camp K'' _ that he was told the group was part of the
Unification Church, he said.
   Molko said he was confused and angry but decided to stay on when
members convinced him that deception had been necessary because of
the church's negative reputation.
   Ms. Leal was a 19-year-old college student when a recruiter
approached her at a San Francisco bus station in 1979.
   She said she was not told the group was part of the Unification
Church until her 22nd day at the retreat.
   Ms. Leal and Molko remained church members for several months
before they were abducted by ``deprogrammers'' who had been hired
by their parents.
   They are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional
distress they say they suffered. Molko also is seeking the return
of $6,000 he donated to the church.
   The California Supreme Court, voting 6-1 last October, overruled
two lower courts and reinstated the suits. It ordered jury trials.
   ``Molko and Leal ... contend that by the time the church
disclosed its true identity, the church's agents had rendered them
incapable of deciding not to join,'' the state court said. ``They
contend, in other words, that the church deceived them into a
setting in which they could be `brainwashed'.''
   The state court said the former members are entitled to their
day in court to prove their charges, even though no physical force
was involved in the alleged brainwashing.
   The state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to
defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right
to practice its religion freely.
   ``At most, it potentially closes one questionable avenue for
bringing new members into the church,'' the state court said.
   The National Council of Churches, other religious organizations
and a group consisting primarily of college professors urged the
justices to overrule the state court.
   They said the state court ruling ``has had, and will continue to
have, a serious chilling effect on religious proselytizing and
conversion in California and elsewhere.''
   In the Gacy case, the justices rejected arguments that Illinois'
death penalty law wrongly gives county prosecutors ``complete and
unguided discretion to determine whether to seek the death penalty
in murder cases.''
   Gacy's appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial
because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert
psychiatric witness for the defense.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Limited federal judges' power to exclude potentially
prejudicial evidence from civil trials, ruling against a young
Pennsylvania man who lost his arm in a car wash accident.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Paul Green's product-liability
lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the
sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about Green's
criminal record.
   _ Agreed to study a federal regulation aimed at saving the
government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some Social
Security recipients.
   The court said it will study a ruling in a Colorado case that
struck down the regulation.
   _ Refused to shield Chicago from being sued for monetary damages
in state court for allegedly allowing excessive noise and air
pollution at O'Hare International Airport.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that court
allow such lawsuits.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a former Chicago councilman convicted of
fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell tax-delinquent
properties.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case of
Thomas E. Keane to set guidelines on when some people may challenge
their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those
convictions.
   _ Ruled that a lawsuit stemming from the terrorist hijacking of
the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985 may be tried in a federal
court in New York City.
   Voting 9-0, the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners
aimed at transferring the suit to a court in Naples, Italy.
   _ Made deadlines for the filing of civil rights lawsuits by some
prison inmates more flexible.
   The court unanimously ruled in a case from Michigan that states
may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal
suits.
   The Unification Church case is Holy Spirit Association vs.
Molko, 88-1600.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that a lawsuit
stemming from the terrorist hijacking of the cruise ship Achille
Lauro in 1985 may be tried in a federal court in New York City.
   Voting 9-0, the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners
aimed at transferring the suit to a court in Naples, Italy.
   Palestine Liberation Organization terrorists seized control of
the ship in October 1985 while it was cruising in the Mediterranean
Sea.
   Leon Klinghoffer, 69, of New York, was killed by the hijackers
and thrown overboard. Klinghoffer, who was Jewish, had been
paralyzed on his right side by a stroke several years earlier and
was in a wheelchair.
   A number of American passengers, including Klinghoffer's wife,
Marilyn, sued Lauro Lines in federal court in New York City.
   Mrs. Klinghoffer died in 1986 and the couple's daughters, Ilsa
and Lisa, settled privately with Lauro Lines. But the claims by
others in the suit still are pending.
   The Italian ship-owning company said American courts lack
authority over the suit because of a provision on the passenger
tickets that said any such claims must be filed in an Italian court.
   A federal judge in New York City said the lengthy and intricate
instructions on the ticket, in small print, did not give the
passengers reasonable notice they were barred from suing in this
country.
   The Supreme Court today said, whatever the merits of that issue,
the lawsuit first must go to trial in the United States.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said if Lauro
Lines loses the suit it will have an opportunity then to appeal on
grounds that American courts lacked jurisdiction.
   Lauro Lines does not have the right now to appeal on that issue,
Brennan said.
   The case is Lauro Lines vs. Chasser, 88-23.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Edward
Perkins, ending his tour of duty in South Africa today, said he
remains encouraged by the determination of the black majority to be
free despite goverment suppression.
   ``I think that probably is the most encouraging because it tells
me that it's pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be
free,'' Perkins told an airport news conference as he concluded 2{
years as the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
   Perkins, 60, said the most disappointing events of his tenure
were the continuation of the government's state of emergency to
control anti-apartheid protests, the banning of 17 activist groups
and the large numbers of people who are arrested and held without
charge under the government's emergency powers.
   Perkins was a strong critic of such developments during his
tenure. Although the embassy repeatedly condemned restrictions on
the press, Perkins gave no on-the-record interviews during his
tenure until last week, when he talked to two South African
newspapers.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.
   Perkins said, ``South Africa is moving through a transition to a
different kind of country, to one where the majority population
will have a decisive say in how they are governed, to a South
Africa in which the majority will participate in and benefit from
the wealth of its economy.''
   Perkins has been appointed director-general of the Foreign
Service, which is subject to Senate confirmation.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Allow San Diego Woman Joint Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to allow a San
Diego woman whose family died in a 1983 airplane crash to sue the
federal government, her city and a utility company in one federal
lawsuit.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Barbara Finley must sue San
Diego and the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. in a separate state
court case.
   At issue was whether federal courts have the power to include as
defendants in Federal Tort Claims Act suits against the government
those whose alleged wrongdoing raise no constitutional or federal
law issue. The court's majority said no.
   Mrs. Finley's husband and two daughters were returning home to
San Diego in a private plane on Nov. 11, 1983.
   On his first approach to Montgomery Field near San Diego, the
pilot was unable to land because the approach and runway lights
were not visible, and he was not authorized to attempt an
instrument landing.
   On the second approach, the plane struck electric transmission
lines owned and maintained by San Diego Gas and Electric. No one
survived the resulting crash.
   Mrs. Finley first sued San Diego and the utility in state court.
She contended that the city negligently had failed to maintain the
runway approach lights and that the utility negligently had placed
its lines too close to the runway and failed to provide warning
beacons for them.
   When she later discovered that the Federal Aviation
Administration was responsible for the runway lights, Mrs. Finley
sued the government in federal court under the FTCA.
   She then asked a federal trial judge to add San Diego and the
utility company as defendants in the federal case.
   The trial judge granted the request, citing ``judicial economy
and efficiency.''
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year reversed the
trial judge, ruling that the city and utility could not be included
as defendants in the federal case.
   Today, the Supreme Court said in an opinion by Justice Antonin
Scalia that the appeals court was right.
   But Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The decision apparently leaves Mrs. Finley free to pursue her
state court suit against the city and the utility while suing the
federal government in federal court.
   The case is Finely vs. U.S., 87-1973.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India demonstrated its ballistic missile
capability today by successfully test-firing its first
medium-range, surface-to-surface missile into the Bay of Bengal,
officials said.
   The missile was fired from the seaside launch site at Chandipur,
750 miles southeast of New Delhi, United News of India said.
   The 7.5-ton missile has a range capability of about 1,500 miles,
sufficient to hit targets as far away as Iran, Hong Kong, China and
islands near the equator to the south, western military officials
said.
   It can also hit any target in neighboring Pakistan. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars in the past 42 years.
   Defense experts say the missile's one-ton payload capability is
more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead.
   The test firing was India's third attempt at launching the Agni
missile, whose name means ``fire'' in the ancient Sanskrit language.
   ``Agni is not a weapons system,'' Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
said in a statement issued after the launch. ``However, the
technologies proved in Agni are deeply significant for evolving
national security options.''
   He said the missile accurately followed the pre-determined
flight path and ``fully met the objectives we had set for it.''
Gandhi did not say how far the Agni traveled during its first
test-firing, and defense officials declined to comment on the
matter.
   The missile's first firing, scheduled for April 20, was
postponed by last-minute problems with the ignition system. A
second launch, set for May 1, was canceled after an error in one of
the rocket's sub-systems.
   By successfully firing the missile, India joined the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain in ballistic
missile capability.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk criticized
the test.
   ``On today's test we're very concerned,'' he said. ``And in the
past we've made our position very clear to the Indian government,
that further proliferation of ballistic missiles in South Asia
would be regarded as a highly destabilizing development in the
region.'' Popadiuk said he did not know if U.S. officials had
communicated with the Indians on this test.
   United News of India said 11,000 people living in 13 villages
near the launch site were evacuated from their homes Sunday evening
as a security measure. The villagers have protested the test-firing
for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if
more launches are held at Chandipur.
   Britain, India's colonia ruler, first used the site in 1893 to
test ammunition. The Indians turned it into a missile test range in
1986 because of an unusual feature _ it faced the Bay of Bengal and
during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles, enabling faster
and easier recovery of shells and other short-range projectiles.
   The bay also has light commercial and naval traffic.
   India has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for
peaceful purposes.
   Western military experts in New Delhi questioned the stance from
a military standpoint, however.
   ``You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a
conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``But if you are using a nuclear warhead, the exact target does
not matter,'' he said. ``I am not saying that the Indians are going
to use a nuclear warhead, but the question is why not?''
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and Western
nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic
weapon in one week.
   India says its nuclear program is intended for non-military
purposes, such as generating power. The test firing of the
intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, was only ``a
technology demonstration of the country's capabilities,'' according
to the government.
   India previously test-fired three surface-to-surface and
surface-to-air missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles.

   President Bush is encouraging demonstrators in
China to ``stand up for what you believe'' and urging the communist
authorities to exercise restraint, saying he hopes pro-democracy
protests do not result in bloodshed.
   Bush will discuss the China situation Tuesday in a meeting with
Wan Li, president of China's National People's Congress, who is
visiting Washington. Li was meeting today with Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   Bush, who once headed the U.S. liaison office in China, and Li
were scheduled to play tennis on Tuesday as well, but the
recreational interlude was canceled as ``inappropriate'' given the
current unrest in China, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said
today.
   He said Bush's national security advisers are keeping him
abreast of the situation.
   ``I would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible
in order to see more democratization and to see a peaceful
resolution of this matter,'' Bush said Sunday.
   ``We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom
of the press and clearly we support democracy,'' the president said
at a news conference in Boston with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The two leaders received honorary degrees and delivered
commencement remarks at Boston University. Afterward, Bush returned
to the White House and Mitterrand flew to Paris.
   Bush's comments came as pro-democracy students occupied
Tiananmen Square in Beijing in violation of martial law for a third
day. Despite repeated rumors of an imminent military crackdown, the
Chinese army had not moved to evict the protesters.
   Bush, who served as U.S. envoy to China in 1974-1975, said, ``I
think this perhaps is a time for caution because we aspire to see
the Chinese people have democracy.''
   He said he did not want to ``exhort in a way that is going to
stir up a military confrontation.'' Bush said it would not be
appropriate for the leader of the United States to tell the
demonstrators ``exactly what their course of action should be.''
   However, he said he hoped the students would follow a peaceful
course and ``continue to fight for what you believe in, stand up
for what you believe in _ but beyond that I cannot go.''
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and other U.S.
experts on Sunday endorsed the moderate course pursued by the Bush
administration.
   Emphasizing hopes for avoiding bloodshed, Bush said, ``We revere
the model of Martin Luther King in this country for his peaceful
protest and so I might suggest a familiarization with that for the
people in China.''
   King, an apostle of nonviolence, led the civil rights movement
in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. He was assassinated in
1968 in Memphis where he was lending support to a garbage workers'
strike.
   ``I don't want to be gratuitous in giving advice,'' Bush said,
``but I would encourage restraint. I do not want to see bloodshed.''
   He said it would be ``sound advice'' for students and workers to
adopt ``peaceful means of effecting change.''
   ``I think that the president is saying just about all that can
be said,'' Kissinger said on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with
David Brinkley.''
   ``We do not want to incite to riot, partly because the
consequences are unforeseeable in human terms, but also partly in
terms of hardheaded American foreign interest,'' said Kissinger,
stressing that anarchy in China would be bad for America.
   ``From a foreign policy point of view, we Americans ought to
consider that if China leaves the game for a while because of
domestic turmoil, it increases Soviet freedom of maneuver to a
remarkable extent,'' he said.
   Winston Lord, U.S. ambassador to Beijing in the Reagan
administration, said Bush administration officials were ``appealing
to the authorities for restraint, and ... they have made clear they
are on the side of the students and political reforms.'' He spoke
on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press.''
   During his news conference with Mitterand, Bush also expressed
optimism that a rift within NATO over short-range European missiles
could be bridged before next week's summit of alliance leaders.
   West Germany wants negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce
short-range nuclear weapons in the European theater, a step the
United States opposes.
   Bush said he has been working ``behind the scenes'' to reach a
consensus, and added, ``I think we could well have this resolved
before the summit.''

<HEAD>Secord Pleads Innocent to Charges of Concealing Iran-Contra Profits</HEAD>

   Richard Secord pleaded innocent today to
charges of concealing from Congress more than $1 million in profits
he allegedly pocketed by selling arms to Iran and the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys said at Secord's arraignment
before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson that they
will discuss whether to combine the latest set of charges with an
earlier indictment. A hearing on the question will be held May 31.
Secord was released on his own recognizance.
   The latest indictment, nine counts unsealed May 11 after the
conclusion of Oliver North's criminal trial, accuses Secord of
obstructing the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987,
perjury and making a false statement.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, said he might have to withdraw
from the case because ``I was privy to and was a party to
discussions with Congress'' in connection with Secord's 1987
congressional testimony. Therefore, Green might be called as a
witness at the trial, he said.
   Green said he would ``under those circumstances'' withdraw from
the case in favor of a partner in his law firm, James E. Sharp, who
stood next to Secord as he was arraigned. Prosecutor Reid
Weingarten said that ``usually the entire firm is dismissed'' as
the attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomes
a witness in the case. Weingarten said ``we must explore''
propriety of the firm of Sharp, Green &amp; Lankford representing
Secord.
   Secord pleaded innocent last year to six other criminal charges
in an indictment accusing him and three others of illegally
diverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Charged with the former Air Force major general in that 1988
indictment were business partner Albert Hakim, former national
security adviser John Poindexter and former National Security
Council aide North. Conspiracy and theft charges against North
relating to the diversion were dropped before his trial. The former
NSC aide was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges
in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   North enlisted Secord in 1984 to run weapons secretly to the
Contras during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel
force.
   Secord and Hakim carried out their work for North and the Reagan
administration through a network of offshore companies and Swiss
bank accounts dubbed the Enterprise.
   Secord is accused of lying when he told Congress that he wasn't
taking profits from the Enterprise. In fact, said the federal grand
jury indictment, Secord used a former Internal Revenue Service
lawyer ``on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars of
profits allocated to the defendant, Richard V. Secord.''
   He also was accused of lying when he told Congress that:
   _His only financial gain from the arms sales to the Contras and
Iran was his $6,000-a-month salary.
   _Half a million dollars from the Enterprise funneled to one of
his companies in Virginia was a loan.
   _He was unaware any money from the Enterprise benefited North,
who was convicted of illegally accepting a $13,800 home security
system from Secord. In addition, the government alleges, Secord and
Hakim arranged to set aside $200,000 as a death benefit for the
education of North's children.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Aquino comments today, adviser
saying government might consider Marcos burial. No Pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's response
to Ferdinand Marcos' latest health crisis belies her claims of a
stable government and shows the nervousness with which she still
views her ousted predecessor.
   Mrs. Aquino said today her government is not strong enough to
risk the return of Marcos and that even his funeral could cause
trouble.
   She refused on Friday to allow the ailing, 71-year-old deposed
president to return from Hawaiian exile and die in his homeland.
She also refused to allow him to be buried here.
   But her national security adviser and a senator closely
identified with the administration indicated today the government
might allow a Marcos burial if his followers guarantee there would
be no bid to undermine the government.
   Mrs. Aquino's caution is well-founded, considering Marcos
supporters led some of the six coup attempts wthat rocked her first
two years in power.
   But since a bloody August 1987 attempt, the government has
boasted continually of its stability, pointing to two years of
economic growth rates above 5 percent and numerous surveys showing
Mrs. Aquino's popularity.
   Government and military spokesmen claim communist rebels are
losing strength and Marcos' following has been reduced to a few
thousand fanatics.
   ``Marcos is no longer viewed by many Filipinos as a threat to
the Aquino government,'' wrote Aquino critic Ninez Cacho-Olivares
in the Filipino publication BusinessWorld. ``Few believe that he or
his wife is capable of making a political comeback.''
   Few challenge Mrs. Aquino's decision to prevent Marcos coming
back alive.
   But in a society that tends to forget its leaders' past
indiscretions, preventing a former president from being buried in
his homeland has struck many as short-sighted and vindictive.
   ``One would hate to think too that Mrs. Aquino would be so
stubbornly uncharitable as to turn down a dying man's last request
even if, as she probably believes, the man was the single biggest
cause of her widowhood,'' said the newspaper Malaya, which strongly
opposed Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain at Manila
airport in 1983 moments after returning from the United States to
challenge Marcos.
   After a Cabinet meeting to discuss the affair today, Mrs. Aquino
told reporters she feared Marcos' followers would exploit the death
of the man who ruled longer than any Philippine president much as
her own supporters used her husband's murder for political gain.
   ``Let's say a person has been ill for 20 years and now, after
three years, he is slowly recovering,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Just
because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to
expose him to infection.''
   Commentator Luis Beltran wrote in The Manila Standard: ``It is a
no-win situation for President Aquino and her government. If she
keeps to her frequent statements that her government is stable and
beyond the reach of coups d'etat, she has no choice but to allow
Marcos and his family to come home.''
   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto told reporters today
there was a chance the government might reconsider a Marcos burial.
   ``I don't think that issue of forever refusing him is valid,''
Ileto said. ``It could change.''
   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel said the government might allow a burial
in Marcos' Ilocos Norte home province if the family pledged ``that
they will not use his remains as political capital, like parading
him around Manila.''
   Marcos evokes deep and often contradictory emotions in an Asian
society that respects authority but harbors bitter memories of
eight years of martial rule.
   On Friday, amid reports Marcos might die at any time, news
organizations were flooded with calls from bankers, officials and
ordinary Filipinos asking if he was dead.
   Government officials have said privately the administration
could face the specter of counter-demonstrations by both
anti-Marcos leftists and pro-Marcos rightists if his body were
returned.
   That would encourage opposition from the left and right and
discourage foreign investors.
   Already, questions have been raised about the stability of the
Aquino administration in the wake of the April 21 assassination
here of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe by communist rebels.
   As a sign of uncertainty, share prices dropped 18 points Friday
because of the rumor Marcos already had died. Business sources said
banks were quietly buying up dollars for fear Marcos' death would
trigger unrest and depress the Philippine peso.
   Selling stocks and buying dollars was a ``normal response'' to a
looming political crisis, one analyst said on condition of
anonymity.

   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., left Walter Reed
Army Hospital briefly on Sunday and was driven to the National
Institutes of Health in nearby Bethesda, Md., to visit a building
named after him, a spokesman said today.
   Rochelle Jones, the congressman's press secretary, said Pepper,
88, remains in ``very serious but stable condition'' at the
hospital with an undisclosed stomach ailment.
   Ms. Jones said the building was dedicated in his honor on May
10, but Pepper was too ill to attend at the time.
   She said Pepper was accompanied by a nurse on the automobile
trip to NIH. Some members of his family were also along, she said.
   Ms. Jones said she did not know how long Pepper stayed but ``it
wasn't a long period of time.'' She described the visit as
impromptu.

<HEAD>Florida's High Court Refuses to Enforce Abortion-Consent Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's Supreme Court today said
minors are free to get abortions without an adult's consent, at
least until next month.
   That is when the court will hear arguments challenging the
constitutionality of a 1988 Florida law requiring single girls
under 18 to get permission from parents, a guardian or judge before
getting abortions.
   The case involving a 15-year-old girl had gone all the way to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to order enforcement of the
law last week.
   The law had previously been struck down as unconstitutional by a
state appeals court. The state Attorney General's office had asked
the state Supreme Court to allow the law to be enforced until the
justices take up the matter.
   But today the Supreme Court refused, without comment. However,
the court agreed to speed up a hearing on the law, from September
to June 27.
   With today's ruling, ``it is our opinion that the law is
unenforceable statewide,'' said Assistant Deputy Attorney General
Mitch Franks.
   The U.S. Supreme Court had refused without comment Thursday to
reinstate Florida's abortion consent law.
   Some experts said at the time that the justices had cleared the
way for all Florida minors to get abortions without permission, but
the attorney general's office said that the ruling might apply to
only one of Florida's five appellate districts.
   After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the girl's attorney, Jerri
Blair, refused to say whether her client, who was 12 weeks pregnant
and is identified only as T.W., had obtained an abortion.

   The only known manuscript copy of Clifford
Irving's phony Howard Hughes autobiography sold at auction for
$5,000.
   The manuscript was sold Sunday along with other Hughes
memorabilia, including an album containing several unpublished
photographs of the reclusive billionaire on his record-setting,
round-the-world airplane flight.
   The buyer of the manuscript would not give his name.
   Irving in the early 1970s duped a publisher out of $650,000 by
claiming he had compiled an autobiography of Hughes based on 100
secret meetings.
   The meetings never took place, and Irving served 17 months in
jail for the fraud. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine as
Con Man of the Year.
   The 989-page manuscript includes the forged signature of Hughes
and other notations, once authenticated by leading handwriting
experts.
   A New York court had ordered all copies of the manuscript
destroyed except Irving's, the one purchased Sunday. Irving asked
Ray Simpson, owner of Simpson's Antiques, to auction the document.
   A London collector bid $6,500 for the album ``A Picture and Word
Story of Houston's Celebration in Honor of Howard Hughes,'' dated
July 30, 1938.
   In all, 26 Hughes-related items sold for $17,000, Simpson said.

   The environmental movement in the United States is booming as a
steady tide of bad news about the environment, culminating with the
Alaska oil spill, has brought a surge of support to the nation's
leading conservation groups.
   In the past year, officials of these groups say, contributions
to the National Audubon Society rose 50 percent, the rate of
membership growth at the Wilderness Society doubled and the
National Wildlife Federation added 700,000 new members.
   ``We're in the ironic situation where possibly the nation's
greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing this increased
interest in environmental organizations,'' Audubon spokesman Robert
SanGeorge said. ``It's a paradox.''
   Although the March 24 oil spill is the most dramatic of the
recent events fueling the movement's growth, it is not the only
one. Environmentalists also cite last summer's East Coast beach
pollution and reports suggesting that air pollution is changing the
Earth's climate.
   The oil spill, said Fred Krupp, executive director of the
Environmental Defense Fund, ``has been an important event in a
series of important events that have heightened public interest.''
   Although the environmentalists insist they aren't gloating over
Exxon's misfortune, they also can't hide a sense of vindication.
   ``This spill has just really presented an opportunity,'' said
Lee Keller Reis, a spokeswoman for the National Wildlife
Federation. ``You hate to say, `We told you so,' but it's a way to
make a point.''
   It is also a way to raise money. Several groups were quick to
take advantage of the spill by sending out direct mail appeals for
contributions.
   The National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest
environmental group with more than 5.8 million members, established
an Alaska Fund immediately after the disaster and asked members for
contributions.
   So far, $400,000 has been collected, Ms. Reis said. She said the
fund will pay for research on the effects of the spill and for
lobbying against oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, among other things.
   A mailing sent out by the Defenders of Wildlife was that
organization's most successful ever, according to Carol Waite, the
group's development director.
   Defenders of Wildlife, which has 80,000 members, got $200,000 in
response to the plea, Ms. Waite said. One woman sent in an
unsolicited donation of about $1,000 in Exxon stock.
   ``I think that was just indicative of how angry people are over
this devastation,'' Ms. Waite said.
   Another group, the 285,000-member Wilderness Society, hasn't
sent out an appeal for contributions related to the oil spill but
has received about $50,000 in unsolicited funds, according to
Rebecca Wodder, vice president for membership and development.
   Other groups, such as the National Audubon Society, said it was
too early to assess the impact of the oil spill on membership or
contributions. Audubon hasn't yet gauged the response to a plea for
funds that it recently sent to 320,000 households around the
nation, SanGeorge said.
   Greenpeace estimates that it has been adding members at a rate
of 50,000 a month since autumn and now has 1.35 million members.
The Environmental Defense Fund's membership has more than doubled
in the last 18 months, and now stands at more than 100,000,
according to Krupp.
   But Krupp and some of his colleagues are wary of the apparent
change in public attitude.
   ``The fundamental lesson of environmental politics is that the
public's interest in gains doesn't always translate into workable
solutions,'' Krupp said.
   For instance, he said, last summer's beach pollution with sewage
and medical waste prompted legislation that stiffened penalties for
polluters, but did little to reduce the sources of pollution.
   ``The spotlight is now focused on environmental organizations,''
Krupp said. ``It's both a great opportunity and also a challenge.
As environmentalists, we need to make sure that this support
translates into real gains and not just proclamations.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Americans Favor Broad Measures To Curb Pollution</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vast majority of Americans would accept
mandatory trash recycling, higher electric bills and other
inconveniences to help clean up the environment, a national poll
has found.
   Broad perceptions exist that pollution is on the rise. The Media
General and Associated Press survey also found backing for
initiatives ranging from a ban on household aerosol products to
strict emission controls at power plants.
   Three-quarters of the 1,084 respondents said laws against
pollution in the United States are too weak, and about as many
faulted efforts by government, businesses and average Americans to
keep the environment clean.
   Environmental concerns were heightened by the 10 million gallon
Exxon Valdez oil spill in March in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
But the poll, conducted by telephone from May 5-13, found concern
and support for action beyond oil tanker safety. Among other steps:
   _ Majorities favored urgent government action, no matter what
the cost, to clean up toxic waste and protect drinking water.
   _ Eighty-one percent said new safety rules and emergency cleanup
teams should be in place at all major oil facilities, even if the
expense would raise the price of oil and gasoline.
   _ Seventy-two percent favored strict smokestack controls at
oil-and coal-burning power plants, even if that would hike the
price of electricity.
   Most respondents also supported restrictions on their own
behavior. Twenty percent said their communities now require them to
separate and recycle household trash; of the rest, 87 percent said
they would support such a requirement.
   Similarly, 75 percent said they would back a ban on household
aerosol products, whose propellants can pollute the air; 60 percent
supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid; and 58 percent favored a
ban on non-radial tires, which release more rubber into the air
than do radials.
   Bans on aerosol cans, lighter fluid and non-radial tires are
among the measures suggested for Southern California by a regional
air quality board in March. Other steps in that proposal won less
support nationally: Respondents were split on parking restrictions
in cities to discourage driving, and 59 percent opposed banning
gasoline-fueled garden appliances.
   Overall, 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased in
the past decade. Nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the
beach last year because of beach pollution.
   Concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political
lines. Residents of the nation's most densely populated areas were
the most apt to see anti-pollution efforts as inadequate and to
favor new steps.
   Respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around.
Forty-two percent said businesses are doing a poor job of keeping
the environment clean and 36 percent said ``only fair,'' for a
negative rating of 78 percent.
   Similarly, 83 percent rated the federal government's
environmental record as fair or poor, as opposed to good or
excellent; 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and
local governments' environmental records; and 79 percent said most
Americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the
environment clean.
   The highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal, in
which 63 percent supported urgent government action regardless of
the expense. Next was the related issue of pollution of the
nation's drinking water, with 52 percent favoring urgent action,
cost aside.
   For those and other environmental problems, the poll gave the
choices of ``urgent government action no matter what the cost,
prompt government action, limited government action or no
government action.'' Urgent or prompt action were favored
overwhelmingly, by 72 percent or more in every instance.
   Responses were split on one current issue, whether the federal
government should issue new offshore oil drilling permits.
Forty-five percent opposed new drilling off the coasts of
California and Florida, while about 35 percent favored new drilling
there and 20 percent were unsure.
   Opposition was greater to oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Sixty percent were opposed and only
about a quarter were in favor, with the rest unsure.
   The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points,
was conducted by the AP and Media General Inc., a communications
company based in Richmond, Va., that publishes the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune
and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV stations WXFL
in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in Jacksonville, Fla.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 miners from Belgium's last
two coal pits demonstrated Monday against plans to close the mines
ahead of schedule.
   The peaceful march contrasted sharply with last month's
demonstration in the northeastern mining region of Limburg, when
police had to fire shots in the air to keep the miners at bay.
Twenty-eight police were injured.
   The management of the coal mines wants the pits closed before
the scheduled date of 1996, arguing that government subsidies to
keep them open can be better used to create reconversion industries.
   The regional government of Flanders is to discuss the issue
Friday.
   Miners want to keep production going as long as possible. An
early closure also would endanger their benefits.
   Two years ago, management closed three mines and cut the
workforce of 18,000 in half.

   Mysterious poisonings at a diaper manufacturer
have left one worker dead and sickened 19 others, a police
spokesman said Monday.
   The police were investigating all possible causes of the
poisonings Sunday at the Hugla paper factory in Afula, in northern
Israel, including the possibility they were the result of sabotage
by Arab extremists, said Northern District Police spokesman Maj.
Gideon Arbel.
   Police were checking the water and food served at the factory,
he said.
   Dr. Ehud Kantros, deputy director of the Afula Valley Hospital,
said the workers were admitted complaining of severe stomach
cramps, nausea, headaches and loss of equilibrium about two hours
after eating lunch.
   A 21-year-old woman died Sunday and 18 others were treated and
released, he said. A 19-year-old remained hospitalized Monday in
intensive care, where he had not yet regained conciousness, Kantros
said.
   Israel radio said the factory kitchen was ordered closed. The
radio quoted an unidentified Hugla spokesman as saying the factory,
which employs 240 workers, did not use poisonous substances in its
manufacturing process or keep poisons on the premises.

   A passenger ship sank off the tourist
island of Bali, killing at least 30 people and leaving 128 others
missing and feared dead, an official said Monday.
   The missing were believed to be trapped in the ship, the Dharma
Mulia, which capsized Sunday when it was struck by huge waves,
according to Wardojo, a Search and Rescue Agency official.
   ``Hopes are very slim that any of them are still alive,'' he
said.
   The ship was carrying 325 people, mostly workers on their way
from Lombok to Malaysia, he said. It went down off the town of
Benoa in southern Bali.
   Rescue workers recovered four bodies and brought 167 passengers
to safety Sunday night.
   Wardojo said by telephone from Bali's capital of Denpasar that
rescuers recovered another 26 bodies Monday.
   Bali is about 750 miles southeast of Jakarta.

   Doctors in the Angolan capital of Luanda
are reporting more than 100 new cases of cholera daily in an
epidemic that has claimed dozens of lives, a newspaper reported
Monday.
   Angolan health officials have not released a death toll for the
epidemic but foreign doctors in Luanda are reporting between 100
and 150 new cases every day, according to the state-owned
Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias.
   The paper said dozens have died in the past two weeks from the
disease, an acute intestinal infection.
   Angolan health authorities have launched a media campaign
advising Luanda's 1.2 million people to boil water before drinking,
wash their hands before preparing food and avoid eating seafood,
raw fruit and vegetables, the paper said.
   Officials said the cholera that often surges in May's hot and
humid rainy season was spreading rapidly due to poor water
supplies, drainage and general pollution in the city.

   America's Junior Miss pageant is changing
its name to the America's Young Woman of the Year program.
   ``America's Young Woman of the Year is more contemporary and
meaningful to today's lifestyle,'' executive vice president R.C.
``Buddy'' Lauten said today.
   He said the change was made in response to complaints that
beauty pageants are outdated and exploit women, and he said it will
help contestants ``better serve as role models for the people about
them.''
   In July the 50-state Junior Miss winners of 1989 will compete
for the first America's Young Woman of the Year title in Mobile.
Kristen Logan, who just completed her freshman year at Baylor
University, will be the last America's Junior Miss.
   The pageant, which has attracted 800,000 high school seniors in
its 32-year history, was known as Junior Miss America in 1958 and
changed to America's Junior Miss the following year to avoid
conflict with the Miss America Pageant.

   Cruising for democracy has come to China.
   The one-month old movement for more personal freedom and clean
government has involved hundreds of thousands of students, workers
and journalists. Now they've been joined by bikers.
   A pack of motorcycle riders has been roaring up and down central
Beijing's main streets the past week in support of students fasting
in central Tiananmen Square for democracy.
   The Beijing branch of the ``Wild Bunch'' kicked into gear with
about 75 motorcyclists and grew to nearly 400 by Saturday, when
students in the square were expecting the army would try to force
them out.
   Many of the people who brought gauze and surgical masks Saturday
night as a precaution against tear gas wound up covering up for
protection from the plumes of exhaust from the cycles.
   Several cyclists rode with their fashionably dressed girlfriends
perched on the back. They waved Chinese national flags and banners
with anti-corruption slogans as they sped by. At least one swilled
beer as he careened around the square.
   The cyclists seemed to have the most fun late at night, roaring
down the avenue in front of Zhongnanhai, the compound where the
country's leaders work and live, honking horns and revving motors
to make sure their presence was known.

   Students protesting for democracy have shown a fondness for
bureaucracy and the trappings of power, two things they supposedly
are fighting.
   For much of the past week, one could barely walk through the
student-occupied Tiananmen Square for more than a minute without
being told the territory that lay ahead was out of bounds.
   ``You can't go in there,'' was a familiar refrain from countless
students armed with nothing more than an air of self-importance.
   Student leaders issued passes to some reporters that supposedly
allowed access around the square. But even they were met with the
response: ``I'm sorry, but those passes are temporarily
ineffective.''
   Meanwhile, other students waved flags, blew whistles, displayed
impressive hand signals and constantly barked orders in trying to
direct the chaotic traffic in central Beijing created by the
Tiananmen protest. Despite their best efforts, however, traffic
remained impossible.

   Soldiers deployed in the outskirts have spent much of the past
few days meeting the citizens of Beijing, who have swarmed around
the military convoys to prevent them from taking action against
protesting students.
   The people and the military generally appear to get along.
   The people have offered the soldiers popsicles and squash to
eat, newspapers to read and lectures on democracy to mull over.
   The troops, in return, have chatted with the masses and
entertained them with an occassional song.
   One revolutionary blast from the past sung by troops to hearty
applause was ``Learn from Comrade Lei Feng.'' The song is a tribute
to a perhaps mythical soldier offered for emulation years ago as a
keen student of Mao Tse-tung's works. Comrade Lei, so the story
goes, died when he was beaned by a falling telephone pole.

   After 21 years of entering frogs in
the annual Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee, Tom
Beatty won with a leaper whose name is rich in literary meaning _
Heavy Metal.
   The heavy favorite in Mark Twain's tall tale about jumping frogs
lost because it had been loaded with buckshot.
   Heavy Metal, the last of 76 entrants in the 61st annual contest
Sunday, jumped 19 feet 9} inches to win the prize as a crowd of
7,000 cheered, said fair spokeswoman Jewel Lucken.
   This former gold rush town hosts the jubilee to honor Twain's
1865 short story ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County.'' In the story, gamblers loaded up the ace jumper so
heavily the frog couldn't get off the ground.
   On Sunday, each frog got three jumps from the center of a
circle, and the distances were totaled. Handlers were allowed to
scream, dance or do anything but touch their frogs to get them to
jump.
   Beatty traveled from Bend, Ore., to enter his jumper. Gary
Johnson of Angels Camp didn't have to go far to enter Moon Shine,
which placed second at 19 feet, 4 inches.

<HEAD>Shanghai Party Leader Says Firing Editor Was Rash</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leader of Shanghai has
acknowledged he was too rash in firing a popular, daring newspaper
editor whose dismissal angered journalists nationwide.
   The China Women's News said Jiang Zemin ``welcomed everyone's
criticism,'' but also denied reports that he was criticized by the
national party's Central Committee.
   Jiang did not say if he was willing to reinstate Qin Benli,
editor in chief of the weekly World Economic Herald.
   China Women's News carried Jiang's comments in its Friday
edition, which was not delivered until Monday.
   Mass protests in Beijing against the government's hard-line
attitude toward student demonstrators have disrupted delivery of
mail and newspapers. Some newspapers also have missed editions
since Premier Li Peng declared martial law Saturday.
   Shanghai authorities fired Qin after he refused to alter the
paper's April 24 edition and accused him of repeated ``violations
of discipline.''
   The edition contained calls for a reassessment of party chief Hu
Yaobang, whose death April 15 triggered student protests that led
to the mass marches. Hu was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack
down on earlier student protests.
   After dismissing Qin, Shanghai authorities set up a special
committee to ``rectify'' and supervise the paper. However, its
lower-level editors and reporters have continued to express
defiance and try to publish controversial articles, and officials
have halted and revised two editions since.
   Qin's dismissal prompted journalists in Beijing and Shanghai to
join the student protests. More than 1,000 Beijing reporters signed
a petition demanding a dialogue on censorship, and thousands
marched last week in Beijing and Shanghai.
   It is the first time journalists for the tightly controlled
official media, many of whom are party members, have rebelled
openly and in such large numbers.
   They said they were embarrassed that many Chinese had to get
news on events in their own country from foreign short-wave radio
broadcasts such as the Voice of America and the BBC.
   Li Datong, an editor at the China Youth News who organized the
Beijing reporters' petition, said he thought it was possible Qin
could be reinstated if enough people kept pressuring Shanghai
officials.
   Chinese sources said last week that Jiang offered to reinstate
Qin if he wrote a self-criticism of his actions and the Herald
agreed not to attack Jiang or the Shanghai city government. The
paper refused.

<HEAD>Expulsion of Workers May Cause Problems for Families, Employers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's decision to expel thousands of
Palestinian workers could cause financial hardship for their
families in the occupied lands and harm the businesses that
employed them.
   About 50,000 workers from the Gaza Strip were ordered home last
week. Many hold low-paying jobs in construction, textiles,
restaurants, street cleaning and garbage collection.
   Israeli officials say workers from Gaza will be allowed to
return only with special permits and the system probably will be
applied later to the 60,000 workers from the West Bank.
   Government officials said the purpose was to punish Palestinians
for the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
   Criiticism came from within the government and from liberal
legislators.
   Shimon Peres, finance minister and deputy prime minister, told
Israel radio expelling workers would cause economic problems for
Palestinians that would inflame the uprising.
   ``We are pushing them into a corner from which there will be
more bitterness and resistance,'' he said.
   Worried businessmen say their industries will suffer unless
replacements are found quickly and have appealed for permission to
hire workers abroad.
   Palestinians expressed concern that delays in issuing the new
permits might cost them their jobs. Fawaz Abu Sitteh, an economist
from Gaza City, described the action as ``the ugliest means of
collective punishment.''
   Annual per capita income in Gaza is equivalent to less than $750
and people have little in savings, he said.
   ``They depend on daily work,'' the economist said. ``They cannot
finance themselves if they don't work.''
   The 110,000 Palestinians who work in Israel are breadwinners for
many of the 1.7 million who live in the territories, bringing home
an estimated $700 million a year. They will find few jobs at home
because little industrial development has taken place during 22
years of Israeli occupation.
   A study in 1988 by the West Bank Data Base Project accused
Israel of ``a deliberate and consistent policy aimed at keeping the
territories as a dumping ground for Israeli industrial products and
as a pool of cheap labor.''
   Those who run industries dependent on unskilled Palestinian
workers say they will have trouble finding replacements because
Israelis do not want the jobs.
   Dov Pollak, managing director of Polgat Textiles, said his
company had employed about 130 Gazans and was hard-pressed to find
substitutes.
   Aharon Sapir, director of the construction industry's
Contractors Association, described the loss of Arab workers as
``catastrophic'' and said ``the immediate solution is to bring
foreign workers'' to replace them.
   So far, the government has opposed importing workers because
112,000 Israelis are unemployed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin made clear the new policies are
intended to punish the Palestinians.
   ``We started two or three months ago to look for measures that
will make it clear to the Palestinians in Gaza, later on in the
West Bank, that the right to leave the territories is a
privilege,'' he said in an interview.
   Rabin said there must be ``a certain balance between their
freedom to work in Israel and their participation in violence and
terror.'' He has the support of many Israelis angered by the
government's inability to crush the uprising.
   One place feelings are especially strong is Ashkelon, a coastal
city north of Gaza. The body of a soldier the government said was
killed by Palestinians was found near Ashkelon. A missing soldier
believed kidnapped by Palestinians, is from the city.
   ``We shouldn't let them work here anymore. Thy kill our
children,'' said Shmuel Attias, 57, who has overseen Palestinian
sanitation crews in Ashkelon for two decades.
   Yossi Sarid, a parliament member from the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement, described the government action as ``stupid,
unjust, ineffective and immoral.''
   He accused Rabin of playing into the hands of radical Israelis
who want to expel all Palestinians.
   ``By sending back the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in a way
which reminds me of South African methods, I believe he gives
legitimacy to all the transferists everywhere,'' Sarid said.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews May 5-13 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

<HEAD>Pravda Accuses Baltic Fronts of Going Overboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Popular movements in the Baltic republics are
going too far in demanding greater independence and backing
programs that amount to complete secession from the Soviet Union,
the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday.
   Grassroots groups in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are issuing
demands that are extremist and even nationalist, the newspaper said.
   Referring to resolutions passed at a mid-May assembly of Baltic
popular movements in Estonia, Pravda said: ``In total, although no
one talks about this directly, they make sense only if their
authors have in mind the complete secession of the three republics
from the Soviet Union.''
   The Baltic assembly stopped short of endorsing secession, but
many members of the Estonian and Latvian People's Fronts and the
Lithuanian movement Sajudis openly espouse complete secession.
   The Pravda article came three days before the opening of a new
national parliament at which at least one Baltic delegation, the
Lithuanians, have threatened to walk out if their desires are
ignored.
   ``We think Uzbeks or Russians don't understand our problems,''
said Alfredas Smailys, a Lithuanian delegate to the new Congress of
People's Deputies from Kaunas. ``We demand the right of veto. If,
however, our protest is not taken into account, we're prepared to
leave the hall.''
   A deputy from Estonia, Ulo Vooglaid, would not specify what
tactics the Estonians will use, but he said the delegation ``will
not retreat'' from the platform worked out at the Baltic assembly.
   Baltic nationalists issued a call May 14 for ``economic
independence'' from Moscow by next year. Sixty-one deputies who
belong to the popular movements also hammered out a joint platform
asserting the right of the country's 15 republics to set their own
policies.
   Last week, the Baltic popular movements saw some of their
economic proposals approved by the Estonian and Lithuanian
parliaments.
   They passed measures taking virtually all control over local
industry away from Moscow as of 1990. Lithuania's economic law
includes provision for printing its own money, and Estonia's would
allow limited private property.
   Lithuania on Thurday also duplicated Estonia's ``declaration of
sovereignty'' and claimed veto power over Soviet laws on its
territory.
   Moscow proclaimed Estonia's sovereignty law was invalid last
fall, but Estonia still considers it in force and neither side has
forced a showdown.

   The movement for political change grew from a
tiny student poster campaign to a mass call for the removal of top
Chinese leaders in five weeks of unprecedented high drama.
   China's leadership could hardly have seen the trouble awaiting
them when former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a relatively
liberal leader who was ousted in a crackdown on a previous round of
student demonstrations, died of a heart attack April 15.
   Within hours of Hu's death, posters sprang up at Beijing
University praising him and indirectly criticing the leaders who
forced him to resign two years earlier. The students held several
demonstrations during the following week to press demands for
democratic reform, a free press and clean government.
   Events surrounding Hu's April 22 funeral set the tone for the
following month of protest, with students fearlessly defying
security forces.
   Up to 100,000 people gathered in central Beijing's Tiananmen
Square April 21 to mourn Hu and stayed overnight, refusing to
follow police orders to disperse.
   Top officials going to a memorial for Hu the following day at
the adjacent Great Hall of the People peered across a protective
wall of thousands of soldiers to view fist-waving citizens
demanding an end to what they called China's dictatorship.
   The broad support the student movement was winning from workers
and others became obvious a week later, when tens of thousands of
people lined the streets of Beijing to cheer about 150,000 students
marching for democracy. Along the route, enthusiastic onlookers
gave the marchers money, food and water.
   Enthusiastic crowds again appeared the following week, when
students marched to mark the 70th anniversary of China's first
student movement for democracy. But the campaign seemed to falter
after the march ended, as leaders argued over what tactics to take
to press their demands.
   While students at most colleges in the capital ended a two-week
class boycott, Beijing University students kept up the heat,
refusing to return to their classrooms and demanding more action.
   About 3,500 students, many from the nation's most prestigious
schools, decided to press their demands by staging a hunger strike
at Tiananmen beginning May 13, two days before the arrival of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China to normalize ties
after 30 years of icy relations.
   The government urged the students to end the strike before
Gorbachev's arrival so as not to spoil the nation's image. Students
hotly debated what to do in the pre-dawn hours of May 15 before
deciding to continue their fast, forcing several changes in the
Soviet leader's schedule that embarrassed the government.
   As the fasting students' health began to deteriorate, Beijing
residents grew increasingly miffed at the government's failure to
meet the hunger strikers' demands of dialogue with officials and a
retraction of an editorial that called the movement a
``disturbance.''
   In the largest protest of Communist China's 40-year history,
well over 1 million people poured into downtown Beijing on
Wednesday in support of the hunger strikers. Many called for the
resignation of Premier Li Peng, viewed as a conservative, and
senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Demonstrations were reported in at
least two dozen other Chinese cities.
   Another mass protest the next day was answered by Li with a
hard-line speech and the declaration of martial law in much of the
capital. Throngs of workers rushing to Tiananmen to protect the
students yelled, ``Li Peng, step down!'' and said his retirement
was the only way the demonstrations would end.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, a relative liberal
sympathetic with many grievances raised by demonstrators,
reportedly has offered to resign, although there has been no
official announcement.
   Li's future also seems uncertain, as he faces virtually
universal condemnation from the people of Beijing.
   Deng has not appeared publicly or been quoted by official media
since he met Gorbachev on May 16.

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
reviewed the military situation in the Middle East with Defense

weapons deals, defense officials said.
   The officials, who asked not to be named, said Rabin and Cheney
met privately and with other officials for more than an hour at the
Pentagon, with Rabin offering the newly installed Cheney a progress
report on the overall situation in the Middle East.
   Rabin and Cheney did not discuss ``in any detail'' Israel's
latest regional peace initiative, the sources said. Rabin and
President Bush are expected to delve more deeply into that issue
during White House talks on Tuesday.
   The Pentagon, in a prepared statement, described today's talks
as ``upbeat (and) friendly.''
   ``Most of the time was spent talking about the current status of
the military situation in Israel,'' the statement said. ``Mr. Rabin
identified the most significant recent development in the region as
the end of the Iran-Iraq war.''
   The defense sources said Rabin had declined to predict for
Cheney what the current cease-fire in that war would mean to Israel.
   ``Basically, Rabin said he didn't know what the cease-fire would
mean or whether it would hold,'' said one official. ``He told
Cheney the war had dominated the region for the past decade. He
also said despite the cease-fire, the arms race in the Middle East
goes on.''
   Iran and Iraq, after more than eight years of fighting, agreed
to a cease-fire last August.
   The Pentagon said in its statement that Rabin ``expressed the
hope that the United States will continue to support Israel.''
   ``Mr. Cheney indicated that we will do our best within the
constraints of the budget to continue our current level of support
to Israel.''
   The Israeli defense chief, however, ``did not get specific about
U.S. support and did not press for any new arms deals or discuss
specific weapons,'' added one source.
   ``This meet was very low key,'' the official said. ``Neither
side asked the other for anything.''
   The meeting ended with Rabin extending an invitation to Cheney
to visit Israel. The secretary accepted the invitation without
committing to a specific date, the sources said.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said today Rabin would meet
with Bush on Tuesday to discuss Middle East peace efforts and
Israel's controversial proposal for Palestinian elections.
   President Bush has said he supports the idea of elections as a
way to get the peace process underway.
   The plan calls for voting to chose Palestinian representatives
to negotiate self-rule for the 1.5 million residents of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations on a permanent solution would
start after three years.
   The PLO Executive Committee rejected the Israeli plan, and other
Palestinian critics say it fails to deal with Palestinian
aspirations for an independent state.

<HEAD>Court Limits Scope of `Discreditation' Decree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Supreme Court said Monday that citizens
may not be thrown in jail for expressing truthful criticism of
officials, limiting the scope of a new decree widely criticized by
reformers and dissidents alike.
   The court reviewed a decree passed by the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet on April 8 because citizens already have been
arrested under differing interpretations of the law, according to a
report distributed by the Tass news agency.
   Critics charged that a provision of the decree banning
discrediting officials and government bodies was written in such a
way that a person could be prosecuted for telling the unpleasant
truth.
   Alvydas Juozaidis, a spokesman for Lithuania's grassroots
Sajudis organization, called the decree ``pure Stalinism.'' Among
its other critics were human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Some opponents have called for the Congress of People's
Deputies, the new parliament that meets for the first time
Thursday, to overturn the law.
   The court said, ``Well-founded, argumentative criticism of the
action and decisions of these organs and officials by citizens,
acting publicly in the framework of socialist law, cannot be viewed
as a criminally punishable act.''
   The court's action, taken as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
seeks to strengthen the role of law in Soviet society, constituted
one of the rare times the court has acted to ensure a controversial
measure is applied consistently.
   The Supreme Court instructed lower courts the decree touched
only ``intentional public distribution of slanderous inventions''
that undermines faith in officials.
   It said that the decree did not include ``dispatches in the
press and any other form of information reflecting insufficiencies
in the activity of these organs, social organizations and
officials.''
   The court said its declaration was a balance between protecting
officials from insults and slander, and protecting the rights of
individuals to express their views.
   Tass did not say how many criminal cases have been filed on the
basis of the new law nor did it address any of them in detail.
   But it said that in the month and a half since the decree was
published, differences in interpretation already had come to light.
   Soviet officials have said that the new decree is more specific
and less subject to abuse than Articles 70 and 190 of the criminal
code that for years have banned ``anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda'' and ``anti-Soviet slander.''
   Politically controled courts used those laws for years to
imprison dissidents. Last year the Soviet Union said it intended to
radically alter those laws. It stopped arresting people under them,
and in the past two years has released hundreds of people arrested
under them.
   But dissidents and reformers alike reacted angrily to the
decree, claiming the provision against discrediting officials
actually was worse than the previous law.
   The law also bans public calls to overthrow the government, and
``premeditated'' acts aimed at inciting national or racial
animosity.
   In other action that also expressed its desire to right the
legal abuses of the past, Tass said the Supreme Court continued its
rehabiliation who were unlawfully convicted of anti-Soviet activity
in the 1930s through the 1960s.
   Those rehabiliated Monday included former midlevel officials who
were accused under Josef Stalin of being German spies or taking
part in a conspiracy to kill the popular Leningrad party chief
Sergei Kirov in 1934.
   A Latvian poet, K.E. Skueniek, who was convicted in 1962 of
anti-Soviet agitation, also was cleared.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   UNIFICATION CHURCH
   
   The court refused to shield the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church from being sued by two former members who say
they were duped into joining it.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that religious
freedom protects the church against allegations of ``brainwashing''
and fraudulent recruiting.
   The case is Holy Spirit Association vs. Molko, 88-1600.
   
   JOHN WAYNE GACY
   
   The court turned down an appeal by mass murderer John Wayne
Gacy, convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys
and young men.
   The justices rejected arguments that Illinois' death penalty law
wrongly gives county prosecutors ``complete and unguided discretion
to determine whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases.''
   Gacy's appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial
because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert
psychiatric witness for the defense.
   The case is Gacy vs. Illinois, 88-6828.
   
   EVIDENCE
   
   The court l Limited federal judges' power to exclude potentially
prejudicial evidence from civil trials, ruling against a young
Pennsylvania man who lost his arm in a car wash accident.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Paul Green's product-liability
lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the
sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about Green's
criminal record.
   The case is Green vs. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 87-1816.
   
   SOCIAL SECURITY
   
   The court agreed to study a federal regulation aimed at saving
the government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some
Social Security recipients.
   The court said it will study a ruling in a Colorado case that
struck down the regulation.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Everhart, 88-1323.
   
   AIRPORT NOISE
   
   The court refused to shield Chicago from being sued for monetary
damages in state court for allegedly allowing excessive noise and
air pollution at O'Hare International Airport.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the court
allow such lawsuits.
   The cases are Chicago vs. Beineman, 88-1496; Bieneman vs.
Chicago, 88-1497; and American Airlines vs. Chicago, 88-1670.
   
   FRAUD
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a former Chicago councilman
convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell
tax-delinquent properties.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case of
Thomas E. Keane to set guidelines on when some people may challenge
their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those
convictions.
   The case is Keane vs. U.S., 88-1178.
   
   ACHILLE LAURO
   
   The court ruled that a lawsuit stemming from the terrorist
hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985 may be tried in
a federal court in New York City.
   Voting 9-0, the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners
aimed at transferring the suit to a court in Naples, Italy.
   The case is Lauro Lines vs. Chasser, 88-23.
   
   PRISONER
   
   The court made deadlines for the filing of civil rights lawsuits
by some prison inmates more flexible.
   The court unanimously ruled in a case from Michigan that states
may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal
suits.
   The case is Hardin vs. Straub, 87-7023.

<HEAD>Bribery Charges Filed Against Two Leading Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bribery charges were filed against two leading
politicians in the Recruit influence-buying case Monday, but
critics said prosecutors had not dug deeply enough into the
scandal, which has shaken politics and business.
   Those charged were Takao Fujinami, a former cabinet minister and
member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and Katsuya
Ikeda, former secretary-general of the opposition Komeito (Clean
Government) Party.
   If convicted, they could be imprisoned for up to seven years.
   Fujinami, 56, and Ikeda, 52, were not taken into custody.
Japanese law protects members from being jailed while Parliament is
in session unless the legislative body grants permission.
   They are widely expected to be the only politicians charged,
although 17 legislators or aides are known to have received bargain
unlested shares of stock from the Recruit Co.
   Thirteen are from the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
including 11 members of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
cabinet.
   Nakasone said he ``received the news of the charges solemnly''
and wished to apologize to the Japanese people.
   Prosecutors said Fujinami and Ikeda received donations and
heavily discounted stock shares from Recruit in exchange for using
political influence to help the information conglomerate's magazine
publishing business.
   All 14 others arrested or charged in the Recruit scandal were
bureaucrats or businessmen.
   Ikeda, a former journalist and four-term member of the lower
house, said the charges were ``a fabrication of reality'' and he
would prove his innocence in court.
   He announced last week he would resign from both Parliament and
the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito Party.
   Yuichi Ichikawa, current secretary-general of the party, said it
was ``extremely regrettable'' that charges had been filed against a
member, but added that prosecutors should carry the investigation
further.
   Actions taken to date ``aren't enough to clarify and get to the
core of the scandal,'' he said. ``If the investigation ends now, it
will have failed to reach the people who were most responsible.''
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said last month he would resign
to take responsibility for the scandal, which has eroded public
trust in politics. The governing party's search for a successor has
been complicated by the scandal's links to most of its senior
members.
   Ichikawa and other opposition party leaders said they would
continue pressing for a full investigation.
   Eiji Suzuki, head of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations, said Monday all members of Parliament who received
Recruit shares should resign, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Fujinami, the chief government spokesman in Nakasone's Cabinet
and an eight-term member of the lower house, was considered a
rising star in the party. He submitted his resignation to the party
Monday but said he would retain his parliament seat.
   He has acknowledged that an aide bought 12,000 shares of stock
in a Recruit subsidiary at a discounted price in 1986, then made a
profit of about 30 million yen ($215,000) when the stock went on
public sale. News reports say Fujinami used some of the profit to
buy a house in Tokyo.
   The former labor minister also is said to have received about 90
million yen ($640,000) in political donations from Recruit.
   Ikeda has admitted his brother bought 5,000 shares of stock in
the Recruit subsidiary and made a profit of about 10 million yen
($71,000). Reports also say Ikeda received 14 million yen
($100,000) in donations from Recruit.
   Both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock
transactions, but some of the profits allegedly were deposited in
their bank accounts.
   Prosecutors said Ikeda and Fujinami used political influence to
persuade officials to continue a ``gentlemen's agreement'' among
government agencies and private companies on a uniform date for
hiring of graduating college students.
   Recruit considered the agreement critical to the sales of its
employment magazines.
   With the filing of charges against Ikeda and Fujinami,
prosecutors said their bribery investigation was complete and they
would focus on illegal donations made by the conglomerate, news
reports said.
   Japanese law restricts a company of Recruit's size to 15 million
yen ($107,000) a year in political donations.
   Takeshita alone has acknowledged receiving more than 130 million
yen (about $1 million) from Recruit in 1985-87.

<HEAD>Party Supports Gorbachev for President, Sakharov Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leadership of the Communist Party on Monday
endorsed Mikhail S. Gorbachev to be chosen again for the post of
Soviet president when the new parliament convenes for the first
time later this week.
   At a separate meeting of deputies to the congress, human rights
activist Andrei D. Sakharov also endorsed Gorbachev, but with
reservations.
   ``My position is that we have no leader except for Gorbachev.
But he is not immaculate, not immaculate in terms of a very large
number of actions,'' Sakharov said in a speech.
   The official Tass news agency said the party's Central Committee
met to discuss the activities of the Congress of People's Deputies,
which will meet Thursday.
   Among the duties of the new congress are to elect the president
and a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Tass said the Central Committee recommended election of
Gorbachev as Soviet president. He was elected president Oct. 1 by
the old Supreme Soviet parliament, which is being replaced by the
congress and the new Supreme Soviet it will elect.
   The 251-member Central Committee, the party's policy-making
body, had been expected to meet prior to the congress to set its
approach to the stronger legislative branch being formed as
Gorbachev attempts to strengthen the Soviet government.
   Many questions of the congress' exact functions have not been
clarified yet, just days before it meets.
   The vast majority of deputies are members of the Communist
Party, but there is a large block of reformers who are impatient
with progress so far implementing Gorbachev's reforms.
   Many of them, especially radicals from the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, cannot be counted on to follow the
Central Committee's dictates.
   On Sunday, Moscow firebrand Boris N. Yeltsin and others told a
rally that they had formed their own program of radical changes
that includes urgent action to heal the economy and multicandidate
elections for the presidency.
   Yeltsin told the rally that Moscow deputies had drafted an
agenda that demands ``radical decisions on the economy, social
justice and glasnost.''
   The deputies are demanding laws on pensions, children's rights
and property, Yeltsin said.
   Tass said Yeltsin was among 34 speakers Monday at the Central
Committee meeting, but it provided no details of his remarks.
   One deputy, Alexander Tolstoukhov, told the Sunday gathering
that Yelstin should be elected president. Yeltsin has denied in the
past that he is interested in challenging Gorbachev, and no clear
opposition to Gorbachev has formed.
   On Monday, scores of deputies signed a letter to Gorbachev,
backing a draft agenda by Moscow deputies.
   The agenda calls on Gorbachev to make a report to the congress
on the state of the Soviet Union before the election for president
is held.
   Sakharov, speaking at the deputies' meeting, said: ``I think we
have no other real candidate than Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   ``Compared to Gorbachev, the candidacy of Yeltsin would be
unsatisfactory,'' he said. Gorbachev's mistakes must be ``corrected
by the people's will,'' Sakharov said.
   In the past, Sakharov has criticized policy on ethnic relations
and government decisions that he sees as limiting its commitment to
free expression.
   The congress consists of 2,250 members, 1,500 chosen on the
basis of geographical representation and 750 chosen from the
Communist Party and its affiliates, social, professional and trade
union organizations.
   The party itself has 100 seats, and Gorbachev was elected a
deputy of the congress from the Communist Party.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T's Largest Union Authorizes Strike; Saturday is Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of AT&amp;T's largest union voted
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract is not
reached by midnight Saturday, the union said Monday as negotiations
entered a critical stage.
   The Communications Workers of America, which reprsents about
130,000 AT&amp;T workers, did not release a breakdown of its nationwide
strike-authorization vote.
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which is
negotiating jointly with CWA and represents an additional 40,000
employees, is conducting a separate vote. Strike authorization is
expected.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's contracts with the two unions
expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. A company spokesman said he was
hopeful a new, three-year agreement would be reached this week and
there were indications the unions might not immediately call a
strike even if the two sides remained far apart at the deadline.
   ``It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give the
leadership such authorization,'' AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said.
``It doesn't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hard
week, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic
that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work
stoppage.''
   A CWA statement stressed that a strike ``is only one of several
tactics to achieve a fair contract.''
   Among those tactics is a nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T's
long-distance service, a move the unions say will cost the company
upwards of $10 million a month.
   The boycott plan calls for the nation's unions and related
organizations, which predominately are AT&amp;T customers, to
temporarily switch their long-distance calls to non-union US
Sprint. The unions and the AFL-CIO also have said they will urge
their major suppliers to boycott AT&amp;T as well.
   If AT&amp;T and its unions appear close to an agreement, the unions
likely would agree to negotiate for a day or two past the
contract's expiration.
   If, on the other hand, the two sides remain far apart, CWA
President Morton Bahr and IBEW President John Barry have the power
to decide whether to strike immediately or to implement the boycott
plan in hopes of pressuring AT&amp;T into concessions.
   Although negotiators have been meeting since March, AT&amp;T has yet
to present a formal offer. That should come early this week.
   Union officials have said the two sides remain far apart on
three major issues: employee contributions to health insurance, pay
and job security.
   ``At this stage, AT&amp;T has yet to seriously address issues of
concern to our members, particularly the issue of employment
security,'' Bahr said. ``Management is pushing a package of
sweeping, unacceptable medical cuts and other proposals which
attack seniority.''
   Barry issued a statement promising unity among the unions, which
were bitter rivals at this stage of contract talks three years ago.
   ``Together our members are determined to win jobs with justice
and a contract worthy of the skills and productivity of our
members,'' he said.
   In 1986, CWA struck AT&amp;T for 26 days but the company was able to
keep half of its manufacturing plants open because the IBEW agreed
to work provided its members were given any added benefits CWA won
through its strike.

authorities said.
   The twin-propeller plane went down around 10:45 a.m. after
takeoff from an airport near Aurora, about 25 miles from here, said
Lee Carlson, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman.
   Killed were three employees of Condor Enterprise Inc., which
owned the plane, said Ernie Kobrow, vice president of the company
based at Aurora Municipal Airport.
   Carlson said he did not know the plane's destination.
   It was not immediately known if the plane was carrying any

   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
sent to the scene.
   De Kalb is about 60 miles west of Chicago.

<HEAD>Secord Pleads Innocent to Cover-up Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Secord, the retired Air Force major
general facing new charges in the Iran-Contra affair, pleaded
innocent Monday to charges of covering up his alleged profits from
selling arms to Iran and the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Secord was released on his own recognizance after being
arraigned before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys said they will discuss whether
to combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment of
Secord. They will report back to the court May 31.
   Robinson said, meanwhile, that he expects the trials of Secord
and John Poindexter, once presidential national security adviser,
to begin simultaneously. The judge said it would be impossible for
him to handle both Iran-Contra cases, which probably will be tried
this fall. Robinson is handling pre-trial proceedings in the
Poindexter case.
   Poindexter; Secord; Secord's business partner, Albert Hakim, and
Oliver North were charged in 1988 with illegally diverting more
than $14 million in Iranian arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Prosecutor Reid Weingarten said the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh has ``every intention'' of prosecuting Hakim
after Secord's trail.
   The latest indictment against Secord accuses him of obstructing
the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987, perjury and
making false statements. The nine counts were unsealed May 11 after
North's trial ended.
   Secord lawyer Thomas Green said he might have to withdraw from
the case because ``I was privy to and was a party to discussions
with Congress'' in connection with Secord's 1987 congressional
testimony. Therefore, Green said, he might be called as a witness
at the trial.
   Green said he would, ``under those circumstances,'' withdraw
from the case in favor of a partner in his law firm, James E.
Sharp, who stood next to Secord as he was arraigned.
   Weingarten said that ``usually the entire firm is dismissed'' as
the attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomes
a witness in the case. Weingarten said ``we must explore'' whether
anyone in the firm of Sharp, Green &amp; Lankford should represent
Secord.
   Secord is accused of lying when he told Congress that he wasn't
taking profits from his network of foreign corporations and Swiss
bank accounts, part of an operation that became known as the
Enterprise. In fact, said the federal grand jury indictment, Secord
used a former Internal Revenue Service lawyer ``on a continuous
basis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to the
defendant, Richard V. Secord.''
   He also was accused of lying when he testified that his only
financial gain from the arms sales to Iran and the Contras was his
$6,000-a-month salary; that $500,000 from the Enterprise funneled
to one of his companies was a loan, and that he was unaware any
money from the Enterprise benefited North.
   North was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges
in the Iran-Contra affair, including illegally accepting a $13,800
home security system from Secord. In addition, the government
alleges, Secord and Hakim arranged to set aside $200,000 as a death
benefit for the education of North's children.
   North called on Secord to secretly run weapons to the Contras
during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel force
and to assist in the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to
Iran.

today a study of 19 U.S. campuses found that two out of every 1,000
students tested was infected with the AIDS virus, a rate below the
national average but a figure one official said ``should cause real
concern.''
   Officials said the study points up the need for more aggressive
efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on college
campuses.
   The study _ the nation's first survey attempting to determine
the prevalence of AIDS among college students _ tested the blood of
16,861 students who sought medical attention in their campus health
centers.
   Of those, 30 tested positive for the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, which amounts to an overall infection rate of 0.2
percent, said the association, which conducted the study with the
federal Centers for Disease Control.
   No student tested positive at 10 of the schools, while five of
the schools had rates of 0.4 percent or higher.
   Richard Keeling, director of student health services at the
University of Virginia and president of the college health
association, said the survey results ``establish beyond any doubt
that HIV infection is a current problem on college campuses.''
   He said ``the fact that HIV infection appears on campuses across
the country should cause real concern.''
   By comparison, studies have indicated that the infection rate
among prisoners is four out of 1,000, or 0.4 percent. Nationwide,
researchers believe 1 million to 1.5 million people are infected, a
rate of 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent.
   Keeling said the overall 0.2 percent rate is ``somewhat higher
than we hypothesized at the outset,'' but he added that ``these
numbers are meant to be indicators, rather than statements of
specific levels of infection.''
   Helene Gayle, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease
Control who worked on the survey, said the prevalence of infection
appears to be about the same for college students as for other
groups where they would not expect to see an extremely high rate.
She said, for example, studies have shown a rate of infection among
military recruits of 0.14 percent.
   At a news conference, Keeling said that of the 30 students who
tested positive 28 were male and two were female. He said he had no
breakdown of the number of men and women whose blood was tested as
part of a study. They also had no breakdown on the age of students
in the study.
   He said the highest campus rate was 0.9 percent but the study
did not identify rates for individual campuses.
   Keeling said his advice to college students is that
``uninformed, unprotected, unsober sexual activity is highly
risky.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,
fatal isease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   The 19 campuses, comprising 18 public and private institutions,
were selected to represent a cross section of higher education in
the United States, the association said.
   However, the association picked only large universities because
they tend to attract students from their geographic areas. Also,
the survey was restricted to students who had routine blood tests
done at their student health centers.
   The testing was done anonymously, and results were not broken
out for the individual schools.
   The association said it will continue the study during the next
academic year and wants include several more schools, including
historically black institutions and some with predominantly
Hispanic students.
   The schools included in the survey were:
   Central Missouri State University-Warrensburg; Emory University,
Atlanta; Mississippi State University-Starkville; Northwestern
University, Evanston, Ill.; Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
N.J.; San Diego State University; Southern Illinois
University-Carbondale; University of California-Berkeley.
   University of Colorado-Boulder; University of
Connecticut-Storrs; University of Georgia-Athens; University of
Kansas-Lawrence; University of Maryland-Baltimore County and
College Park;
   University of Massachusetts-Amherst; University of New
Hampshire-Durham; University of Southern California-Los Angeles;
University of Texas-Austin and University of Washington-Seattle.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Dig in Parking Lot for Bombed Museum's Treasures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Britain's best regional museums that was
destroyed by German bombers and paved over as a parking lot will be
the focus of an unusual archaeological dig this year.
   The city of Hull in northeast England opened the site of the old
Hull Municipal Museum to the public Monday, turning it into a kind
of retrospective of the 1940s, with extracts from war broadcasts
and popular songs piped into the dig, said project coordinator
David Fleming.
   The six-month dig was organized by civic officials, assisted by
an American museum, to save what is left of a once-fine historical
collection.
   The neoclassical museum collapsed in an inferno of German
incendiary bombs in 1943 and was left in ruins for several years
until, for safety reasons, it was flattened and turned into a
parking lot, Fleming said.
   ``For all the world it looked like any other car park,'' said
Fleming, the principal keeper of museums in the coastal city on the
North Sea.
   ``But when we put in a ditch in 1988, we realized a high
proportion of the collection had survived intact although it was
very badly damaged.''
   Fleming said in an interview it was hoped the dig would not only
save the treasures, but reveal how some objects, especially those
made from modern materials, decay in soil.
   The collections ranged from fossils and Roman coins to the
largest prehistoric boat found in Britain and objects made from
nylon and rayon, which were new materials at the time, he said.
   ``It is bizarre,'' he said. ``We're not talking about a normal
archaeological site. We're trying to piece together a moment in
time: June 23, 1943.''
   The site ``was related to people alive here. There's a great
emotional relationship in Hull to this dig,'' he said.
   Financial support for the $192,000 project has also come from
the state-funded National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Heafitz
Museum in Boston, he said.
   City officials hadn't excavated in the post-war years because
Hull had been bombed heavily. ``There was a lot of rebuilding to
do,'' he said. ``It was just something put to the back of people's
minds.''
   Some of the treasures were lost before the rubble was cleared.
   ``We don't really like to call it looting. ... It was hard to
know the mentality at the time, and it looked to be totally
abandoned,'' he said, adding that the extent of the losses was
unknown and most museum records were destroyed.
   After the dig, any treasures salvaged will be housed at one of
the city's other museums, said Fleming.

   A man released from jail after he was
charged with burglary was arrested again less than two hours later
when police answered a burglar alarm at a tire store.
   Police said they identified Kirk Stanley Manning, 19, by the
release papers in his pocket.
   Manning was released on his own recognizance Friday night, three
days after his arrest in Florence on burglary and theft charges.
Manning told officiers he entered the business to get enough money
to return to Florence, about 55 miles west of Eugene, police said.
He was charged with burglary and jailed, this time on $1,000 bail.

   Flooding forced many snakes into populated areas,
but experts asked residents to restrain their fears and spare the
reptiles, many of which eat rodents.
   ``There's a lot of harmless species in the Dallas area. The ones
that are left alone will return to their homes as soon as they can
because they tend to live in the same place all their lives,'' said
Ardell Mitchell, reptile supervisor at the Dallas Zoo.
   And experts say the snakes may be doing homeowners a favor,
since last week's flooding, caused by heavy rainstorms, may also
have forced a few rodents to higher ground.
   Harmless Texas rat snakes, diamondback and blotched water
snakes, which can grow to more than 3 feet long, are the most
common species in the area. But some areas of Dallas have venomous
copperheads and diamondback rattlesnakes.

<HEAD>NATO Leaders Seek to Mend Dispute Over Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One week before the big NATO summit
begins, officials are still scrambling to mend a rift between the
United States and many of its European allies over short-range
nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The disagreement may not be completely settled by the time
President Bush and other alliance leaders gather May 29-30 in
Brussels to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But reassuring words by Bush and French President Francois
Mitterrand suggest the issue won't be allowed to disrupt the summit
_ at least on the surface.
   It's a much bigger issue in Europe, where feelings on
European-based nuclear weapons run sharp and deep, than in the
United States.
   Even in Europe, however, one diplomat, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said, ``There will be something to paper
over the differences so we can emerge reasonably united from the
summit.''
   Richard Fieldhouse, a research fellow at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, said the issue
has become ``too steamed up,'' making it difficult to find a
solution.
   ``There's a bit too much enmity. ... There's a lot of political
maneuvering and a lot of bad blood politically,'' he said.
   But Hans Binnendijk, director of studies for the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, predicted a way would be found to
narrow the split in time for the anniversary gathering.
   ``It is clear that (Germany) and the United States don't want to
see this thing blow up at the summit,'' he said.
   Over the weekend, Bush said the dispute was a ``vexing
question'' with differing opinions by ``strong-willed people from
strong countries.''
   However, he also said ``I think great progress has been made''
and ``I think that we could well have this resolved before the
summit.''
   Mitterrand, after meeting with Bush, said, ``On this problem,
like on other problems, at the outset people have diverging views,
differing opinions. But the important thing is to come to a meeting
of the minds and to achieve a common answer. And this has always
been the case in the alliance.''
   The dispute stems from a push by the United States and Britain
to replace the aging Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missile with
a new, more powerful weapon.
   The arms campaign has become increasingly unpopular in many
European countries, upbeat about the friendlier moves by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and reluctant to do anything to cool
the warmer East-West climate.
   ``Continental Europeans are really not interested in another
round of nuclear modernization,'' said Fieldhouse.
   Politicians, he said, will have ``a hard time trying to convince
the public it's necessary.''
   The United States had hoped for a strong signal of support from
the allies for the Lance modernization program. But that now
appears highly unlikely.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, worried about the survival of his
center-right government, wants to delay a decision on production of
the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after important elections next
year in Germany.
   Moreover, his government unexpectedly demanded that the alliance
enter into early negotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to
reduce short-range, or theater nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The United States and Britain have strongly opposed that,
arguing the emphasis should be on East-West bargaining to slash
conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.
   U.S. and British officials worry that opening discussions on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons would inevitably lead to
removal of all those forces from Europe.
   NATO contends it maintains a nuclear stockpile as a deterrent to
balance the enormous superiority the East has built up in
conventional arms.
   Germany has gained support for its position _ although with
varying degrees of enthusiasm _ from Belgium, Denmark, Norway,
Greece, Italy and Spain.
   Gorbachev has tried to add more pressure on the Western allies.
He recently promised to unilaterally withdraw 500 short-range
nuclear weapons from Europe this year.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450
short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lance
launchers, most based in Germany.
   In their meetings, NATO officials have been trying to find
acceptable language on the weapons issue to write into the
Comprehensive Concept, a blueprint for alliance strategy in arms
control and force planning.
   The roadmap, which will be presented to Bush and the other
leaders at the summit, lacks only a section on the allies' stand on
short-range nuclear forces.
   A number of possibilities are still on the table but no
compromise solution has yet emerged, officials say.
   The European diplomat suggested the officials may signal their
willingness to enter into negotiations with the Warsaw Pact on
reducing theater nuclear weapons _ but not now. Discussions would
hinge on progress in newly opened East-West talks in Vienna on
slashing conventional forces _ a position Bush has publicly
embraced.
   The officials, though, could put off a decision altogether,
perhaps bumping the issue to a commission, which would report its
findings to NATO officials by a certain later.
   The United States intends to go ahead with research and
development for a replacement to the Lance missile. Military
analysts say it will be obsolete by 1995.
   NATO members are: Canada, the United States, Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.

   Edward Perkins, the first
black U.S. ambassador to South Africa, ended his tour of duty
Monday with a salute to the country's blacks.
   ``It's pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be
free,'' he said.
   Perkins gave his first news conference in 2{ years in South
Africa just before boarding a plane to the United States, where he
is expected to become director-general of the Foreign Service.
   ``The most encouraging (thing) has been to see the reaction of
the black majority to the efforts of the government to stifle overt
unhappiness with the status quo,'' he said.
   ``While the government has been fairly successful in many cases
with the state of emergency, I think the black majority seem even
more determined, even stronger in making a difference.''
   The 60-year-old Louisiana native said he was most disappointed
by ``the continued existence of the state of emergency, the banning
of 17 organizations a couple of years ago and the inclination to
arrest a lot of people and detain them without charge.''
   Perkins consistently has criticized such practices. He also
attended political trials and protest services and traveled
extensively, visiting some of the poorest and most militant black
communities. However, he made only a handful of public speeches and
until last week gave no news interviews.
   ``The United States should be, and intends to remain, engaged in
South Africa,'' Perkins said. ``We must steadfastly manifest what
we believe in as a nation so that our message is heard and
understood all over South Africa, in every village and in every
township.
   ``We do not wish to impose an ideology, but we do want to
express our belief in human rights, the rule of law, equal justice
under law, and equal participation in government under a
constitution which has been decided by representatives of a
majority of South Africans.''
   His departure comes as the U.S. government prepares for a visit
from National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated the next
president of South Africa, and just after a meeting between
President Bush and clergymen who favor more economic sanctions to
pressure Pretoria to end apartheid.
   Sanctions have been a major issue during Perkins'
ambassadorship, which started a month after Congress imposed trade
embargoes in 1986. Since then an argument has raged in South Africa
and the United States about whether such sanctions hurt the black
majority by weakening the economy or help them by forcing reforms.
   ``The purpose of that act was to ensure that (African National
Congress leader) Nelson Mandela was freed, that political
organizations were unbanned and that free political dialogue
happened in the country, among others,'' said Perkins, who refused
to give his personal view on the issue.
   ``Mandela has not been released, and the ANC is still banned and
on top of that several other organizations have been banned. If you
look at it in those terms, it's easy to say sanctions have not been
effective,'' he said.
   However, he said Americans who push for sanctions ``look upon
them as a tool which will remind the people in political power that
(they have) to make some changes before they are looked upon as
responsible members of the Western world of nations.''
   He said South Africa is changing ``to a different kind of
country, to one where the majority population will have a decisive
say in how they are governed.''
   ``I am encouraged,'' he said, ``but I would say, as an outside
observer, the road is still a pretty long one to travel.''

<HEAD>Baker Urges Arabs and Israelis To Make Concessions for Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called
on Arabs and Israelis today to show a more conciliatory attitude
towards each other's interests as a means of beginning a ``serious
negotiating process.''
   ``Let the Arab world take concrete steps toward accommodation
with Israel _ not in place of the peace process, but as a catalyst
for it,'' Baker said in a speech to the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, a group that lobbies for U.S. support of Israel.
   He called on Arabs to end the economic boycott of Israel, to
respect Israel's right to membership in international organizations
and to ``repudiate the odious line that Zionism is racism.''
   At the same time, Baker issued an appeal to conservative
elements in Israel, calling on them to ``lay aside, once and for
all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''
   Baker said that Israeli interests in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip can be accommodated in a settlement based on U.N. Security
Council resolutions spelling out framework for a peace settlement.
   He called on Israel to forswear annexation of occupied
territories, to stop settlement activities in these areas and to
allow schools to reopen.
   He asked Israelis to ``reach out to the Palestinians as
neighbors who deserve political rights.''
   In a similar vein, Baker urged Palestinians to ``reach out to
Israelis and convince them of your peaceful intentions.
   ``You have the most to gain from doing so, and no one else can
or will do it for you,'' he said. ``And no one is going to
`deliver' Israel for you.''

   In most statehouses, if a legislator's
vote was cast while he was away or a bill was mysteriously
transferred from one committee to another it would be discussed
heatedly for months.
   It's all in a day's work in the Rhode Island Senate.
   Since the Democratic Party, which controls the Senate 41-9, was
torn apart in a power struggle at the beginning of the year, there
have been sharp conflicts between Majority Leader David R. Carlin
Jr. and Judiciary Committee Chairman John J. Bevilacqua.
   Fourteen of Carlin's 16 top bills were killed by committees
controlled by the Bevilacqua side, and Carlin's supporters have
defeated a few of the opposition's bills on the Senate floor.
   The Republicans helped Bevilacqua's group strip Carlin of most
of his traditional power in a series of 26-24 votes at the
beginning of the year. Minority Leader Robert D. Goldberg won the
right to unilaterally summon bills out of committee and onto the
floor for votes.
   GOP senators have emerged as power brokers and peacemakers,
siding with Carlin to defeat some questionable bills sponsored by
the Bevilacqua group.
   Similar upheavals occurred this year in Connecticut and North
Carolina, where bipartisan coalitions ousted Democratic House
speakers. An attempt in Florida failed when the Democratic speaker
formed an alliance of his own with Republicans. In Indiana, where
the House has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, the
parties agreed to elect co-speakers who would alternate control of
the chamber.
   In Rhode Island, with no clear-cut winner, the feuding has
continued intermittently.
   The General Assembly normally adjourns in late May or early
June, but the Senate is several weeks behind last year's pace and
the big test of the year _ budget negotiations with the House and
Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete _ has not yet started.
   Carlin and Bevilacqua met May 16 to try to hammer out a unified
Senate position, their first face-to-face meeting in months aside
from brief encounters on the Senate floor.
   They said later that agreement would take some time but would
not be impossible, in part because the state's tight financial
picture means little money will be left over for lawmakers' pet
projects.
   The meeting followed a tense week marked by what Carlin labeled
two ``absolutely incredible'' incidents.
   The first was when state Sen. James S. D'Ambra, a Democrat who
supports Carlin, was recorded as voting with the Bevilacqua faction
on a hotly contested bill while he was in Boston for the day.
   Bevilacqua said someone must have accidentally pressed D'Ambra's
voting button. Carlin and D'Ambra said that was impossible.
   A day later, the Carlin faction noticed that a bill assigned to
the Corporations Committee, where Carlin has a majority, had
somehow been transferred to Bevilacqua's Judiciary Committee.
   Lt. Gov. Roger N. Begin, presiding over the Senate, ruled the
bill was improperly reported out and he was upheld on a 24-24 vote.
   The Republicans helped Carlin on that vote. They also have
helped defeat bills sponsored by the Bevilacqua group that would
have allowed deer hunters to trespass on private property and
short-circuited the normal chartering procedure for a Connecticut
man who wants to open a Rhode Island bank.
   Carlin has begun looking ahead, to the 1990 elections.
   In a recent interview, he said the Bevilacqua group's successful
fight to defeat a Carlin-backed bill banning assault weapons would
be used against Bevilacqua's supporters in the election.
   ``It's a motherhood and apple pie issue, and they voted against
motherhood and apple pie,'' Carlin said.
   But the feud is not universal.
   Carlin's press secretary, Suzanne Costa, has helped several
Bevilacqua supporters, such as state Sen. James M. Donelan, to
publicize their bills.
   ``That person, Suzanne, is here for all the senators,'' said
Donelan. ``She has done a good job for me ... I think a lot of the
staff has tried to remain neutral.''

   A police officer was hospitalized in

   Police Chief Jerry Redmond said Monday that the incident
occurred when Sgt. Jester Johnson, 43, responded to a disturbance

   Redmond said Johnson arrested Isaiah Wright, 26, of Hollandale,
who allegedly was fighting with a woman.
   The police chief said that as Johnson was trying to handcuff
Wright, the suspect bite the officer in the face and threw him to
the ground. Another officer apprehended Wright.
   Wright is in the Hollandale City Jail and was to be tested for
the AIDS virus, Redmond said. He is held pending arraignment on
charges of aggravated assault on a police officer and resisting
arrest.
   Johnson is in a Memphis, Tenn., hosptial where he is expected to
undergo plastic surgery.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says Two Former Members Can Sue Unification Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church
failed Monday in a Supreme Court attempt to kill a lawsuit by two
former members who say they were ``brainwashed'' into joining the
church.
   Church officials had said the Constitution's guarantee of
religious freedom should nullify the lawsuit. But the justices
dismissed the appeal without comment, refusing to shield the church
from the suit seeking damages.
   In other action, the court:
   _Rejected an appeal by mass murderer John Wayne Gacy, the
Chicago man convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33
boys and young men. No one in U.S. history has been convicted of
killing more people.
   _Ruled unanimously that a lawsuit against the owners of the
cruise ship Achille Lauro, target of a terrorist hijacking in 1985,
may be tried in a federal court in New York City rather than in
Naples, Italy.
   _Agreed to use a case from Colorado to study a federal
regulation aimed at saving the government time and money when it
mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients.
   _Let stand a ruling that Chicago may be sued for monetary
damages in state court by people contending officials allowed
excessive noise and air pollution at O'Hare International Airport.
   _Rejected an appeal by former Chicago Councilman Thomas E.
Keane, convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell
tax-delinquent properties. The court refused to use the case to set
guidelines on when some people may challenge their fraud
convictions after completing prison terms for those convictions.
   _Limited, by a 6-3 vote, federal judges' power to exclude
potentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials. The court
allowed a jury to be told about the criminal record of a young
Pennsylvania man who sued over the loss of his arm in a car wash
accident.
   In the Unification Church case, David Molko and Tracy Leal said
in lawsuits that they were duped into becoming ``Moonies'' in
California.
   Molko saud he was a 27-year-old law school graduate in 1979 when
recruited by church members in San Francisco.
   He said two men approached him at a bus stop and told him they
belonged to an international community of socially conscious people.
   He went to dinner with them and thereafter to a retreat outside
the city where he and others were kept to a tight schedule of
lectures, group discussions and calisthenics, he said.
   Molko said the group members repeatedly denied their
organization was a religious one. Only on the 12th day was he told
the group belonged to the Unification Church.
   Molko said he was confused and angry but stayed on when members
persuaded him that deception had been necessary because of the
church's negative reputation.
   Ms. Leal told a similar story in court papers. She said she was
a 19-year-old college student when a recruiter approached her at a
San Francisco bus station in 1979.
   She said she was not told the group was part of the Unification
Church until her 22nd day at the retreat.
   Ms. Leal and Molko remained church members for several months
before they were abducted by ``deprogrammers'' who had been hired
by their parents.
   They are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional
distress they say they suffered. Molko also is seeking the return
of $6,000 he donated to the church.
   The California Supreme Court, voting 6-1 last October, overruled
two lower courts and reinstated the suits. It ordered jury trials.
   The state court said the Molko and Ms. Leal are entitled to
trials to present evidence they were ``brainwashed'' and ``the
church's agents rendered them incapable of deciding not to join.''
   The state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to
defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right
to practice religion freely.
   The National Council of Churches, other religious organizations
and a group consisting primarily of college professors had urged
the justices to overrule the state court.
   The groups had said the state court ruling ``has had, and will
continue to have, a serious chilling effect on religious
proselytizing and conversion in California and elsewhere.''

``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   The sold-out performance Saturday night at the Music Center's

opening is May 31.
   ``This was my first time to see it and Nancy's second,'' said
Reagan. ``But she was as eager to see it again as I was for the
first time. The special effects are just amazing.''
   ``I could come back and see it tomorrow night,'' said a beaming

   Ashrita Furman, who holds more Guinness
world records than anyone else, has added yodeling to his claim to
fame.
   The native New Yorker by Monday morning had yodeled for 27
hours, besting, he said, the current Guinness World Record of 26
hours set in 1984 by Errol Bird in Lisburn, Northern Ireland.
   ``I feel really good,'' he said after completing the grind at
the Guinness Museum at Fisherman's Wharf.
   If certified, the record will be Furman's 15th. His others
include running a marathon while juggling three balls _ in 3 hours,
22 minutes.
   ``I used to be the classic nerd _ a pure bookworm,'' said the
34-year-old bachelor who manages a New York City health food store.
``I had no athletic interest at all.''
   Furman began his yodeling effort Saturday night and by mid-day
Sunday the task was taking a toll on his larynx and vocal cords.
   But the physical suffering was nothing compared to the time he
performed gymnastic forward rolls nonstop for 12\ miles to set a
record. The headaches were bad, but the nausea was worse.
   He hopes to reach his goal of 25 records by the end of the year.

   Marjory Stoneman Douglas warned
``there's still a lot to be done,'' then accepted the national
Sierra Club's highest honor for her efforts to preserve Florida's
Everglades.
   ``It has been the greatest possible happiness to me to have had
this purpose and goal,'' the ``grande dame of the Everglades'' told
state and national environmentalists Sunday who gathered to honor
her.
   Ms. Stoneman Douglas, 99, said increased public interest and
political efforts to reverse developmental damage to the Everglades
have ``been the greatest possible pleasure in life.''
   Ms. Stoneman Douglas, whose book ``River of Grass'' six decades
ago helped spur the drive to create the Everglades National Park,
has continued to vigorously advocate expansion of the park and
protection of other Florida wetlands and natural resources.
   ``I think she has been to the Everglades what Winston Churchill
was to Britain in World War II,'' said Mike Finley, the national
park's superintendent. ``She has been the leader, the conscience,
the rallying point.''

   Radical students burned U.S. flags and
clashed with riot police in Seoul and Kwangju on Monday as they
began a week of protests to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops
from South Korea.
   Students organized demonstrations on at least 23 campuses
nationwide. Most were peaceful and small in scale, with just a few
hundred students taking part, police reports said.
   But in the southern city of Kwangju, about 170 miles southwest
of Seoul, an estimated 1,000 students hurled rocks and sticks at
riot police in a violent demonstration, officials said.
   Students demanded that 43,000 U.S. troops stationed here under a
mutual defense treaty be withdrawn immediately. They burned
American flags and put up posters denouncing the United States.
   In Seoul, police arrested 18 students armed with iron bars and
firebombs who briefly occupied an office at National Police
Headquarters, officials said. Students smashed windows and threw
anti-government and anti-American leaflets outside, they said.
   ``Disband the torture and murder machine,'' students chanted
before being overpowered by police.
   Security was stepped up at U.S. diplomatic and military
facilities, with riot police standing guard. Nine busloads of riot
police guarded the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.
   Student groups called for a week of protests to demand an end to
South Korea's military alliance with the United States. The
militants claim the United States helps prop up authoritarian rule
in South Korea.
   Dissidents and radical students are calling for the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo's government. But the radicals lack
significant public support due to their violent tactics and extreme
views.
   The dissidents contend the United States props up the Roh
government to enforce its control over South Korea. Radical
students contend U.S. troops are blocking reunification with
communist North Korea.

<HEAD>Past Glorious, Future Uncertain For Cape Hatteras Lighthouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse has symbolized
the rugged beauty of North Carolina's Outer Banks islands for
generations, and now the tower that warned ships of dangerous
shoals is itself threatened by the sea.
   For years, debate has raged about what should be done to
preserve the nation's oldest and tallest brick lighthouse.
   When it was built in 1870 _ replacing one that had fallen into
the sea _ the 208-foot lighthouse was 1,500 feet from the Atlantic
Ocean. The shoreline has advanced about 11 feet per year since then
and waves now crash less than 200 feet from its base.
   The future of the landmark was left uncertain again last week
when the National Park Service's regional office in Atlanta said it
was putting off a decision on how to preserve the tower.
   Instead, the park service said it plans to issue a special
document listing options for protecting the lighthouse in about
three weeks. Then the agency will accept public comment for 30 to
90 days before making a final decision.
   ``We're trying to determine whether the comment cries out for
hearings or meetings,'' said James Howard, a park service spokesman.
   Over the years, a number of efforts _ including steel groins and
artificial seaweed to hold sand _ have done little to slow the
sea's natural advance.
   In 1986, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was set to build a
23-foot-high revetment and seawall around the spire at a cost of
$5.6 million.
   But a group calling itself the Move the Lighthouse Committee
persuaded the park service to reconsider, saying the ocean would
eventually surround the lighthouse, making it an island.
   Last year, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences
recommended the 2,600-ton lighthouse be moved inland. The panel of
10 experts estimated that moving the lighthouse 500 feet on rails
would cost $4.6 million and take a year.
   ``If you want to save the lighthouse there is absolutely no
alternative,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a professor of geology at Duke
University and a member of the Move the Lighthouse Committee.
   But many residents of Hatteras Island fear the monument will
collapse if it is moved. Instead, they favor efforts to replenish
the beaches, using sand fences and more artificial seaweed or
groins.
   The Academy of Sciences committee acknowledged some detrimental
effects of relocating the lighthouse. As many as eight acres of
ancient maritime forest in adjacent Buxton Woods could be lost in
clearing a new site, they said.
   ``If they move it we're going to lose something whether it falls
or not because it won't be on the same site it was built on,'' said
Rany Jennette, whose father was the last civilian keeper of the
Cape Hatteras Light.
   Jennette, who was born in the adjacent lighthouse keeper's
quarters in 1921, comes up from his home in Greenville, S.C., every
summer to work as a seasonal ranger and tour guide.
   ``I would go up to the top any time my father would let me,'' he
said. ``One thing I really enjoyed was using the old heavy
spyglasses to watch the ships go by.''

   Red velvet ropes on Monday blocked
the entrances to Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel, the first New
Jersey casino closed by gaming regulators for financial reasons.
   The state Casino Control Commission last week ordered the
Atlantis to close its multilevel casino floors after it ran up
debts of $150 million. Regulators are considering a bid by
developer Donald Trump to buy the Atlantis for $63 million and
convert it into a luxury non-casino hotel.
   Shortly before the normal start of gambling at 10 a.m., a small
group of customers waited at the bottom of the stalled escalators.
A security guard arrived and told them the casino was closed for
good.
   ``There are apparently some people who don't read newspapers or
watch television,'' said Henry Budniak, the Atlantis security shift
supervisor. ``But these are a bunch of people who were attached to
this place. It's sad.''
   ``We'll have to go look for another place to gamble,'' said
Mildred Kerns of Philadelphia. ``I feel so bad. I feel like
crying.''
   Two other customers said they gambled until the bitter end at 4
a.m., when casino attendants stopped handing out change for the
slot machines, the last roulette wheel stopped spinning and dealers
laid their last cards on the green felt.
   ``We came to say good-bye,'' said Antoinette Miozzi of
Philadelphia. ``We love this place. We've been coming here for all
eight years it's been open.''
   About 600 hotel and restaurant workers remain on the payroll out
of 2,000 employees. Casino workers were required to turn in their
gaming licenses, but were told officials from the Trump
Organization would visit the Atlantis on Tuesday to offer them
part-time positions as dealers or cashiers.
   Trump owns two other casinos and is building a third, the legal
limit for an individual owner. Atlantis' state-appointed
conservator, Joseph M. Nolan, has recommended that Trump's
agreement to buy the hotel be rejected in favor of subsequent
higher bids.

<HEAD>Soviet Pilot Taken to Hospital in Ankara</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet air force pilot who was wounded
while fleeing his country has been moved to an Ankara hospital from
Trabzon on the Black Sea, where he landed his MiG-29 fighter, state
radio reported Monday.
   The radio did not identify the hospital and officials would not
reveal the pilot's whereabouts.
   Officials said they doubted the government would grant the
Soviet request for extradition. Newspapers said U.S. experts had
examined the MiG-29, the most modern jet in the Soviet air force.
   Capt. Alexander Zuyev landed Saturday in Trabzon, with a
bleeding arm wound, and asked for asylum in the United States.
   On Monday a doctor in charge at the Black Sea University
hospital, said: ``Police came, took him away and we don't know
where.''
   ``The pilot is under the protection of Turkish officials
responsible for his safety,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Nazim
Belger.
   Turkey allowed the plane to be flown back to the Soviet Union on
Sunday. It was stripped of rockets and weapons, which were returned
on a separate plane.
   Newspapers reported Monday the MiG-29 was examined by Turkish
and U.S. military experts. Turkish officials and the U.S. Embassy
refused comment.
   Walter Shonia of the Soviet Embassy told reporters Zuyev was a
terrorist and Turkey's refusal to extradite him would amount to
support for terrorism.
   A Turkish official said privately, however: ``The Russians know
that in many decades we have not sent back home any military
person, from East or West, who asked for asylum.''
   In 1983, a Soviet general in uniform walked across the border to
Turkey and was flown to the United States. His name was not
revealed in Turkey but newspaper reports claimed he was a
high-level security officer.
   Three jets have been flown from the Soviet Union to Turkey since
1970 and the government returned only those Soviets who wanted to
go home.
   Pravda, the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party, reported
Monday that Zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the Tskhakaya
airfield north of Batumi and therefore was armed on the day of his
flight. It said he shot and wounded a sentry, who fired back and
wounded Zuyev.
   Two other Soviet fighters started chasing the MiG-29 but could
not intercept Zuyev because the border was so near, Pravda said.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
fell Monday in reaction to political developments in China, as
concern continued in the British colony over its future when it
reverts to China in eight years.
   Brokers say the activity had been expected because of the tense
situation in China over student demonstrations for democratic
reforms and the Chinese government's declaration of martial law
Saturday to end the protests.
   Stock exchange executives urged investors to stay calm, but
brokers expect developments in China to continue to govern the
market's activities. Some said it might take a week for the market
to stabilize.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips plunged 339.06 points to close
at 2,806.57 with all key shares suffering losses. The index lost
288.27 points in 15 minutes when the market opened but recovered
slightly to end the session at 2,887.89.
   On Friday, the last day of trading before the weekend holiday,
the index fell 132.03 points in panic selling in the worst
single-day plunge since the worldwide market collapse in October
1987.
   Turnover totaled $384.4 million Monday, compared with $316
million on Friday.
   There are fears the failure of the student movement could affect
Hong Kong's future and how China will govern the territory in 1997
when it comes under Chinese sovereignty.
   Under a Sino-British agreement signed in 1984, Hong Kong will
become a Special Administrative Region of China under a ``one
country, two systems'' formula. China has promised to preserve Hong
Kong's freewheeling social and economic system that has made it an
international financial center for 50 years beyond 1997 and allow
Hong Kong people to govern the territory.
   But many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents remain skeptical
of Chinese promises and the viability of the concept that would
allow a capitalistic enclave to exist under communism.
   An estimated two-thirds of Hong Kong's population are refugees
from China or their descendants who fled the Chinese mainland.
   On Sunday, a crowd of Hong Kong Chinese estimated at between
400,000 and 1 million rallied in support of the pro-democracy
demonstrators in China in what was described as the largest protest
march in the British colony's history.
   The marchers, who included staffers from China's official Xinhua
News Agency and other leftist organizations, demanded the
resignation of Chinese Premier Li Peng.
   ``Hong Kong, not noted for its political activism, has found a
rallying point which has stirred its collective consciousness to an
extent that has surprised everyone,'' said an editorial in the
English-language South China Morning Post.

   The Florida Supreme Court refused
Monday to allow enforcement of a new state law requiring minors to
get parental or judicial consent for abortions, but moved up a
hearing on the law's validity.
   The decison means that single women under 18 throughout Florida
will be able to get abortions without consent of parents or judges,
at least until the high court rules following oral arguments June
27, a lawyer for the state said.
   The justices last week had decided to hear a case involving a
15-year-old girl in September, but agreed Monday to expedite the
case at the request of Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth's
office.
   The state repeated a request to allow enforcement of the law
until the Supreme Court rules on its validity, but the justices
denied that motion for a second time.
   ``With the denial of the stay, it is our opinion that the law is
unenforceable statewide,'' said Assistant Attorney General Mitchell
Franks.
   The state's 5th District Court of Appeal, ruling in the case
involving the 15-year-old, struck down the abortion consent law as
unconstitutional.
   The case last week went from the Florida high court, which
denied a stay of the 5th District ruling sought by a lawyer
representing the rights of the girl's fetus, to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which also declined without comment to order enforcement of
the law.
   Lawyers had disagreed whether the ruling by the 5th District in
Daytona Beach would apply to Florida's other four appeal court
districts as well, but Franks said the Supreme Court's decision
erased all doubt.
   He said that under the decision, the 15-year-old girl can
legally go ahead with her abortion, if she has not already done so.
   Her lawyer, Jerri Blair of Leesburg, has repeatedly refused to
comment on whether the girl has had or plans to have the abortion,
citing her client's right to privacy. Blair did not return
telephone calls Monday.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, an abortion opponent, said he was
disappointed by the justices' decision. ``I would rather have (the
law) implemented and carried out as I have supported it in the
past,'' Martinez said.
   The girl is identifed in court records only as ``T.W., A
Minor.'' The justices ordered the case file sealed to ensure that
her identity remain a secret.
   The case began when T.W. sought consent from a judge to have an
abortion, telling him she feared physical and emotional abuse from
her parents if she sought permission from them.
   The judge said he was unable to deal with the law as written,
and the consent requirement subsequently was found
unconstitutionally vague by the 5th District Court.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, under fire for
allegedly using his position for personal gain, climbed out of debt
last year, according to a financial disclosure statement released
today.
   The forms showed that the Texas Democrat paid off debts of
between $105,000 and $200,000 and now has no liabilities, but his
assets also declined. He listed 1988 assets of $31,005 to $100,000
_ compared with between $155,000 and $435,000 the year before.
   Those figures do not fully reflect holdings placed in a blind
trust established by Wright in 1987.
   House members and senators must annually report their outside
income, including speaking fees _ known as honoraria _ gifts,
assets and liabilities. The reports of most of the 435 House
members were released today; the Senate's were released last Friday.
   The forms included those of two members of the House who had
previous careers in television comedies and a former baseball
player.
   Former actor Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual
income from the ``The Love Boat,'' a long-running series in which
he played Gopher, a skirt-chasing officer on a cruise ship.
   Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported only $11,212 in residuals. Jones
appeared on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former pitcher, got a $350
royalty check from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni
Association.
   Hank Brown, R-Colo., listed not only his own income but that of
his wife and three teen-age children. Christy Brown, 19, made
$1,600 working in another congressman's office and $295 for
babysitting and yard work. Her sister Lori, 17, worked in a movie
theater for $1,547 and earned $367 for babysitting and 19-year-old
Harry got $370 for yard work.
   Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned $5,000 for his jewelry
designs.
   Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the chief spokesman in Congress for the
elderly, and currently a patient at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, drew $14,916 in Social Security benefits.
   Speaker Wright has been charged with violating House ethics
rules for activities that include getting abnormally high royalties
from bulk sales of a book and for his financial relationship with
Fort Worth developer George Mallick.
   Wright reported no more book earnings last year, but he paid off
a note worth between $50,000 and $100,000 from Mallightco, Inc.,
the partnership he formed with Mallick.
   He listed owning less than $5,000 worth of stock in Jewell
Enterprises, a nursing home operation that also has drawn the
attention of the House ethics committee.
   Investments and $30,000 in speaking fees brought Wright's income
up to a range of $188,183 to $203,579, nearly doubling his
speaker's salary of $115,000. He reported receiving no gifts.
   Each member of Congress, except for the speaker and two leaders,
is paid $89,500 a year. House members are limited to earning an
additional 30 percent _ or $26,850 _ in honoraria. Many lawmakers
go over the limit, but donate any excess to charity.
   The amounts in the financial disclosure forms list only ranges.
For example, properties worth $52,000 and $98,000, respectively,
both would be listed in the ``D'' or $50,001-to-$100,000 range. An
asset worth millions would be listed simply as over $250,000.
   This tends to hide the true wealth of the individual, but it
represents a guide to sources of outside income, investments and
the like.
   Wright's chief vote-counter, House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., doubled his salary with $90,100 from 53 paid speeches. To
get under the House ceiling in honoraria, he gave $63,575 to
charity in 177 separate contributions.
   The House Republican leader, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois,
reported income of $165,865 to $180,864 and assets of $165,000 to
$400,000. He earned twice as much as Wright in speaking fees but
gave $30,900 out of the total $60,500 to charity to get under the
limit.
   Michel, an avid golfer, also managed to outfit himself for his
game by taking part in charity tournaments.
   His forms showed he received $250 in golf clothing and
accessories from the Bob Hope Desert Classic; $316 worth of
``carry-all, glasses, atlas, frame, calendar, golf clothing, and
golf balls'' from the Kemper Open; $250 in clothing and accessories
from the Jerry Ford Invitational; and $150 in golf-related gifts
from the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament, named for a
baseball player who died of cancer.
   Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Republican whip whose complaint
launched the ethics probe of Wright, accepted $28,550 in honoraria
and gave $1,750 to charity.
   A complaint is pending before the ethics committee against
Gingrich, charging that he violated House rules with a partnership
he formed in 1984 to promote his book ``Window of Opportunity.'' He
didn't report earning any royalties from the book last year.
   Gingrich was reimbursed for 11 trips on which he made speeches
to various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich that promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported income
of $134,250 to $138,250. Most of the excess over his $99,500
leadership salary came from making speeches. Foley listed nearly
two dozen stock transactions, but it appeared from the numbers that
he did little better than breaking even.
   Foley also accepted several trips, including one with his wife
to Hong Kong and Tokyo for a conference, with his plane fare and
his hotel accommodations paid for by the Japan Society in New York.
   Other members of Congress also took some exotic trips in 1988.
   Democrat J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., took a 13-day journey with his
wife to Australia and New Zealand with their expenses paid by
Qantas Airways and farm groups from the two countries.
   Elizabeth Patterson, D-S.C., received all expenses in connection
with a trip to Taiwan from the Chinese Culture University.
   Alex McMillan, R-N.C., diligently recorded gifts received in
five double-spaced pages.
   He included a 1988 season's pass to Grandfather Mountain, $4.95
in Irish Cream Mints from tobacco distributors, two green bagels
from a fellow congressman, three pairs of over-the-calf socks
valued at $13.50 and a copy of the book, ``Honest Graft,'' by
Brooks Jackson, which details Democratic campaign fundraising.
   Some House members were given extensions for filing their
disclosure forms and 21 were not available today.

   The poor man's hamburger will be honored
July 13-15 with the Second Annual Downtown Corinth Slugburger
Festival.
   The celebration pays tribute to Corinth's favorite delicacy, the
slug, a deep-fried patty made from a soybean and meat mixture. A
slugburger is most often served with onion, pickle and mustard.
   Last year, locals traced the history of the slugburger as far as
1918. That was the year meat market owner William R. McEwen and
restaurant proprietor John Weeks devised a recipe to use unsaleable
meat trimmings.
   Some of the athletic events scheduled last year were the
slug-on-a-spatula relay, the slug squash, the slug-toss, the
build-a-slug scavenger hunt and the slugburger eating contest. Most
of the events had to be canceled because of lack of interest.

   While students at century-old Slippery
Rock University treasure their school's funny name, university
officials say it can be a mixed blessing.
   Some students and faculty came to this state university, which
celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, because the quirky name
attracted their attention.
   ``It's a bizarre name,'' said Tracy Lancia, a freshman from
Acton, Mass., who said the name caught her eye on a computer
printout of schools with strong education programs. ``But if it
wasn't called this, I wouldn't be here.''
   Slippery Rock doesn't always conjure up images of lofty
scholarship, however.
   ``We're kind of like the advertising jingle where nine out of 10
people recognize the trade name but they can't tie it to the
product,'' said Charles Fouse, provost and vice president for
academic affairs.
   The university is battling an image as a party school after a
recent Playboy magazine labeled it that way.
   Sure, there are parties at Slippery Rock, about 50 miles north
of Pittsburgh, but they're no more frequent than at other
universities, a student said.
   ``It's just because of the name,'' said Danielle Lundy, 21, a
senior from Williamsport.
   The town's creek was named Slippery Rock after a colonial
soldier plunged into it when his horse slipped on a rock in 1779.
Later, when the existence of two neighboring towns called
Centerville caused a mix-up in postal deliveries, one was renamed
Slippery Rock. The town has a population of 2,000 today.
   The name later was passed on to the school.
   The name is what drew actor Martin Sheen to take a detour off
Interstate 79 last month to buy a few Slippery Rock T-shirts.
   Slippery Rock does a brisk business in T-shirts, according to
Tom McPherson, manager of the university's book store.
   ``I don't understand it,'' McPherson said. ``It's a common
(name) to us. But it's a fascination, a loyal following out there.
... There isn't a state in the United States where we haven't
shipped these things.''

   The youngest person ever to undergo four liver
transplants has celebrated her third birthday playing with a new
Barbie doll and swing set.
   ``There was a time when I didn't think we'd see her first
birthday, let alone her third,'' said Shirley LaRocco said of her
daughter, Meghann.
   ``But our prayers were answered, and now she's doing just
fine,'' she said. ``We're just so excited she's doing so well. This
is the first year she's known it's her birthday.''
   She said Meghann played with her gifts for most of the day
Sunday.
   Meghann was born with biliary atresia, a a fatal liver defect,
and complications necessitated the series of transplants in
November and December 1986.
   Chicagoans rushed donations to the family to help defray medical
costs. Officials of the University of Chicago Hospitals had
estimated the cost of Meghann's treatment at $500,000.
   Doctors estimate Meghann's chances for a full recovery at 80
percent to 85 percent. She no longer has to make regular visits to
the doctor but continues to take an anti-rejection drug,
cyclosporine, every day.
   ``She's just like any normal child now,'' said her father,
Frank. ``She's even taking roller-skating lessons.''

   People using wheelchairs can get on the Sixth

   There's a ramp leading onto the bridge from the city's North

in wheelchairs must either jump the curb or ride in traffic.
   City traffic engineers say they know of no safe solution,
because cutting into the curb could expose a structural beam.
   Larry N. Thomas of the Pittsburgh chapter of Open Doors for the
Handicapped said the matter is being considered by the mayor's
handicapped accessibility committee.
   ``Some people said it was the state's responsibility, some said
the county or the city. Now the city is saying, `It's our

said.

<HEAD>Farmers' Income Prospects Brightening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher-than-expected prices for crops and
livestock have boosted farmers' cash income prospects for 1989 by
at least $2 billion from the forecast of just a month ago, an
Agriculture Department economist said Monday.
   In revising the earlier prediction, Greg Hanson of the
department's Economic Research Service said figures for the fourth
quarter of 1988 showed that cash receipts for sales of major
commodities produced on the nation's farms ``were stronger than
forecast'' initially and that the momentum continued into the first
quarter of 1989.
   ``Our crop receipts are projected to set an all-time record in
1989,'' Hanson said in an interview. ``There has been price
strength in both crops and livestock.''
   The latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock at
around $81 billion, with sales of crops at $76 billion. But
expenses are rising, too, as farmers put more cropland back into
production, and direct federal payments to farmers decline.
   Nationally, including all farm-related cash receipts, the gross
cash income of farmers could be in the range of $168 billion to
$173 billion, compared with about $170 billion in 1988. Expenses
are forecast at $115 billion to $119 billion, compared with $113
billion last year.
   As a result, Hanson said, farmers this year could see net cash
income in the range of $50 billion to $55 billion. That would be
down from the 1988 record of $57.7 billion.
   Just a month ago, the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at
$48 billion to $52 billion.
   Net cash income is the annual difference between gross cash
income and cash operating expenses. As defined by the agency, it is
the amount of money farmers have available to pay debts, make
purchases and pay for family living expenses.
   As used by USDA economists, net cash income during a calendar
year can include proceeds from sales of crops produced in earlier
years. For example, one reason that 1988 net cash income reached a
high level _ besides rising commodity prices _ was that many
farmers raised cash by selling off grain held from past harvests.
In addition, many livestock producers culled herds because they
lacked the feed and needed the money.
   In another method of bookkeeping, the agency computes net farm
income, which is a calendar year measure of the net value of
agricultural production, whether sold or stored on the farm.
   Under this method, changes in inventory values are taken into
consideration, along with values assigned to ``non-money'' income
such as an allowance for a farm family's dwelling and other factors.
   According to USDA's latest projections for 1989, net farm income
could rebound to record level of $47 billion to $52 billion. Last
year, when inventories were drawn down sharply, net farm income was
about $41 billion, down from $46.3 billion in 1987.
   Hanson's comments followed an outlook report Friday in which
analysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are ``not much
changed'' from earlier forecasts, except that the weather has
shifted the distributions.
   ``Wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with large
carry-in stocks (inventories) will have higher incomes because
prices are up,'' the report said. ``But wheat producers who were
hit by the dry weather this winter and spring, and who lack stocks
or crop insurance, will sustain losses.''

   Iranian drug addicts who don't kick the
habit by July 23 will be rounded up and thrown into labor camps for
at least one year, Tehran TV reported Monday.
   The broadcast quoted the governor general of southeastern Kerman
province as telling a news conference that special segregated camps
for men and women have been built to rehabilitate addicts.
   Tehran Radio als reported that 15 convicted drug traffickers
were hanged Monday. That raised the number of smugglers executed in
the last 10 days to 94.
   Iranian authorities have executed more than 650 drug smugglers
and traffickers since a crackdown was launched in December.
   State-run TV did not identify the Kerman official, but he was
quoted as saying rehabilated addicts will be quarantined with their
families until they could be allowed back into society.
   He said reformed addicts would undergo regular medical
examinations to ensure they were drug-free, said the TV report,
monitored in Nicosia.
   Anyone who turned to drugs again would be returned to the camps,
the official said.
   The law mandates the death penalty for anyone possessing even
small quantities of drugs. More than 2,500 addicts have been
reported picked up since January.
   Unofficial reports estimate that 2 million of Iran's 50 million
people are involved in drug abuse.

<HEAD>More Than Enough Food For World's Hungry, U.N. Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The world produces more food than it needs
but neglect, complacency and incompetence have left at least half a
billion people hungry, participants in a U.N. conference on hunger
were told Monday.
   The World Food Council, a U.N. agency that deals with the
political aspects of food supplies, opened its 15th annual
conference with conflicting but generally grim assessments on the
state of hunger in the world.
   Council Chairman Eduardo Pesqueira of Mexico said ``peace is a
basic prerequisite'' to ending worldwide starvation.
   ``Wars in Central America and Africa make their scarce resources
go to arms rather than food programs. Detente is important for
developed and developing countries,'' he said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a statement
read at the opening of the conference, said hunger still can be
eliminated.
   ``Five years ago, the council noted that hunger ... was largely
a man-made phenomenon: human error or neglect created it, human
complacency perpetuated it and human resolve could eradicate it,''
the statement said. ``That is equally true today.''
   Pesqueira said comprehensive figures on world hunger are
difficult to determine. The conference heard widely divergent
figures.
   Youssef Wali, Egypt's deputy prime minister and minister of
agriculture, cited statistics that said 512 million people in the
world suffer from hunger, and that the figure is increasing
annually by 10 million people.
   But Ide Oumarou, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, said in a statement that 800 million people are
either temporarily or permanently hungry.
   He said the world produces 10 percent more food than it needs,
meaning the cause of hunger is ``a question of distribution and
imbalances created by international trade, not of shortage.''
   According to World Food Council reports, most malnourished
people live in Asia and Africa. Among seriously troubled countries,
it cited Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka in Asia and Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zaire, Tanzania, Kenya,
Uganda and Mozambique.
   Young children, pregnant and nursing women and the elderly are
the most vulnerable to hunger, the council says.
   It says malnutrition coupled with diarrhea and infectious
diseases kill an estimated 14 million children under age five every
year, and 83 percent of the malnourished people under five live in
Asia and about 12 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.
   The World Food Council urges help for poor countries to start
projects to become self-sufficient in food rather than depending
totally on deliveries of surplus food from richer countries.
   The 36-member council is to meet for four days, during which
delegates will tour projects north of Cairo where large sections of
desert are being reclaimed for agriculture.

<HEAD>Official Linked with Pair of Investigators Cleared of Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Communist Party official with links to two
controversial criminal investigators has been cleared of bribery
charges and released from custody, Tass said Monday.
   Viktor Smirnov, former second-ranking party official in the
Moldavian republic, was charged Jan. 11 with taking bribes.
   The weekly Moscow News said at the time that Smirnov had been
popular in Moldavia where he was sent in 1984 because of his
activity in an investigation that broke up a chain of corruption in
the republic of Uzbekistan.
   That investigation was led by Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov,
two investigators who tracked a chain of bribery and corruption
that led to Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former leader Leonid
I. Brezhnev.
   ``Today, the case against Smirnov was dropped due to the absence
of facts of the crime, and he was released from custody,'' Tass
said.
   It said prosecutors ``apologized to Smirnov for the serious
violations of socialist legality with regard to him on the part of
officials from the prosecutor's office.'' It did not identify the
officials responsible for arresting him.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov gained wide popularity in the Soviet Union
because of their investigation, and both won seats in the Congress
of People's Deputies parliament that meets for the first time
Thursday.
   But Ivanov has been sharply attacked by the Kremlin for saying
in a televised election debate May 12 that the name of Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev has come up in his corruption
investigation. The Soviet Supreme Court has ordered an
investigation of Gdlyan because of the jailing of a famous Estonian
scientist who died in prison and later was cleared of charges.
   A commission of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's highest executive body, on Friday reported systematic
violations of laws and ethics by Gdlyan and Ivanov, and turned
their findings over to the Soviet Procurator General's Office.
   Ligachev has denied any wrongdoing and demanded that results of
an investigation be made public. Tass said a statement of his about
the corruption investigation was read at Monday's meeting of the
party's policy-making Central Committee. It did not provide details.
   Moscow News on Jan. 22 said Smirnov was one of four delegates to
the Communist Party conference in June 1988 that Vitaly Korotich,
editor of Ogonyok, identified in a speech as having been implicated
in taking bribes.
   If true, that would mean that Smirnov was implicated by Gdlyan
and Ivanov, who wrote the article published by Korotich's magazine
alleging four unidentified delegates to the conference had taken
bribes.
   But Ogonyok itself later published the names of four Uzbek
officials that it said had been fired from party jobs or were being
prosecuted as a result of an investigation started after Korotich's
speech at the party conference.
   Smirnov resigned his job in Moldavia in 1988. Tass said fuller
information about his case would be published later.

<HEAD>Governor Urges DOE To Abandon Nevada As Dump Site</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nevada Gov. Bob Miller said his state won
federal assurance Monday that it will be allowed to independently
assess the suitability of Yucca Mountain as the nation's first
permanent dump for high-level nuclear waste.
   Miller and all four members of the Nevada congressional
delegation met with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins at
departmental headquarters to reiterate their opposition to having
the dump in their state.
   ``We went into the meeting as opponents of the repository being
in Nevada, and we left the meeting with the same opposition,''
Miller said in an interview.
   The department is scheduled to begin its own on-site feasibility
studies later this year. The dump, if Yucca Mountain is deemed a
suitable site, would open in 2003.
   Miller said Watkins pledged that Nevada would be given a full
opportunity to do its own studies of the site, about 100 miles
northwest of Las Vegas. Watkins also promised ``some additional
funding'' for the state studies, although exact amounts were not
discussed, Miller said.
   Christina Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said Watkins' office
had no comment on the meeting.
   Miller said Watkins had given his ``personal assurance that
Yucca Mountain was not a done deal,'' and that the department would
make a full and objective study of the site before deciding whether
it would be suitable for holding the waste.
   The dump is intended to entomb 70,000 tons of highly radioactive
waste from commercial reactors and from the Energy Department's
nuclear weapons plants. Numerous sites had been under consideration
early in the decade, but in 1987 Congress decreed that the search
would be limited to Yucca Mountain.
   Watkins earlier this month said that while he was legally
obligated to pursuing the Yucca Mountain program, he sympathized
with the Nevada government's misgivings.
   Miller said he and the Nevada congressonal delegation were
sending a letter to the state Senate expressing support for a bill
that would make it illegal to build a permanent nuclear waste dump
in Nevada. The bill passed the state Assembly earlier this year and
has not yet been acted on by the Senate.

<HEAD>Hospital Admissions For Cocaine on Rise, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Admissions to hospital emergency rooms for
cocaine-related abuses last year increased in 15 of 19 cities
surveyed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a congressional
panel said Monday.
   The leaders of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and
Control attributed this trend, in part, to ``a surge nationwide in
the supply and demand for crack,'' a cheap cocaine derivative.
   In a joint statement, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the
committee's chairman, and ranking Republican Lawrence Coughlin of
Pennsylvania also noted dramatic increases in marijuana emergency
room cases, with 16 of 19 cities reporting increases.
   ``This report documents the increasing seriousness of the drug
crisis,'' they said. ``Hospitals are facing a terrible public
health emergency because of drug-related cases. We have got to
develop a national strategy addressing supply and demand.''
   Emergency room admissions for cocaine abuse skyrocketed by 210
percent last year in New Orleans, and shot up by more than 100
percent in Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington.
   Admission rates also rose significantly in Atlanta; Boston;
Chicago; Detroit; Minneapolis; Newark, N.J.,; New Yor; Phoenix; San
Diego, and St. Louis. Record levels of admissions also were
reported for the states of Colorado and Texas, although no
statistics were available for individual cities in those states.
   Cocaine emergency room admissions fell in Miami and were stable
in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

<HEAD>Soviets to Reduce Number of Britons Allowed at Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union ordered the British to reduce
their Moscow employees by nearly half Monday in the latest
expulsion exchange. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the
Kremlin's actions showed that little had changed despite Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
total number of employees permitted at the British Embassy and
companies would be reduced from 375 to 205, the number of Soviets
permitted to work in Britain. Soviet embassies abroad do not have
non-Soviet employees.
   The latest diplomatic flap began Friday when Britain ordered
eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists out of the country on
grounds they were engaged in activities incompatible with their
status, a diplomatic phrase for spying.
   Moscow called the accusation ``groundless'' and retaliated by
ordering the same number of British diplomats and journalists to
leave.
   It is the largest British-Soviet expulsion exchange in four
years. In 1985, a total of 31 diplomats, journalists and other
representatives were sent home and, in 1971, Britain expelled 105
Soviets.
   Gerasimov said he did not know whether the reduction of 170
people could be accomplished by dismissing Soviet employees or
whether some accredited diplomats, journalists and businessmen
would have to be sent home.
   An embassy spokesman said about 150 accredited Britons work in
the Soviet Union, including 68 diplomats.
   Mrs. Thatcher said told the BBC Monday: ``We gave them the
chance and they have not taken it, and they have revealed their
true nature.''
   ``We had hoped that, with a new era dawning in relations, that
with the Soviet Union taking a different view on many things, that
they might have accepted (the expulsions) and not retaliated the
way they did.
   ``Were they going to show that things were different, or were
they going to prove by what they did that things really have not
changed much at all? They chose the latter.''
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, said Britain would
continue working for improved relations, but ``we shall not turn a
blind eye to unacceptable activity which threatens our national
security and so the safety of our citizens.''
   ``It is because of the continuance of this kind of conduct that
it is necessary for us to remain vigilant in all respects toward
the conduct of the Soviet Union,'' he told the House of Commons in
London.
   In October 1986, a similar action during an espionage dispute
stripped the U.S. Embassy of 260 Soviet employees. American
diplomats had to shovel snow, do their own cooking and otherwise
fend for themselves until the support employees could be replaced
by Westerners.
   The British spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he did not know how many Soviet citizens the embassy employed. He
said they handle such non-diplomatic jobs as driving and
translating.
   Gerasimov made his announcement at a news conference, where
British correspondents challenged accusations that three of their
number were spies.
   He set the tone of the meeting by saying: ``The Soviet side has
certain information that some U.K. employees in Moscow fulfill the
orders of secret services.''
   Quentin Peel, correspondent of the Financial Times, asked
Gerasimov whether he dared repeat the accusation directly to the
three correspondents. ``Are you prepared to accuse our colleagues
of spying, here in front of all their peers?'' he demanded.
   The ministry spokesman said only that the expulsion order was
prepared without his knowledge.
   In response to another question, Gerasimov said he agreed the
cutback could affect attempts to attract Western investment if it
includes employees of British-Soviet joint ventures.
   ``I will redirect that question to the people who have drawn up
this text,'' he said.
   British companies have formed at least 19 joint ventures with
Soviet enterprises, offering badly needed foreign currency,
management expertise and technology.
   Gerasimov did not say how long the reductions would take, who
would be affected or whether the cuts would be achieved through
attrition, expulsions or withdrawals of employees by government
order. The British spokesman said the embassy would have no comment
until those matters were clarified.
   The disagreement comes at a time of improved relations. Mrs.
Thatcher and Gorbachev have a good personal relationship and
Gorbachev received a warm greeting when he visited London early
this month.

<HEAD>S&amp;Ls' Securities Regulations Tightened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Monday announced new
regulations requiring savings institutions to meet more stringent
standards in documenting their securities activities, the latest in
a series of steps to tighten supervision of the troubled industry.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board issued amended regulations
requiring S&amp;Ls to report their securities transactions according to
generally accepted accounting principles and to clearly distinguish
between those securities held for sale, for trading and as
investments.
   Paul Lockwood, a spokesman for the bank board, said S&amp;Ls would
be able to conduct the same securities transactions as in the past,
``but they've got to account for (them) in a more realistic sense.''
   ``They've been lumping them all together, which makes it very
hard for auditors or for our own exam staff to get a handle on the
exact financial picture,'' Lockwood said. ``This is just one more
step of a series that we've taken to tighten up the supervision of
savings institutions.''
   A Bush administration proposal to restructure the industry and
rescue depositors with money in insolvent S&amp;Ls is working its way
through Congress.
   Brian Smith, director of regulatory affairs for the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions, said the bank board's new rules
``establish a much more stringent standard'' as to when S&amp;Ls can
value securities at their higher, historical costs versus market
value, which could be lower.
   S&amp;Ls would have to hold securities ``through thick or thin'' to
maturity in order to value them for accounting purposes at the
higher level, Smith said.
   The bank board's action requires an S&amp;L's board of directors to
adopt an investment policy on securities and to monitor the
institution's compliance with that strategy. Management, meanwhile,
will be responsible for carrying out securities transactions that
comply with the investment policies.
   Lockwood said the rules would help federal regulators assess the
financial status of S&amp;LS and help thrift managers ``have a better
handle on their own situation.''
   Smith said the new rules could reduce S&amp;Ls' flexibility in
deciding whether to sell off or hold on to securities. If
securities were classified as a long-term investment, institutions
wouldn't be able to switch course and ``just get rid of it if they
don't like it,'' he said.

   A convicted robber who escaped and created
a new life for herself during 10 years of freedom should be granted
a pardon because of her extraordinary success rehabilitating
herself, her attorney contends.
   The state Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services

Smith, who was recaptured because of a tip from her ex-husband,
would be the first inmate to be pardoned since at least the 1940s
for any reason other than terminal illness.
   In South Carolina, pardons can be granted only by a special
board, and before it will consider a hearing, five of the seven
members must vote to approve an investigation.
   ``It is very rare that inmates request pardon hearings,'' board
spokesman David Allen said.
   In 1975, Mrs. Smith, then known as Pamela Rodgers, was convicted
in South Carolina on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to
12 years in prison. She walked away from a work release program in
1978 and hitchhiked to Maryland.
   During the next decade, she earned her high school diploma,
overcame drug and alcohol abuse, married Ray Smith, raised a foster
child and two sons, and became a successful real estate agent.
   ``Her story is the most extraordinary story any of us has ever
heard about someone who has ever rehabilitated herself,'' said
Richard Harpootlian, her attorney in Columbia.
   ``Someone who was convicted of several armed robberies and a
drug problem, on the run took herself and pulled herself up by her
bootstraps to become a productive member of society.''
   Mrs. Smith's happy life ended in May 1988 when her previous
husband, convicted of murder in Idaho, tipped authorities to her
whereabouts. Mrs. Smith was returned to South Carolina to finish
her original prison sentence and one additional year for escape.
   Under an interstate agreement, Mrs. Smith was transferred last
fall to the Women's Correctional Institution in Jessup, Md., so she
could be closer to home.
   ``There's no reason for her being in there other than just
punishment,'' her husband said in a telephone interview from his
home in Severn, Md. ``She's made changes in her life, and it hasn't
cost anyone anything except her.''
   Smith, 40, said he and the couple's two teen-age sons from Mrs.
Smith's previous marriage would be at the hearing in Columbia.
   Mrs. Smith was unlikely to be allowed to attend because the
board did not request her presence, said her attorney in Baltimore,
John Hassett.
   Despite the lack of precedent, Hassett said he was optimistic.
   ``I spoke to her on Friday, and she and her family are also
extremely optimistic,'' he said. ``Dick Harpootlian and I both
believe we've put her case in the best possible posture for
consideration.''
   Should the pardon request be refused, Mrs. Smith will be
eligible for parole in April.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of workers cheered
opposition leaders who defied a government ban on demonstrations
and appeared Monday at factories to seek support for their claim to
the presidency.
   The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition of
their victory in the May 7 general election, shook hands and passed
out leaflets welcoming a delegation from the Organization of
American States due Tuesday.
   ``The OAS will not solve all our problems, but it will create
the environment. They have come to investigate,'' said presidential
candidate Guillermo Endara. Workers greeted him at factories in
Panama City with chants of ``Endara is my president!'' and
``Justice! Justice!''
   International observers say the opposition won the elections by
a 3-1 margin. The government and its de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, nullified the vote after it was apparent their
candidates were losing.
   Monday was the third straight day that Endara and his two vice
presidential candidates, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford,
defied the ban on demonstrations that will last until the OAS
delegation files its report June 5.
   The delegation is made up of the foreign ministers of Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, and OAS Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares.
   A pro-government party Monday criticized the OAS for adopting a
resolution condemning Noriega and said its delegation could not
mediate among Panamanians.
   ``We call on the OAS to adopt a virile attitude toward
aggression against our people by the United States,'' said a
statement issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party, the largest
pro-government group.
   After touring factories Monday, Endara said, ``We want a
transfer of power from the Defense Forces to a civilian
government.''
   Noriega holds power because he commands the Defense Forces. He
has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the United
States but says the charges are part of a U.S. plot to retain
control of the Panama Canal, due to be turned over to Panama at the
end of 1999.
   U.S. troops sent to augment security at U.S. canal installations
continued exercises Monday, including special jungle training and
live firing.
   On Monday the opposition candidates, pursued by a caravan of
journalists, left party headquarters without revealing their exact
destination.
   Ford said the opposition is not calling for large, announced
demonstrations in order to avoid ``butchery.''
   ``We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one by
one,'' Ford said after sharing a cup of coffee with a few workers.
   Panama has a population of about 2.5 million.
   On May 10, paramilitary Noriega supporters attacked opposition
candidates, leaving a bodyguard dead and Endara and Ford bloodied.
   Crowds were small but enthusiastic Monday. At a Panama Beer
brewery, workers came running from the far ends of the plant.
   At one stop the candidates put on work gloves and gathered
around a grinding machine that Endara, an enthusiastic campaigner,
adjusted without being entirely certain of the results.
   By the end of the trip to a dozen factories, including such
U.S.-associated plants as Coca-Cola, General Mills and
Colgate-Palmolive, Endara's collar was covered with lipstick.
   Only a few police officers were visible as the caravan wound
through a Panama City industrial park. Most officers were directing
traffic.
   Since the May 10 attack the government has sharply reduced
police presence, emboldening opponents despite a general strike
that fizzled last week.
   At a Kraft cheese plant, one worker snatched a leaflet from
another and said, ``That's not for toads to read.''
   Members of the government's extensive network of informers are
called ``toads.'' The man who had been called a toad retreated.

   A retired police sergeant, who never
fired his gun during 26 years on the force, fatally shot an
intruder during a struggle in his home, authorities said.
   Earle Wolthausen, 76, drew his gun only once while with the Long
Beach Police Department.
   Sheriff's deputies said a man crashed his car into a garden wall
about a quarter-mile from Wolthausen's home Sunday morning. The man
walked past several homes and smashed Wolthausen's front window,
falling inside.
   The retired officer tried to restrain the struggling intruder
but couldn't. ``I was getting weaker and he was getting stronger,''
said Wolthausen, who retired in 1968 and has a heart condition.
   He called for his wife to bring him his gun and then had to
struggle with the intruder for control of it. Wolthausen wrestled
the weapon free and shot the intruder in the head. The dead man was
not immediately identified.

   Question: What's 3{ feet long, weighs 35
pounds and lives on 5 pounds of smelt a day, plus nearly $5,000
worth of assorted exotic saltwater fish? Answer: The grouper that
ate Terry Haley's pet store aquarium.
   ``Day after day he got progressively larger and our inventory of
fish got progressively lower,'' said Haley, owner of Terry's
Aquarium &amp; Pet Center.
   The spotted jewfish, a type of grouper, was purchased for $150
and arrived at a petite one foot long and 3 pounds just 18 months
ago. It was caught off the Florida Keys.
   Haley put it in the store's 1,100-gallon saltwater show tank,
which once contained about 75 fish.
   Groupers are known to prey on smaller fish, but Haley thought he
could control what it ate by hand feeding it.
   That didn't work.
   ``He's eaten everything in the aquarium,'' Haley said Monday
from his store in this southern Chicago suburb. ``That's about
$3,000 to $5,000 worth of fish.''
   It's also the last straw for Haley, who said he plans to ship
the fish back to its native environment, where it can swim for its
own supper.
   The fish is fed 5 pounds of smelt a day, but the list of its a
la carte snacks from among its tank-mates is impressive.
   In the last six months, the grouper ate a clown trigger fish
worth $600, two imperator angels worth about $250 each, two queen
angels worth $150 each, one blue racer worth $50, and 50 yellow
tangs worth $20 each.
   Haley said he gave little thought to placing the expensive clown
trigger in the tank because groupers have not been known to include
them in their diet. But it didn't stop the grouper, which experts
say can grow to as much as 8 feet.
   ``It's in there for a day and turns into food,'' he said.
   Thinking a swift fish would be safe from the lumbering grouper's
jaws, Haley placed a 12-inch blue racer in the tank.
   ``The racer was in there about a month,'' he said. ``The grouper
just lay there and waited. It raced too slow one day and he was
gone.''
   In fact, the grouper has devoured everything except a couple of
6-foot moray eels and a nurse shark. But not for lack of trying.
   ``We came in one morning and it had the shark in its mouth about
halfway down,'' he said. ``We beat him with a broom handle and he
spit him out.''
   Haley bought the fish from Noyes Marine Life, an aquarium
supplier in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and plans to return it to the sea
off that city on July 5. The fish will be flown to Florida and
released by divers, he said, adding that he doesn't know yet how
much that will cost.
   Haley offered the grouper to zoos and the Shedd Aquarium in
Chicago, but they said there was no room. The owners of a nearby
restaurant had another idea.
   ``They'd put their hands up to the tank and measure him and
smile,'' he said. ``They were really eying him up, but I can't
imagine anybody having our fish for dinner.''

   BEIJING _ More than 100 top military leaders vowed to refrain
from entering Beijing to confront or suppress the masses of
citizens who have seized control of the capital to demand
democratic reforms. The promise, in a letter to the People's Daily,
was a serious blow to Prime Minister Li Peng and other hardliners
who have tried to quell the demonstrations.

<NOTE>CLASH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   BEIJING _ Witnesses said soldiers with sticks and belts clashed
with crowds about 15 miles southwest of Tiananmen Square in an
apparently isolated incident whose cause was unclear. The clash,
which began late Monday and ended about 1 a.m. Tuesday (noon EDT
Monday), reportedly injured about 15 people. Tens of thousands of
students continued their peaceful occupation in Tiananmen Square in
defiance of martial law.

<TEXT>
   God's Little one-sixty-ninth of an Acre is now
available to sun-loving city-slickers for $38,682. The catch: it's
a slab of rooftop.
   ``The idea developed out of my own observation of the
marketplace and the general high demand for outside space that most
apartment buyers prefer,'' said Sheldon Stein, vice president of
Jacob Holm Inc., a development company.
   Stein decided to divide the roof of a Greenwich Village building
into 14 patio spaces and sell them to people who first buy a one-to
four-room apartment in the building for $130,000 to $212,000.
   ``New York, unlike most cities, has few park spaces or open
areas. And apartments are smaller, which makes New Yorkers desire a
little more freedom,'' he said Monday.
   Escape to this roof to view the Hudson River to the west,
midtown Manhattan to the north and Wall Street to the south. This
building is a story or two taller than its neighbors and zoning
restrictions have kept skyscrapers at bay.
   On the roof, $12,894 plus a monthly maintenance of $42.84 gets
you 235 square feet of tar beach with lights and running water,
enclosed by a 6-foot-high fence.
   Big spenders can pay $38,682 for 625 square feet, or just over
1-69th of an acre, with a maintenance charge of $128.52 _ 60
percent tax deductible.
   A 10-foot-wide common area will be decorated with plants.
   ``We wanted to give it a feeling of graciousness, so that people
weren't being corralled,'' said Stein.
   Security will be provided so that no one steals lawn chairs or
exercise bicycles.
   ``One guy may have dinner there, another may have a garden and
one may fly a kite,'' said Stein. ``On the issue of barbecuing,
we'd rather not discuss it. Technically, it's primarily for
sunbathing.''
   The management company has just started advertising the
apartments. The 300 people who called last weekend were told about
the added incentive of a rooftop co-op, and some of them seemed
interested, said Stein.
   In a city where parking spaces and yacht slips already are sold
for hefty prices, is there any limit to the type of property that
can turn co-op?
   ``I'm a real estate man _ that's a broad question,'' said Stein,
who once dreamed that co-op car ownership would be ``the way to
go.''

   Rep. Tony Coelho, the House Democratic whip,
supplemented his salary by giving speeches and collecting rent on
property in California, his financial disclosure forms showed
Monday.
   The lawmaker's income ranged from $123,525 to $136,025 in 1988.
   His base salary was $89,500, boosted by rents of $5,000 to
$15,000, honoraria after charitable donations of $26,525 and
interest from a federal credit union of $2,500 to $5,000.
   Coelho, whose personal finances have recently drawn public
attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986
financial disclosure form, put most of his assets in a qualified
blind trust in June 1988.
   At the time, the California Democrat's holdings were worth
$65,000 to $150,000, with the largest investment _ a rental duplex
in Merced, Calif., _ valued at $50,000 to $150,000.
   The assets that Coelho kept out of the blind trust include
another rental property in Merced, valued at $50,000 to $100,000,
and savings accounts, money market accounts and individual
retirements accounts worth $25,000 to $80,000.
   Coelho listed no purchases or sale of property, stocks or bonds
in 1988, but he did refinance his principal residence in the
Virginia suburbs.
   That arrangement allowed him in October to pay off loans of
$80,000 to $200,000, the forms show. Coelho satisfied a commercial
loan of $50,000 to $100,000 from Federal City National Bank, a
$15,000 to $50,000 line of credit from Security Pacific National
Bank and the same line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank.
   Coelho also sent his trustee, I. Barry Mehler, a check for
$60,000 for inclusion in his blind trust last November, according
to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure. He did not
say where the money came from; his aides said they would ask.
   Excluding his blind trust, Coelho was left with one liability, a
50,000 to $100,000 mortgage on his Merced rental house from the
Tracy Savings and Loan institution.
   Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, lawmakers are not
required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their
principal residence.
   Another exemption is details of a spouse's income. Coelho's
wife, Phyllis, works as an assistant to Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind.
   Coelho, a top fund-raiser for the Democratic Party and former
head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an
active speaker on the lecture circuit last year, collecting
honoraria of $90,100. He gave $63,575 to charity, keeping $26,525,
a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed.
   Among those who gave Coelho $2,000 for speaking was Drexel
Burnham Lambert, a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for
Coelho to fly from Iowa to Los Angeles.
   The Washington Post has reported that Coehlo had not listed on
his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy $100,000 in
high-yield Drexel Burnham junk bonds. Coelho blamed the omission of
an oversight by his California accountant.
   Coelho, a member of the House agriculture committee, accepted
speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential
business before the panel.
   They included the California Grocers Association, the American
Horse Council, The Fertilizer Institute and the Connell Rice and
Sugar Co.
   Coelho did a fair amount of traveling at other people's expense
to give speeches in 1988. Sometimes, the destinations were resorts.
But the only overseas trip was five days he spent in Israel on a
trip paid for by Project Interchange.
   The congressman and his wife spent two nights at Marco Island,
Fla., paid for by Puccio and Associates; he visited Palm Springs,
Calif., two times at the invitation of the Mexican-American Grocers
Association and the Tobacco Institute, and spent three days in
Yosemite National Park on a fact-finding trip paid for by the
Yosemite Park and Curry Co.
   Coelho, who suffers from epilepsy, traveled to New York once and
California three times for The Epilesy Foundation of America. He
also visited Texas, California and New York for the ``Tony Coelho
`Yes I Can' Disability Foundation.''

<HEAD>White House Makes Rare Statement Seeking Lower-Value Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House tried to talk down the value
of the dollar Monday, coupling a rare public statement on the
subject with apparent Federal Reserve action in an effort to head
off further foreign trade problems.
   There was no indication of much quick impact, analysts said.
   The White House statement, read by deputy press secretary Roman
Popadiuk, said, ``If the dollar's recent rise against other major
currencies is sustained for a prolonged period, or extended, it
could undermine international efforts to reduce global trade
imbalances.''
   The statement, marking the first time the White House has
commented directly on the dollar since President Bush took office,
was accompanied by a new Federal Reserve selloff of dollars in
international currency markets, traders and analysts said.
   And it followed hectic trading in European markets, with the
Federal Reserve and the central banks of Japan, West Germany,
Britain and other major European allies reportedly selling millions
of dollars in an attempt to break the currency's surge.
   A high value for the dollar makes imported goods less expensive
in the United States and U.S. products more expensive abroad,
aggravating the U.S. trade deficit. The recent rebound of the
dollar's value abroad could undo recent improvements in the
nation's trade accounts, economists suggested.
   Despite massive intervention by central banks, particularly the
Bank of Japan, the value of the dollar abroad has continued to
surge in recent weeks.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc.,
said the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, began selling off
dollars ``about the time of the (White House) statement. It was
calculated to have a combined impact. Unfortunately, the market is
shrugging it off.''
   The Federal Reserve does not comment publicly on its buying and
selling activities in financial markets.
   The White House statement said the climbing dollar ``is a matter
of concern'' that ``has also prompted questioning of the
administration's commitment to the process of economic policy
coordination'' among the Group of Seven major industrial
democracies.
   ``This administration remains fully committed to this process,''
the statement continued.
   It referred to a pact among United States, Britain, Japan,
France, West Germany, Italy and Canada, to take steps to coordinate
their economic policies _ including interest rate changes and
direct intervention in exchange markets _ to keep major currencies
stable.
   Popadiuk declined to elaborate on the statement, saying it spoke
for itself. ``The president and the secretary of the treasury
remain the administration's sole spokesmen on the dollar and
exchange rate policy,'' he said.
   The White House statement said, ``We will continue our efforts
to strengthen underlying policies that promote the adjustment of
external imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as
agreed in the April 7 G-7 communique.''
   The statement, couched in the language of international finance,
amounted to a public assertion that the Bush administration
supported additional intervention by central banks to break the
dollar's rise.
   Since the White House usually does not make such comments, the
statement appeared designed largely for its psychological impact on
traders, analysts suggested.
   ``The dollar is getting out of hand, so they had to do
something. But they're going to have to back it up with action, to
spend billions to move dollars around,'' said Michael K. Evans,
president of Evans Economics, a Washington-based consulting firm.
   Even an increase in a key interest rate last month by West
Germany's central bank _ a move that would usually help weaken the
dollar _ failed to have much impact on the dollar's rise.
   Higher interest rates abroad and lower interest rates in the
United States should also help to drive down the dollar.
   Monday's statement thus re-inforces previous administration
efforts to prod the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates.
   The dollar steadied at higher levels in Europe on Monday, but
dealers said that heavy, repeated central bank intervention had had
little impact.
   The dollar pushed through the two-West German mark level early
in the European day, for the first time since December 1986.
   International finance sources have said that level and one of
140 yen to the dollar are the upper thresholds in exchange-rate
ranges agreed to privately by the seven industrial democracies.
   The rise in the dollar above that threshold apparently helped to
trigger Monday's White House statement.

<HEAD>Campus Survey Finds Higher Rate of AIDS Infection than Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students are testing positive for the
AIDS virus more frequently than expected, but at a lower rate than
the population as a whole, researchers said Monday.
   A survey by the American College Health Association and the
Centers for Disease Control showed that 30 of the 16,861 students
who sought medical attention in their campus health centers tested
positive for the AIDS virus, for a rate of 0.2 percent.
   Nationwide, researchers believe 1 million to 1.5 million people
are infected, a rate of 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent.
   The study is the nation's first survey attempting to determine
the prevalence of AIDS among college students.
   The testing was done anonymously, and results were not broken
out for the 19 campuses selected to represent a cross section of
higher education in the United States
   Of the 30 students who tested HIV positive, all but two were
male. Officials did not release the gender breakdown of those
tested.
   No student tested positive at 10 of the schools, while five of
the schools had rates of 0.4 percent or higher. The highest campus
rate was 0.9 percent.
   Richard Keeling, director of student health services at the
University of Virginia and president of the American College Health
Association, said the 0.2 percent rate is higher than health
officials had projected. They had expected it would have been
closer to the rate for military recruits.
   Keeling said his advice to college students is that
``uninformed, unprotected, unsober sexual activity is highly
risky.''
   His message to the campuses is that they must be more aggressive
about AIDS education, working with students in small groups and
asking sensitive questions like: ``What do you say to him when he
says he won't wear a condom?''
   He said college health services must start offering more HIV
services, including testing and care for those who test positive,
including close medical surveillance of their immune systems. A
majority of college health services do not provide testing for HIV
infection and only a small number offer anonymous testing, he said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,
fatal disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. Spread
through contact with blood and semen of infected people, its chief
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. A
small percentage of cases have been caused by transfusions of
contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected
pregnant women to their offspring.
   The survey was restricted to students who had routine blood
tests done at their student health centers, and Keeling said it was
not clear to researchers whether the sample may be overestimating
or underestimating the prevalence of the disease on the campuses.
   Helene Gayle, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease
Control who worked on the survey, said it is intended to give an
indication of the magnitude of the AIDS problem on college campuses
and is not an exact figure.
   The association said it will continue the study during the next
academic year and wants include several more schools, including
historically black institutions and some with predominantly
Hispanic students.
   The schools included in the survey were:
   Central Missouri State University-Warrensburg; Emory University,
Atlanta; Mississippi State University-Starkville; Northwestern
University, Evanston, Ill.; Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
N.J.; San Diego State University; Southern Illinois
University-Carbondale; University of California-Berkeley.
   University of Colorado-Boulder; University of
Connecticut-Storrs; University of Georgia-Athens; University of
Kansas-Lawrence; University of Maryland-Baltimore County and
College Park;
   University of Massachusetts-Amherst; University of New
Hampshire-Durham; University of Southern California-Los Angeles;
University of Texas-Austin and University of Washington-Seattle.

<HEAD>Research Says New Approach May Eliminate Mastectomy for Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By shrinking tumors with medicine before
surgery, doctors may be able to eliminate most mastectomies as the
standard treatment for breast cancer, a leading cancer researcher
said Monday.
   Dr. Gianni Bonadonna of the National Cancer Institute of Italy
said his study showed that the new approach could eliminate the
need for mastectomies in 87 percent of women who otherwise would
have had this mutilating surgery.
   In recent years, doctors have slowly switched to removing just
the lump, not the whole breast, when the tumor is small. However,
this conservative surgery is not usually considered possible when
tumors are large.
   The latest strategy involves shrinking big tumors first with
chemotherapy so they are small enough to be taken out with a
breast-saving operation called a lumpectomy, which generally leaves
about three-quarters of the breast intact. The chemotherapy is the
same as that commonly used after surgery.
   The procedure was outlined by Bonadonna at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   Bonadonna predicted that by 1994, the 100th anniversary of the
radical mastectomy, this common operation ``will be very, very
rare.''
   Surgeons frequently recommend against trying to spare breasts
containing larger tumors because too little healthy tissue is left
to save and because they fear the cancer will be more likely to
spread to other parts of the body.
   So far, Bonadonna and colleagues in Italy have used the new
procedure on 97 patients beginning in January 1988. Although none
of their cancers have returned, other experts caution that much
longer follow-up will be necessary to know whether this approach is
as good as mastectomies at saving lives.
   Despite recent studies showing that for small tumors, at least,
breast-sparing surgery appears to be safe, some physicians remain
skeptical.
   ``I think there is still a lot of place for mastectomy,''
because the chances of cure may be better, commented Dr. Hendre
Falkson of the University of Pretoria in South Africa.
   While cautious, some other physicians said they found
Bonadonna's findings intriguing.
   ``This challenges the conventional treatment,'' said Dr. Nikolay
Dimitrov of Michigan State University. ``It may provide a
revolutionary change in the treatment of breast cancer.''
   Added Dr. Jules Harris of Rush Cancer in Chicago: ``I think it's
interesting and exciting and will give rise to a great deal of
clinical investigation.''
   Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer of women in the
United States. The disease strikes one in 10 women at some time
during their lives and caused 42,000 deaths last year.
   In Bonadonna's study, chemotherapy was given to women whose
breast tumors were bigger than three centimeters, or just over one
inch. The drugs could bring them down below three centimeters in 87
percent of the women.
   The largest tumor was over four inches across and was shrunken
small enough so doctors could perform a lumpectomy. The average
size of the tumors before treatment was two inches.
   After the operations, the doctors treated the women with
radiation therapy and additional chemotherapy.

<HEAD>Forest Officials Hope Dogs Can Control Grizzlies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Shoshone National Forest are
trying to find ways to teach grizzly bears to avoid humans and plan
to see if a Russian breed of dog used by bear hunters will do the
trick.
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologists have been
experimenting with bear aversion techniques in recent years, and
this year will continue testing a ``thumper gun'' that fires
plastic bullets to see if that will teach grizzlies to avoid people.
   But recently U.S. Forest Service officials received permission
to see if Russian bear dogs, a breed rare in this country, can be
used to scare off bears.
   The Russian hounds were not available in the past because
neither the Soviet Union nor Finland, where they are trained to
hold a bear at bay until a hunter arrives, would export the
animals. But Soviet restrictions have been loosened under the
glasnost campaign, and some of the dogs have found their way to the
United States.
   Monte Barker, a Forest Service wildlife biologist, said the dogs
now in this country haven't been trained as bear dogs, but he's
confident they could be.
   The small, quick dogs have been used primarily for bear hunting
and protection in the Soviet Union, where they are trained with
European brown bears, he said.
   The dogs' characteristics include fearlessness, courageousness,
speed, and a highly-developed sense of smell.
   ``Near as I can tell, it has the best nose of any dog there
is,'' Barker said.
   A proposal approved by the Management Subcommittee of the
Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee calls for Barker to collect
information on the dogs and try to get owners to bring the animals
to the Shoshone forest.

   Police teams worked Monday to recover the
bodies of six U.S. narcotics employees and three Peruvians killed
in a weekend plane crash in the Andes, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said there was no
indication of what caused the crash Saturday that killed all
aboard, but he discounted sabotage because of tight security
controls.
   The bodies were brought down to Vichaycocha, a remote village on
the arid western slopes of the Andes, said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Charles Loveridge. Peruvian military helicopters carrying U.S.
personnel were meeting them there.
   The single-engine Cessna Caravan crashed Saturday afternoon
against a 15,000-foot-high peak in the Andes, 65 miles northeast of
Lima by air.
   The plane, owned by the U.S. State Department's International
Narcotics Matters Bureau, was en route to Lima from the jungle town
of Tingo Maria, 240 miles northeast of the capital.
   Officials said the three Peruvians were Hugo Samanez, director
of a U.S.-funded coca eradication program; a police captain and the
8-year-old son of a police commander.
   Loveridge said the dead Americans included an agent with the
Drug Enforcement Agency, two helicopter pilots, a helicopter
mechanic, the plane's pilot and a security expert contracted by the
State Department.
   In Washington Maurice Hill, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, identified the DEA agent as Rick
Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky.
   Loveridge identified the other Americans as John Knapp, the
plane's pilot; Billy McDonald and Dennis Eisler, helicopter pilots;
John Van Zandt, a helicopter mechanic, and Clyde Bayless, a
security expert contracted by the State Department.
   He said he had no hometowns or ages for the five.
   U.S. teams also are investigating the crash, the first incident
in which American narcotics agents were reported killed in Peru in
the campaign against cocaine trafficking.
   Tingo Maria is 240 miles northeast of the capital in the lush
Upper Huallaga river valley, a rain-drenched region on the eastern
slopes of the Andes that is the world's greatest source of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The U.S. government has assigned several dozen agents to work
with Peruvian anti-drug police in campaigns against narcotics
traffickers in the violent region.
   The fanatical, Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group
controls much of the valley and works hand in hand with drug
traffickers, police and U.S. officials say.

<HEAD>India Joins Small Group of Nations with Ballistic Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India launched on Monday a rocket named
Agni, the Sanskrit word for fire, and became only the seventh
nation to develop a ballistic missile of its own.
   The missile has a range of more than 1,500 miles, enough to
reach targets as far away as Iran in the west, Hong Kong in the
east, China to the north and islands around the equator to the
south, Western military officials said.
   It can also hit any target in neighboring Pakistan, with whom
India has fought three wars since they became independent of
Britain in 1947.
   Military officials reached by telephone said the missile was
launched Monday at Chandipur, 750 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   By successfully firing the missile, India joined the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, China, France and Israel in
developing its own such weapon.
   Monday's test was for a range up to about 620 miles, the
military officials said on condition of anonymity. One said the
guiding system, not the range, was the most implortant factor in
the test.
   ``Agni is not a weapons system,'' Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
said in a statement. ``However, the technologies proved in Agni are
deeply significant for evolving national security options.''
   He said the missile accurately followed a predetermined flight
path and ``fully met the objectives we had set for it.'' He did not
say how far the rocket traveled.
   It was the third attempt to launch the Agni missile. The first
launch date, April 20, was set back by problems with the ignition
system. A second date, May 1, was scrubbed because of an error in a
subsystem.
   Western military experts said the 1-ton payload capability means
the 7.5-ton Agni could carry a nuclear warhead, but Gandhi denied
the possibility was being considered.
   ``What Agni does is to afford us the option of developing the
ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons with high precision at long
ranges,'' he said. ``This provides us with a viable non-nuclear
option of the greatest relevance to contemporary strategic
doctrines.''
   Defense experts say a sophisticated guiding system would not be
needed for the missile to deliver a nuclear charge.
   ``You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a
conventional warhead,'' a Western analyst said privately, ``but if
you are using a nuclear warhead the exact target does not matter. I
am not saying that the Indians are going to use a nuclear warhead,
but the question is why not?''
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and Western nuclear
experts believe its scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in a
week.
   The government says its nuclear program is for such nonmilitary
purposes as power generation, and firing the missile was only a
``demonstration of the country's capabilities.''
   Agni is the fourth missile India has developed since 1983. Three
surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles with ranges of 20 to
about 150 miles also have been test-fired.

<TEXT>
   World tea production last year climbed to a
record 2.42 million metric tons, up 3 percent from 1987, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The bumper harvest resulted from favorable growing conditions
and new plantings coming into production in several countries, the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report.
   Larger crops were reported for India, Sri Lanka, China, Kenya
and Malawi. Tea output in Mozambique and Uganda remained at low
levels, ``reflecting unstable political and economic conditions,''
the report said.
   Further, tea production in some areas of the Soviet Union
continue to be affected by the 1986 a Chernobyl nuclear plant
accident, the report said. Consequently, the Soviets have had to
increase imports to meet domestic requirements.
   U.S. tea imports in 1988 increased 16 percent to 90,144 tons
valued at $129 million. Even so, last year's increase to replenish
inventories left 1988 total tea imports slightly below the 1986
level of 90,549 tons valued at $133.6 million, the report said.
   ``Preliminary data indicate that U.S. retail food store tea
sales continued to fall in 1988 as consumers showed their
preference for soft drinks, fruit juices and alcoholic beverages,''
the report said. ``However, sales of herbal teas were higher after
showing signs of topping-out over the past several years.''

<TEXT>
   James Griffin announced his candidacy
Monday for a fourth term as Buffalo mayor in typical fashion for
the maverick Democrat _ saying he'd seek the nomination of the
Republican Party.
   Griffin, who twice before has been defeated in Democratic
mayoral primaries, said it didn't matter how he got re-elected.
   ``If it goes like last time, fine,'' Griffin said. ``The people,
they make the decision, not the parties.''
   In 1985, Griffin lost in the Democratic primary, then switched
affiliations and won re-election to a third term on the GOP and
Conservative tickets.
   In 1977, Griffin lost the Democratic primary and won on the
Conservative ticket.
   State Assemblyman William Hoyt is the endorsed candidate for
mayor of the Democratic and Liberal parties. He could have as many
as four challengers in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary _ Griffin,
state Sen. Tony Masiello, former Chief City Judge Wilbur Trammell
and City Comptroller Robert Whelan.
   Griffin, 59, is expected to receive the endorsement of the
Republican Party sometime this week. The Conservative Party, which
supported him in his three previous campaigns, is expected to
endorse him Tuesday.
   Griffin said Monday that when he became mayor in 1977 Buffalo
was ``on the verge of bankruptcy.''
   He said its downtown was a disaster, unemployment rampant and
its housing decayed.
   ``Today the city has been brought back to life,'' he said,
noting numerous development projects, such as a new transit system,
minor league baseball stadium and waterfront projects.
   The mayor said 23,000 jobs had been ``saved or created'' and
that unemployment has fallen to 5 percent from 15 percent.

<TEXT>
   Federal parks along America's seashores are
facing environmental threats ranging from oil spills to the
increasing use of all-terrain recreational vehicles, the Wilderness
Society said Monday in a report on 31 coastal parks.
   The conservation group noted the devastation of federal park
beaches from the oil spill in Alaska, but said other coastal parks
also ``are fending off a distressing variety of threats that
eventually may overwhelm them.''
   Among the problems facing these parklands are:
   _Tons of garbage and other ocean debris washing ashore on
federal searshores and parks each year, including medical wastes
and unmarked chemical drums.
   _Pressure for offshore oil development near the federal land.
   _Wastewater pollution from nearby agriculture or urban
development.
   _The increasing use by park visitors of all-terrain vehicles
that damages dunes and wildlife habitat.
   _Developers who aggressively are buying private parcels of land
within some of the parks, while the government is unable to compete
for the parcels because of budget constraints.
   The report by the conservation group said there are no signs the
problems facing the coastal parks will ease.
   ``Tomorrow the problems facing our coastal parks will be more
serious than they are today'' unless additional measures are taken
to better protect these stretches of federal seashore, the
Wilderness Society report said.
   The coastal parks and seashore areas examined were Acadia in
Maine; Aniakchak, Bering Land Bridge, Cape Krusenstern, Glacier
Bay, Katmai, Lake Clark and Kenai Fjords in Alaska; Everglades,
Biscayne, Canaveral, Fort Jefferson and Timucuan in Florida;
   Assateague Island in Maryland-Virginia; Cape Cod in
Massachusetts; Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout in North Carolina;
Cumberland Island in Georgia; Fire Island in New York; Gateway in
New Jersy-New York;
   Gulf Island in Mississippi-Florida; Hawaii Volcanoes in Hawaii;
Olympic in Washington; Padre Island in Texas; Virgin Islands
National Park; Golden Gate, Channel Islands, Gateway, Redwood,
Point Reyes, Santa Monica Mountains, all in California.

<HEAD>1956 Revolt Leaders `Martyrs,' Should Be Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's foreign minister on Monday
said Imre Nagy and ``fellow martyrs'' who led the failed 1956
revolt against Stalinism were victims of show trials.
   Another senior communist urged the political and legal
rehabilitation of Nagy and his associates, captured and executed in
1958 after Soviet tanks and troops violently crushed the
short-lived 1956 revolt.
   The statements reflected growing demands for Nagy's
rehabilitation before June 16, the 31st anniversary of his
execution, and public questioning of the role of former leader
Janos Kadar in Nagy's demise.
   The state news agency MTI quoted Foreign Minister Gyula Horn as
saying Monday that it can ``be unequivocally stated that former
premier Imre Nagy and his fellow martyrs became the victims of
politically inspired show trials.''
   His statement before about 400 communists and non-party members
at a meeting in the northeastern city of Eger followed a weekend
demand from 400 communist reformers for Nagy to be rehabilitated
politically.
   Central Committee secretary Matyas Szueros was quoted Monday in
the communist party daily Nepszabadsag as saying ``we definitely
have to come to terms with the meaning of 1956 and the role of Imre
Nagy'' and his associates.
   ``There is a need for their political and legal rehabilitation,
as well as for the reinstatement of their human dignity,'' Szueros
was quoted as saying on Italian television Saturday night.
   A government commission is investigating the trial of Nagy and
other revolt leaders, who may be legally rehabilitated when the
probe is completed. Political rehabilitation would require the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' (communist) Party to revise its
official version of Hungary's history.
   Kadar, 76, has come under increasing fire since losing the party
leadership a year ago Monday. This month, the party's Central
Committee stripped him of his last political posts and said serious
mistakes had been committed in his 32-year rule.
   Kadar came to power at the end of the revolt, when Nagy and
leading associates were captured and imprisoned. They were executed
after summary trials in June 1958 on charges of counterrevolution.
   Previously buried in unmarked graves in a remote corner of a
Budapest cemetery, they are to be reburied at a June 16 ceremony
expected to draw tens of thousands of sympathizers and to be
broadcast live on Hungarian state television.

   A deal allowing a private ski resort to
cross the Appalachian Trail was improperly struck, three
environmental groups charged in a lawsuit filed Monday.
   The National Park Service in January approved an easement to let
the Killington Ski Area cut trees from a 200-foot corridor across a
1.2 mile stretch of the trail and cross it twice with ski runs.
   The park service also waived its right to review future
development by the resort at Mendon, the Appalachian Trail
Conference, Sierra Club and Vermont Natural Resources Council said
in their U.S. District Court lawsuit.
   The National Park Service and Interior Department were named in
the lawsuit. The park service and Killington officials have said
the easement was granted properly.
   ``Such wide-ranging development in the corridor of the
2,000-mile trail, much less waiver of future review of adjacent
development, has never been permitted in more than 1,750 other
negotiations with landowners from Maine to Georgia,'' the
environmental groups said in a statement.
   Environmentalists and Vermont's congressional delegation asked
the Interior Department in January how the Killington deal was
struck.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has charged that the park service
ignored staff recommendations and decided the easements on
political grounds.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian was killed Monday by a rock
Israelis flung at his car, and gunmen attacked Israeli police in
the West Bank and soldiers who were hitchhiking in the Negev Desert.
   The Palestinian's death was the first reported since residents
of southern Israel began stoning Arab-owned cars after a soldier
was found killed in the area two weeks ago. Police blame
Palestinians for the soldier's death.
   At least 497 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising that
began more than 17 months ago in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Twenty-two Israelis also have been slain.
   Concern grew over Palestinian threats to increase the level of
violence and start using guns in the uprising, coupled with the
army's discovery of an arms cache in the Gaza Strip.
   Palestinian farmers in Gaza said soldiers bulldozed about 20
acres of Arab orchards and seized the land to build what appears to
be a military road along the territory's eastern border with Israel.
   Hashem Abba Shawa, head of the local Citrus Producers' Union,
said he complained to military authorities and requested
compensation for eight families. Army spokesman said they were
checking the report.
   In Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops wounded seven
Palestinians with gunfire and shot seven others with rubber-coated
steel pellets in clashes with stone throwers, Arab doctors said.
   Among those injured by the pellets were six women aged from 12
to 55, they said.
   The stoning victim was identified only as a 42-year-old man from
Dura, near Hebron in the West Bank. He was hit by a rock apparently
thrown from a passing car near the coastal city of Ashkelon, police
spokesman Eli Elimelech said.
   Nili Nir, spokeswoman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon, said
the man was dead of a head wound when he arrived.
   An army spokesman said no one was injured in Monday's shooting
attacks on Israeli police in Bethlehem and soldiers in the Negev
Desert.
   West Bank police spokesman Mordechai Baraket said unidentified
gunmen fired three pistol shots at police near Manger Square. One
shot hit the policmen's vehicle, he said, but no one was injured
and police arrested four suspects.
   In Navatim, five miles south of Beersheba, an assailant driving
a truck with Israeli license plates fired with an automatic weapon
at three soldiers waiting at a hitchhiking spot, Israeli radio
reports said.
   Army radio said the soldiers ran into a field and the gunman
fled. The soldiers were quoted as saying they thought the attacker
was an Arab.
   Police sealed the area, searched with a helicopter and
surveillance plane, and arrested dozens of Arab suspects, the radio
said. It said all were released after questioning.
   The arms cache, discovered during a six-day curfew in the Gaza
Strip, included 18 weapons, pistols, U.S.-made and Soviet automatic
rifles, Israeli submachine guns and Swedish Karl Gustav rifles, an
army announcement said.
   It was found during the roundup last week of of 250 activists of
the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas (Zeal).
   ``We are trying to detain as many Hamas activists as possible,''
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an Israel television
interview from the United States. In Gaza, he said, Hamas ``is more
than anything else responsible for crimes against the Palestinians
and the Israelis.''
   Itim, the Israeli news agency, quoted military officials as
saying a senior Hamas leader in the West Bank, Sheik Bassam Jarar,
was detained several days ago in Gaza, a Hamas stronghold.
   Hamas issued a statement in Nicosia, Cyprus, urging Arab nations
to ``open their borders to all those who want to fight against
Israel,'' Israel radio reported.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said Palestinians had
increased the use of firearms and noted that leaflets being
distributed by the Palestine Liberation Organization threaten to
kill an Israeli for every Palestinian who dies in the uprising.
   ``We are seeing more use of firearms generally. We see it as a
grave development,'' Gissin said in an interview.
   He added, however, that it was too early to tell whether
underground leaders of the rebellion were changing their policy
against the use of firearms.
   An Israeli paratrooper force raided the West Bank village of
Batir on Monday and arrested about 20 Palestinian suspects.
   Israel television showed blindfolded and handcuffed Arabs
sitting in a schoolroom. A Palestinian flag was painted on the wall.

   The Agriculture Department said Monday that it
will crackdown on the testing and detention of ready-to-eat meat
and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by the
bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said the new policy will take effect as soon as
the revised testing procedures are ready in about six weeks.
   Crawford said that on April 14 the Centers for Disease Control
``confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the United
States caused by meat or poultry.'' The case involved a nationwide
recall of turkey franks made by Plantation Foods Inc., Waco, Texas.
   ``We have responded by intensifying our sampling and compliance
policy to ensure that ready-to-eat products contaminated with
Listeria monocytogenes do not reach consumers,'' Crawford said.
   Under the Listeria monitoring program, the agency will increase
the number of samples tested each year. Other procedures are being
put into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reach
consumers until the problem has been protected, he said.
   Listeria is difficult to control because it can grow slowly on
foods under refrigeration, Crawford said. The bacteria have the
potential to cause serious illness, particularly among those with
weakened immune systems such as infants, pregnant women, the
elderly and the chronically ill.
   However, he said, healthy people are ``essentially at little
risk'' from the disease, which can cause flu-like symptoms,
including fever, chills, headaches and sometimes abdominal pain and
diarrhea.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday said the United
States won't consider improving relations with Cuba unless it makes
democratic reforms and frees political prisoners.
   Bush called on Cuban President Fidel Castro to reject the Soviet
military presence, hold a national plebiscite, free all political
prisoners, allow free emigration and grant unrestricted access to
international human rights monitoring groups.
   ``I am unalterably committed to a free, united and democratic
Cuba and I will never falter in that support,'' Bush said in
remarks before a group brought to the White House to recognize the
Cuban holiday celebrating independence from Spain.
   He accused Castro of squelching basic rights, such as freedom of
religion, assembly and speech.
   ``In response, our demand is plain and simple. Democracy and
respect for human rights, not sometimes, not someday, but now.''
   Bush said Castro should ``free all political prisoners and to
conform to accepted international standards regarding human rights.
I challenge him to allow unrestricted access to the United Nations
and other organizations monitoring their compliance, and a policy
of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states.''
   Bush's tone contrasted with the restraint he has used in talking
about the pro-democracy demonstrations rocking China.
   In his speech, Bush mentioned China in passing, saying ``It is
important that the people of Cuba know the truth, and we will see
that the people of Cuba do know the truth about their dicator and
about the world...''
   ``And totalitarian systems everywhere are feeling new pressures
from the people. You see it today on the televisions sets coming
out of China. We've seen the those beginnings of it in the Soviet
Union and many, many other countries around the world.''
   Bush said he was challenging Castro ``to take concrete and
specific steps leading to free and fair elections and full
democracy. A useful first step would be to accept a proposed
plebiscite in Cuba.''
   Havana has not responded to international calls for a plebiscite
in which the Cuban people could vote for or against the communist
government that was installed when the Castro-led revolution came
to power in 1959.
   ``This I pledge,'' Bush said, ``Unless Fidel Castro is willing
to change his policies and behavior, we will maintain our present
policy toward Cuba.
   Bush referred to speculation that the change in administrations
in Washington this year might be an opening for a more relaxed
attitude toward Cuba after the long chill in relations.
   ``Knock off this wild speculation as just that _ some suggesting
that our administration is going to unitlaterally shift things with
Fidel Castro. I am not going to do that,'' Bush said.
   Bush said U.S. opposition to Cuba's re-entry into the
Organization of AMerican States would continue unless Castro
changed his policies. And he vowed to continue beaming radio
broadcasts into Cuba via the U.S.-government Radio Marti.
   ``In short, what we want to do is to advance that day when Cuban
independence day achieves a new and a richer meaning, freedom from
the evil of tyranny and oppression, freedom from the economic
misery wrought by the communist rule,'' he said.
   In February, a United Nations team that visited Cuba last
September reported on allegations of human rights abuses, which the
government denied.
   The investigating team said it received more than 1,600 human
rights complaints from Cuban prisoners, including 137 of torture,
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

<HEAD>British Envoy Pleads For Release Of Missing Briton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Ambassador Allan Ramsay appealed
on television Monday for the release of 75-year-old Briton Jack
Mann, a World War II pilot believed kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut
10 days ago.
   ``My government does not make deals with hostage-holders,''
Ramsay said, speaking in Arabic over the Christian-run Lebanese
Broadcasting Corp. network.
   ``There must be something wrong with the mentality of those who
kidnap an old gentleman of 75 years of age to accomplish certain
objectives,'' he said.
   ``There's no way any gains would be won from such an abduction.''
   Mann disappeared May 13 and a group calling itself the Cells of
Armed Struggle later claimed it had kidnapped an unidentified
Briton.
   Ramsay indicated he believed the Briton held was Mann, who has
lived in west Beirut with his wife Sunny for more than 40 years.
   The Cells of Armed Struggle demanded release of unidentified
prisoners it claims are held in Britain in connection with the 1987
murder of leftist Palestinian cartoonist Naji Ali in London.
Scotland Yard said no one was detained or charged with the slaying.
   Ramsay said Mann and all other foreign hostages held in Lebanon
should be freed unconditionally. Besides Mann, 17 others are
missing _ nine Americans, three other Britons, two West Germans, an
Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Pope John Paul II meanwhile appealed in a letter to 16 heads of
state and the U.N. secretary-general for steps ``to prevent the
destruction that threatens Lebanon,'' the Vatican said Monday.
   The pope said the violence wracking Lebanon was ``linked to the
intervention of armed forces of neighboring countries,'' and ``was
the responsibility of the entire international society.''
   He did not mention specific countries, but among heads of state
receiving the letter were leaders of Syria and Israel, who have had
forces in Lebanon.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived Monday and received a warm embrace from Morocco's King
Hassan II that ended the Arab League's 10-year ostracism of Cairo.
   The 22-member league holds a special summit starting Tuesday,
and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi hinted that he dropped his plans to
boycott the meeting despite his opposition to Mubarak's presence.
   His statement came after he met with other Arab leaders in
Tripoli on Monday.
   As a 21-gun salute boomed, Hassan, wearing a traditional white
djellaba cloak and red fez, hugged Mubarak, who wore a Western
business suit.
   Although differences remain over Lebanon, Palestine and other
issues, Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali called Egypt's
readmission ``an important historic event ... that will boost Arab
solidarity.''
   Egypt's membership was suspended in 1979 after the late
President Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David peace accords with
Israel.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, said
Gadhafi reached agreement with the leaders of Algeria, Syria and
Tunisia to oppose ``any concession at the Arab summit and to
boycott it if there was any hint of recognizing Israel.''
   Algeria's Chadli Bendjedid, Syria's Hafez Assad, and Tunisia's
Zine Abidine Ben Ali _ flew to Tripoli early Monday to persuade
Gadhafi to change his mind about skipping the meeting.
   Later Monday, Gadhafi flew to the western Algerian city of Oran,
where he was to meet again Tuesday with the three presidents,
Libyan television reported. It was not clear whether the summit
would be delayed by Gadhafi's meetings Tuesday.
   The Lebanese chair may stay vacant because of the dispute
between Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun and Moslem acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss. Their governments have been competing for
legitimacy since September, when Parliament failed to elect a
successor to President Amin Gemayel.
   A ministerial subcommittee on Lebanon met Sunday and Monday but
failed to resolve the bitter quarrel.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, initially insisted only
Hoss attend. Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival and Aoun's only
outspoken Arab backer, threatened to walk out if only Hoss were
invited, a conference source said.
   The source said Syria and Iraq ``reluctantly agreed'' the summit
should ask both men to express their views, but neither would be
considered the official representative of Lebanon.
   A second ministerial subcommittee met to consider rival working
papers on the Palestinian issue submitted by Syria and Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation.
   The PLO paper complained Arab states have failed to pay promised
donations of a one-time lump sum of $128 million followed by $43
million a month to support the uprising in Israeli-occupied
territory.
   A PLO spokesman said only Saudi Arabia and Libya have paid a
total of $52 million. He said a possible cause was Arafat's
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.
   The preparatory committee agreed to a compromise between the PLO
and Syrian positions drafted by Egypt. It was the first substantive
Egyptian contribution to the Arab League since 1979.

the stricken areas.
   The action makes federal funds and low-cost loans available to
residents of Ouachita Parish affected by the storms, which began on
May 5.
   The White House statement said the Federal Emergency Management
Agency might make other parishes eligible for help after damage
surveys are completed.
   Robert D. Broussard, director of FEMA's regional office in
Texas, was named to coordinate federal recovery operations in the
area.
   Assistance can include temporary housing, loans, grants, and
other programs to help individuals and business owners.

<TEXT>
   Ending the dispute between the United
States and West Germany over short-range nuclear weapons depends on
the timing of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the devices, officials
said Monday.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear warheads are deployed in West
Germany, and West Germany has been insisting on prompt superpower
talks on the weapons.
   The United States has taken the stand that such talks cannot
begin until the Soviets make substantial reductions in conventional
weapons in Europe.
   Diplomatic sources in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said both sides ``have a along way to go'' in resolving the
conflict before a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit opens
May 29.
   ``Progress has already been made because the United States is no
longer rejecting outright the notion of the talks,'' one source
said. ``We still have to work out the timing of when talks should
begin.''
   He said West Germany seeks a compromise with language making it
clear that the talks would begin ``within the foreseeable future
and not next century.''
   That is in line with West Germany's position that progress in
conventional-arms negotiations with the Soviets in Vienna should
lead quickly to talks on the short-range nuclear devices.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said Monday discussions
with the United States are centered on conditions for the beginning
of such talks.
   A U.S. compromise accepting the talks in principle is coupled
with a demand that West Germany drop its insistence on ``prompt''
talks.
   Klein was asked about that and he said the word ``prompt'' ``can
have a broad interpretation.'' He declined to elaborate.
   He said Chancellor Helmut sent a letter to President Bush on
Monday outlining the West German position on Washington's
compromise proposal, but he declined to give details of the
letter's contents.
   He said Kohl would telephone Bush Tuesday for further
consultations.
   U.S. officials say that as part of a compromise Washington would
agree in principle to short-range weapons negotiations at some
point linked to progress in the Vienna talks.

<TEXT>
   About 6,000 people gathered at a
memorial in Cambodia's capital to observe an annual ``Day of Hate''
marking the mass killings of the former Khmer Rouge government, the
Vietnam News Agency said.
   The ceremony took place Saturday at the 129-foot-high Buddhist
shrine in Phnom Penh's Cheung Ek district, where the Khmer Rouge
executed 20,000 people, the report said. The report was dated
Sunday and seen in Bangkok Monday.
   It said hundreds of Buddhist monks, Cambodians living overseas
and foreign diplomats attended the ceremony. Vice Premier Chea Soth
said in a speech that any settlement of the Cambodian conflict must
guarantee the Khmer Rouge do not return to power.
   The report said people laid wreaths at Toul Sleng Museum of
Genocide, an old school building the Khmer Rouge used as a torture
chamber.
   The Khmer Rouge overthrew the U.S.-backed government of Lon Nol
in April 1975. The fanatical communists then tried to fashion a
primitive agrarian society by moving people into slave labor camps.
More than a million died.
   Vietnam invaded in late 1978, drove the Khmer Rouge to the Thai
border and installed another communist government in Phnom Penh.
The Khmer Rouge is the strongest of three guerrilla groups fighting
the Vietnamese, whose announced total pullout by Sept. 30 triggered
fears of a Khmer Rouge return.
   Disagreement over the future role of the Khmer Rouge has stalled
talks between Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the main non-communist
guerrilla leader, and Hun Sen, prime minister of the Phnom Penh
government.
   According to a Vietnam News Agency account monitored Monday, Hun
Sen told the president of the non-aligned movement, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe, in a message last week that he would let
the Khmer Rouge run in a general election only as a political
party, with no military force.

<TEXT>
   Conservatives opposed to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's choice of a deputy attorney general are trying to
scuttle the nomination before it is sent to the Senate by President
Bush.
   The conservative Washington Legal Foundation has distributed
press packets containing material critical of Robert B. Fiske Jr.
as part of an effort to persuade Bush not to nominate the New York
attorney for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department.
   Fiske, a moderate Republican who once chaired the American Bar
Association's judicial screening panel, is accused by conservatives
of trying to thwart many of former President Reagan's appointees to
the federal bench.
   Representatives of various conservative organizations, such as
the American Conservative Union and the Free Congress Foundation,
have privately urged Bush administration officials not to send the
nomination to the Senate.
   ``I can't see how conservatives can do anything but be in
opposition to him becoming deputy attorney general,'' said Patrick
McGuigan, a scholar at the Free Congress Foundation.
   The conservative interest groups have enlisted support from Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee
who has expressed misgivings about Fiske.
   On Monday, Humphrey wrote Bush to question Fiske's party
loyalty, citing the $1,000 that Fiske donated to a Democrat who ran
unsuccessfully last year for senator from Vermont.
   Humphrey, who released copies of his letter to Bush, wrote that
the $1,000 donation to the campaign of Democrat William Gray showed
that ``Fiske is not truly committed to the goals of a Republican
administration.''
   The donation ``raises profound questions about Mr. Fiske's
commitment to the Republican platform and your own judicial
philosophy,'' Humphrey said.
   In his letter, Humphrey said his concerns were shared by ``other
Republican members of the Judiciary Committee.''
   McGuigan said he has had numerous conversations with officials
at the White House and the Justice Department expressing
conservative opposition to Fiske.
   ``There can be no doubt in the minds of the White house and the
Department of Justice as to where its normal allies stand on the
Fiske nomination,'' McGuigan said.
   David Runkel, the attorney general's press secretary, said
Fiske's donation to Gray's campaign was based on personal
friendship, not politics.
   ``This guy is a personal friend, he served as U.S. attorney in
Vermont the same time Bob was U.S. attorney in Manhattan,'' Runkel
said.
   Meanwhile, the man Fiske wants to replace, Deputy Attorney
General Harold G. Christensen, will leave his job on June 1, the
department said.
   Christensen, who took office last fall following his
confirmation by the Senate, will return to private legal practice
in Salt Lake City, the department said.

<HEAD>Ethiopia's Police Stop Student Demonstration</HEAD>

   Ethiopian police stopped students from
demonstrating in the streets and sealed off both campuses of the
University of Addis Ababa, residents and diplomatic sources
reported.
   The attempted demonstration came three days after President
Mengistu Haile Mariam's government crushed a coup led by senior
generals, including the armed forces chief of staff and commander
of the air force.
   A diplomat in the Ethiopian capital said by telephone: ``The
students gathered inside the campus, but when they tried to go into
the streets armed police pushed them back. All the workers were
ordered off the campuses and police remained at the gates.''
   He said there were conflicting reports about the purpose of the
demonstration.
   ``The students were singing. Some people say they had demands to
present to the government. Others say they were supporting last
week's coup attempt. I am not sure which. I don't speak Amharic,''
Ethiopia's official language.
   A Western diplomat, also speaking on condtiion of anonymity,
said details of the demonstration by a few hundred students were
sketchy, but that some carried banners critical of Mengistu.
   He said there were reports that police beat students with
truncheons and some injured ones were taken to the hospital.
   An Addis Ababa resident told The Associated Press both campuses
were quiet in the afternoon, and Ethiopia's official media had not
mentioned the confrontation by 7 p.m.
   Last week's coup attempt began Tuesday afternoon, a few hours
after Mengistu left for a visit to East Germany. It was crushed
Friday with the surrender of the 150,000-man 2nd Army in Asmara,
capital of northern Eritrea province.
   The government has not mentioned casualties and has announced
only the deaths of three generals: Merid Negussie, chief of staff;
Amha Desta, air force commander, and Denissie Bulto, 2nd Army
commander.
   Initially, the government said they were killed by soldiers
loyal to the government. Mengistu, who hurried home Wednesday
night, told a weekend rally in Addis Ababa they committed suicide
rather than surrender.
   Mengistu also indicated the generals were unhappy with the
government's conduct of the wars with rebels in Eritrea and in
Tigre province, and with his Marxist rule.
   ``There were often cases when our forces were whistled back when
they appeared to be on the brink of victory,'' he declared.
   Unitersity students demonstrated frequently against Emperor
Haile Selassie before Mengistu and fellow officers seized power in
1974.

<HEAD>Most House Members Earn Money Outside Jobs, Disclosure Forms Show</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Wright blind trust and reworks in top 17 grafs,
picking up in 15th graf pvs, House Majority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of House members boosted their income
last year with speaking fees, investments and money from such other
sources as jewelry making and TV residuals, disclosure forms showed
Monday. House Speaker Jim Wright paid off at least $105,000 in debt
but may have had to dig into personal assets to do it.
   The most common addition to congressional pay was in fat fees
from interest groups in exchange for giving speeches.
   Almost all House members have outside investments, some
substantial.
   Some earn money from previous careers _ including pensions.
   Some moonlight.
   For example, Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Northern
Cheyenne Indian, earned $5,000 last year for his jewelry designs.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former National Basketball
Association player, received deferred income totaling $45,000 from
the Washington Bullets and Atlanta Hawks. He also reported $10,000
in income for renting space and equipment to his re-election
campaign.
   The disclosure forms filed annually by all 535 members of the
House and Senate provide a look at Congress' outside income and the
wealth _ or lack thereof _ of each member. Each form lists a
member's money received, his assets and liabilities.
   The Senate reports were released last Friday.
   House members are limited to earning an additional 30 percent _
or $26,850 _ in honoraria for appearances. Most lawmakers donate
anything over that to charity.
   The forms do not provide precise data on congressional income,
listing only ranges. For example, properties worth $52,000 and
$98,000, respectively, both would be listed in the
$50,001-to-$100,000 range. An asset worth millions could be listed
simply as more than $250,000 unless a member chose to spell it out.
   This often shrouds the true wealth of an individual member but
does provide a guide to where that lawmaker derives investment and
other income.
   Wright, who has been under investigation for allegations that he
used his leadership position for financial gain, got out of debt in
1988, according to his disclosure statement.
   His debt: Somewhere between $105,000 and $200,000 was paid off,
leaving Wright with no financial liabilities.
   His assets: Somewhere between $31,005 to $100,000, compared with
a range of $155,000 to $435,000 in 1987. But the current accounting
does not include holdings in the blind trust he established in 1987.
   House members' homes also needn't be listed.
   The financial disclosure statements show that honoraria _
generally fees for outside speeches _ were an important part of the
incomes of many of the 435 House members, supplementing a federal
salary which in most cases comes to $89,500.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the third-ranking
House Democrat, doubled his salary last year with $90,100 from 53
paid speeches. To get under the House ceiling in honoraria, he gave
$63,575 to charity in 177 separate donations.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois reported income
of $165,865 to $180,864 and assets of $165,000 to $400,000. He
earned twice the $30,000 Wright earned in speaking fees, giving
$30,900 out of the total $60,500 to charity.
   Michel listed some of the side benefits of taking part in
charity golf tournaments: $966 worth of golf clothing and
paraphernalia from the Bob Hope Desert Classic, the Kemper Open,
the Jerry Ford Invitational and others.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported income
of $134,250 to $138,250. Most of the excess over his $99,500
leadership salary came from fees for speeches.
   Foley was among many House members who accepted trips. The Japan
Society in New York picked up the air fare and hotel tab for travel
to Hong Kong and Tokyo to attend a conference.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who said his
assets are no more than $45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988
from his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   A complaint is pending before the House ethics committee in
connection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote the
book.
   Gingrich's expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches to
various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   Here is how some lawmakers _ including two former actors and a
major league pitcher _ added to their congressional incomes in 1988:
   _ Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual income from
the ``The Love Boat,'' the long-running series in which he played
Gopher.
   _ Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported $11,212 in residuals. Jones
appeared on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   _ Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., a former pitcher, got a $350 royalty
check from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association.
   _ Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., was reimbursed by a variety
of groups last year for two sweeps across Africa and trips to
Israel, Japan, Korea, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.
Expenses also were paid for seven trips inside the United States.
   While 1988 was a story of income enhanced for many House
members, some did less well.
   Rep. Barton Jennings Gordon, D-Tenn., lost nearly $68,000 when
his investment in a trust fell from 118,355 to $50,461. ``A
partnership trust that he was in went bankrupt,'' said spokesman
Harrison Wadsworth.
   The disclosure forms call for listing gifts valued at $100 or
more.
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind., listed as gifts ``zero things and
zero money.''
   Among Jacobs' assets: A Great Dane, ``Friend,'' housebroken and
listed as priceless and a cocker spaniel, ``Annie,'' not completely
housebroken and listed as a current liability.

<HEAD>Parliament Debates Bill On Letting Blacks Join Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators opened debate Monday
on a bill to let blacks serve in the Cabinet while remaining
excluded from Parliament.
   The government says the aim is to bring a black into the Cabinet
for the first time, possibly as minister or deputy minister in
charge of black education.
   The governing National Party supports the bill but parties to
its left and right oppose it. The measure would allow the president
to appoint people to the Cabinet even if they were not members of
Parliament.
   Parliament includes a chamber for Asians, a chamber for people
of mixed-race, and the dominant white chamber. The black majority
has no formal role in national affairs.
   The Rev. Allan Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race chamber,
said during Monday's debate that he knew of no prominent black
leaders who supported the bill and described the government move as
``tokenism.''

<HEAD>Thailand Complains Burmese Troops Enter Thailand Pursuing Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand complained to Burma on Monday
about a large-scale incursion of Burmese troops who were attacking
Karen rebels, the government spokesman said.
   Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops trying to attack
the rebels from the rear intruded into northern Tak province
Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai border police found
the bodies of six Burmese soldiers after pushing the intruders back
with artillery fire, officials said Monday.
   Government spokesman Suvit Yodmanee said Director General Thep
Devakul of the Foreign Ministry's political department summoned
Burmese Ambassador Nyunt Swe and lodged a protest.
   He said Thailand demanded compensation.
   ``So long as they stay inside their borders we consider that a
Burmese affair. Once they come into Thailand, it is our policy to
drive anybody back, Karens or Burmese,'' Suvit said.
   The military government in Rangoon last year killed hundreds of
Burmese in crushing a popular uprising for democracy and vowed to
destroy the Karens, an ethnic rebel group that has fought for 40
years for greater autonomy.
   Thailand said Burmese soldiers over the weekend intruded into
Ban Wangkaew village of Mae Sot district, about 235 miles north of
Bangkok, and attacked the rebel camp of Kaw Moo Ra, which is
separated from Thailand by the Moei River.
   Thai officers said the soldiers were driven back before dawn
Sunday. They said six bodies were found.
   Karen sources claimed 60 to 65 Burmese soldiers were killed in
fighting Saturday and many wounded. Five rebels were killed and 11
wounded, they claimed. One Burmese student fighting alongside the
rebels was killed and another wounded, they said.
   Government forces began their attack on Ko Moo Ra on Thursday,
after overrunning the major rebel stronghold of Wangkha two days
earlier.
   Rebel officials say the loss of five key border crossings since
the Burmese intensified their offensive last October has severely
disrupted the black market trade that has sustained their
insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Jim Wright's financial disclosure
statement, released on the eve of a crucial hearing into his
alleged rules violations, touches only lightly if at all on money
deals that led the ethics committee to charge the House speaker.
   Mallightco, the investment partnership that sparked many of the
69 ethics charges against the Texas Democat, is mentioned but once
_ in the liabilities section with the notation that a loan was
``satisfied during 1988.''
   Wright made no mention of royalties from his book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man.'' The ethics committee has accused Wright of a
``scheme to evade'' outside income limits by selling the book
previously.
   There is one brief mention of Jewell Enterprises, a company that
went under after disastrous nursing home investments, causing
Wright and other investors a substantial loss. The speaker listed
stock in the bankrupt company as an asset worth less than $5,000.''
   The ethics committee was scheduled to hold an unusual televised
hearing on Tuesday on Wright's longshot motion to dismiss the most
serious charges against him, as the speaker sought a badly needed
victory to counter a losing public relations battle.
   Stephen Susman, a hard-nosed Houston lawyer brought in this
month to bolster Wright's legal defense, will take the lead role in
the hearing and spent Monday preparing his case. Susman is expected
to argue that the ethics committee stretched House rules beyond
their intended meaning when it charged Wright with 69 violations.
   The panel's special outside counsel, Richard J. Phelan of
Chicago, will defend the committee's interpretation of the rules. A
ruling on the motion to dismiss charges was expected later this
week.
   Wright, who has often owed substantial amounts, used 1988 to
work his way out of debt _ listing no liabilities at yearend,
according to the statement released Monday along with those of
other House members.
   His income was between $188,183 and $203,579 and his assets
ranged from $31,005-$100,000. These figures, however, do not
include holdings in a blind trust established by Wright in 1987.
Those figures were not available.
   Wright paid off debts totaling between $105,000 and $220,000,
including money he owed to Mallightco and a bank. The special
counsel to the ethics committee said Wright satisfied these notes
with money he made from his share of an oil and gas investment that
is still under investigation by the panel.
   The speaker earned $170,000 as his share of the deal, his most
profitable financial transaction. Mallightco bought and later sold
its interest in the prospective Sabine Lake oil and gas well along
the Texas-Louisiana line. The well turned up dry. There was no
trace of the deal on the disclosure form.
   Mallightco was owned by Wright, his wife, Betty, their partner
George Mallick, and Mallick's wife _ until the speaker pulled out
of the partnership last year. The ethics committee said there was
``reason to believe'' Wright received gifts from Mallick who,
according to the panel, had a direct interest in legislation.
   The disclosure showed Wright received between $5,001 and $15,000
in oil and gas royalties from Southeastern Resources in 1988.
   As in previous years, he held 57 acres of land in Van Buren,
Ark., valued at $5,001-$15,000, and real estate in Prince Georges
County, Md., worth between $15,001 and $50,000.
   Wright's use of the Sabine Lake profits to satisfy his debts
left him with fewer assets than a decade ago. The speaker's 1978
disclosure form showed holdings of between $72,000 and $170,000.
   Meanwhile, Wright's defense against the ethics charges will be
that the rules were changed in midstream.
   Wright's lawyers are expected to argue Tuesday that the two most
serious sets of charges should be dismissed because the panel,
reacting to a new moral climate, has stretched the rules beyond
their original intent.
   But his lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied, and
they give the speaker less than an even chance of winning a
preemptive dismissal of the charges.

   Recent heavy rain in the region made rivers rise across eastern
Oklahoma, southern Missouri and sections of Arkansas. The North
Canadian River at Woodward, Okla., was almost 2 feet above flood
stage, the weather service said.
   A cold front moving across the northern Plains triggered strong
thunderstorms over eastern North Dakota with locally heavy rain and
hail.
   Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico generated thunderstorms
across southern Mississippi, eastern Tennessee, northwestern
Georgia, and from northeastern Florida to eastern North Carolina.
   Scattered showers fell over the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Redmond, Ore., and Oak Harbor, Wash., to 100 at Midland,

eastern half of the Ohio Valley and the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast, and from central Nebraska across Iowa to the upper
Great Lakes. Scattered showers were forecast over the northern and
central Pacific Coast and inland to the northern Rockies, and over
northern Maine.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted from the northern and
central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies; in the 90s across
Florida, the Gulf Coast, much of the central and southern Plains,
the southern Rockies and interior Southern California; between 100

and generally in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>50 Go On Hunger Strike in Belgrade, 2,000 Protest in Bosnia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50 villagers from Bosnia have
gone on a hunger strike in front of the federal Parliament in the
capital to protest harassment by police and communist authorities,
an activist said Monday.
   Also Monday, 80 workers at a food-processing company in Bosnia
said they were fasting, and about 2,000 others protested to demand
back the jobs and pay they lost because of a huge financial
scandal, the official Tanjug news agency reported. Bosnia is one of
Yugoslavia's six republics.
   The group from the Bosnian village of Mosevac began their hunger
strike Saturday demanding the release of local youth activist Hasan
Delic, who was arrested May 13, said activist Dzevad Galijasevic.
   The official youth organization headed by Galijasevic and Delic
claimed three years ago that the local communist leadership was
rife with corruption and political nepotism in Mosevac, about 180
miles west of Belgrade.
   The group accused local county and police officials of
misappropriating funds collected for building Mosevac's public hall.
   The protesters on Monday also demanded the resignation of the
Bosnian police chief, Muhamed Besic, and a meeting with members of
the federal government to air their grievances.
   In the Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, Agrokomerc workers
demanded that all factories resume normal production that was
disrupted since the food-processing company was found to have
issued about $1 billion worth of uncovered bills of exchange in
1987 worth, Tanjug reported.
   Earlier reports said the workers were demanding the release of
Fikret Abdic, the jailed former director who has been on trial for
the past year on embezzlement charges.
   Thousands of Agrokomerc employees were left jobless or on
minimal wages since Abdic was removed from his post and arrested.

<HEAD>Dalton Phases Out Competitive Preschool</HEAD>

   Parents who were crestfallen when their bright
toddlers were rejected by a prestigious private preschool can take
heart: The Dalton School now admits it was never really able to
pick the best brains.
   School officials, sensitive to the feelings of those distraught
parents and frustrated by their inability to judge the academic
competence and character of toddlers, have decided to close the
preschool.
   ``It's difficult enough to select good students when they're 17
and 18. It's almost impossible to make distinctions _ except on the
edges, if they're extraordinarily brilliant or retarded _ when they
are 2{,'' James W. Wickenden, co-chairman of Dalton's admissions
and scholarship committee and a former dean of admissions at
Princeton University, said Monday.
   New Yorkers hunting for the fast lane to the right track for
their children will now have to wait for kindergarten to begin
their frantic push to get their youngsters into Dalton.
   The board of trustees voted last month to phase out the nursery
school over the next two years as the 34 children who enter in
September at age 3 proceed to kindergarten.
   School spokesman Frank J. Carnabuci said the process had become
something of ``a rat race.''
   The competitive admission to Dalton was lampooned in the movie
``Baby Boom,'' when a mother tried to cope with her daughter's
rejection.
   ``I don't understand,'' she said. ``Her resume was perfect, her
references impeccable.''
   For parents, their offspring's failure to get into an elite
nursery is ``their wonderful little child's first rejection,'' said
Cynthia Bing, who provides advice on how to get into the city's
elite private schools. ``It won't be as heartbreaking when they
don't get into Harvard or Princeton.''
   Admissions director Chris McDermott said there were almost six
times as many toddlers trying to get into the preschool as there
were openings and no reliable means for judging the little
applicants.
   Ms. McDermott said the decision was based on watching a child
play for 45 minutes with three other toddlers and talking with the
parents. Often, family affiliation and space limitations were the
deciding factors, she said.
   Wickenden said school administrators decided it would be better
to admit students when they are older, when test scores and other
information are available to help make better decisions.
   Kindergarten applicants are judged by their scores on the
Educational Records Bureau test, a standardized admission test, as
well as their records from nursery schools and interviews, Ms.
McDermott said.
   Wickenden said a greater percentage of students who entered at
age 2{ had to be asked to leave the school in later grades because
of poor performance than did youngsters who were admitted at the
ripe old age of 5 or 6.
   ``The hope would be by delaying the admission process by 1{
years, it would be fairer and the school could strengthen the
academic excellence of those admitted,'' he said.
   Dr. Sirgay Sanger, a child psychiatrist in Manhattan, didn't buy
those arguments. ``If you have a headache, you don't cut off the
head,'' he said.
   Instead of abolishing the program, the school should improve its
selection process, especially since preschool programs are in such
demand by working parents, Sanger said.
   Children can be judged at an early age if they are studied
carefully over an extended period, not in a 45-minute interview, he
said. ``They can have off days and on days and you need to see them
at different times.''
   For parents who had their heart set on sending their
preschoolers to Dalton, there should be some comfort in the
knowledge that Manhattan has about 115 private nursery schools,
with about 4,500 slots for 3- and 4-year-olds, according to the
Parents League of New York, an association of private schools and
parents.
   ``In September there will be no 3-year-olds sitting out on the
street with nowhere to go to school,'' said Mrs. Bing.

<HEAD>Convicted ANC Guerrilla Marries Girlfriend On Death Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla facing execution for a
1986 bombing that killed three people has married his girlfriend in
an interracial wedding ceremony on Death Row, a newspaper reported
Monday.
   Robert McBride, 25, of the African National Congress, was
sentenced to death in April 1987, 10 months after planting a bomb
at a beachfront bar in Durban that killed three women and injured
69 people. The blast came two days after President P.W. Botha
declared a national state of emergency.
   The Pretoria News said McBride, who is of mixed race, married
his white girlfriend, Paula, in a ceremony conducted by an Anglican
minister at Pretoria Central Prison on May 10. They decided not to
publicize the marriage at the time and did not want the bride's
maiden name disclosed, said the reporter who wrote the story.
   The couple reportedly met almost daily over the past two years,
communicating through a glass window at the prison.
   At his trial, McBride said he carried out the bombing on his own
and feared punishment by the ANC for violating its directives
against hitting civilian targets. The blast killed two whites and
an Indian. Most of the injured were white.
   No execution date has been set. McBride's wife was quoted as
saying she hoped the sentence would be commuted.
   The Justice Department said Monday that two black trade
unionists on Death Row were reprieved by Botha, who commuted their
sentences to 20-year prison terms.
   Seven other prisoners are scheduled to be executed this week,
according to an organization of human rights lawyers.

<HEAD>Trial Begins For Marcos Foe Steve Psinakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged with conspiring to ship
explosives to the Philippines in 1981 to help depose then-President
Ferdinand Marcos was framed, his lawyer argued Monday.
   Attorney James Brosnahan made the allegation during opening
arguments in the long-awaited trial of Steven Psinakis.
   The case has generated protests from current leaders in the
Philippines, where Psinakis is considered a hero.
   More than 100 Philippine lawmakers have urged President Bush to
block the prosecution, and President Corazon Aquino interceded
personally to get Psinakis freed on $200,000 bail. The president's
brother-in-law, Sen. Agapito Aquino, has said he will seek removal
of U.S. military bases from the Philippines if Psinakis is
convicted.
   Psinakis, 57, a Greek-born U.S. citizen, has denied any role in
bomb-making and has said he is being prosecuted because of a
vendetta against him by the local FBI and federal prosecutors. He
declined to make any statement Monday.
   Prosecutors said pieces of explosive detonator cord, bomb-making
materials and shipping documents were found in a search of garbage
at Psinakis' home in December 1981.
   But Brosnahan told jurors Psinakis was framed. ``It was planted
there, and the question is by whom?''
   He said Psinakis ``never purchased, never sent, never
transported and never received detonating cord in interstate
commerce without a permit.''
   In a news conference outside the courtroom, Brosnahan said
Psinakis had become the target of threats by Marcos agents and
supporters. ``He was told somebody was going to get him, and he was
told that repeatedly,'' he said.
   Brosnahan drew heated objections from Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ben Burch when he tried to detail events in the Philippines in the
'70s and '80s, said that Psinakis' co-defendant, Charles Avila, is
now a mayor in a Philippine city, and described Psinakis' efforts
to persuade U.S. authorities that Marcos agents were committing
crimes here. Avila has remained in the Philippines, which has no
extradition treaty with the United States.
   Burch said the prosecution will play two wire-tapped telephone
conversations between Psinakis and a St. Louis doctor active in the
anti-Marcos movement. In the calls, he said the men used the code
terms of ``50s and 60s and 30s'' to refer to explosive detonator
cord and its size.
   Shipments of explosive cord from St. Louis to San Francisco were
picked up at a bus station by a friend of Psinakis, he said, then
delivered to someone in the Psinakis family.
   Burch said investigators searching the Psinakis home found a
letter addressed ``Dearest Buddy,'' discussed ``BCs'' or blasting
caps, ``stripping the rope,'' a process used to get the explosive
material from the detonator cord, and a shortage of ``powdered
sugar.'' He said the letter, typed on Psinakis' typewriter, was
signed ``Steve.''
   Psinakis' wife, Presentacion, comes from a prominent Philippine
family allegedly robbed of its riches by Marcos. The couple moved
to San Francisco in 1973. After Marcos went into exile three years
ago, Psinakis returned to the Philippines a hero.
   Psinakis was indicted secretly in December 1986 and arrested the
following July on arrival at San Francisco International Airport.
   If convicted of conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the
shipment of explosives from St. Louis to San Francisco, Psinakis
faces up to 15 years in prison and $20,000 in fines.

   Moslem rebels killed 61 soldiers in
weekend attacks around Kandahar in southeastern Afghanistan, the
guerrillas' Afghan News Agency reported Monday.
   It said Latif Aryan, identified as the provincial chief of
secret police, and four of his agents were among those killed.
   Other rebel sources earlier reported increased fighting around
the battered, ancient city where rebels have put communist forces
under intermittent siege for almost two years.
   ANA said mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy warriors,'' concentrated
weekend rocket attacks on Kandahar's military airport, destroying a
jet bomber, a tank, two other vehicles and a fuel pumping station.
The agency said four mujahedeen were wounded. There was no
independent confirmation.
   Both sides in the Afghan war often make exaggerated and
contradicting claims and verification is rarely possible.
   The Soviet-backed People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Mujahedeen, backed mainly by
Pakistan and the United States, are fighting to topple it and
establish an Islamic system of government.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guinness Book of Records on Monday announced
it is scrapping its gluttony section because eating a whole ox in
less than 42 days could make you sick and because the world is more
health-conscious.
   ``If you have witnessed one of these competitions, they are
simply gross,'' said editor Donald McFarlan. ``We now regard these
records as unhealthy and outmoded, in the light of growing concern
about health issues worldwide.''
   McFarlan decided to drop 43 gluttony records from the book's
1990 edition, due out in autumn. They include records for consuming
beer, prunes, eels, eggs, gherkins, ice cream, pancakes, spaghetti,
sushi and snails.
   The book, the world's best-selling after the Bible, has carried
a health warning for several years pointing out that attempts to
break gluttony records ``must be regarded as extremely
inadvisable.''
   No one has ever died while attempting to break a gluttony
record, as far as the publisher knows.
   McFarlan hopes people will try to break more socially acceptable
records, so new categories are planned for the 1990 edition,
including the most cars converted to lead-free gasoline on a single
site.
   Only one gluttony entry, greatest omnivore, will remain ``for
its historical and nostalgic value,'' Guinness said in a statement.
   The record holder is Frenchman Michel Lotito, whose diet since
1966 has included 10 bicycles, a supermarket cart, seven television
sets, six chandeliers, a coffin, and a Cessna light aircraft.
   As for ox-eating, Johann Ketzler of Munich set the meat-eating
record when he ate a roasted one in 42 days in 1880.
   The book is sold in the United States as the Guinness Book of
World Records.

   Inhofe lists a payment on Oct. 19 of a personal loan to Ralph
Abercrombie, his former campaign treasurer, in an amount ranging
from $5,001 to $15,000. The Associated Press has reported
previously that Inhofe apparently used campaign funds to repay a
$12,000 loan in October.
   The AP also reported that Inhofe told the Federal Election
Commission in a letter dated Oct. 19, 1988, that Abercrombie lent
him $20,000 on June 30, 1986, and Inhofe then lent the money to his
campaign.
   Federal law generally forbids candidates from borrowing more
than $1,000 from individuals.
   On Oct. 23, Inhofe amended his statement to the FEC and said the
transaction actually was a trade of 4,000 shares of personal stock
and that he had given Abercrombie power of attorney to sell the
stock.
   Inhofe has denied any intentional wrongdoing, saying a candidate
may lend his own assets to his campaign and that he believed the
$20,000 was his money and not a contribution from a supporter.
   However, Inhofe also filed documents with the FEC that use the
terms ``lender'' and ``maker'' to describe the transaction and
which also make reference to collateral and security, an interest
rate and a maturity date on the note.

   Neighbors of a high-rise apartment
building were kept away Monday while demolition experts worked out
plans to bring down the building that wouldn't fall.
   ``We told you so,'' said a grass-roots neighborhood organization
which had argued the building and two others were solid enough to
be renovated for low-income housing.
   More than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36-year-old
building down Sunday, although a second round of explosives knocked
out the first two floors, leaving the main part of the building and
a wing leaning against each other.
   Two businesses in the area remained closed and four homes
evacuated. Police posted a 14-man detail around the building, and
traffic was rerouted.
   The neighborhood organization, Project BASIC, had tried
unsuccessfully in federal court to stop the demolition of the
10-story Hartford Park building, claiming it was structurally sound.
   Group officials said they hoped the failure of two blasts to
bring down the building would help their case when they try to stop
the demolition of two other 90-unit buildings in the project.
   ``It makes our position better,'' said group spokesman Anthony
Hempfer. ``We will be submitting this as evidence.''
   ``Some people might find this amusing,'' said Stephen O'Rourke,
head of the city's housing authority. ``To me it's a nightmare.''
   ``Why didn't it fall? That's an open question,'' said David R.
Evans, the explosives expert who coordinated the blasts. ``I
knocked out the two floors I wanted to knock out and, by all
indications, the building should have fallen.''
   ``It's the way it's built,'' Evans said. ``It's built like a
honeycomb.''
   Earlier this month, an 87-year-old grain silo in Forth Worth,
Texas, came down only after repeated blasts with more than 700
pounds of dynamite.
   The Providence Housing Authority decided to switch from
explosives to a wrecking crane, which will begin work Tuesday, said
O'Rourke, who said the process could take up to two weeks.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond Pettine had allowed the housing
authority to continue with its plans to raze the building after
engineers testified the 2,300 holes drilled in the building to hold
the dynamite had made it structurally unsafe.
   During a hearing earlier this month, a housing authority
engineer testified that the building probably would not withstand a
40-mph wind, said Project BASIC.
   Project BASIC had argued that the low-rise units slated to
replace the building would not provide enough affordable housing to
compensate for the lost units.
   The failed attempt to bring the building down ``clearly
demonstates the structural integrity of the Hartford Park
highrises,'' the group said in a statement. ``We told you so.''
   ``Given the strength of these buildings, they can and should be
rehabilitated and occupied by families and individuals in need of
safe, decent and affordable housing,'' it said.
   O'Rourke, however, said the structural safety of the building
was not at issue.
   ``They were coming down for sociological reasons, to lower the
density of the site,'' he said.
   A hearing on Project BASIC's attempt to stop the demolition of
two other Hartford Park buildings was scheduled for June 6.

improvements on the shop. Dixon lists no real estate holdings,
although he has between $100,000 and $250,000 in money market

<HEAD>SEC Chief Says Congress Should Consider Limiting Takeovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Monday that Congress should consider passing
legislation to restrict the power of states to limit corporate
takeovers.
   David Ruder said the state and federal partnership governing
securities laws is undergoing a severe test because of a growing
tendency by states to pass restrictive laws asserting state control
over outside takeover attempts of local companies.
   In remarks prepared for a New York conference on corporate
financing, Ruder noted the SEC has stated previously the agency's
belief that anti-takeover statutes passed by state legislatures in
New York and Delaware were unconstitutional.
   He said he believes Congress could eventually be forced to
address this question by limiting the power of states to restrict
takeover attempts.
   ``Limitations on the free transferability of securities of
corporations that are owned by shareholders nationwide diminish the
efficiency, depth and liquidity of the nation's securities
markets,'' Ruder said.
   ``Federal law should control in this area by pre-empting state
statutes that unduly interfere'' with the buying and selling of
securities, he said.
   Ruder, who announced last week that he was stepping down as SEC
chairman to return to teaching at Northwestern University's law
school, said that unless state legislatures on their own stop
passing antitakeover legislation, Congress should enact
restrictions.

   Leaders in six countries will press an
initiative for disarmament through the United Nations, they said
Monday in a statement sent to Presidents George Bush of the United
States and Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
   They are Presidents Raul Alfonsin of Argentina and Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, former President Julius Nyerere of
Tanzania and Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi of India, Ingvar Carlsson
of Sweden and Andreas Papandreou of Greece.
   Five years ago, leaders of the six countries launched their
appeal directly to the leaders of the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   ``The international situation has seen important changes,'' they
said in their statement. ``The relationship between the two
superpowers has improved... We now believe that the purpose of the
initiative can best be pursued through the United Nations.''
   The statement was accompanied by letters to Bush and Gorbachev,
the contents of wwhich were not disclosed.
   It called for a comprehensive treaty to ban nuclear tests or any
use of nuclear weapons, with a schedule for eliminating the
weapons, a ban on the use in new weapons of nuclear material from
disarmed weapons, a U.N. verification system on disarmamanemt, a
convention on chemical weapons, and prevention of the use of outer
space for military purposes.
   The statement was released by Argentine Ambassador Enrique
Candioti, who delivered the letter to U.S. authorities.

<HEAD>Armed Men Attack Relief Train, Rob Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 armed men boarded a train
carrying 1,500 tons of emergency food supplies to the war-ravaged
south and robbed three relief workers, a government statement said
Monday.
   It said three Western relief officials were robbed of their
``personal belongings'' but were not harmed, and the gunmen left
without touching the food supplies. It did not give the names or
nationalities of the officials working with the U.N.-sponsored
relief project.
   It reported the robbers boarded the train Sunday about nine
miles north of Malwal and said they were searching for foreigners.
   After holding the three officials briefly as hostages the gunmen
left and told the train crew to continue the trip to Aweil,
according to the statement. It gave no other details.
   The train started the journey Saturday after a delay of more
than a month, caused in part by crewmen who feared making the trip
through the embattled area without an armed escort.
   It left Muglad in southwestern Sudan for Aweil, a town 180 miles
farther south that is controlled by government troops.
   The train, with 48 freight cars, is scheduled to drop off the
loads from 32 cars in Malwal and Maput, two rebel-held towns
between Muglad and Aweil.
   It had been schedluled to depart April 15. A further delay was
caused by government objections to the plan to deliver food to
areas held by the rebels' Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   Organizing the shipment is Operation Lifeline Sudan, which is
part of a U.N. effort to help some 100,000 people threatened with
starvation.
   The $132 million project was planned to stockpile 100,000 tons
of food in southern Sudan by the end of this month, but less than
half of that amount has been delivered.
   U.N. officials have said the operation is a race against time.
Seasonal rains that begin in May turn roads and airfields into
quagmires.
   The southern rebels, mainly Christians and animists, have been
battling for more than six years for greater autonomy and more
economic development from the central government in Khartoum. The
government and northern Sudan are predominantly Moslem.

   A Chinese official told Vice President Dan
Quayle on Monday the Beijing government had agreed at the start of
ongoing mass demonstrations that authorities would refrain from
violence, an administration official said.
   But Wan Li, head of China's National People's Congress, the
Chinese legislature, also told Quayle that restoring order in China
would be the first priority and no progress can be made toward
promised reforms during the current upheaval.
   Wan met with the vice president and later with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III during an 11-day visit to the United
States.
   He refused to comment on the situation despite persistent
questioning by reporters, and was described as ``very careful'' in
his talk with Quayle.
   ``He was careful to position himself on either no side or every
side of this thing,'' in that meeting, said the administration
official, who said also that Wan was careful to point out that most
of the tension in Beijing and the imposition of martial law has
occurred since he left the country for his trip.
   However, Wan did say that before he left the country several
days ago, ``They agreed not to use violence,'' against the
demonstrators, said the source.
   His visit to Washington came as more than 100 top military
leaders vowed Monday to refrain from entering Beijing to suppress
the demonstrators who have seized control of the capital.
   Also Monday, members of Wan's People's Congress began gathering
signatures needed to open a special session on the legality of
martial law, sources said, indicating a further erosion of Wan's
support.
   Early Tuesday, witnesses said soldiers clashed with crowds at
one intersection. Witnesses said soldiers hit people with sticks
and belts, but did not open fire. The incident appeared isolated.
   One report said 15 residents were injured.
   The administration declined immediate comment on the violence,
in part because it was unclear whether the incident was ordered as
part of a strategy or was just an isolated occurrence, said one
official.
   Quayle, asked about the matter, told reporters during a photo
session with Wan that he hoped for a nonviolent solution to the
Chinese strife.
   ``We support the advancement of democracy, freedom and human
rights around the world,'' he said. ``We certainly hope that the
public demonstrations that have gone on in China and continue will
be successfully concluded without any violence.''
   During his meeting with Wan, Quayle underscored the U.S.
``interest in human rights and democratization worldwide, and the
hope that China would continue its political development and
economic reforms,'' the vice president's press office said.

<TEXT>
   A crowd estimated at 200,000 demanded at a rally
in downtown Yerevan that Armenia's president, prime minister and
Communist Party chief be replaced, a local activist said Monday.
   Rafael Popoyan said in a telephone interview that the
demonstration, held Sunday in the Armenian capital, also demanded
resolution of the long-festering conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a
largely Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
   Ethnic clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh, which many Armenians want
annexed to their southern republic, killed more than 90 people last
year.
   Popoyan said the rally decided to suspend a 4-day-old general
strike in anticipation of Thursday's opening of the nation's new
parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. He said the strike
may be renewed if the congress fails to address the question of
Nagorno-Karabakh.

Fifth Avenue, Room 910, New York, NY 10010. Purchasers will receive
a $3 gift certificate.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is recalling 325 ``Smurf'' and ``Snoopy''
ceiling fans because a defective mounting bracket could cause the
fans to fall, the CPSC said.
   Sears said there have been three incidents of the fans falling,
although no one was injured. Consumers who return the fan to Sears
stores will receive a full refund of the $129.99 price, the company
said.
   Calls to Arsana of America and Sears were not immediately return.

<HEAD>Baker Urges Concessions From Israel, Palestinians; Sees Rabin</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: adds 3 grafs of comment by American Jewish leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged
Israel on Monday to stop settling Jews on the West Bank and in Gaza
and to give up any aspirations of annexing territories captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   Baker, in a speech to an American Jewish group, said, ``Now is
the time to lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic vision of
a greater Israel.''
   He also called on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government to
reopen schools on the West Bank and in Gaza closed by Israeli
authorities attempting to cope with a Palestinian uprising.
   ``Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors who deserve
political rights,'' Baker said in the speech to the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, a private research and lobbying group
holding a convention here.
   At the same time, Baker called on Palestinian Arabs to abandon
``the illusion of control over all of Palestine'' _ meaning Israel
apart from the West Bank and Gaza.
   He also urged the Arab world to end its economic boycott of the
Jewish state and to recognize Israel ``as a neighbor and partner in
trade and human contact.''
   Baker's speech, which he gave before meeting with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, represented a hardened U.S. stance
toward Jerusalem while also appealing for concessions from radical
Arabs.
   He said the United States would not ``dictate an outcome'' to
the negotiations Baker hopes will spring from a proposal by Shamir
to hold elections among Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza.
   But, Baker said, ``we do have an idea about the reasonable
middle ground to which a settlement should be directed.'' He then
proceeded to stake out a position on many controversial issues,
including Israel's control of the West Bank and Gaza.
   He said Palestinian self-government in the territories would
provide ``ample protection'' for Israel's security.
   Baker did not explicitly rule out retention by Israel of some of
the territory, as Rabin and several other leading Israelis say is
essential to deter another Arab attack.
   But Baker stressed that Israelis ought to get used to the idea
of a negotiated settlement that ``will in all probability involve
territorial withdrawal and the emergence of a new political
reality.''
   In terse terms, he told Israel: ``Forswear annexation. Stop
settlement activity. Allow schools to reopen.''
   At the same time, Baker reiterated that the United States did
not support creation of an independent Palestinian state.
   Rabin, talking to reporters after a 70-minute meeting with
Baker, said schools in Gaza were open with 200,000 students in
attendance. But on the West Bank, the Israeli official said, ``we
learned that once schools are opened the confrontation between kids
and the military forces of Israel increase the number of casualties
among youngsters.''
   Rabin said he had not read Baker's speech, which was delivered
about an hour before their meeting. But he said the key question at
the moment was whether Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza would
engage Israel in negotiations as proposed by Jerusalem.
   ``We learned that once a peace process starts it has its own
momentum,'' Rabin said.
   The Israeli official said he and Baker concentrated on how to
get elections going and ``how to remove the threat of terror'' that
keeps Palestinians from participating in Shamir's proposal.
   Rabin said many Palestinians ``realize that what Israel has
offered is a unique opportunity'' but they were holding back out of
fear of assassination.
   Shamir's two-step plan involves electing Palestinian leaders to
negotiate temporary self-rule and then holding negotiations among
Israel, Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt on an overall settlement.
   Earlier, Rabin reviewed the military situation in the Middle
East with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney without broaching any
requests for new weapons deals, defense officials said.
   The officials, who asked not to be named, said Rabin and Cheney
met privately and with other officials for more than an hour at the
Pentagon, with Rabin offering the newly installed Cheney a progress
report on the overall situation in the Middle East.
   Rabin and Cheney did not discuss ``in any detail'' Israel's
latest regional initiative, the sources said. Rabin and President
Bush are expected to delve more deeply into that issue during White
House talks on Wednesday.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, said in a statement that
``Baker deserves praise for calling on the Palestinian Arabs to
abandon violence and to reach out to Israel to convince the Jewish
state of their peaceful intentions.''
   Also, Reich said, ``we are gratified by Secretary Baker's words
urging the Palestinians to abandon their hopes of destroying Israel
and to renounce all talk of taking over Israel in stages.''
   The Jewish leader said the major issue, however, was bringing a
halt to the Palestinian uprising and accepting Israel's plan for
free elections.

   Tiananmen Square has become a garbage-strewn
encampment for students demanding more freedom and a symbolic field
of battle in the political struggle within China's leadership.
   A citizen said late Monday night, while manning a roadblock to
keep soldiers out of the the city: ``Every four years you have
elections in America and change your government. Every 10 years we
have riots and change ours.''
   The main political combatants are Premier Li Peng, who is cool
to political reform and appears to have support from Deng Xiaoping,
the 84-year-old leader; and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang,
known as a relative liberal.
   Both have tried to manipulate the students.
   Under Deng's orders, according to reports, Li has equated the
movement with ``turmoil'' and tried to give the impression of
strong leadership by crushing it.
   Zhao has tried to use the discontent as a springboard back into
the favor of both people and party.
   Neither has succeeded.
   Li ordered martial law Saturday, but the soldiers surrounding
Beijing have yet to enter the city.
   Zhao won points with the people by visiting hunger-striking
students last week, tears in his eyes, but Chinese sources say he
has lost support in the party.
   Those apparent failures introduced two new elements: the
military and representatives of the National People's Congress.
   On Monday, seven leading generals expressed opposition to
martial law and said the People's Liberation Army should not enter
Beijing.
   Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, the nation's last living
marshals, said Sunday night the army would not suppress the
students. Their announcement in all official media clearly limited
Li's order, which gave the military the right to taken any steps
necessary to restore stability.
   The military appears to be saying it is not willing to be used
as a pawn and wants the political squabble to stop.
   Also Monday, sources said representatives of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, were collecting signatures
on a petition for a special meeting to consider the legality of
Li's martial-law order.
   The Science and Technology Daily reported Monday that 24
deputies sent a letter saying the disturbances should be ended ``by
democratic and legal methods.''
   Students and intellectuals have been part of other political
power struggles in Communist China's 40-year history, such as the
1956 Hundred Flowers campaign and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution
by the radical left.
   A brief student campaign for democracy in the winter of 1986-87
led to the downfall of Communist Party chairman Hu Yaobang, a
relative liberal whose death April 15 inspired the current movement.
   Beijing is a sea of rumor and innuendo, with no free press to
help sort it out. Within one week, various sources have reported
that Li and three others had seized power, that Zhao had resigned,
that Li and Deng had stepped down and that President Yang Shangkun
was preparing a coup.
   To that confusion can be added the contradictory tone of the
official press. On Monday, the front page of the People's Daily
carried both an editorial favoring the crackdown and a story
criticizing martial law.
   The student movement is largely a product of Deng's opening to
the West and his economic reforms.
   Students know of the People Power uprising that ousted President
Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines three years ago and about
student protest in South Korea. It would be difficult to close
China again.
   Lacking a victory by one of the three top leaders, a vacuum at
the top could result.
   Right now, Li appears weakest because he declared martial law
but could not enforce it.
   Zhao's position has not been strong for months. He has been
blamed for record-high inflation and an overheated economy,
associated with his policy of introducing elements of a market
economy in the state-run system.
   Deng has been is shaken because 11 years of popular economic
liberalization were not accompanied by political reform.
   ``Right now the stage is empty,'' a government source said.
``All the people in the audience are on their feet clapping for a
new leader, but no one is coming out. I think this is a tragic
moment in our history.''

   Although Visclosky received the congressional salary of $89,500,
he didn't take it all for personal use, according to press aide
Rudy Murrieta. He declined to accept the previous congressional
raise from $77,000 until the month of December, putting all the
excess money into the Peter J. Visclosky Foundation, Murrieta said.
Visclosky ended up accepting about $78,040 for personal use, with
the rest, approximately $11,460, going into the foundation. About
half of those funds have been distributed to charities in northwest
Indiana, and the rest will be distributed this year, Murrieta said.
   Among the positions Visclosky held is that of a member of the
board of directors of The Potato Museum in Washington, but he has
resigned from that because he did not have enough time to devote to
it, Murrieta said.

<HEAD>Germany Responds to US Missile Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To Update with official saying issue unsettled, adds 2 grafs
after 3rd graf previous, ``Popadiuk said''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it is
studying a response from West Germany to a proposed U.S. compromise
on the issue of short-range missiles in Europe.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
response, received Monday afternoon, had been discussed with
President Bush by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Popadiuk said he had ``no details or characterization'' of the
latest proposal to cross the Atlantic. ``It is being studied,'' he
said.
   However, another U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the issue was ``still unsettled.''
   The official said the reply had neither advanced nor lessened
prospects for a settlement. ``We're not home yet,'' the official
said.
   Bush on Sunday voiced optimism that the U.S.-West German dispute
which has split NATO would be resolved before the alliance's
40th-anniversary meeting begins next Monday in Brussels.
   The flap centers on whether to negotiate with the Soviets on
reducing the size of NATO's nuclear arsenal in western Europe.
   The West German government, responding to heavy political
pressure for disarmament, has supported such talks. The United
States has generally held that East-West negotiations on the
weapons should begin until the East's superiority in conventional
arms is erased.
   Last Friday, the U.S. side gave West German Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg a compromise offer that West German officials
privately said opened the door to eventual U.S.-Soviet negotiations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who spent the weekend in
Kennebunkport, Maine, with Bush at the president's oceanside
retreat, said Saturday the German stance was ``too vague'' for a
deal.
   The Germans thus far have insisted on leaving open the option of
eliminating all NATO and Warsaw Pact short-range missiles in any
negotiations.
   Under the U.S. proposal, meanwhile, negotiations would be held
only after NATO and and Warsaw Pact nations agreed on cuts in
conventional forces that would reduce the East's superiority.
   Earlier Monday, Popadiuk called the issue a ``NATO-wide issue,
and it's one that affects all members, and all members have a view
on it, and of course, all views are welcome.''
   ``The issue will be worked and hopefully will be resolved before
the NATO summit so that we can have a successful NATO summit,''
Popadiuk said.

   Dr. Rohit Parasher, a strike leader, said the clinics were
established ``as an expression of our deep anguish and concern for
our patients.''
   About 5,000 doctors went on strike last Tuesday, and government
hospitals began turning away many patients because of the lack of
staff.
   Parasher said more than 4,000 people have received treatment at
the clinics set up in tents outside nine of New Delhi's 11
hospitals.
   Medicine will be provided free, and the clinics will be operated
until the strike ends, he said.
   A Health Ministry official said negotiations are under way, but
he declined to give details.
   Earlier wage negotiations ended in deadlock May 15, and the next
day more than 3,500 doctors in Delhi left their jobs. About 1,400
doctors at government hospitals in Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Banaras
and Aligarh joined the strike.
   The strikers are seeking pay raises, higher allowances for not
being allowed to have private practices and firm schedules for
promotions.
   Most are junior staffers and nearly all are resident physicians.
Emergency cases are been handled by senior doctors.
   The strikers want a montly increase of $53. They now receive
between $200 and $269 per month.
   They also seek an increase in the monthly allowance for not
having a private practice from $16 to $40. Government doctors are
barred by law from having their own practice.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Monday rejected a bid by
one of the nation's most profitable savings and loans to switch its
insurance coverage from the fund that backs thrifts to the more
healthy one that insures bank deposits.
   The application by Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
was denied by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which rejected the
institution's claim that it was exempt from a temporary ban on
defections from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Great Western, the nation's second-largest FSLIC-insured
institution, had filed an application claiming it was eligible to
convert from coverage by FSLIC to insurance with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The application was seen as a test case on whether regulators
would allow widescale defections from the FSLIC, although several
smaller S&amp;Ls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts'
insurance fund.
   The FDIC is considered the more attractive insurance fund
because it retains big assets while the FSLIC has been largely
depleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry.
   Legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leaving
FSLIC until Aug. 10, 1988, and Congress has since extended the
moratorium until Aug. 10, 1989. Thrifts that had already converted
to FDIC or announced their intention prior to March 31, 1987, to
covert by merging with an FDIC-insured bank were exempted.
   Under President Bush's $157 billion proposal to restructure and
rescue the thrift industry, institutions would be barred from
leaving the FSLIC for another five years. The provision is designed
to help the fund recuperate and to ease the costs of the bailout.
   Regulators and some members of Congress had been concerned that
widescale defections from FSLIC could cut the fund's intake of
insurance premiums and make the S&amp;L rescue even more expensive.
   Great Western applied to leave FSLIC based on its October 1988
application to merge with the smaller Great Western Savings Bank of
Bellevue, Wash., an FDIC-insured institution. The California thrift
also cited its March 1987 memorandum of intent to merge with Great
Western Thrift and Loan in Salt Lake City, Utah.
   The bank board rejected Great Western's application to merge
with the Washington thrift and said the Utah memorandum was not
valid because no further steps to combine with the Utah thrift had
been taken since the agreement was signed.
   Great Western, which had assets of $30.8 billion as of Dec. 31,
issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the bank board's
ruling.
   ``We are confident that under existing law and regulation, Great
Western's program for FDIC membership meets every test and we
intend to vigorously pursue all options available to us,'' said
James F. Montgomery, chairman and chief executive.
   The company did not elaborate on what its options might be.

   Rep. Tony Coelho, the House Democratic whip,
supplemented his salary by giving speeches and collecting rent on
property in California, his financial disclosure forms showed
Monday.
   The lawmaker's income ranged from $123,525 to $136,025 in 1988.
   His base salary was $89,500, boosted by rents of $5,000 to
$15,000, honoraria after charitable donations of $26,525 and
interest from a federal credit union of $2,500 to $5,000.
   Coelho, whose personal finances have recently drawn public
attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986
financial disclosure form, put most of his assets in a qualified
blind trust in June 1988.
   At the time, the California Democrat's holdings were worth
$65,000 to $150,000, with the largest investment _ a rental duplex
in Merced, Calif., _ valued at $50,000 to $150,000.
   The assets that Coelho kept out of the blind trust include
another rental property in Merced, valued at $50,000 to $100,000,
and savings accounts, money market accounts and individual
retirements accounts worth $25,000 to $80,000.
   Coelho listed no purchases or sale of property, stocks or bonds
in 1988, but he did refinance his principal residence in the
Virginia suburbs.
   That arrangement allowed him in October to pay off loans of
$80,000 to $200,000, the forms show. Coelho satisfied a commercial
loan of $50,000 to $100,000 from Federal City National Bank, a
$15,000 to $50,000 line of credit from Security Pacific National
Bank and the same line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank.
   Coelho also sent his trustee, I. Barry Mehler, a check for
$60,000 for inclusion in his blind trust last November, according
to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure. He did not
say where the money came from; his aides said they would ask.
   Excluding his blind trust, Coelho was left with one liability, a
50,000 to $100,000 mortgage on his Merced rental house from the
Tracy Savings and Loan institution.
   Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, lawmakers are not
required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their
principal residence.
   Another exemption is details of a spouse's income. Coelho's
wife, Phyllis, works as an assistant to Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind.
   Coelho, a top fund-raiser for the Democratic Party and former
head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an
active speaker on the lecture circuit last year, collecting
honoraria of $90,100. He gave $63,575 to charity, keeping $26,525,
a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed.
   Among those who gave Coelho $2,000 for speaking was Drexel
Burnham Lambert, a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for
Coelho to fly from Iowa to Los Angeles.
   The Washington Post has reported that Coehlo had not listed on
his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy $100,000 in
high-yield Drexel Burnham junk bonds. Coelho blamed the omission of
an oversight by his California accountant.
   Coelho, a member of the House agriculture committee, accepted
speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential
business before the panel.
   They included the California Grocers Association, the American
Horse Council, The Fertilizer Institute and the Connell Rice and
Sugar Co.
   Coelho did a fair amount of traveling at other people's expense
to give speeches in 1988. Sometimes, the destinations were resorts.
But the only overseas trip was five days he spent in Israel on a
trip paid for by Project Interchange.
   The congressman and his wife spent two nights at Marco Island,
Fla., paid for by Puccio and Associates; he visited Palm Springs,
Calif., two times at the invitation of the Mexican-American Grocers
Association and the Tobacco Institute, and spent three days in
Yosemite National Park on a fact-finding trip paid for by the
Yosemite Park and Curry Co.
   Coelho, who suffers from epilepsy, traveled to New York once and
California three times for The Epilesy Foundation of America. He
also visited Texas, California and New York for the ``Tony Coelho
`Yes I Can' Disability Foundation.''

   The Soviet Union on Monday suggested both NATO and
the Warsaw Pact be disbanded.
   ``The Warsaw Treaty states propose disbanding both military
alliances at the same time, starting with disbanding of their
military forces,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov.
   Gerasimov said the full appeal to members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization would be published in Soviet newspapers Tuesday.
   It is not the first time East European officials have broached
the idea, but Monday's statement comes one week before a NATO
summit meeting that finds the 16-nation Western alliance divided
over the depth of changes in the Soviet threat.
   West Germany advocates talks on the elimination of short-range
nuclear weapons from Europe, while the United States and Britain
say no such talks are possible while the Soviet Union and its
allies have overwhelming superiority.
   A compromise reportedly is in the offing on the question of
nuclear arms talks, but fundamental differences remain within NATO.
West Germany is more concerned with eliminating the possibility of
a destructive East-West conflict on its territory, since even a war
that NATO wins would likely be disastrous for Germany.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has offered the possibility of an
undivided Europe free of nuclear threat.
   Gerasimov said Monday the East European alliance was suggesting
expanding arms negotiations to all weapons systems, including
navies.
   He said the appeal was being made because times have changed
since the post-war era when the two alliances were formed.
   East European officials have offered the hypothetical
possibility of dissolving the Warsaw Pact once NATO is disbanded,
and Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu mentioned simultaneous
dissolution years ago. The topic has arisen recently in talks by
Hungarian officials contemplating neutrality.

<TEXT>
   A jury was seated Monday for the trial of
U.S. Rep. Donald E. Lukens, who is accused of having sex with an
underage girl.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys spent seven hours selecting
the jurors, who will hear evidence on a misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor.
   Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini challenged defense attorney
Thomas Tyack in court to explain his decision to excuse the only
black potential juror. The girl who made the allegations against
Lukens is black.
   Tyack said he excused the woman because her husband works for
the state; there were other jurors who he believed would be more
appropriate from the defense's point of view; and because the
potential juror appeared to be ``living in a vacuum.''
   Tyack was referring to her statement that she had absolutely no
knowledge of the case despite widespread media coverage.
   Lukens, a 58-year-old conservative Republican, was elected to
Congress in 1986, and previously served from 1967-71. In between,
he ran unsuccessfully for governor and served in the state
Legislature.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that Lukens, indicted Feb. 23, had offered to
plead guilty to the charge, but the prosecution would not agree to
his condition that references to any sexual contact with the girl
be removed from court documents.
   Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove said he
would consider requests by Ms. Mangini that only limited testimony
be allowed from the girl regarding two other cases in which she is
involved as a witness and that her juvenile record not be
introduced.
   The defense maintains the evidence is needed to establish or
question the girl's credibility.
   Lukens, who has repeatedly has denied the allegations and
accused the girl's mother of setting him up for extortion, did not
comment to reporters Monday.
   Columbus television station WSYX on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly
recorded videotape that showed Lukens apparently offering a
government job to the girl's mother, Anna Coffman, after she asked
him why he was ``messing around'' with her daughter. In the tape,
Lukens told Ms. Coffman he did not know her daughter was a
teen-ager.
   If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail
and a $1,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   Prosecution briefs unsealed Monday for the
perjury trial of former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall show the government
hopes to show that he plotted how he would lie publicly about a
shady loan deal.
   In one brief unsealed in U.S. District Court on the eve of juror
questioning, the prosecution argues that public statements Swindall
made after his allegedly false grand jury testimony are relevant to
the case because they point to ``a continuation of Swindall's
attempts to limit his own potential criminal exposure.''
   Swindall, 38, is accused of lying under oath in 1988 to a
federal grand jury investigating his dealings with Charles
LeChasney, an associate and now-admitted money launderer, and
``Mike Martinez,'' actually Mike Mullaney, a federal agent posing
as a money broker for probable drug dealers.
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal
grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five
years in prison. The indictment contends he lied in concealing from
the grand jury his discussions on how the movement of money would
be concealed to protect him.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican congressman from Atlanta's
eastern suburbs, lost his seat last November to Democrat Ben Jones.
An attempt at a speedy trial before election day collapsed after
jurors received Swindall campaign material proclaiming his
innocence in the mail.
   In the brief, the prosecution says it wants to enter as evidence
statements Swindall made in later interviews and news conferences
which are ``clearly false,'' as shown by a tape-recorded phone
conversation between the congressman and the agent.
   At one point in that conversation, the agent, posing as a broker
funneling Swindall money through LeChasney as middleman, asked the
congressman what he would say if anyone started asking questions.
   ``What's wrong if I say I sold the note to someone Charles
LeChasney introduced me to and I don't know what his name is and I
really didn't care,'' Swindall replied.
   ``There's no question in this transaction that I am basically
using Charles as my buffer,'' Swindall said in another conversation
related in the prosecution brief.
   Swindall's attorney wants to prevent any use of post-grand jury
statements by the congressman, on the grounds that they are not
relevant to the issue of whether he lied to the panel.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman unsealed several motions and
trial briefs after objections from news organizations. But two
other government briefs must remain secret because they contain
``highly sensitive'' information not previously reported in the
media, he said.
   Since potential jurors might read or hear new news reports,
there is a substantial chance that reporting on the sensitive
information might taint the jury, Freeman ruled.
   The judge set aside Monday for 75 potential jurors to fill out
questionnaires and for lawyers on both sides to study them.
Courtroom questioning of the potential jurors is expected to begin
Tuesday.
   Freeman has said he wants to see if an impartial jury can be
seated before ruling on Swindall's request to move the trial out of
town because of prejudicial publicity.

<HEAD>Trial Starts Tuesday for Two Accused in Bank Robbery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men accused of helping stage the
state's biggest bank robbery go on trial Tuesday in a case in which
authorities say one witness was murdered, another died of unknown
causes and jailed suspects plotted to kill other witnesses and flee
to the Cayman Islands.
   ``I've been wracking my brain, trying to find a way to summarize
it for the jury,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Bryant.
   ``These people are just too zany,'' Bryant said of the
defendants. ``They've been watching too much television.''
   John P. McCoy, 43, of Slater's Branch, Ky., and Doyle David
Moore, 27, of Lovely, Ky., go on trial Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in Huntington on charges of conspiracy to commit bank robbery
and intimidating witnesses.
   McCoy also faces a murder charge in the shooting death of
Russell M. Davis of Martin County, Ky., who was part of the robbery
gang.
   The Matewan National Bank in Kermit was robbed of more than
$286,000 on Jan. 3, 1987. Authorities say McCoy masterminded the
heist, in which he was joined by Moore, Davis and Harold D.
``Boonie'' Runyon, 39, of Forest Hills, Ky.
   Davis met with Secret Service agents in Jacksonville, Fla.,
shortly after the robbery and agreed to become a government
witness. A few days later, authorities say, Runyon and McCoy took
him to the top of a Kentucky mountain and shot him in the head.
   ``He was a threat to us,'' Runyon said Friday in pleading guilty
to the Davis killing and to a charge of conspiracy to commit
robbery. ``There was no reasoning with him. We took him to a hill
and shot him.''
   Runyon said he and McCoy buried Davis in a shallow grave on Ford
Mountain in Pike County, Ky. The body was not discovered until last
February.
   McCoy, Moore and Runyon were indicted by a federal grand jury in
March in the robbery, and a murder charge later was added against
McCoy and Runyon. Moore was not charged in the Davis killing.
   Runyon, who had been scheduled to stand trial with McCoy and
Moore, could be sentenced to life in prison on the murder count and
five years for the robbery charge, plus $500,000 in fines.
   Earlier this month, Timothy Lynn Sammons, 30, of Beauty, Ky., a
friend of Davis who appeared before the grand jury, was found dead
in his car. Martin County Coroner Jay Hinkle said Monday the cause
of death still has not been determined but said foul play is not
suspected.
   McCoy, Runyon and four others _ including McCoy's son _ were
charged May 6 in an alleged plot to break McCoy, Runyon and another
man out of jail, kill five witnesses and help the prisoners flee to
the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean.
   Prosecutors said the six asked an imprisoned burglar to kill the
trial witnesses and then help them break out in return for $20,000
in cash and $100,000 in counterfeit money.

<HEAD>EPA Understates Smog Problem, Environmentalist Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency routinely
understates the severity of the smog problem in urban areas because
it relies on too few monitoring devices, a private environmental
group said Monday.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said that in many large
American cities unhealthy levels of smog are twice as frequent
during the hot summer months as EPA estimates would indicate.
   Last March the EPA released 1988 air pollution figures that
showed ozone pollution, which is a chief component of urban smog,
as being the worst in a decade and ``clearly the most pervasive air
pollution problem'' the country faces.
   The agency indicated nearly 100 areas of the country have
unhealthy levels of ozone pollution during at least some periods of
the summer.
   Nevertheless, according to the environmental group, those EPA
statistics reflect only a fraction of the ozone pollution problem,
according to the NRDC.
   The environmental group said the EPA estimates of days in which
there are unhealthy levels of smog in an area are often based on
smog readings from a single monitor.
   ``This approach seriously underestimates the extent of the smog
problem in most large urban areas,'' said David Hawkins, an
attorney for the environmental group and a former assistant
administrator at the EPA.
   EPA officials could not immediately be reached for comment on
the NRDC's assertions.
   Hawkins said that an analysis conducted by the NRDC showed that
unhealthy levels of smog occurred about twice as often in many
American cities than the EPA statistics suggest.
   In urban areas in most parts of the Northeast and across some
areas of the Southeast and Texas smog levels were found to be
considerably worse than implied by the EPA reporting, he said.
   Hawkins said the group counted the number of ``smoggy days'' in
1987 and 1988 in 48 large urban areas and found the levels higher
than the EPA suggested, based on its monitoring system.
   For example, according to the NRDC, the Houston, Tex.,
metropolitan area had 54 smoggy days, compared with 21 cited by the
EPA during the time period; Washington, D.C., had 18, instead of
the EPA figure of 10.5; and Cincinnati had nine instead of the two
in the EPA report.

<HEAD>Marcos Unchanged; In Very Critical Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
continued to rally but remained in unstable and very critical
condition Monday with kidney, heart and lung failure, hospital
officials said.
   St. Francis Medical Center officials canceled a scheduled
medical briefing Monday morning, saying there was nothing new to
report.
   ``The update is there is no update,'' hospital spokeswoman Norma
Kop said. ``Nothing has changed.''
   Marcos, 71, has been listed in very critical condition since
Thursday, when he underwent surgery to prepare his veins for kidney
dialysis.
   He was responding to medicine and was conscious and alert
Monday, but his condition had not stabilized and the prognosis
remained poor, said Gene Tiwanak, assistant hospital administrator.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15, and as a result has
not had to travel to New York to face racketeering charges he
bought real estate with money plundered from the Philippine
treasury.
   His wife, Imelda, who is also charged, last week appealed to
Marcos' successor to allow her husband to die in his homeland, but
President Corazon Aquino declined.
   The Marcoses have lived in Hawaii since February 1986, when they
were ousted in a civilian-military revolt that brought Mrs. Aquino
to power.

<HEAD>Australia Against Treaty; To Push For Protected Wilderness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Monday
he will not sign a treaty limiting mining in Antarctica and called
instead for tougher action _ declaring the mineral-rich continent a
wilderness park.
   As one of the seven original claimant nations to the Antarctic,
Australia has veto power over the U.S.-supported treaty, which must
be signed by November to take effect.
   ``Although we recognize that (it) is very much better than no
protective regime of any kind ... we believe that it is both
desirable and possible to seek stronger protection for what remains
the world's last great wilderness,'' Hawke said.
   Hawke announced the Cabinet decision jointly with Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans and Environment Minister Graham Richardson.
   Supporters of the proposed Convention on the Regulation of
Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, drawn up last year in
Wellington, New Zealand, argue limited protection is better than
none at all.
   Australia has land claims totaling 38 percent of the continent,
making it the largest claimant.
   France is the only other original claimant nation not to have
signed. The other claimants are Argentina, Chile, New Zealand,
Norway and Great Britain.

<TEXT>
   Taiwan should halt all contacts with China
until it lifts martial law and acknowledges that the
anti-government demonstrations are patriotic and democratic, 60
legislators said in a statement Monday.
   The lawmakers from the governing Nationalist Party said, ``We
should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until
the Chinese Communists lift martial law and end any military
crackdown.''
   They said they will submit their statement to the Legislative
Yuan (parliament) for discussion Tuesday and then relay it to the
Cabinet.
   Hu Chin-heng, a 35-year-old clerk at the Ministry of
Communications in Taipei, began what he said would be a three-day
hunger strike to protest ``Taiwanese indifference'' to
demonstrators in China who are demanding democratic reforms.
   Students at some universities in Taiwan have signed petitions
supporting the demonstrators in China, but there have been no large
rallies.
   People protesting the Chinese government actions rallied Monday
in the Netherlands and Australia.
   About 150 Chinese students living in Holland staged a peaceful
protest in front of the Chinese Embassy in the Hague.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek advised Dutch
nationals not to travel to China because of the unrest. His warning
followed the weekend cancellation of a planned state visit to China
by Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus.
   Hundreds of Chinese students in Australia held rallies in Sydney
and Melbourne.
   About 300 demonstrators crowded into the courtyard of the
Chinese consulate in Sydney. Some burned photographs of Chinese
Premier Li Peng.
   Police blocked the entrance to the consulate building. There was
no violence.
   A similar rally was held in Melbourne, where demonstrators
called for the removal of Li Peng and China's senior leader, Deng
Xiaping, and the lifting of martial law.
   The Foreign Ministry in Canberra told Australians planning trips
to Beijing to wait until the situation becomes clear.
   The Taiwanese legislators said the Nationalist government should
offer to open direct trade and shipping links with China if China
cancels the crackdown and accepts the protests as patriotic and
democratic.
   The Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost the civil
war to the Communists. The island's government has refused to have
any direct contacts with the mainland authorities.
   But in the past two years it has followed a flexible policy that
allows Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through
third countries.
   Legislator Huang Chu-wen, who initiated the statement to the
government, said a military crackdown could set back democracy in
China by 20 years and ``we would miss a good opportunity to reunite
peacefully.''
   The Nationalists say China and Taiwan, considered a Chinese
province by both the Nationalists and Communists, should be
reunited under a democratic system. Martial law was lifted in
Taiwan in 1987 after it had been in force for 38 years.

<HEAD>1973 Bias Case Against Navy Goes To Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Testimony began Monday on a federal
lawsuit filed in 1973 alleging that the Navy discriminated against
black civilian workers in promotions at Jacksonville Naval Air
Station.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton is hearing the non-jury
trial, which may involve up to 450 witnesses and 4,000 exhibits in
the case that became a class-action suit after it was filed.
   Attorneys for both sides estimated the trial may take up to 12
weeks. Melton said if it is not over by the end of June, he will
have to recess it until September because of other court business.
   The lawsuit was filed by six blacks in 1973 after their
complaints were rejected by their bosses. One of the six workers
has died since the lawsuit was filed.
   Ten years after the case went to court, it was declared a class
action, with the outcome potentially affecting 1,200 to 1,700
blacks who work or have worked at the Navy Aviation Depot, formerly
the Naval Air Rework Facility.
   To win, lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund
Inc. must prove there was a sweeping pattern of sometimes subtle
personnel decisions that promoted white workers ahead of more
qualified blacks.
   ``We think the promotion process is a largely subjective
procedure. When you have that kind of subjective decision-making,
discrimination can enter the process,'' said Clyde Murphy, one of
the lawyers with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   The Navy has denied any discrimination and also has defended its
system for evaluating and promoting civilian workers.
   If Melton decides the Navy has discriminated, another trial
would be needed to determine which employees were treated unfairly
and how they should be compensated. The plaintiffs in a subsequent
lawsuit could seek back pay and promotions, Murphy said.
   ``It's a big case, and when you litigate against the federal
government, they have a lot of resources,'' he said.
   A variety of reasons are behind the 15-year delay since the
original 1974 trial date.
   A major issue has been the changing nature of how civil rights
employment laws apply to the federal government. That resulted in
years of delay until the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the
application of the law, Murphy said.
   In addition, the two sides haggled for years over what
information they were required to give each other. Government
attorneys ``aggressively litigated'' the case, Murphy said.
   And for several years, only one federal judge was available in
Jacksonville and he was required to put criminal cases ahead of
civil actions.

   A crime hot line that won a volunteerism award
from President Bush just a month ago is on the verge of closing its
doors for lack of contributions.
   ``We happen to be one of those thousand points of light that the
president is talking about that is now about to flicker out,'' said
Georgette Watson, who runs the Drop-A-Dime service from an office
in Boston's Roxbury section. ``It's an operation where when the
money comes in it's just about spent. ... We need serious money.''
   Drop-A-Dime has been taking anonymous tips about drugs and other
criminal activity since 1983.
   According to police, one in 12 anonymous tips from Drop-A-Dime
results in arrests. Last year, the organization received more than
2,000 tips about drug activity, gangs and weapons.
   In February, Drop-A-Dime passed on a tip about a high school
student carrying a gun at school. The tip led to the arrest of an
18-year-old carrying a loaded 9mm handgun.
   ``We can't afford to lose an orgnization like Drop-A-Dime,''
Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said. ``Policing in this
country will never be effective without groups like that. The
information we have gotten from the group has been very fruitful,
and I fully support Georgette.''
   Drop-A-Dime's original $700 annual budget has jumped to $120,000
as the operation has become more sophisticated, but it was down to
its last dime by the end of March. Now its organizers are dialing
for dollars trying to make it through the last two months of the
fiscal year.
   The tip line, known officially as Drop-A-Dime - Report Crime,
Intelligence Data Inc., handles between 300 and 600 calls per week.
   In April, Drop-A-Dime received a citation signed by Bush. The
award was for volunteer action since Drop-A-Dime has only two
salaried employees, including Watson, and uses about 10 Vista
volunteers for much of its work.
   Watson says she will have to decide by the end of this month
whether to hang up the service for good.
   ``Since April, I've been paying the small bills out of my own
pocket,'' Watson said.
   The organization relies largely on private donations from banks
and private corporations for its annual budget.
   Watson said some donors apparently gave to other projects this
year. ``Some have given us less this year, and others nothing at
all. I guess some have chosen other issues, like homelessness or
AIDS,'' she said.
   The Boston Police Department also chips in $20,000 each year and
this year provided an emergency infusion of $3,000 as cash
dwindled. Next year's $20,000 installment will not come until late
summer or early fall.
   The Rev. Bruce Wall, a co-founder of Drop-A-Dime as well as a
minister and assistant clerk magistrate, said he wrote Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn asking him to support a proposal requiring police
to allocate some assets confiscated in drug-related arrests to
groups such as Drop-A-Dime.
   ``If Drop-A-Dime has to turn off its telephones because this
city's public officials failed to support, then I am forced
seriously to question whether the `war on drugs' is a reality,'' he
wrote.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Monday
her government was not strong enough to risk allowing Ferdinand
Marcos to return _ dead or alive.
   She has refused to let the ailing, 71-year-old deposed president
return from Hawaiian exile to die in his homeland and has ruled out
burying him here.
   Marcos remained in critical condition Monday in a Honolulu
hospital after suffering renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure last
week.
   Mrs. Aquino said on Monday that the country is recovering from
20 years of abusive rule by Marcos, but the recovery is still too
fragile to risk allowing Marcos to come home even in death, she
said.
   ``Let's say a person has been ill for 20 years and now, after
three years, he is slowly recovering,'' she told reporters. ``Just
because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to
expose him to infection.''
   Mrs. Aquino recalled how anti-Marcos groups exploited the 1983
assassination of her own husband, Benigno Aquino Jr. Aquino was
slain at Manila airport moments after returning from the United
States to challenge Marcos.
   The killing stirred such outrage it led to the popular uprising
that toppled Marcos in 1986 and forced him into exile.
   ``I appealed for peaceful demonstrations,'' she said. ``I
appealed to them not to engage in violence. Will all of Marcos'
followers do the same thing? We cannot allow anyone to create
trouble or we will be fighting again. We cannot allow these
things.''
   The president conferred on the issue Monday with her Cabinet
Crisis Committee and later officials said the ban on the former
president remained.

<HEAD>11 Arrested in Los Angeles Strike, `Reform' Contract Reached in Boston</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA6,9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A teachers' strike in Los Angeles went into a second week Monday
with 11 arrests and a break in talks, while negotiators in Boston
agreed on a contract school officials called a landmark in
educational reform.
   The arrests were the most in one day during the walkout that has
crippled education in the nation's second-largest school district.
   They occurred after a rally at which more than 10,000 teachers
hoisted picket signs and cheered wildly when United Teachers-Los
Angeles President Wayne Johnson called school board members
``desperate, despicable people.''
   Johnson accused board members of lying when they say the
district cannot afford to meet teachers' demands for a 26 percent
raise over three years, including 10 percent in the first year.
   The Boston Teachers Union and Superintendent Laval S. Wilson
tentatively agreed on 7 percent pay increases for teachers for each
of three years despite warnings from officials that the city cannot
afford it.
   The contract, which requires ratification by the School
Committee and the union, comes at a time when Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis has proposed tax increases and spending cuts to
balance the state budget. Mayor Raymond Flynn said he did not
believe money would be available to support the contract, but he
supported provisions aimed at decentralizing school management.
   Wilson and Edward Doherty, president of the 6,000-member
teachers union, said the contract would give teachers greater
control over the schools, would reduce the power of seniority and
would hold teachers more responsible for the performance of their
students.
   In a joint statement, Wilson and Dougherty called the pact a
``landmark.'' Union and school officials noted, however, that it
was modeled after teachers' contracts in Dade County, Fla., and
Rochester, N.Y., which gave teachers a greater stake in how school
systems are run.
   In Los Angeles, school district police arrested 11 people for
investigation of roadway obstruction and trespassing during a
sit-in outside district headquarters. Ten teachers, including two
union vice presidents, were arrested along with a 17-year-old, said
district spokeswoman Tammy Sims.
   School board President Roberta Weintraub emphasized after the
breakdown in talks that the district had boosted its offer of a
21.5 percent pay raise over three years to a 24 percent raise over
three years, contingent on extra state funding.
   Superintendent Leonard Britton said he did not know why talks
collapsed Sunday night. ``I am led to the conclusion that the
union, and its officials particularly, were looking for any reason
to break it off,'' he said.
   Education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union
representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, counselors,
nurses and librarians went on strike May 15.
   The district claimed a small gain in student attendance Monday,
following a week of losses. There were 293,482 students in class,
up 34,362 from Friday. The district has more than 550,000 students.

<HEAD>Senators Ask Bush to Settle Cambodia Debate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three senators want President Bush to give top
priority to blocking a return to power in Cambodia by the Khmer
Rouge, the communist group blamed for more than a million deaths
during its 1973-78 rule.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, and Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., sent Bush a letter that also urged rejection of a proposal
for U.S. arms aid to non-communist guerrillas in Cambodia.
   The weekend letter, obtained by the Associated Press, asked Bush
to settle the debate between two groups of U.S. legislators and
experts.
   Both agree the Khmer Rouge should be stopped from returning to
power and the argument is whether the various proposals would help
or hinder this.
   ``We urge you to make unconditional United States opposition to
the Khmer Rouge and support for a diplomatic settlement your top
priorities, rather than a new program of U.S. lethal assistance,''
the senators declared.
   The other side favors arms aid for the non-communist Cambodian
factions to strengthen their hand in future power-sharing
negotiations.
   The State Department says U.S. policy is under study. White
House reaction to the senators' letter was not immediately
available.
   U.S. policy for settlement of the decade-old war includes
safeguards against future Khmer Rouge domination, along with
self-determination for the people and total withdrawal of the
Vietnamese military forces that invaded in 1978.
   The three senators voiced concern that Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
the West's choice to head a future Cambodian state, ``remains
allied with the murderous Khmer Rouge.''
   They added that ``any military assistance at this time simply
would reinforce Prince Sihanouk's alliance with the Khmer Rouge and
discourage him from attempting to reach a diplomatic settlement
which excludes the Khmer Rouge.''
   ``We do not need to remind you of the genocide committed by the
Khmner Rouge...nor do we need to remind you that the incredible
brutality of the Khmer Rouge continues today in the refugee camps
its forces control in Thailand and inparts of Cambodia,'' the
letter said.
   But Sihanouk's backers have argued that the Khmer Rouge can be
controlled more effectively as part of an alliance.
   The senators also said any military aid provided Sihanouk's and
other non-communist Cambodian groups ``invariably would fall into
the hands of the Khmer Rouge,'' and would also increase civil
strife.

<HEAD>Israelis Celebrate Holiday With Bonfires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israelis lit hundreds of bonfires Monday night
to celebrate an ancient Hebrew victory over the Roman occupiers of
the Holy Land.
   The bonfires of the Lag Ba-Omer holiday, which ends at sundown
Tuesday, commemorate the fires lit by the soldiers of Simon
Bar-Kochba who led Jews in a rebellion against the Romans between
135 A.D. and 138 A.D.
   Jewish legend also holds that Lag Ba-Omer marks the end of a
plague in which 24,000 disciples of the famed Rabbi Akiva died
because they did not properly honor one another.
   Another legend says Akiva's disciples died fighting the Romans.
Israeli children often make bows and arrows during the holiday to
re-enact the battle.
   Police estimated that about 200,000 people, mostly Orthodox
Jews, will spend the holiday at Mount Meron near the northern city
of Safed to celebrate Lag Ba-Omer with picnics and prayers.
   Mount Meron is the burial site of Rabbi Simeon Bar-Yohai,
believed to be the author of the ``Zohar,'' a central book in the
mystical Jewish teaching, the Kabbalah. The kabbalists see Lag
Ba-Omer as the anniversary of Bar-Yohai's death.

   ``The Blessing,'' the new play at the
off-Broadway American Place Theater, conveys the message that
mothers should not object if a daughter becomes a lesbian.
   But in the telling, playwright Clare Coss has made her story
long, unpleasant, tedious, inconsistent and boring.
   Louisa Horton plays a New Orleans woman in a spacious Long
Island old-age home who has periods of confusion, but most of the
time complains loudly that she wants to live with her daughter.
   The photographer daughter, played by Anita Gillette, experiences
guilt but realizes she'd have to hire full-time caretakers for her
mother. She patiently accepts her mother's abuse during weekly
visits. The daughter's supportive lawyer roommate-lover, Nan, is
played by Kelly Bishop, who was the original brash Sheila in ``A
Chorus Line.''
   The playwright has the mother proclaiming aspects of her own
personality, some of them news to everybody else on stage. More new
personality traits for Mom are written into the daughter's
throbbingly delivered eulogy while her mother is still alive.
   This apparently is meant to show the mother as a complex person.
But it comes across as the writer throwing in everything she can
think of and creating no person known to humanity.
   Three practical nurses often watch TV in the mother's room. Beth
Fowler plays an Irish woman obsessed with the Catholic Church,
Leila Boyd a mothering black woman and Olga Merediz a sympathetic
Hispanic girl. Anne Shropshire plays another old lady in the home,
vague but saintly.
   The play of seemingly innumerable scenes is directed by Roberta
Sklar.

   More than 100 military leaders said Monday they
will not order their men to confront or suppress the masses of
people who seized control of the capital to demand democratic
reform.
   Student leaders on Tuesday considered ending their 10-day
occupation of Tiananmen Square.
   Soldiers clashed briefly Monday night with residents 15 miles
from the square, but no shooting was reported. Other troops
withdrew from streets in southern Beijing, ending standoffs with
local residents who have surrounded their convoys and blocked their
movement.
   Students who have guided the tumultuous pro-democracy movement
over the past month expressed concern that many Beijing students
were leaving and that half their numbers were now students from
outside the city.
   Beijing University student leader Gua Haifeng said some leaders
want to pull out because of the increasingly squalid conditions and
the lack of clear-cut results from the occupation.
   Others argued they should stay until they achieve victory in
their struggle with the government, stressing that the students
still have the strong support of city residents.
   About 45,000 people were on the 100-acre square Tuesday morning.
A soldier from the western province of Xinjiang praised the
students' ``revolutionary, patriotic, democratic movement'' in a
speech over loudspeakers.
   A mother was seen weeping in the arms of her daughter, pleading
with her to come home.
   The promise by the military not to attack protesters represented
a serious blow to Premier Li Peng and other hardliners who have
tried to quell the huge demonstrations.
   Sources said members of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, began gathering signatures needed to convene a special
session on the legality of martial law, indicating a further
erosion of Li's support.
   In Washington, the Voice of America said Chinese authorities
were jamming its broadcasts, apparently trying to cut off one of
the demonstrators' main sources of information. It was the first
reported case of jamming since before diplomatic relations were
restored in 1979.
   Soldiers withdrew from streets in southern Beijing to end
standoffs with residents who had surrounded military convoys for
the last three days.
   Army trucks and armored vehicles remained deployed elsewhere in
western and southern parts of the city, but the mood was generally
relaxed. State television quoted an officer as saying he was told
to withdraw because of the widespread opposition to martial law.
   Residents and soldiers clashed briefly in one area when the
soldiers tried to move to a nearby army storage facility.
   People surrounding the trucks tried to block their path and a
battle with rocks and bricks began.
   An unconfirmed report said a soldier was killed, and one report
said 15 residents were injured. A Chinese journalist said about
2,000 soldiers participated in the clash.
   The confrontation, which ended at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, occurred
15 miles southwest of Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, where
tens of thousands of students have held round-the-clock vigils in
defiance of martial law.
   Citizens have set up barricades throughout the city to keep
soldiers from moving on the students.
   What caused the clash was not clear. Witnesses said soldiers hit
people with sticks and belts but did not open fire. The witneses
said some soldiers pushed through throngs of residents trying to
block their way but that military vehicles did not advance.
   There were new signs of internal political struggle.
   The letter from military leaders, which was sent to the People's
Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, was drafted by
seven prominent military figures, a source at the People's Daily
said. The seven include former Defense Minister Zhang and former
army Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi.
   ``As old soldiers we have the following demands,'' the letter
said. ``The People's Liberation Army belongs to the people. It
cannot confront the people, even more so it cannot suppress the
people and it will never shoot the people.
   ``To keep the situation from worsening, the army cannot enter
the city.'' The letter was signed by 100 other officers, said
another source.
   Li's inability to enforce martial law indicated an intense power
struggle. Li emerged as a hardliner during the protests and
appeared to have won a power struggle with Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was more sympathetic to the students'
demands.
   Chinese sources said Zhao has resigned in protest, but no
official statement has been made and his whereabouts and status
remain unclear.
   The students began leading the protests on April 15 to demand
talks with the government on bringing democratic reforms and ending
official profiteering. But now the students _ bolstered by
widespread support their movement has won from the populace _ are
pressing for the resignations of Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The protests reached a zenith last week during the historic
visit to China by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose social
reforms are admired by reform-minded Chinese.
   Students began a hunger strike May 13, two days before
Gorbachev's arrival. The populace embraced the students' cause and
poured into the streets, resulting in crowds estimated at more than
1 million.
   Under martial law, the city government banned marches, strikes,
class boycotts, the spreading of rumors and any criticism of
leaders. The bans were widely ignored.
   Foreign reporters were told they could not conduct interviews,
take pictures or make tapes or videos on the streets, in work
places and at several other locations.

<HEAD>Record Promoter Admits Giving Cocaine for Air Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A record promoter pleaded guilty Monday to
three charges involving payola, and admitted giving cocaine to a
Fresno radio employee to win air time for songs by Bruce
Springsteen and other artists.
   Ralph Tashjian, 41, of San Mateo pleaded guilty in U.S. District
Court to a misdemeanor payola charge for sending the cocaine in a
Federal Express envelope to the radio station program director.
   He also pleaded guilty to two felony charges of filing a false
corporate tax return and obstructing a grand jury investigation.
   Tashjian said he sent less than a gram of cocaine to the Fresno
program director to encourage the broadcasts of records by
Springsteen, Laura Branigan and Elvis Costello.
   Tashjian was the first person convicted under amended 1960
payola statutes, which outlaw the exchange of gifts for radio time,
said Department of Justice attorney Richard Stavin.
   Three counts of tax violations against Tashjian's wife, Valerie,
were dismissed last week.
   Judge Pamela Ann Rymer agreed with a defense motion that the
couple was the victim of vindictive prosecution, and labeled the
government's prosecution ``reprehensible.''
   As part of a plea agreement, other counts in a 175-count
indictment filed against Tashjian will be dismissed. But Tashjian
must testify before any federal grand juries or trial juries.
   Defense attorney Anthony Brooklier said Tashjian has not been
subpoenaed to testify, and refused to say if Tashjian would testify
against his ex-boss, record promoter Joseph Isgro.
   The plea agreement also allows Tashjian to withdraw his guilty
pleas if Ms. Rymer sentences him to more than nine years in prison
and a $265,000 fine at his sentencing set for July 31.
   The government agreed not to use Tashjian's testimony against
him in any future prosecutions unless he has perjured himself or
unless he withdraws from the plea agreement.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city Board of Supervisors on Monday
unanimously approved the nation's first law allowing live-in lovers
to register their partnerships publicly.
   The law, which also is intended to extend health benefits to
``domestic partners'' of city workers, was opposed by the Roman
Catholic Church but hailed by homosexual couples, who cannot
legally marry, and heterosexuals lovers who don't want to wed.
   The law, which passed on a 10-0 vote with one supervisor absent,
requires a routine second vote May 30 before going to Mayor Art
Agnos, who has promised to sign it.
   The supervisors also voted 10-0 to direct the mayor to form a
task force to examine how health benefits could be extended to
domestic partners of city employees.
   A few other cities have adopted policies extending health
benefits to live-in lovers of municipal employees. But San
Francisco would be the first to allow any non-married couples in
the county to register their relationships like traditional couples
file marriage licenses.
   The ``Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' form would be filed
with the county clerk for a $35 fee.
   ``I hope that other cities around the country ... will be
looking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of the
way people live,'' said Harry Britt, president of the Board of
Supervisors, author of the measure and a leader of the city's
politically powerful gay community.
   Britt played down worries by Agnos that people from other cities
might swarm to San Francisco to get their relationships
legitimized. He emphasized that the law's benefits would apply only
to partners of city workers, but urged that its spirit be adopted
in all spheres.
   ``My hope is that people will go to their unions, they'll go to
their employers, they'll go wherever in society people are given
some sort of benefits, and be able now to say, `This is the person
I love' and be dealt with fairly,'' he said.
   In addition to health benefits, live-in lovers of the 25,000
city workers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospital
visitation rights.
   ``This is long overdue,'' said Scott Smith, who was the lover of
Harvey Milk, San Francisco's first gay supervisor, who was
assassinated in 1978. ``Our relationships are just as valid as
non-gay relationships.''
   The law, which defines domestic partners as any ``two people who
have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and
committed relationship,'' is not binding on private businesses. But
proponents say the city's policy could lead to changes in many
areas.
   ``This is only the beginning,'' said Matthew Coles, a lawyer who
helped draft the law and worked on similar measures adopted in
Berkeley and Santa Cruz. West Hollywood also has such a law.
   Private employers, though, remain skeptical.
   ``My impression is that companies are not eager to stretch
benefits that far,'' said Richard Morten, vice president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
   The Roman Catholic Church worked against a similar plan vetoed
by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein in 1982. The Rev. George Wesolek of
the Archdiocese of San Francisco recently called the law ``a
frontal assault on marriage and the family as we know it.''
   Deacon Norman Phillips of the Archdiocese said he was not
surprised by the vote. ``I think our hope would be that they might
reconsider,'' he said.
   The church is opposed to the ``pseudo-marriage'' provision of
the legislation, although it supports the extension of civil rights
benefits and health coverage, Phillips added.
   Another clergyman said the law would have a positive impact on
the AIDS crisis.
   ``We need to support gay couples in stable relationships, not
promiscuous sex,'' said Episcopal priest Robert Cromey.
   Some of the city's employees worry their health-care premiums
could rise if the cost of insuring domestic partners, including
AIDS patients, drains city funds. Health and insurance officials
say the newly eligible people will pay their own way with monthly
premiums of about $150.
   In Berkeley, 7.5 percent of the city's 1,450 employees have
sought coverage for domestic partners under its health plan.
Eighty-five percent of those couples are heterosexual.

<HEAD>Government In China Mainly A Party Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the byzantine maneuverings of China's
political system one thing is clear _ power is strictly a party
affair.
   The main premise in Chinese politics is that the Communist Party
decides and the government does. Decisions are generally made by
consensus among party leaders.
   The legislature, or National People's Congress, has little pull,
and direct elections as known in the West are practically
non-existent.
   The decision-making process is made murkier by the role of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84. Deng holds only one official post,
as chairman of the Central Military Commission, and has withdrawn
from an active day-to-day role in running the country.
   But there has been no question that when critical matters arise,
Deng's word is final. That ultimate authority may now be on the
line as opposition grows to the imposition of martial law, believed
done on Deng's orders, to put down student-led unrest in Beijing.
   The general course of the nation is adjusted about every five
years when the 47 million-member party convenes its national
congress of about 2,000 delegates.
   The congress, however, merely reflects decisions made by the
175-member Central Committee, which meets in full session at least
once a year, and the 17-member Politburo, the nucleus of party
power.
   At the core of this nucleus is the five-member Standing
Committee of the Politburo. At Deng's bidding, the Standing
Committee is now balanced with two advocates of reform _ party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili _ two more conservative
politicians _ Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin _ and one
fence-sitter _ Qiao Shi.
   China's executive wing is the State Council, led by the premier
and three vice premiers and including 41 ministers. All are party
members and the ranking officials, such as Li Peng and the vice
premiers, are Politburo members. Despite promises to separate party
and government functions, the party still has a decisive say in a
broad spectrum of policy areas.
   This is even more the case with the National People's Congress,
a body of almost 3,000 which meets for about two weeks once a year
to vote on legislature and formally appoint members of the State
Council. It also fills the largely ceremonial post of president, or
head of state, now held by retired Gen. Yang Shangkun.
   The National People's Congress in recent years has tried to shed
its image as a rubber-stamp body by allowing more debate and
seeking more say in shaping legislature.
   The congress, or more exactly its 163-member Standing Committee,
which is responsible for its day-to-day operations, has managed to
alter or delay some controversial bills.
   But senior leadership in the congress, called the ``highest
organ of state power,'' is again dominated by the party, and all
important legislation emerges from policies set by the party.
   Under the National People's Congress are people's congresses at
various district and provincial levels. Citizens have a direct vote
for the lowest-level county congresses, although the candidates
must generally be approved by the local party offices.
   The local congresses, consulting with the party, appoint
delegates to provincial-level congresses who in turn nominate
delegates for the national congress.

   Two brothers who ran with spy
Christopher Boyce went on trial Monday in the slaying of the first
U.S. Forest Service officer killed in the line of duty, and a
defense lawyer conceded their involvement.
   Pellets from a shotgun carried by James Pratt struck Brent
``Jake'' Jacobson, causing him to bleed to death, Pratt's lawyer,
Jonathan Cottrell, told jurors. Jacobson was a Forest Service law
enforcement officer who helped track the two suspects for 20 hours
through deep snow.
   Cottrell said he wouldn't challenge much of the prosecution's
evidence, thus avoiding lengthy technical testimony from FBI
experts, but contested circumstances that would warrant the death
penalty under state law.
   Cottrell suggested the defense would try to show that the Pratts
fired in self-defense at pursuers, and that Jacobson was acting as
a volunteer, not as a law enforcement officer in the manhunt.
   James Pratt, 29, of Indian Hills, Colo., and his brother Joseph,
27, of Sandpoint, are charged with first-degree murder and 16 other
felony counts stemming from an abortive Jan. 11 burglary.
   The Pratts gained notoriety in 1982, when their testimony helped
send escaped spy Christopher Boyce back to federal prison.Boyce,
whose sale of CIA satellite information to the Soviets was
chronicled in the book ``The Falcon and the Snowman,'' had escaped
from prison in California and taken refuge in northern Idaho.
   Cottrell told the Kootenai County jury that the Pratts were the
two black-clad figures who burst into a tavern owner's home on Jan.
11, intent on robbery. They briefly took a hostage from among the
nine people in the home, fired shots at a pursuing sheriff's
deputy, and shot it out with Jacobson and a deputy when cornered in
a ravine the evening of Jan. 12, Cottrell said.
   ``If they thought they were master criminals, they were kidding
themselves,'' Cottrell said of the robbery that netted little of
value.
   Bruce Greene, representing Joe Pratt, reserved his opening
statement until after Bonner County Prosecutor Phil Robinson has
presented his case.
   Robinson said he intends to seek the death penalty if the Pratts
are convicted of murder.
   Cottrell asked jurors to ``use your common sense'' when deciding
whether the shootout was a continuation of the burglary and robbery
of the night before, or a separate series of crimes.
   If the jurors find that Jacobson was shot as part of a robbery
or in his capacity as a law-enforcement officer, they could find
the Pratts guilty of first-degree murder, which is punishable by
death.

   Stefania Follini, who has spent more than
four months sealed in a cave, learned Monday evening that her
isolation experiment was almost over. She heard a human voice,
laughed and said it was like an alarm clock.
   Minutes after Miss Follini was notified on a computer screen
that the experiment would end Tuesday, she heard another person's
voice for the first time in four months and nine days.
   ``Stefania, I'm your God talking to you,'' experiment
coordinator Maurizio Montalbini said over an intercom.
   The 27-year-old Italian woman looked at a video camera trained
on her, laughed and said: ``I didn't think you would find me down
here.''
   Miss Follini woman has been living 30 feet underground since
Jan. 13 without sunlight, clocks or other ways of measuring time.
On May 4, she guessed it was March 7, though she said she might be
two weeks off.
   Montalbini broke the news first by typing it in Italian over a
computer connected to Miss Follini's.
   ``Stefania, a real adventure doesn't stop. It never ends,'' he
wrote.
   Miss Follini frowned and watched the screen.
   ``You have lived 130 days in temporary isolation,'' Montalbini
wrote.
   Miss Follini watched the screen, stone-faced.
   ``And now, the adventure continues,'' Montalbini wrote. ``You
are returning on your trip to eternity.''
   Miss Follini continued watching the computer screen,
expressionless. Montalbini, who once spent six months isolated in a
cave, explained to the 40 reporters clustered around two TV screens
that she was having trouble believing what she was reading.
   Finally, Miss Follini typed in a reply.
   ``How come?'' she wrote, an uncertain smile on her face.
   Montalbini assured her he was telling the truth _ the experiment
was over.
   ``Are you really serious?'' Miss Follini wrote.
   Montalbini wrote that the end of the isolation experiment meant
the end of daily, boring mental and physical tests. With that, Miss
Follini laughed and clapped her hands, and Montalbini talked to her
over the intercom.
   After several verbal exchanges with the various Italian
researchers, Miss Follini remarked that ``the feeling she had was
like when the alarm clock goes off on Monday morning,'' interpreter
Rita Fraschini said.
   The isolation set a duration record for women. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and several U.S. universities
cooperated with Montalbini and other researchers from his and Miss
Follini's hometown of Ancona, Italy.
   The experiment in 30-foot-deep Lost Cave in the hills of west
Carlsbad simulated some of the effects of interplanetary space
travel.
   In the absence of clocks and sunlight, Miss Follini's sleep-wake
cycle has been altered radically. She tends to stay awake 20 to 25
hours and sleep about 10 hours.
   Miss Follini's menstrual cycle hasn't helped her guess at the
passage of time because it stopped in the absence of light days and
dark nights, researcher Andrea Galvagno said.
   Miss Follini, an interior decorator, has coped with the
isolation by livening up her 10-foot-square Plexiglas living area
with colorful figures cut out of construction paper and glued to
the plastic walls. She also reads, plays solitaire and keeps in
shape with calisthenics and judo moves.
   Monday morning, eight hours before she was scheduled to find out
she was coming out Tuesday, Miss Follini appeared to be cutting out
figures for another poster.
   Occasionally, researchers summon her to perform computerized
tests of mental power and concentration. She also monitors her
temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and lung capacity.
   For the first three months, she was grouchy, but she has become
more cheerful in the past month, researchers said.

   President Bush is encouraging demonstrators in
China to ``stand up for what you believe'' and urging the Communist
authorities to exercise restraint, saying he hopes pro-democracy
protests do not result in bloodshed.
   ``I would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible
in order to see more democratization and to see a peaceful
resolution of this matter,'' Bush said Sunday.
   ``We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom
of the press and clearly we support democracy,'' the president said
at a news conference in Boston with French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The two leaders received honorary degrees and delivered
commencement remarks at Boston University. Afterward, Bush returned
to the White House and Mitterrand flew to Paris.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's televised defense
against ethics charges this week will be that the rules were
changed in mid-stream, but even his own lawyers give him less than
an even chance of winning quick dismissal of the case.
   Wright's lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets of
charges brought against their client by the House ethics committee
should be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moral
climate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent.
   ``We are hoping for a clear interpretation that the rules
haven't changed on us,'' Wright said.
   But Wright's lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied
and give the speaker less than even chance of winning a pre-emptive
dismissal of the charges.

   Americans would accept an array of encroachments
on their lives to help clean up the environment, such as a ban on
aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling, a poll has found.
   The Media General-Associated Press survey of 1,084 adults found
broad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise, and
that government, businesses and average Americans are not doing
enough to combat it.
   Three-quarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in
the United States are too weak, and majorities favored urgent
government action, no matter what the cost, to protect the nation's
drinking water.
   Large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all
major oil facilities and at oil- and coal-burning power plants,
even if those measures would raise the price of oil, gasoline and
electricity.

   The Alaska oil spill, last summer's beach pollution and reports
of global warming have pumped new life into the American
environmental movement, which is reaping a bitter windfall with
each new catastrophe.
   Officials of some of the nation's leading conservation groups
say they have been inundated with donations and new members during
the past year or so, especially after the March 24 spill of nearly
11 million gallons from the oil tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Although environmentalists insist they aren't gloating over
Exxon's misfortune, they can't hide a sense of vindication.
   ``This spill has just really presented an opportunity,'' said
Lee Keller Reis, a National Wildlife Federation spokeswoman. ``You
hate to say, `We told you so,' but it's a way to make a point.''

   Three months after the last Soviet
soldiers left, the government is showing increasing confidence it
can ultimately force Moslem guerrillas and their supporters _
especially the United States _ to talk peace.
   Western countries had predicted the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors, would overwhelm the Afghan armed forces within weeks or
at least a few months of the Soviets' departure on Feb. 15.
   Although these predictions have not come true, the United States
has rebuffed proposals by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
a mutual cut-off of weapons and stepped-up efforts for a cease-fire.
   ``They say, `We should give the mujahedeen more time,' but they
have had time and they have nothing to show. They have no power.
They can only fire rockets,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said.
   He said President Bush should accept that the guerrillas will
not bring down the Soviet-backed government and that a negotiated
peace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused by
the United States.

   It's springtime on Martha's Vineyard and
the locals are girding for what's become an annual influx of
arrogant, offensive pests who walk the streets at night and hang
out at restaurants.
   It's not tourists. It's skunks.
   Hordes of the ``black cats with white tails'' have inhabited the
island, taking up residence under houses, rummaging through
restaurant garbage, intimidating vacationers, terrorizing pets and,
frankly, stinking up the place.
   ``They're really bold and brassy. You can see them on the main
streets, you can see them walking around anywhere,'' said Diane
Goodale, animal control officer for the Vineyard Haven section of
town. ``If you're fishing at night, they'll just come right up to
you.''

<HEAD>Spoleto Festival Gears Up For 13th Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Wrter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spoleto Festival U.S.A. is like a
wedding, and each spring this historic city revels in a two-week
honeymoon with the performing arts.
   Like any good wedding, this year's 13th edition of Spoleto
boasts something old, something new, something borrowed and, if not
blues, at least plenty of hot jazz.
   ``The mix of the festival is provocative without being one-sided
from an aesthetic point of view,'' says festival general manager
Nigel Redden. ``But if we aren't provocative, if we aren't
challenging every year, the festival will lose its audience.''
   The Spoleto curtain rises Friday, May 26, at noon with a round
of speeches on the steps of Charleston City Hall. Sixteen days and
111 performances later, Spoleto closes with a thundering fireworks
display over Middleton Place Plantation.
   This season, the old includes productions of Bellini's opera,
``La Straniera,'' and sold-out performances of Mozart's popular
``The Marriage of Figaro,'' the latter directed by festival founder
and artistic director Gian Carlo Menotti.
   Among the new productions is Laurie Anderson's music theater
work entitled ``Empty Places,'' in which 10,000 images will be
juxtaposed to music on more than a dozen moveable screens at the
Gaillard Municipal Auditorium.
   The something borrowed is a return engagement of the popular
Colla Family Marionettes from Italy who performed at the festival
years ago. The hand-carved puppets, similar to those Menotti
enjoyed as a child, return in two new performances.
   The jazz lineup includes, among other performers, The Ramsey
Lewis Quartet and the Hank Jones Trio.
   With ticket sales running 30 percent ahead of last season _
tickets for ``The Marriage of Figaro'' sold out two days after the
box office opened in March _ Redden predicts another box-office
record for Spoleto.
   ``I hope it reflects on the festival generally,'' he said.
``Certainly, I think people are learning to trust what we do.
   ``We do have a very eclectic offering. At the same time we're
doing an 18th-century and a 19th-century opera, we're also doing an
absolutely brand-new 20th-century opera with Laurie Anderson.''
   With several major productions scheduled to go on the boards at
Gaillard, a structural engineer was brought in to make sure the
grid above the stage could support the weight of the numerous heavy
sets.
   While there was no problem with the stage, problems were found
with the traditional release of helium-filled balloons during the
festival's opening ceremonies. The multicolored balloons will not
float skyward this year because of concerns sea turtles mistake
deflated balloons for jelly fish and try to eat them.
   Instead, Redden said the festival is working on a way to drop
oxygen-filled balloons onto the crowd from above.
   Other highlights of the festival include:
   _ Academy award-winning actress Eileen Heckart and Tony-winner
Joanna Gleason in the Lee Blessing play, ``Eleemosynary,'' the
story of three generations of women and their attempts to
communicate with one another.
   _ ``Dangerous Games,'' a dance theater production with music by
Astor Piazzolla and choreography by Graciela Daniele.
   _ Dance performances by the Boston Ballet and the Trisha Brown
Company. Other dance offerings include performances by a company
known as ISO which combines dance, acrobatics and new vaudeville.
   _ The festival's popular chamber music series _ some featuring
musicians who will perform on the festival's new $65,000 Steinway
piano _ as well as a performance of Mozart's ``Requiem'' and a
concert of French music entitled, ``After the Fall of the
Bastille.''

<HEAD>East German and Polish Dispute Still Frays `Frontier of Friendship'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SWINOUJSCIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German claims to channel waters
off this lucrative Polish port have frayed the ``frontier of
friendship'' that separates the East bloc neighbors.
   Officials on both sides say a solution is near, but the two
countries still carefully stake out their turf on the wide beach
west of the port and border guards in towers atop the dunes keep
watch over a rusty barbed-wire fence; signs warn strollers.
   But even marking buoys have not prevented a fierce squabble over
sovereignty of the channel, which winds back and forth from the
high seas to the port in order to avoid sandbars and shallows.
   The port of Swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening to a bay
that leads to Poland's largest port, Szczecin, 40 miles to the
south on the Odra (Oder in German) River.
   The conflict erupted in 1985 after East Germany extended its
territorial waters by 12 miles and started to enforce its claim to
parts of the channel approach to Swinoujscie that had been under
Polish administration.
   Negotiations have been going at least since October 1987. While
both sides say an agreement is near, concerns over the issue still
run strong on the Polish side.
   East German coast guard cutters have closed in on ships that
allegedly strayed out of Polish waters, warning them over bullhorns
they were violating East German territory, said Jozef Chabowski, a
department director at the Polish Shipping Company.
   ``We were facing the problem that East Germany said we were
operating on waters they claim don't belong to us, so the issue
must be settled. It was a show (of authority) from their side to
the ships,'' he said.
   But he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the
past year.
   The dispute arose at about the time Poland made public plans to
open a duty-free zone in Swinoujscie-Szczecin, while East Germany
was investing heavily to build up its Baltic port at Rostock 80
miles to the west.
   Jozef Stebnicki of the Maritime Office that handles shipping
complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected, and
Boleslaw Stolowicz, chairman of the Certa fish cooperative, said it
was a problem for deep-sea fishing companies.
   Talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last June
when Poland's Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met Erich Honecker, the East
German leader, in the former German city of Wroclaw. A government
spokesman at that time said an agreement was near.
   Ten months later the problem lingers, though in April the East
German and Polish foreign ministers said a bilateral agreement will
soon be signed that satisfies both sides.
   ``We here in the Western territories of Poland are especially
sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history,''
said Jerzy Timen, an editor at the Szczecin-based weekly newspaper
Morze i Ziemia (Sea and Earth).
   Timen, who has written extensively on the dispute, said Polish
authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that
officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the
conflict in a national and international context.
   ``Everyone was talking about it, but articles didn't appear _
although you could sneak certain problems into professional or
factory publications,'' he said.
   But Polish underground newspapers from the area reported
extensively on the dispute and said that Polish vessels at one
point were being stopped and inspected by East Germans.
   Just after World War II, the area around Swinoujscie-Szczecin,
previously German, was turned over to Poland.
   The German towns of Swinemuende and Stettin became Swinoujscie
and Szczecin.
   Resident Germans were forced to leave, while Polish refugees
were moved in after having been expelled by the Soviet Union from
what before the war had been the eastern part of Poland.
   As relations between Poland and East Germany improved in the
1970s, Poles and East Germans only had to show national identity
cards to cross the border. Poles flocked to East Germany to shop at
its better stocked stores.
   But after the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in
1980-81, East Germans required Poles to use passports and issued
Poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation.
   Now the majority of Germans in the restaurants and on the
beaches are tourists from West Berlin, only a two-hour drive away,
who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them, among other
things, to eat a first-rate dinner for the equivalent of only about
$10.

<HEAD>Hugh Wilson Sees New Show as ``Getting Even''</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer-director-writer Hugh Wilson, who's
gone a few rounds with entertainment's movers and shakers, smiled
at the opportunity presented to him in his new CBS series about
Hollywood, ``The Famous Teddy Z.''
   Wilson's last show, the critically acclaimed ``Frank's Place,''
was summarily dumped by CBS. He doesn't use the word revenge, but
he says he does expect to take a few shots in his new series,
premiering in the fall.
   Jon Cryer (``Pretty in Pink'') stars as a mail-room clerk at a
big talent agency who suddenly finds himself representing the
agency's biggest star.
   ``It's a Cinderella story,'' Wilson said. ``A kid gets an
enormously lucky break, and we show how he deals with it. His
naivete and inborn honesty seem to work for him in a business where
there's no naivete and little inborn honesty.
   ``It's a fun little way for me to get even with some people the
public thinks are wonderful and that we know are monsters.''
   Wilson was the creator of ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' which ran on
CBS in 1978-82, the short-lived ``Easy Street'' on NBC in 1986-87,
and the ``Police Academy'' movie series.
   He also wrote and directed ``Rustler's Rhapsody,'' a send-up of
singing cowboy movies, and ``Burglar.''
   ``After `Burglar,' I realized I could do better work with a
freer hand in television and that I wouldn't be pigeon-holed as I
was in films,'' Wilson said. ``You have more people telling you
what to do in films than you do in television. I'd like to do more
movies, but what I'd like to do are terrific movies.''
   ``Frank's Place,'' which made its debut in September 1987, was
one of the most critically acclaimed series of that season. But
that was the year of the ``dramedy,'' a hybrid between comedy and
drama, and neither CBS nor the audience knew what to do with it.
   The sophisticated show was given an 8 o'clock (Eastern) time
period when it should have been on no earlier than 9, then it was
bounced around the schedule and taken off the air with the promise
of a return. It never did.
   Other ``dramedies'' got similar treatment. NBC sporadically
aired ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' then dropped it, and
ABC canceled ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story.''
   Wilson's newest offering has gotten a better time slot _ 9:30 on
Monday, sandwiched between the successful ``Murphy Brown'' and
``Designing Women.''
   ``I couldn't believe it when they put `Frank's Place' in at 8
o'clock,'' he said. ``They also put `WKRP' in at 8 and the only
time it was a big hit was when they moved it to 9 o'clock. It's now
a huge success in syndication, which proves my theory that people
like the show, but that it was in the wrong time slot.''
   Wilson's new show is loosely based on a real incident that
occurred about 30 years ago. A mailroom clerk was sent to pick up
the agency's newest star and when he returned, the actor insisted
he be made his agent. The erstwhile clerk soon represented the
biggest names in Hollywood.
   Wilson said ``The Famous Teddy Z'' is a fish-out-of-water story.
``He's a guy who has no idea what he is doing,'' he said. ``He
lives in Torrance, and his mother think's he must be dealing dope
to make so much money. She's very suspicious of Beverly Hills. The
show is a send-up of celebrities.''
   Wilson began in the advertising business in Atlanta, then came
to Hollywood to go into films.
   ``In 1971, I raised $40,000 and tried to make a low-budget
feature,'' he said. ``I wrote it, acted in it and never finished it
so nobody knows how bad it was.
   ``I came out here and through two friends, Jay Tarses and Tom
Patchett, met Grant Tinker. He agreed to take me on as a director
trainee, but I saw that in the comedy series, the most important
person was the head writer. The first thing I wrote was a `Bob
Newhart Show.'''
   Tinker was then head of MTM Enterprises and Tarses and Patchett
were producing ``The Bob Newhart Show.'' Tarses most recently
produced ``Molly Dodd'' and ``Slap Maxwell.'' Patchett created
``ALF.''

<DATELINE>COLCA CANYON, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From a condor's perch on this gorge in
southern Peru you could look down on 10 of New York's World Trade
Center towers stacked end on end.
   The 60-mile-long Colca Canyon formed by the Colca River is the
deepest land gorge on Earth, according to the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   This mysterious land of desert-dry moonscapes, exotic
vegetation, active volcanoes and scattered pre-Columbian ruins is
just now emerging from obscurity.
   The canyon and surrounding Colca Valley are home to thousands of
Indians, descendants of pre-Inca tribesmen who settled here 3,000
years ago.
   ``The whole history of Peruvian man is summarized in this
startling landscape, which until only a few years ago was
incommunicado with the rest of Peru,'' wrote the Peruvian novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa in the foreword to the recently published
``Discovering The Colca Valley,'' one of the few books on the
region.
   Terraced fields painstakingly carved from the slopes still yield
corn and potatoes, the Indians' traditional staples. Ancient
irrigation canals keep the land productive.
   Some farms and hamlets rest precariously on canyon ledges,
giving the appearance of defying gravity or tempting fate.
   Most Indians still build their homes from adobe or rocks and
rely on the wool of their alpaca herds for clothing.
   They share these cloud-swept highlands with Andean condors and
scores of rare flora and fauna, such as giant cactuses and the
guanaco, an elusive cousin of the llama.
   From surrounding mountain ridges, the Colca plummets 14,339 feet
to the Colca River, according to Guinness. The World Trade Center
in New York is 1,350 feet high.
   The opposing lower wall descends 10,607 feet, nearly double the
depth of Arizona's Grand Canyon.
   Spanish conquistadors reached the Colca in the mid-1500s. They
built churches and towns atop Indian villages, and then left, said
Mauricio de Romana, one of the authors of ``Discovering The Colca
Valley.''
   Americans Robert Shippee and George Johnson led an expedition
into Colca and published an article in the January, 1934, issue of
National Geographic, calling it ``a lost valley of the Incas.''
   It was a brief interlude in the obscurity of the Colca, whose
wonders stayed forgotten until a gravel road was forged in the
mid-1970s, linking it with Arequipa, 115 miles south.
   Arequipa, Peru's second largest city, is 545 miles southeast of
Lima.
   ``To the surprise of Peruvians and foreigners alike, this
important setting, full of history and culture, appeared to the
world,'' Romana said in an interview.
   The road brought change to the Indians' traditional
self-sufficient lifestyle, tourists and spreading fame.
   The Guinness book recorded the Colca's depth for the first time
in the mid-1980s, Romana said.
   The road now carries travelers on a rugged five-hour journey in
the shadow of the Andes' majestic spine, across the barren and cold
altiplano and skirting volcanic cones.
   The canyon rim offers a bird's eye view of walls plunging
thousands of feet to the rushing Colca River and of condors gliding
on thermal winds over farms and villages.
   The most dramatic places are several days farther by foot and
mule and are seen by just a hearty handful of the 10,000 to 15,000
tourists who reach the Colca yearly, according to Romana.
   Anthony Holley, an Arequipa guide, said some visitors are
discouraged because they cannot easily reach the deepest zone.
   The arduous journey by road, a shortage of lodgings and
generally unsafe conditions signal some of the major problems
facing Peruvian tourism.
   In the last several years Peru has been hit by spreading social
and economic chaos, fueled by its worst recession of the century.
   Tourism officials say the country does not have the money to
invest substantially in tourism infrastructure or even protect what
already exists.
   But officials say the Colca so far seems to have been spared
from a recent upsurge in highway banditry and the bloody guerrilla
insurgency plaguing many other areas of the country.
   Romana, a director of the Colca Foundation, which seeks to
preserve the zone, said the arrival of the modern world has not yet
had a serious impact on the Colca or its people.

<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seems only logical, just plain common
sense: when diplomats strike a deal to eliminate some weapons, the
soldiers who have been manning them won't have to do so any more.
   So, with the United States scrapping intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in western Europe under an arms control treaty with the
Soviet Union, the American troops assigned to the missile units
ought to be coming home.
   Right, said Rep. Andy Ireland of Florida.
   Wrong, said the Pentagon.
   When Ireland advanced his proposition the other day, he said he
was left feeling like the skunk at the garden party.
   It turned out the Defense Department wasn't planning on pulling
any U.S. forces out of Europe just because of the missile treaty.
The missile personnel would just stay put and get new assignments.
   Ireland, a Republican who prides himself on a hawkish record on
defense legislation, said the military is playing ``kind of a shell
game.''
   When he first raised the manpower question, he was told about
25,000 U.S. personnel are on assignments that will be eliminated by
the INF treaty. This meant the assignments would go, not the
manpower. After the congressman said he had in mind recalling them
from Europe, there was some delay followed by a new, reduced
Pentagon estimate of the number involved _ more like 5,000.
   Ireland said the real count probably is about 16,000 U.S.
personnel on European assignments that will be obsolete under the
INF treaty.
   In any event, he was told, most of them were supposed to be
doing something else anyhow. They had been diverted from other
assignments to missile duty, all because Congress was so stingy
with manpower. Now they can get back to whatever it was the
services wanted them doing in the first place.
   Congress may decide otherwise.
   Ireland and Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., are sponsoring a
legislation to have U.S. personnel assigned to the
intermediate-range missile units pulled returned to the United
States when the weapons are eliminated.
   That wouldn't make a big dent in the 325,000 U.S. troops still
stationed in Europe. But Ireland said it would at least send a
message to U.S. allies in Europe that they have to pay a bigger
share of defense costs. ``We've got to leave the check on the table
one time and let the Europeans pick it up,'' he said.
   But the armed services don't want cuts. A defense official told
a House hearing last Thursday that the military is at work on ``a
variety of proposed missions'' for the missile bases the treaty
renders obsolete.
   ``We have made significant progress in the identification of new
missions,'' said John A. Woodworth, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for international security policy.
   No specifics, he said. That's classified.
   Those overseas bases have remarkable staying power, since they
are mission-shopping while Congress finally has swallowed some
politically unpopular cuts in domestic military bases.
   Woodworth said there were 14,562 Army and Air Force slots in
Europe on intermediate-range missile assignments that will be
eliminated by the fall of 1990.
   But he said only 5,685 of them are going to be withdrawn from
Europe. He said the rest will be reassigned ``to requirements that
could not be accomplished earlier ... and to needed enhancement of
our European defense posture.''
   To deal with congressional insistence that the INF missile cuts
be accompanied by real cuts in personnel and costs, the current
plan is to have about 8,000 slots cut in the United States instead
of in Europe.
   Those manpower reductions would show up in the rosters of Fort
Carson, Colo.
   Ireland said estimates of defense savings made possible by the
INF treaty range as high as $2 billion, but he said they'll never
be realized if the personnel involved ``are squirreled away in
other European posts.''
   But the starting point assumption seems to be that American
troops will stay in Europe, in about their current number, for the
foreseeable future.
   Ireland says it's become a sort of entitlement program, like the
domestic social programs in which the law says who'll get benefits,
automatically and usually permanently.
   The question of sharing that defense burden is among the issues
waiting for President Bush as he journeys to Brussels next week for
the 40th anniversary NATO summit meeting.

<HEAD>A New But Still Unknown Peronist to Take Argentina's Helm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Juan Carlos Zamudio says he
believes in President-elect Carlos Saul Menem, the newest heir to
Juan D. Peron.
   ``He has the same thoughts as Peron,'' Zamudio said. ``He
understands the feelings and the pain of the people.''
   Zamudio, a 39-year-old former custodian who uses a wheelchair,
is one of the 7.9 million Argentines who voted for Menem and the
Peronist Party in the presidential election May 14 and said he is
convinced that if Menem is made aware of a problem, he will fix it.
   Zamudio wants the government to refurbish a hospital that Peron
opened 40 years ago but later fell into disrepair and now is closed.
   But Menem, the 58-year-old governor of La Rioja Province, is a
new and still largely unknown face of Peronism. Zamudio may have to
wait for the hospital.
   Menem still is tied to organized labor that has been the
backbone of the party for 40 years but insists ``at no point did we
make promises'' to anyone, except to provide ``work, work and more
work.''
   The new Peronist will have a severe economic problem to deal
with when he takes office Dec. 10 _ one of keeping the country from
sliding into economic and social chaos and the policies of the old
Peronism are not apt to work to that end in today's Argentina.
   Argentines who didn't vote for Menem accepted his victory with
resignation.
   ``The Peronist Party used to say it could solve everything in
two or three months,'' said Alejandro Nunez, a lawyer. ``Menem is
saying it's going to take two or three years. It's good he says
that because it's going to take at least that long.''
   The first real insights into how Menem's Peronists will
government are not likely until he names his Cabinet in June and
when he presents his own economic program and takes responsibility
for it.
   Argentina's $59-billion foreign debt, on which $3.5 billion in
interest is overdue, will be a chief concern. Peronist economists
selected by Menem have been assigned to a delegation of President
Raul Alfonsin's incumbent government for meetings in the United
States with Argentina's creditors.
   Peronists also have become involved in government actions aimed
at stabilizing the deteriorating economy, which poses perhaps the
biggest threat to a smooth political transition in December.
   Menem stresses his party is merely cooperating with Alfonsin,
not co-governing. But the political risk is much the same.
   Politics in Argentina for four decades has been polarized by
love for or hatred of the party founded by Juan Domingo Peron in
1946.
   Workers and the poor, who receive essential benefits and
protections, are unswervingly loyal.
   ``The great contribution of the Peronist Party to Argentina is
the incorporation of workers into the national political life,''
said Italo Luder, a constitutional attorney and the party's 1983
presidential candidate.
   The middle class and the political right see it as fascist,
authoritarian, corporative, corrupt, incompetent, dominated by the
unions and unable to control the host of movements that gather
under its banner.
   Menem has worked to dispel what he calls his party's ``black
legend.''
   Peronists were the victims of violence as much as anyone else,
he says, reminding Argentines that the party had been banned or
restricted for 25 of the past 34 years and that he was jailed for
nearly five years following the military coup that ousted Peron's
widow, Isabel, from the presidency in March 1976. She had been her
husband's vice president and succeeded him on his death in 1974.
   ``Peronist violence was a response to violence exercised against
Peronism,'' Menem has said. ``I'm not justifying one or the other,
but let's be a little more evenhanded.''
   But skepticism of Peronism remains among Argentines who remember
churches that were burned, newspapers that were taken over,
dissidents who were harassed and industries that were nationalized
by Peron.
   Javier Vazquez Torrielli, 24, a business broker, said his father
took to wearing a gun in 1940s because he wasn't a Peronist and
felt threatened.
   Mirta Candolfi, 40, an employee of the state telephone company,
recalls Peronists coming into her grammar school and taking down
the picture of Gen. Jose San Martin, the father of the country, and
replacing it with Peron's.
   ``The fear of Peronism wasn't invented. It stems from peoples'
memories of things that happened,'' said Nunez, the lawyer.
   But even critics say Menem seems to accept ideas that the party
once rejected, such as selling off state-owned companies. He acts
on the basis of explanation and compromise, and he actively seeks _
and receives _ public support.
   ``Menem has an extreme ability to reach out and put his arm
around his enemies,'' a diplomat said. ``He draws people in rather
than pushes people away. That's his strategy. We have to wait and
see what the policies will be.''

<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE QUEENS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

   On April 6, 1988, Grammy-winning guitarist Larry
Carlton walked out of his California recording studio and into a
gunman's bullet. He believed he was going to die.
   ``I hit the floor, and then I prayed. ... I was ready to go to
heaven,'' said Carlton, a born-again Christian. ``And I'll bet you
that bought me some time. I think that kind of faith was a real
positive thing.''
   Carlton's faith _ and the frantic efforts of doctors who
repaired his severed carotid artery _ saved his life. Since then,
Carlton has made an incredible recovery and returned with a new
album, ``On Solid Ground,'' and an upcoming world tour.
   But music is not Carlton's only business these days. He's also
established a fund to aid crime victims who need help and have
nowhere to turn.
   None of it seemed possible when he was gunned down by an unknown
assailant for unknown reasons in the Hollywood Hills 13 months ago.
The bullet severed a vocal cord and caused damage to his left arm.
   ``The doctors told my wife, `He'll be fine _ if he lives. He'll
play,''' Carlton recalled in a voice still raspy from the shooting.
``I couldn't see it ... In the back of my mind. I wondered if I was
ever going to be as good as before.''
   After seven months of rigorous therapy and medical attention,
Carlton picked up the guitar for the first time to see for himself
if the licks featured on albums by Steely Dan, Michael Jackson and
Joni Mitchell were still within him. The answer came one night in
his studio, when Carlton settled in to record an instrumental
version of the Derek and the Dominoes classic ``Layla'' for his new
album.
   ``That part that's on the record is one complete take all the
way through. And there's that one lick in the middle of it that's
just FLYING,'' said Carlton, his voice rising with excitement.
   ``I was real proud, and I felt great. So that was kind of a
spark, that night I did `Layla.' It was like, `It's back, it's
back.'''
   Confident that he could handle the guitar, Carlton turned his
attention to Helping Innocent People (HIP), a support group he
founded to aid crime victims in need of financial or other help.
   ``We watch the news and we read the papers, and there's victims
every day,'' Carlton said. ``Most of us are jaded to it _ I was.
I'd be eating my dinner and watching TV, and go on with my life.''
   HIP has already started to help, recently providing $100 to a
crime victim left hospitalized by a vicious gang beating, Carlton
said.
   ``That's our dream _ to help people just when they need it,'' he
said. Carlton will contribute part of the proceeds of the world
tour which begins June 31 in Buffalo, N.Y., toward the fund.
   Carlton established his credentials as a premier guitarist
during the 1970s. He played on 13 albums with the Crusaders, worked
on three Joni Mitchell albums and contributed guitar work on Steely
Dan classics such as ``Kid Charlemagne'' and ``Josie.''
   His fretwork was featured in more than 3,000 sessions, including
appearances with John Lennon, Linda Ronstadt and Barbra Streisand.
Along the way there were two Grammy Awards and another five Grammy
nominations.
   But in the early part of this decade, Carlton put out the word
he was through with session work. ``I just started realizing that I
wasn't looking forward to going to work in the morning. And when I
realized I wasn't looking forward to making my sessions, rather
than continue doing them and take the money, I quit.''
   Since them, Carlton's solo career has progressed steadily,
peaking in 1987 with his acclaimed ``Last Nite'' album and its
single, ``Minute by Minute.'' The shooting interrupted work on a
follow-up album, and instantly changed his priorities.
   ``I'm one of the fortunate ones,'' said Carlton. ``I'm going to
live, and I'm going to continue to make a living and make my music.
Helping Innocent People was born because we realize that. It was
born out of that philosophy, to help the less fortunate out.''

   In El Centro, Calif., three years ago the final eight games of
the season were canceled after a father threatened umpire Carl Ott
with a knife.
   In Terre Haute, Ind., a manager clubbed a rival manager with a
bat and sent him to the hospital before the game even started.
   State Police had to be called to break up a brawl at the 1972
Little League World Series.
   Little League has had its share of critics over the years, but
its very prosperity indicates to supporters that its benefits
clearly outweigh its flaws.
   Most parents who have sat on wooden benches on a lazy summer
afternoon and watched their own and their neighbors' kids enjoy the
national pastime, however ineptly, conclude that Little League
can't be all bad.
   This is especially true when a man sees his son let a ball go
right by him in the outfield because he was preoccupied at the time
blowing dandelion fuzz.
   In another game, the same father watched the same son get struck
out four times by a towheaded pitcher with a fast ball you couldnt
believe. His son apparently harbored no ill will toward the
pitcher, however, because 10 years later he took her to the senior
prom. The Little League, after a lawsuit, began allowing girls to
play in 1974.
   One of Little League's least vocal but most severe critics is,
sadly, Carl Stotz himself.
   ``I have absolutely no animosity toward anyone working for the
corporation,'' he says.``Many of them are my dearest friends. But
what Little League is now is not what I envisioned it to be and I
do not approve.''
   Stotz feels that commercialization has blurred the neighborhood
focus of the program which he saw as its heart and its purpose.
   He feels this is most evident in the annual World Series. Stotz
arranged the first one, in 1947, as a rather modest ``tournament''
among all-star teams from three states to draw attention to his
idea in the early postwar years.
   He did not foresee its becoming an international event,
ballyhooed, televised and broadcast play by play to places as far
away as Taipei.
   He felt, he explains, that a county championship or state would
be sufficient aspiration for youngsters, ``a tournament close to
home and inexpensive, financed the same way the leagues are
financed, by local sponsors.''
   He says he watched neighborhood volunteers replaced on his board
of directors with celebrities and benefactors through the influence
of national sponsors.
   His critics say he was behind the times, a naive innocent who
didn't realize Little League's potential. His supporters say, as
did one Williamsport father, ``All my kid wants to do is play in
the World Series. All I want him to do is play baseball and have
fun.''
   Because of these and other philosophical and administrative
differences Stotz was eased out of the Little League in 1955.
Without bitterness, he says, ``I decided it was time to
surrender.'' He once described what he had given birth to as a
Frankenstein's monster.
   So he left. He took with him, however, his Original Little
League. It is not affiliated with Little League, Inc.
   The Original Little League has thrived in Williamsport in the 34
years since Stotz's ouster. About 150 children, including about 25
girls, play on 12 teams in three age groups.
   ``I think our program is a lot better than theirs,'' says John
White, who played in and now directs the Original Little League.
   ``We don't stress winning as much as they. We seem to have a
more relaxed atmosphere at our games. If adults get overly
boisterous we just tell them politely that this is for the kids.
   ``We play every night, Monday through Friday, and at the end of
the season we play some all-star games with neighboring leagues.
Carl often comes down to watch the games. The kids love him, ask
for his autograph. They still call him Uncle Tuck.''
   The field the ``Originals'' play on is the same one Carl Stotz
used to rearrange newspapers and figure out the proper distance
between bases for kids. The field has been improved over the years
by volunteers. It has a fence and scoreboard and dugouts and
clubhouse and grandstands.
   On May 4, 1974 the city of Williamsport formally dedicated that
field on Memorial Park to its honored citizen and put up a sign:
The Carl E. Stotz Field.
   So Uncle Tuck still has that.
   Another honor came to Carl Stotz on Oct. 8, 1988. The Original
Little League threw a testimonial dinner to celebrate its 50th
anniversary.
   Last year.
   ``Our first season was in 1939,'' says Stotz, his penchant for
accuracy unremitting. ``So we celebrated our 10th anniversary at
the end of the 1948 season, not 1949. Count it up. Use your fingers.
   ``In 1948 I put out a 25-page 6-by-9 booklet with pictures of
all the boys. It brought in, let's see here, $200.59 in
contributions in excess of printing costs. This year's 50th
anniversary of their Little League is a year late.''
   In Carl Stotz's back yard is a garage-size building which he
built himself to preserve what he calls ``my display.''
   If you drop by, he will show you the first Little League bat.
You will see snapshots of the first three Little League teams, no
different in composition than today's Polaroids that decorate
refrigerators across the land.
   You will see handwritten batting records, done in pencil instead
of ballpoint.
   You will see an original base. It was made of white canvas
stitched together and stuffed with wood shavings by Stotz's sister,
Laurabelle, the mother of his two nephews who wondered who they
would play. That mother was the first of 750,000 yearly volunteers
who make it all work.
   You will see the first Little League home plate, which Stotz cut
out of a piece of half-inch rubber he found in his father's
basement _ and, of all things, the pocketknife he used to cut it,
which, it appears, he couldn't bear to throw away.
   ``I had in mind a traveling display,'' Stotz says, ``something
to take around the country so Little League kids could take a look
at their roots.''
   Speaking of roots, you will also find in Carl Stotz's display
the brittle remains of the lilac bush that tripped him up in his
back yard and set him to dream of a better way, a dream that became
Little League.
   ``That lilac stump? Well,'' says Stotz, ``after a couple of
years I went and looked and discovered it was still there. So I dug
it up.
   ``Yeah, I guess that's one thing I saved on purpose.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The opening of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore 100 years ago this month, and the Hopkins medical school
four years later, greatly influenced the way America trains its
doctors. Besides setting the standards of medical education,
Hopkins researchers also have made remarkable contributions to the
practice of medicine in the 20th century.

   The Chief swept into the hospital lobby,
handing his hat, coat and books to the waiting crowd, dispensing a
cheery greeting and a wave of his hand.
   He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marble
Christ and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at a
bed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on The
Chief.
   William Osler, a showman with high forehead and the bold
mustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medical
students at the bedside. And he was making history.
   For this was Johns Hopkins Hospital around the turn of the
century. And Osler was among a small group of physicians who were
helping change the way America trained its doctors.
   With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the Hopkins medical
school in 1893, Osler and his colleagues became the first American
medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students.
They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by
experience.
   ``From the outset, Johns Hopkins embodied a conception of
medical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basic
science and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern all
institutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist Paul Starr in his
Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``The Social Transformation of
American Medicine.''
   As Hopkins graduates became professors and scientists all over
the country and abroad, ``they took a major part in shaping the
character of medical education and research in the 20th century,''
Starr wrote.
   This month marks 100 years of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions. The U.S. Postal Service planned to issue a $1 Johns
Hopkins stamp, and the prestigious Journal of the American Medical
Association dedicated its June 2 issue to new research from Hopkins.
   The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical
education. In the past century, researchers there developed the
radical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renal
dialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other key
contributions.
   The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when
America had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones,
medical historian Lester S. King said in a recent interview.
   No national standards yet governed medical education. Just about
anybody could get into a medical school somewhere, often without
even a high school education. Some diploma mills conferred a degree
in less than a year.
   Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where
students could get some training with patients. Most schools could
not offer much bedside experience.
   In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratory
facilities and conducted only limited original research. Germany,
by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicine
that began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances in
microscopy, chemistry and physiology.
   In America, reformers had been pressing for tougher academic
standards, noted University of Minnesota medical historian Leonard
G. Wilson. The reformers argued that medical students needed a much
better background to study medicine effectively at a time of many
advances in such areas as surgery, pathology, bacteriology and
biology.
   But some medical school professors opposed raising entrance
standards. It might discourage a natural genius in the art of
healing, they said. And a school that raised its requirements
risked losing students to less-rigorous institutions _ no small
consideration at a time when medical schools depended largely on
student fees.
   Some of the better schools made major academic improvements
during the 1870s and 1880s. And in 1874, one key reformer told the
trustees in charge of establishing Hopkins hospital and university
that they had a ``precious'' chance to set up a top-notch school of
their own.
   ``No medical school already organized has anything like your
opportunity,'' said Charles Eliot, president of Harvard University.
   The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather than
battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from
scratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to let
students into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching tool
from the beginning.
   When it came to opening the medical school, however, they also
had a big problem.
   As trustees of the estate of Baltimore financier Johns Hopkins,
they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in
American history. The $7 million Hopkins left upon his death in
1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university.
   But even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889, the financial
prospects for opening the medical school were shaky. Income from
the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried
up.
   Four wealthy, well-educated daughters of the trustees offered to
raise the needed money, provided the school would admit women on
equal terms as men. The trustees agreed.
   But by December 1892, the women had raised less than half the
$500,000 the school needed. Other medical schools, knowing of the
delay, were trying to lure the Hopkins medical faculty away.
   Finally, Mary Garrett, a member of the women's committee,
offered to donate the balance _ for a price. The school would have
to admit only students who had a bachelor's degree, and a reading
knowledge of French and German.
   The trustees, swallowing hard at requirements they feared might
drive away many prospective students, accepted. ``It is lucky that
we got in as professors,'' Osler told a fellow faculty member. ``We
could never enter as students.''
   It was a relief when 18 students, including three women, showed
up to form the first class.

   The medical curriculum Hopkins provided was marked not so much
by innovation, as by combination of features that had appeared in
Europe and scattered American schools.
   It started with ``a clean slate and a bunch of good ideas and
good examples,'' said medical historian King. Of all the American
schools that were trying to improve medical education, ``Hopkins
went about it with the greatest enthusiasm and effectiveness.''
   It was an ambitious enterprise, even apart from requiring a
college degree for entry. Few other schools provided well-equipped
laboratories in basic science for teachers and students. Hopkins
aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of
existing knowledge.
   The idea was ``to give the world men who can not only sail by
the old charts, but who can make new and better ones for the use of
others,'' said John Shaw Billings, a Civil War battlefield surgeon
who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum.
   Hopkins also made a policy of learning by doing, both in the
laboratory and in the hospital. With Osler as their mentor at the
bedside, students took medical histories of patients, performed
physical examinations, conducted routine laboratory tests and
followed their patients' course.
   As Osler put it, ``the student began with the patient, continued
with the patient, ended his studies with the patient, using books
and lectures as tools, means to an end.''
   The school made full-time jobs out of teaching basic science,
rather than using local physicians to teach part time, as most
other schools did. The full-time idea, later extended to
instructors of medical practice, allowed Hopkins to go outside the
local community to lure top-notch faculty members.
   Eventually, the school also offered lengthy training in medical
specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the
regular curriculum.
   The result of all this was such that in 1901, Harvard's Eliot
congratulated Hopkins University president Daniel Gilman on a
``prodigious advancement of medical teaching.''
   Among all the changes in the nation of the previous 25 years,
Eliot continued, ``there is none greater than that wrought in the
development of medical teaching and research, and these men whom
you, sir, summoned here have led the way.''
   Who were those men? Most attention nowadays goes to the Big Four.
   One was Osler, who had come from Philadelphia to become
professor of medicine at the school and physician-in-chief at the
hospital. The author of a classic medical text, Osler became one of
the nation's most highly regarded physicians.
   Joining him was William Halsted, a shy and excrutiatingly
meticulous surgeon. He became well-known for such innovations as
the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and his training of other
surgeons.
   Then there was William Welch, a genial, rotund pathology
professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education
and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy.
   Finally there was Howard Kelly, the gynecological surgeon, who
developed and improved that art. He ``took pleasure in quick,
flashy operating,'' one student wrote later. ``He'd be in and out
of the abdomen almost before you knew it, all the time talking and
illustrating what he was doing or about to do.''
   Today, Kelly's operating table serves as a library table, its
thick glass top chipped around the edges.
   Of the 17 original hospital buildings, only three remain, hemmed
in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical
school. The old sitting room where Osler wrote his famous textbook
is now split into cubicles by blue room dividers, part of an
administrative office.
   The scene today at Hopkins would astonish the Big Four.
   Faint rock music nudges the quiet of a white-walled laboratory
as Bert Vogelstein, 39, holds up a dark gray sheet of X-ray film.
It shows several series of smudged black lines.
   During the days of the Big Four, physicians were just beginning
to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells. Now, the
smudged lines on Vogelstein's film are helping to explain those
abnormalities. They represent an analysis of colon cancer tissue,
suggesting that the tumors arose after normal cells lost protection
from a gene that suppresses cancer.
   In a room crammed with computer display terminals, Elliot
Fishman, 36, narrates a series of ghostly images. A skull tumbles
end over end, revealing its inner detail. A hip bone sways in its
pelvic socket like a pendulum. A dark blue liver rotates to reveal
patches of cancer that look like popcorn.
   Halsted needed a scalpel to peer within patients like this;
radiologist Fishman uses sophisticated scanning machines and
computer power. The result is three-dimensional images of the
body's interior that can be rotated or manipulated, helping
surgeons plan operations well in advance.
   Victor McKusick, 67, arose shortly after 5 a.m. one recent day
at his Baltimore home. He drank some coffee, read the paper, picked
up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape
recorder. It was time to catalog a new human gene.
   When the Hopkins medical school was founded, the idea of genes
was not yet generally accepted, for the work of Austrian monk
Gregor Mendel in the 1860s was not yet widely known. Today,
McKusick maintains a list of human genes, accessible by computer
around the world. The entry he dictated before breakfast that
morning was number 4,584.
   But while medicine has advanced greatly since Hopkins began,
some things stay the same, notes Hopkins medical historian A.
McGehee Harvey.
   A committee that reviewed the Hopkins medical curriculum
recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing, and of not only
teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating
new knowledge, Harvey said.
   ``It's a process of rediscovery,'' he said with a smile. ``They
rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place
started.''

   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Here are some medical milestones at Johns
Hopkins University and hospital:
   1889 _ Surgeon William S. Halsted develops the radical
mastectomy for breast cancer.
   1902 _ Hugh Hampton Young designs an operation called a perineal
prostatectomy to treat bladder problems caused by an enlarged
prostate. ``Diamond Jim'' Brady was so grateful for the surgery
that he donated the money to build a urology institute.
   1907 _ Anatomist Ross Harrison creates first culture of living
cells outside the body.
   1913 _ First psychiatric clinic in a general teaching hospital
founded by steel magnate Henry Phipps.
   1913 _ First renal dialysis developed by pharmacology professor
John Jacob Abel. The cylindrical artificial kidney was tested on a
rabbit.
   1926 _ Abel crystallizes insulin, proving it is a protein.
   1944 _ At the suggestion of pediatric cardiologist Helen
Taussig, surgeon Alfred Blalock performs the ``blue baby''
operation to treat a congenital heart defect. The operation helped
pave the way for modern heart surgery.
   1948 _ Allergist Leslie Gay finds that dramamine protects
against motion sickness.
   1968 _ Daniel Nathans and Hamilton Smith discover restriction
enzymes, which are chemical scissors that cut genetic material in
particular places. They shared a 1978 Nobel Prize for their
discovery, now widely used in genetic engineering.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a free high school for Catholic boys,
drawing students from all around New York City. And while other
parochial schools struggle with rising tuitions and dwindling
enrollments, Regis High School in Manhattan has managed to afford
$5 million in improvements in recent years, thanks to the
generosity of donors, largely alumni. The school also has managed
to maintain a standard of academic excellence.

<NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unusual story behind the founding of Regis
High School is captured in the Latin words engraved in stone above
the columns on its classical facade: ``Deo et Patriae Pietas
Christiana Erexit.''
   Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trod
the corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate:
``Built by Christian piety for God and country.''
   Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave her
pastor $500,000 to build a free school for Catholic boys, Regis is
still giving full scholarships to every student it admits.
   It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochial
grammar schools in the five boroughs of New York, the surrounding
three-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield.
   ``Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says Mark
Mazzetti, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling
back and forth from Princeton, N.J.
   ``My friends back home think I live here,'' says Marty Cassidy,
14, a freshman who rises at 5:30 a.m. to commute with his brother,
a sophomore, from New Canaan, Conn.
   ``The journey can take up to two hours each way, but I don't
have any regrets. You can do a lot of homework on the train _ or
you can just sleep.''
   For Luis Taveras, 17, a senior who chose Regis over the Bronx
High School of Science, the trip to school is a 30-minute subway
ride from the Bronx.
   ``I love it here,'' Taveras says. ``When you come from the
Bronx, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind of
world. This school is a meeting ground for people from so many
different backgrounds.''
   Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _
valued by school officials at over $24,000 _ thanks not only to the
generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the
years gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500
alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their
own right.
   About half the $3.3 million budget comes from interest on the
school's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni,
foundations and other sources.
   ``Each year the costs go up at least $200,000,'' says the Rev.
James J. Fischer, S.J., the president since 1980. ``That's not
going to end.'
   But while other Catholic schools struggle with rising tuitions
and contracting enrollments, Regis has been able to pour $5 million
in recent years into expanding science labs and other major
renovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks from
Central Park. The top faculty salaries will hover near $40,000 this
fall.
   Last year's seniors scored an average of 1,273 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, 369 points above the national average. Many
graduates attend select colleges, including 84 who went on to Ivy
League colleges in the past four years alone.
   More than a third of the students come from families with
incomes below $30,000 a year, and 40 percent are the children of
immigrants from Ireland, Puerto Rico, China, the Philippines,
Italy, Cuba, Haiti and three dozen other countries.
   ``It's still very much an immigrants' school,'' says the Rev.
Vincent W. Hevern, S.J., the school psychologist.
   The school, largely white for decades, now has a 28 percent
minority enrollment, including 60 Hispanic students (12 percent),
51 Asian (10 percent) and 28 black (6 percent). Unlike many
parochial schools, especially in big cities, it does not admit
non-Catholics.
   Each fall, on the first Saturday in November, about 900 students
take a standardized admissions test. Students also are judged on
their elementary school grades, activities and, for the finalists,
an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly
before Christmas.
   In 1978 nearly 1,300 students took the entrance test. The number
fell to a low of 770 in 1987 before rebounding. Most of those
admitted score in the top 5 percent on standardized tests _ a
common cutoff for the gifted.
   Regis officials, casting a worried eye on the dwindling pool,
talk openly of the possibility of admitting girls some day, as all
Jesuit colleges and some 10 Jesuit high schools already have done.

   ``There's no comparable opportunity for Catholic girls in the
city of New York,'' says the Rev. Frederick J. O'Brien, the
headmaster. ``If the demographics ever became really horrendous,
that's one way to broaden the pool.''
   O'Brien will be succeeded as headmaster this summer by the Rev.
James F. Kuntz, who has been headmaster of St. Peter's Prep in
Jersey City, New Jersey. Kuntz, a 1966 Regis graduate, will be only
the second alumnus ever to run the school.
   Fischer says he doesn't think Regis' boys-only status could
withstand a legal challenge. ``I think someone would crack that
tomorrow and we'd have to take in girls if they got a good lawyer.''
   The school's two top administrators are two of only a dozen
Jesuits left on the 50-member staff. A quarter-century ago, more
than half the faculty were Jesuit priests or ``scholastics'' _
young Jesuits halfway through the 13-year preparation process
leading to ordination. Not a few of them were alumni. In fact, a
Regis yearbook marking the 50th anniversary in 1964 noted that
almost 10 percent of its alumni were priests.
   But few Regians opt for the priesthood these days. Many of the
Jesuits on the faculty are nearing retirement, and their
replacements are not in sight. It has only one scholastic this
semester ``and we're not sure we'll get a replacement when he
leaves,'' says Frank Walsh, the assistant headmaster.
   Other things have changed at the school. There was a time, says
Lynda Blakinship, chairman of the science department, when a Regis
student was just a student. ``Now he's taking care of the younger
brothers and sisters, cooking the meals, doing the wash while the
mother works. In my advanced placement physics class, two-thirds of
the guys had jobs.''
   No longer do students flunk out in droves in the sort of
educational triage that once characterized many Jesuit schools.
   Latin, long the backbone of the curriculum, became optional four
years ago.
   While that raised the hackles of some alumni, O'Brien says,
``we're trying to get needy students in here. We're bringing in
kids who very often are the first people in their family to
complete high school. They know no reason to study Latin.''
   While it is no longer producing legions of priests, Regis does
inculcate in its students the value of community service.
   Seniors are required to spend Tuesday mornings out as volunteer
tutors in grammar schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods, or
working in hospitals or nursing homes. Most seniors are freed from
all classes during the last trimester to devote full time to such
pursuits, or to work on job internships.
   Its alumni include several university presidents, including
Timothy S. Healy (1942) of Georgetown and Joseph A. O'Hare (1948)
of Fordham, as well as banking executives, corporate chieftains and
judges _ although rival Xavier High School boasts Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia.
   The alumni rolls are also thick with lawyers who first honed
their oratorical skills in the classrooms of Regis and its Hearn
Society, a perennial state debating champion.
   ``We still produce more lawyers than anything else,'' O'Brien
says. ``If you teach here for a while you understand that it is not
an accident. Our kids love to argue.''
   But the school's best-known graduate is Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the AIDS researcher and director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases whom President Bush has called one
of his personal heroes.
   Fauci, a 1958 graduate, remembers fondly his four years
commuting as a straphanger from Brooklyn to the upper East Side,
where he encountered ``an academic excellence that really was
unmatched in all of the educational experiences I've had since
then.''
   Regis is now run by a board that includes both lay and Jesuit
members. Its leaders say it will retain that Jesuit character, even
as the numbers of priests on its staff dwindle.
   Mazzetti, the freshman from Princeton, said his parents have
been pleasantly surprised at how few demands the school makes for
money to pay for extracurriculars or anything else.
   ``At my old school, they always asked for money for every little
thing,'' he says.
   But an older student who overheard the remark chimed in
knowingly, ``Never being asked for money? Give me a break. Wait
until you graduate.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He likes to laugh and make others laugh, but
there's a serious side to Ed Zern. He's concerned about what's
happening to the planet and its creatures. That's why more than 30
years ago he established a program to give conservationists a pat
on the back.

<TEXT>
   Outdoorsman and writer Ed Zern, a
conservationist with a sense of humor, is still spouting the
one-liners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers.
   ``I prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work,'' the
78-year-old Zern likes to say.
   And:
   _``Fishermen are born honest, but they get over it.''
   _``Some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of
string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other. This is
a silly definition, of course, for many fishermen use flies instead
of worms.''
   _``Fish is brain food. People who eat fish have large,
well-developed brains. People with large, well-developed brains
don't fish. It's that simple.''
   Beneath the mischievous grin, however, is a serious concern
about what could lie ahead unless Americans start paying more
attention to the world around them.
   ``Thirty-five years ago, we didn't have waste products of
nuclear plants,'' Zern says. ``We didn't have a lot of the poisons
that are poisoning the atmosphere. We didn't know that spray cans
could destroy our ozone layer.''
   Zern never imagined things would become as bad as they have.
   ``I thought something would be done about it, measures would be
taken,'' he says. ``Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.''
   The bearded, hoary-headed author of the ``Exit Laughing'' column
in Field &amp; Stream magazine, occasionally mistaken in the past for
another avid outdoorsman, the late Ernest Hemingway, is doing what
he can to increase public awareness.
   Zern is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology
entitled ``Hunting and Fishing from A to Zern.'' He also is creator
of the more-or-less imaginary Madison Avenue Rod, Gun, Bloody Mary
and Labrador Retriever Benevolent Association, whose motto is
``Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry.''
   ``It's implicit in everything he does, the respect for the
outdoors, the love for it,'' says Maggie Nichols, Field &amp; Stream's
managing editor.
   That zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards
program Zern founded in 1954 with corporate backing. His aim was,
and still is, to give conservation-conscious folks ``a slap on the
back.''
   His Chevron Conservation Awards Program, believed to be the
oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country, has
recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years.
The 1989 finalists were honored May 17 in Washington, D.C.
   Each year, Zern helps whittle down the list of up to 150
nominees. Some of them, he acknowledges, fit the stereotypical
image of the conservationist.
   ``Little old lady in tennis shoes? They exist and they're
charming people, usually,'' he says, chuckling.
   His all-time favorite finalist is a 70-year-old Pennsylvania
game warden who was honored in the late '50s. The man's wife, who
nominated her husband for the award, thanked Zern profusely
following the ceremony.
   ``This little old lady came up to me and said, `Mr. Zern, I want
to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a
wonderful thing it was for me,''' Zern says. ``I said, `Well, I
should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to
honor your husband.'
   ``She looked sort of surprised. She said, `Oh, no, it isn't
that. We've been married 52 years and this is the first time we've
ever stayed at a hotel.'''
   Zern's passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father, who
headed West Virginia University's Department of Mines during the
1910s. The elder Zern often took his young son on inspection trips.
   ``I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream,''
he recalls.
   Zern caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his family
moved from West Virginia to the Pittsburgh area.
   Since then, Zern has fished and hunted on five continents.
   Occasionally, sometimes by accident and sometimes not, Zern
repeats himself in his ``Exit Laughing'' column, which he began in
1958. It never goes unnoticed.
   ``I always get three or four letters and I hae the same answer
to all of them,'' he says.
   ``I say, `Dear Mr. Thompson, Thank you for your letter of such
and such a date. The last time I heard the Philadelphia Orchestra,
they played the Brahms First and I understand they've done it
several times before. Sincerely yours.'''
   So just where does he get his ideas?
   ``I wish I had one,'' he says. ``I've got a piece due the day
after tomorrow. It was a lot easier when I was younger and
smart-aleckier than I am now.''
   He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes his
hands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from a
manual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer.
   Nevertheless, Zern is at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., only about
half the time. The rest of the time he's on the road.
   His favorite sport, and writing topic, is fishing. Like many
serious anglers, he tosses his catch back into the water.
   Zern doesn't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated.
   ``I'm rather glad everybody doesn't like fishing or the good
fishing places would be so overpopulated,'' he says. ``So I'd never
knowingly write anything that would encourage anybody to go
fishing. You can always build more bowling alleys or tennis courts.
You can't build more trout streams.''
   His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees.
   Among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a Juneau,
Alaska, couple who have developed a school curriculum on marine and
wetlands resources, and a Milwaukee man who has led a campaign to
establish a national park in American Samoa.
   Ten professional conservationists also received $1,000 and a
bronze plaque, including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist
from Massachusetts who is working to save the threatened Piping
Plover, a shore bird.
   The five group finalists included the United Anglers of Casa
Grande High School in Petaluma, Calif., which is rehabilitating
local waterways so fish can migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 students
are raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed to
meet earthquake standards.
   Zern says he has no real way of knowing whether the awards
program or any of his other efforts have had, or will have, a
significant effect.
   ``We don't really know how many souls are saved,'' he says, ``no
matter how tough the sermon.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ One of the managers of a Connecticut bar,
himself a recovering alcoholic, decided adults needed a place to go
to dance and party without being exposed to booze, like the
non-alcoholic clubs for teen-agers. So one night a week the Night
Life VIP Lounge becomes Club Soda, where the drinks are no stronger
than the name implies.

<TEXT>
   The dance music pulses through the art
deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly
stir, shake and blend exotic drinks.
   The adult crowd at Club Soda is partying this Friday night, but
they are all sober. There is no alcohol in the drinks.
   ``It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze,''
says Joseph W. Perugini, one of the managers of Club Soda, a Friday
night non-alcoholic alternative for adults who want to party
without getting drunk.
   ``There are people out there that just can't drink and they have
no where to go.''
   There are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance
without alcohol for teen-agers, but a boozeless bar for adults is
unusual, says Perugini's partner, Thomas Rowlay.
   ``We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's
not what we were looking for,'' Rowlay says.
   Except for Friday nights, Club Soda is actually the Night Life
VIP Lounge, a full-service bar. And the decision to ban booze each
Friday night, typically a busy night for bars, was something
personal for Perugini, a recovering alcoholic.
   ``I'm recovering and I've met through my past two years out
there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the
sauce,'' Perugini says.
   ``I'm just tired of reading, `Just say no to drugs and say no to
booze.' You've got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time
we show people how to live. I feel real good about it.''
   Perugini credits Night Life owners Pat Scarpa and Dave DeStazio,
his employers for a number of years, with giving him the chance to
try the no-booze bar.
   It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager Lester J. Szmajlo
endorses.
   ``You've got people that maybe shouldn't be drinking, that don't
want to drink and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have
that same atmosphere, a party night, and not get drunk,'' Szmajlo
says.
   Does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd? Not according to
Club Soda's two managers.
   ``It's like `Is there life without drinking?' Yeah, there sure
is,'' Rowlay says. ``The important thing is people who don't drink
are no different from people that do, I mean in terms of dullness.
Because you have some people who don't drink who are dull and you
have some people who do drink who are dull.''
   The Club Soda drink menu runs the gamut from the ever-popular
Shirley Temple, ginger ale with a dash of grenadine, to more exotic
items such as the Lemon Spritzer, Pineburst and a host of frozen
coladas, as well a mineral water, cappucino and expresso coffees.
   Joe Mrozinski, head bartender at Club Soda, says the fancy
drinks, at $3.50 a pop, are big sellers. ``There's not much call
for non-alcoholic beer so we discontinued it.'' he said.
   ``The help has been very supportive of this and it's tough to
find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that
they're accustomed to in a real bar,'' Perugini says.
   The club, which opened Feb. 27, averages 130 to 150 people a
night, Perugini says. Most non-drinkers are discovering the club by
word-of-mouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local
newspaper.
   Michelle Killiany, 19, of Bristol, heard about the club in an
alcoholism recovery program in which she participates.
   ``I don't miss not having drinks, not at all,'' she says. ``I
like it here a lot. The mirrors and the non-alcoholic drink. Hang
around, you'll see, it's a gas. It's worth the drive.''
   Donald Corriveau, 29, of New Britain, is becoming a regular.
   ``There's not too many places you can dance without alcohol
being around and we just started to avoid those places,'' he says.
``We're recovering from that alcohol experience and being around
those kinds of bars is not good.''
   There is a doorman at Club Soda, not to check ID's but to check
for boozers and potential troublemakers. The doorman does not admit
anyone who has been drinking.
   ``Some people may come in for a goof, but that's on them,''
Perugini says. ``They're the ones who paid the five bucks to come
in and walk right out.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's something of a cross between ``Ripley's
Believe It or Not'' and ``60 Minutes,'' which may have inspired its
name. Soviet television's rapid-fire news show ``600 Seconds,''
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the
establishment, has become immensely popular since it went on the
air. Before Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, such a program would
have been unthinkable in the Soviet Union.

   A lost bull roams a busy city street.
Prostitutes woo foreign customers. A holiday bombing rips off a
man's legs.
   These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviet
television screens as glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
drive for openness, goes video.
   Traditionally, the Kremlin has used state-run television as it
did other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather than
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just
plain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on
subjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commands
unlimited time, and news shows spend a lot of time reporting lists
of government leaders seeing each other off on trips.
   But Gorbachev is a more lively TV personality than his
predecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speeches
and broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first time
this winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other on
television.
   Western music videos are shown routinely, ``space bridges''
bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Soviet
living rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives
Soviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles.
   One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat stories
about the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is ``600
Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on Leningrad television that has
become a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987.
   One avid fan of 30-year-old anchorman Alexander Nezorov said the
program ``shows the Soviet people what they were torn away from all
their lives, things that we learned to close our eyes to.''
   Six days a week, 15 million people in Leningrad, Moscow and
other regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latest
sensations from the Soviet Union's second-largest city.
   ``600 Seconds,'' the news magazine show ``Fifth Wheel,'' the
debate program ``Public Opinion'' and the music discussion program
``Musical Boxing Ring'' make Leningrad television among the most
progressive in the Soviet Union, reinforcing the reputation of the
city built by Peter the Great as a window on the West.
   ``600 Seconds'' is like a cross between ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not'' and ``60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show,
``Our City Scandal-Monger.''
   At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes
of news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotaped
reports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digital
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the
remaining seconds.
   Everything about the show sets it apart from ordinary
broadcasts, which are presented in formal language in detail, and
are visually dull.
   The show's popularity is evident to the staff. About 200 calls
and dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny, dingy room in
Leningrad's TV center where two harried producers and Nevzorov work
under a crumbling portrait of Lenin. Ironically, no portrait of
Gorbachev, whose glasnost policy made the program possible, hangs
on the wall.
   Nevzorov's irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishes
stirring up the town with what he calls ``sensations.'' The program
consists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of the
bizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet.
   In a recent broadcast, ``600 Seconds'' took on one of the city's
biggest department stores, accusing its employees of selling highly
sought Finnish clothing under the table. The store demanded a
retraction, but Nevzorov told viewers later that police had
investigated and that ``no excuses can be made.''
   The program has stopped reporting about dogs, says producer
Kirill M. Shishkin, because the staff was swamped with calls for
days by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcast
reported the dog's owner had been killed in a car accident.
   Nevzorov, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races around
this city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for his
Monday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from the
public and police.
   He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go
along with such status in the West _ no secretary, no private
office, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $475 a
month.
   Adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs.
The Soviet press has praised his pioneering style, and colleagues
say he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public.
Journalism students at Moscow State University are studying his
program as a model of how news should be reported on television.
   But Nevzorov rejects the label journalist. He is a former horse
trainer and TV scriptwriter, and bristles when the word journalist
is mentioned. Most Soviet journalists, he said, could not come up
with the stories he does, and he doesn't agree with the Western
notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize
the news.
   He openly acknowledges that cooperatives, the fledgling private
businesses spawned by Gorbachev's reforms, are a target. ``Whenever
we have the opportunity to nail them, we do,'' he says.
   The public turns to ``600 Seconds'' to fight the Soviet
bureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program to
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his
apartment window.
   ``600 Seconds'' and other Leningrad TV programs have helped lift
the veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution,
murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject,
privileges of the Soviet elite. One episode of ``Fifth Wheel,'' for
instance, complained that elaborate government homes were being
well maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles.
   But there are still forbidden themes. Nevzorov's boss, Alexander
A. Yurkov, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary.
   Edward A. Sagalayev, head of Soviet TV's Information Department,
who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult.
``I also have my bosses. We have our minister. He has his
deputies...And it is not always possible to overcome
psychologically these traditions.''

   While much of Soviet television is looking more
Western, the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers
to do things the old-fashioned way.
   ``Hello, comrades,'' Igor Kirillov says as he peers through
thick bifocals to begin Vremya, the nightly news on
state-controlled television.
   He has uttered those same words since Vremya first went on the
air on Jan. 1, 1968, and became a main news source for the Soviet
Union's 285 million people.
   While other Soviet TV programs and the press are tapping
glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness, to
air sensations about crime, history, or life in the West, Vremya
has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago.
   When the superpowers agreed last March that U.S. President
Ronald Reagan would travel to the country he had called an ``evil
empire,'' a major announcement worldwide, Soviets had to sit
through two hours of a Gorbachev speech about farming and a story
about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from Vremya,
which is Russian for time.
   Vremya still dwells on long-winded reports about the Soviet
economy, often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore
dubbed ``tractor news.''
   nd in static pictures that make Western producers cringe,
cameras often fix on Kirillov and other announcers reading lengthy
government statements.
   Vremya has its high points, however. When an earthquake killed
thousands on Dec. 7 in Armenia, Vremya aired a dramatic report from
the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks.
   Kirillov, 57, read the news during the ``period of stagnation,''
the conservative rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, and has
continued through the glasnost years.
   Interviewed in Vremya's tiny studio, Kirillov compared the
program, then and now.
   ``Earlier it was good,'' he said through gritted teeth,
indicating some discomfort with that evaluation. Switching to his
full baritone voice, he added: ``Now it is also good.''
   Other TV programs borrow the style of American broadcasts.
Kirillov concedes he watches the Cable News Network, but says he is
sticking to his old-fashioned, formal style.
   ``We like not to rush, so it comes from the soul,'' he says.
Trained as an actor, he believes anchormen should express their
opinions through intonation and gestures.
   But Kirillov is part of a vanishing breed. In five to 10 years,
he predicts, multitalented professionals of a ``higher level
intellectually'' will replace Vremya's theatrically trained
announcers.
   A new man in charge of Vremya described the ideal anchorman.
   ``He should be a little bit of a journalist, a little bit of an
actor, a little bit of a politician,'' says Edward M. Sagalayev,
head of Soviet TV's Information Department.
   Producers are spicing up Vremya with graphics, foreign video
plucked off communications satellites, and shorter, more
interesting and timely reports.
   Sagalayev says Vremya lags behind other programs because it was
born before glasnost, when ``there was a big difference between
politics and real life,'' and ``because it has much official and
government information.''
   But, he adds, ``Tractor news is really a tradition that we must
abandon. For decades, the impression was formed that economic
information must occupy the top place.''
   Pressure for change is coming from many directions. The
Communist Party newspaper Pravda said in 1986 the program was dull,
and TV officials agree it still is.
   ``It must be more dynamic, more informative, more visual,'' says
Alexander A. Yurkov, a top official of Leningrad television,
popular for its Western-style programs.
   Sagalayev, who gained a reputation as a reformer when he
produced the live news and entertainment show Vzglyad, agrees and
he hopes to make Vremya more appealing.
   ``News should be what interests millions of viewers, and not a
small group of people,'' he says.

   Dinah Manoff's earlier work for the producers
of ``Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in the
new NBC comedy.
   The show, about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly
finds himself living alone, was created by Susan Harris, who also
created ``Soap'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   Manoff plays Carol Weston, the self-absorbed daughter of the
pediatrician, played by Richard Mulligan, and sister of a
policewoman, played by Kristy McNichol.
   ``They auditioned hundreds of actresses,'' she says. ``Everybody
I knew went in for that role. They couldn't find what they were
looking for.''
   It would seem that Manoff would have had an edge because she had
played Elaine Lefkowitz in ``Soap'' for the producers,
Witt-Thomas-Harris.
   But, she says, ``They didn't think I was right for the part at
first because of the work I'd done in `Soap.' The characters were
different. They didn't want the New York, Jewish, fast-talking,
tough Mafia princess I played in `Soap.' I'd played the same kind
of character in the movie `I Ought To Be in Pictures.'
   ``So I asked to read. When I read I made sure that none of that
was showing. And they saw it and cast me.''
   Manoff says she has ``a real affinity'' for the writing of Susan
Harris.
   ``I understand her rhythm,'' she says. ``I understand her
language.''
   Manoff also claims an affinity with her character in ``Empty
Nest.''
   ``Carol, in my mind, is always on her way to therapy or coming
from therapy,'' she says. ``She's usually in a self-absorbed state
of mind. For me, the character is rooted in PMS, pre-menstrual
syndrome.
   ``My favorite line is when Kristy comes bounding down the stairs
and says, `My greatest fear has happened. I'm falling in love.'
Carol says, `My greatest fear is that there is no such thing as PMS
and this is who I really am.' Every woman in the audience howled
for 10 minutes. That's who Carol is and who I am on my worst days.''
   She disagrees with descriptions of Carol as neurotic. ``She's
just terribly self-involved,'' she says. ``Everything has to
revolve around her. If there's a disaster somewhere, her only
thought is how does it affect her. She regularly takes her
emotional temperature.''
   Manoff grew up in a show business family. Her mother is
actress-director Lee Grant and her stepfather is producer Joe
Feury. Last summer she worked in ``Boy's Life,'' a movie made on
location in South Carolina directed by her mother and produced by
her stepfather.
   ``It was very interesting,'' she says. ``It was kind of like
being 14 and told to clean up your room. That's the downside. The
upside is that she and I are very close friends and very admiring
of each other as actresses and artists.
   ``I know my work is safe with her because she will only let me
do good work. But when she's directing we have to go back to a
child-parent relationship. It pushes all my buttons when she tells
me how to fix my hair and how to dress. I try not to call her Mom
on the set, but when I'm tired and cranky it slips out.''
   She'd worked for her mother once before, on a TV movie called
``A Matter of Sex.'' The movie, which also starred Jean Stapleton,
was about sexual discrimination in the workplace.
   She didn't begin acting until she was 19 because her mother
didn't want her to be a child actor. She was a college film student
briefly, then quit to pursue her acting career.
   ``I'd like to direct someday,'' she says, ``but I'll leave
filmmaking for later in life. Acting is creative and a release from
your emotions. That's fun. Directing is more comfortable and puts
you in charge. As an actor you have to be open and vulnerable. As
director you get to be an adult doing a grown-up job.''
   Manoff studied at the Actor's Studio and made her professional
debut in a production for PBS called ``The Great Cherub Knitwear
Strike.'' Next, she did a small role on the TV series ``Welcome
Back, Kotter.''
   Manoff won a Tony in 1980 for her Broadway role in ``I Ought To
Be In Pictures.'' She reprised her role in the movie version.
   Her only other series was ``Soap,'' on which she played the
daughter of a gangster and the wife of Danny Dallas (Ted Wass). ``I
was spoiled and mean, a real pain,'' she says. ``Then I turned
nice. It was `The Taming of the Shrew,' or the Jew. I became sweet
and loving and there was no place for my character to go, so they
killed me off.''
   Her film ``Child's Play'' is just out and ``Bloodhounds of
Broadway'' is due in September. Another movie, a thriller called
``Backfire,'' is coming up on Showtime.
   She is starting a new movie called ``Welcome Home, Roxie
Carmichael,'' which also stars Winona Ryder and Jeff Daniels.

   On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on the
other side the Sharks. The rival gangs from ``West Side Story''
huddle around microphones and watch conductor Paul Gemignani on a
small podium in the middle of a vast wood-paneled room filled with
musicians.
   It's a Sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' are in RCA Records' Studio A on West 44th
Street.
   The singers look at Gemignani. The conducter, wearing
headphones, glances at a man standing over a control panel in a
soundproof booth near the stage. Take after take is recorded until
Jay David Saks is satisfied.
   Saks, an RCA Records producer, is the man who must capture the
sound of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' a celebration of some of the
biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer.
Besides a suite of dances from ``West Side Story,'' the show
includes numbers from ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``The King and I,''
``Gypsy,'' ``Peter Pan'' and others.
   The final result, released in May on two records or two
cassettes or two compact discs, is one of the most lavish original
cast recordings ever made. It includes more than 120 minutes of
music and a 62-page booklet with extensive notes on each of the
musicals included in the show.
   ``Cast albums are very demanding,'' says Saks, who has been in
the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album
guru Thomas Z. Shepard at Columbia Records. ``They require a great
deal of advance preparation and a lot of study. If you're going to
record the Beethoven `Seventh Symphony,' you don't have to sit
there in advance and decide whether you're going to take it up a
key or whether you're going to leave out the third movement.
   ``But in the case of a Broadway show, you have a theatrical work
that's designed for the stage, and how does it translate to a
record when you have nothing to go by except what you're hearing,''
he says. ``Frequently you have to change the reality of what is
happening musically to re-create more accurately the memory in the
listener.''
   Before the taping sessions, Saks wasn't sure how ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' would work on record. It presented special
problems.
   ``Most of this music is familiar, and most of it has been
recorded before,'' he recalls. ``For example, you don't want to
have just another recording of `West Side Story.' Plus there's a
lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show. So what do
you do with it?''
   Saks decided to record not just the music, but the feel of the
stage production. He brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he
calls ``crowd material,'' not just the singing. In the case of the
``West Side Story'' segment, that meant having 30 or 40 or 50
people up on stage making fight or dance hall sounds for the
``Mambo'' number or the fight sequence.
   ``I think without that, we would have ended up with another
small orchestra recording of music from `West Side Story,''' he
says. ``We wanted to make it feel like you were in the theater.''
   Many of the composers and lyricists represented in ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway,'' including Stephen Sondheim, Morton Gould, Jule
Styne, Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, came to the February
recording sessions after having pre-production conferences with
Saks.
   In the past, most Broadway musicals were recorded in one day,
usually the company's day off. Some still are, but ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' took three days, spread over two weeks, to
complete.
   For one reason, it was twice as long as a regular cast
recording. It has a large cast _ 62 performers _ and a large
orchestra _ 42 musicians plus two players added for the ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' segment.
   For another, technical advances have allowed for more material
to be placed on a record, tape or compact disc.
   ``In the old days, there was a limitation as to how much music
you could put on a record without having the recording suffer
technically,'' Saks says. ``If there were 60 minutes worth of
recordable music in a show, producers had to make some hard
decisions as what to keep and what not to keep because they
couldn't get more than 22 or 24 minutes on a side.''
   Today, compact discs can handle up to 74 or 75 minutes of
material without much difficulty. More of a show can be put on a
single CD than could ever fit on a record.
   ``Now, we say that anything worth recording, we do record,''
Saks says.
   Saks jumped to RCA in 1974 when Shepard did. He also became a
producer of classical recordings, supervising albums by such
orchestras as the Chicago Symphony conducted by James Levine and
the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. But he also
assisted Shepard on some of the best cast recordings ever made,
including ``Sunday in the Park with George'' and ``Sweeney Todd.''
   His first solo cast recording as a producer was ``Starting Here,
Starting Now,'' a tiny off-Broadway musical revue by David Shire
and Richard Maltby Jr. When Shepard left RCA in 1986, Saks took
over its Broadway cast album production. In the last two years, he
has done ``Anything Goes,'' ``Legs Diamond'' and ``Into the
Woods,'' for which he won a Grammy.
   And RCA has dominated the cast album market since, also
recording such Broadway shows as ``Chess'' and ``Sarafina!'' during
the same time period. Saks didn't do those recordings. They were
produced by their own composers.
   ``I'm a strong believer in not doing what you don't think you
can do well,'' he says.

   Millions of Christians in the Middle East
and North Africa, faced with Moslem and Jewish fundamentalism, feel
they are treading the narrow lip of a volcano.
   ``Many believe they have no future in this area,'' said Gabriel
Habib, General-Secretary of the Cyprus-based Middle East Council of
Churches.
   ``You have a climate of despair and hopelessness. ... Christians
fear the future.''
   An estimated 12 million to 14 million Christians live in the
region, gathered in minority pockets among 120 million Moslems and
4 million Jews.
   ``As Christians, the biggest challenge we face is the rising
militant fundamentalism of Islam and the militant fundamentalism of
Judaism of Israel,'' said Dr. George Sabra, assistant professor of
theology at the Near East School of Theology in west Beirut.
   Moslem persecution of the followers of Jesus dates from the
Crusades, when they were viewed as fifth columnists for the
invading Europeans who came to recover the Holy Land.
   That suspicion lingers.
   ``Fundamentalists ought to understand that pluralism in the Arab
world is a necessity of life,'' said Bishop Eliya Khoury, head of
the Anglican Church in Jordan. ``If not, believe me, extremism
breeds only opposite extremism.''
   In Lebanon, Maronite Catholics see their fight in a 14-year-old
civil war as another chapter in a centuries-old struggle for
survival against Islam.
   The Maronites, the only Christians to have held political power
in the modern Arab world, claim that Lebanon's Shiite Moslems want
to create an Islamic state modeled on Iran.
   Their fight to hold onto their traditional privileges is the
taproot of Lebanon's civil war.
   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct political
history,'' said Professor Kamal Salibi, who teaches history at the
American University of Beirut.
   ``They fear being overwhelmed. ... If the system is democratized
they would be outvoted and they can't carry the day.''
   Maronite extremism is the starkest Christian reaction to the
growth of both Islamic and Jewish fundamentalism in the Middle East.
   Christians increasingly believe that if they do not assert their
own beliefs they might be subsumed by fundamentalist zeal.
   ``In addition to sharing with everyone else the wars, the
economic problems, the Great Power challenges, ... Christians are
caught between Israel on the one hand and Islam on the other,'' the
Council of Churches' Habib said.
   But their leaders fear that an aggressive response could trigger
their own destruction. The tension pushes thousands to emigrate.
   The Maronites, once slightly more than 50 percent of Lebanon's
population, have dwindled to about 30 percent.
   Christians who remain in the region worry about the loss of
their special identity.
   Mary Saliba, a Christian mother living in predominately Moslem
west Beirut, says she sends her four children as often as she can
to the Christian sector.
   ``I don't want them to end up marrying Moslems,'' she said.
   Moslems see the Maronites as warring to keep their lockhold on
the Lebanon's presidency and other centers of power reserved for
them since independence from France in 1943.
   Under Israel's laws, all citizens are guaranteed equal civil
rights. But its creation as a state for Jews effectively
marginalized Christians, Christian leaders say.
   The political factor is heightened because most Christians in
the Holy Land are Palestinians, who fundamentalist Jewish groups
seek to expel from the Jordan River's West Bank, taken by Israel
since the 1967 war.
   In the Islamic belief, Christians and Jews are considered
harbingers of the true faith and are protected as fellow believers
in the Old Testament.
   But there is a deep fear ``of fundamentalists overthrowing
existing regimes and establishing societies based on Sharia
(Islamic law),'' said Habib.
   These laws include banning pork, veiling women, cutting off the
hands of convicted thieves and stoning adulteresses.
   Only about 180,000 Christians, mostly Armenians, remain in Iran.
Tens of thousands left after the 1979 Islamic revolution instituted
Sharia.
   ``You can't study Armenian or the Bible there,'' said Joseph, a
15-year-old whose family moved to Cyprus so he could enroll in the
Armenian school.
   ``There are lots of extra lessons _ Arabic, the Koran, Persian _
which I won't need in the future,'' he said.
   Sudan is locked in a civil war because Christians in its south
loath the Islamic rules voted in by the northern Moslems.
   Moslem clerics call such fears baseless.

   Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Lebanon`s
Shiite fundamentalists, said Christians should be guided by the
Biblical verse: ``Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God
what is God's.''
   ``There's no conflict between Christianity and Islam when Islam
demands the implementation of Sharia,'' he added. ``What's the
difference between implementing the Islamic order in a Christian
area and implementing the Marxist or the French or any other system
in a Christian area?''
   The problem, Christians say, is that a religious state would
intervene. They noted, for example, that fundamentalist Moslem
militias forced the American University of Beirut to alter its
courses of study.
   The Koran, Islam's holy book, was dropped from a cultural
studies course after the fundamentalists objected its use as one
text among many. They also objected to Christians teaching about
Islam.
   In Egypt, the Moslem-Christian strain starts with the census.
Militant Christian Copts claim they number 12 million. The
government sets the number at 3 million. The true figure is
believed to be around 7 million.
   Egypt's Islamic fundamentalist underground occasionally vents
its anger on the Copts, who trace their beginnings to St. Paul in
the year 50.
   The Moslem militants who assassinated President Anwar Sadat in
1981 were accused of robbing rich Coptic jewellers for funds.
   Violence erupted in the Egyptian fundamentalist strongholds of
Minya and Assiut in 1987 after the fundamentalists accused Copts of
spraying crosses on Moslems' clothing.
   Copts do attain influential positions in Egypt's government. The
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Butros Ghali, and the
ministers of emigration and international cooperation are Copts.
   Their co-religionists have reached high posts in the judiciary
and the army. But none has ever been defense minister or
commander-in-chief.
   They also face some legal restrictions. For example, a Coptic
man can marry a Moslem woman only if he converts to Islam.
   ``Copts always have to do things by the back door,'' said one
man who produces and distributes Bible-study videos.
   ``Copts feel a certain insecurity,'' said an Egyptian who would
identify himself only by his first name, Henein. ``They don't have
easy access to superior positions.''
   The covert discrimination often tips the scales for Christians
deciding to emigrate.
   Turkey has a secular government but bans Christians from
government posts. Christians there said the historical animosity
between the two communities has ebbed, but many high school
students emigrate, leaving behind an increasingly elderly community.
   Fewer than 10,000 Christians remain in the old city of
Jerusalem, according to church statistics. Some fear it might
shrink to the point of virtual extinction.
   ``Christianity might be represented by monuments, buildings and
stones rather than by people,'' said the Most Rev. Samir Kafity,
Anglican bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.
   Most Western Christians ``don't realize there's a living
Christian community in the Middle East,'' said Ramy Khoury, a
publisher and writer in Amman, Jordan. ``When they come here and
see Christians they're slightly surprised.''
   In many Arab countries, Christians try to keep a low profile to
avoid trouble.
   In Egypt, the head of the Coptic Church, Pope Shenouda III,
recently blocked an attempt to form a Coptic political party.
   ``Those who want peace and national unity must mesh with their
Moslem brothers,'' he said. ``Establishing a Christian party will
create negative reactions.''

   Moslems recognize Jesus as a prophet, but
the Crusades in the Middle Ages planted suspicions among them that
Christians were allied with those who wanted to subvert Islam.
   Those suspicions are rekindled today by a new kind of Crusader,
Christian evangelists such as Americans Jerry Falwell and Pat
Robertson.
   They preach that Israel fulfills Biblical prophecies predicting
the arrival of a new Messiah and seek to convert Moslems.
   ``The Crusaders came out of the conviction that we were not
Christian enough,'' said Gabriel Habib, General Secretary of the
Cyprus-based Middle East Council of Churches.
   Crusader castles dot the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, Israel
and Jordan, symbols that Christianity, although born in the Holy
Land, was later a colonizer.
   Now the Christian fundamentalists are ``projecting an image of
Christianity of political and economic power. It's the image of a
new crusade, this time allied with Israel,'' Habib said.
   The fundamentalist groups have opened the so-called
International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, where Israel has its
capital, to spread their teachings.
   A glossy tract published by a California church says: ``Jesus is
coming to rule _ from Jerusalem.''
   Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network has a television
station in an Israeli-held sector of south Lebanon. It has been
destroyed twice in bombing attacks.
   The station's administrative manager, who agreed to be
interviewed only on condition of anonymity, said Robertson's
support for Israel is a personal statement and the station tries to
avoid politics.
   Almost 70 percent of its programming ranges from U.S. football
to ``Magnum P.I.,'' he said.
   But he noted that the rest are ``programs to inspire people in
their faith.'' Pro-Iranian Moslem militants in Lebanon would like
to see these off the air, he said.
   Evangelical groups say they work in the Middle East because the
region's Christians, isolated in minority pockets around the Arab
world, are not forceful enough.
   Seeking converts ``is what the Gospel calls them to do among
their own people,'' said a missionary with the Assembly of God who
did not want his name used because it might limit his ability to
travel in the region.
   ``I wish every Coptic priest, every Roman Catholic priest would
do it,'' he added.

   These are the five main Christian groups of the Middle East:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES _ Founded in Christianity's early
years, these are independent churches linked to specific nations or
ethnic groups. The Coptic Orthodox Church, believed founded by St.
Mark in the year 50, is the largest in the Middle East with about 7
million followers, mostly in Egypt. The others are the 2-million
member Armenian Orthodox Church and the Syrian Orthodox Church.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES _ Also known as Greek Orthodox, these
are self-governing and differ from the Oriental Orthodox churches
on doctrinal decisions handed down before the year 800. The largest
is the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, with
about 1.3 million followers, mostly in Syria. Others include the
the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Church of Cyprus
and the Church of Mount Sinai, represented by about a dozen monks
at the famous shrine where Moses is said to have received the Ten
Commandments.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CATHOLICS _ They consist of seven branches. All but the Maronite
Catholics, the largest Christian sect in Lebanon, broke from
branches of the Orthodox churches. The Maronites claim to have 1
million members in Lebanon and 6.7 million outside the region. The
others range in membership from 30,000 to 300,000 and include the
Chaldean Catholic Patriarchate of Babylon, the largest Christian
community in Iraq; and the Syrian Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch,
which celebrates its liturgy in Jesus' language of Aramaic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST _ Its largest group, 250,000
members, is in Baghdad, Iraq. The church long been pilloried by
others Christians, allegedly for following the teachings of
Nestorius, an excommunicated 5th century patriarch of
Constantinople.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROTESTANTS _ Now numbering about 100,000 members, Protestant
churches were established in the Middle East in the early 19th
century by missionaries. U.S. evangelistic groups, such as those
led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Rev. Pat Robertson, are
active in Jerusalem and southern Lebanon.

   If there's a deep black hole in South America,
Bolivia has been in it. But now, as some of its more advanced
neighbors might be on the verge of falling in, Bolivia may be
coming out. The light at the top offers hope for the poorest
country on the continent but it's still only a glimmer. This is one
in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the
economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

<TEXT>
   A remarkable economic turnaround and a
newfound political stability are giving hope to the South American
country that perhaps most needs it.
   But despite Bolivia's visions of a brighter future, its present
remains bleak:
   _Of every 10 workers, two can't find jobs and one has turned to
the illegal cocaine business.
   _One of every 10 newborns doesn't survive infancy _ the worst
rate in the Americas.
   _Of every 1,000 Bolivians, 14 die each year. That's nearly
double the South American average.
   The new leadership that will grapple with the country's grave
problems won't be known until at least Aug. 4, when Congress
convenes to choose a new president. In a general election May 7,
all candidates fell short of the absolute majority needed for
direct election, so the legislature must pick from the top three
finishers: Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the former dictator Hugo
Banzer Suarez and Jaime Paz Zamora.
   All three have pledged, however, to stick with an economic
program that transformed Bolivia from South America's most chaotic
nation into what some are calling a Third World model.
   Bolivia has had 76 governments since independence from Spain in
1825 _ half of them de facto military governments and the other
half democratically elected.
   From 1978 to 1982, its 6.9 million people _ many of them
descendants of an Indian culture that predated Inca conquests in
Bolivia by several centuries _ saw eight changes of government.
They included three bloody military coups.
   Democracy was re-established in 1982, but the government of
then-President Hernan Siles Zuazo proved unable to reverse an
economic tailspin and an inflation rate that soared to an
inconceivable rate of 23,000 percent a year.
   A 10-million peso note shrank in value to $5, and the Central
Bank confessed to not a penny in reserves.
   When President Victor Paz Estenssoro was elected to replace
Siles Zuazo in 1985, he declared simply but dramatically: ``Bolivia
is dying on us.''
   His government prescribed a drastic cure: a 95-percent currency
devaluation, an end to subsidized prices and a 10-fold increase in
the price of gasoline, and the layoff of 35,000 state tin miners
and other government employees. While public spending was slashed,
an effective new tax system brought in additional revenues.
   The new program was put to an immediate test when world market
prices for tin and oil, the country's main exports, plunged
drastically. The plan nonetheless took hold.
   Inflation dropped and leveled off at about 10 percent a year _
among South America's lowest rates. In 1987 and 1988, the country
enjoyed modest but steady economic growth for the first time in
many years.
   Once-scarce foreign investment is picking up, as is foreign aid.
Some factories and new homes and office buildings are going up.
With new tax revenues, the government is paving streets and
painting public buildings.
   ``Bolivia is a country that has made a complete turnaround,''
U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said in an interview. ``It has
reversed the trend toward economic collapse and established the
base for recovery.''
   Gelbard said he expects the recovery to continue no matter which
of the three candidates is chosen president, since each is
committed to the program.
   ``I'm very optimistic.''
   Fernando Mendoza, World Bank representative in Bolivia, said the
Bolivian program ``represents a very important example for Latin
America and other countries that are passing through a similar
situation.''
   While such countries as nearby Brazil and Argentina try to
entangle themselves from foreign debt, Bolivia, because of its
poverty, is under less pressure from foreign creditors.
   Unlike other debtor countries, Bolivia owes most of its
$4.2-billion foreign debt to governments or international
assistance agencies, which have been more willing to reschedule
payment.
   Commercial lenders have virtually written off the $700 million
Bolivia owes them, and has allowed the government to buy half of it
back at 11 percent of its face value.

   With economic stability has come political steadiness. When Paz
Estenssoro hands over power in August, he'll be the first elected
president to finish out his full term in 25 years.
   But the social cost of the program has been excruciating,
nevertheless, and the benefits so far have not reached many of the
jobless or the 2 million peasant farmers who know only of
subsistence.
   Unemployment rose to a staggering 25 percent _ and still remains
above 20 percent. Without government subsidies, prices for many
basic goods soared to levels similar to those of industrialized
countries, while wages remained at Third World levels. The minimum
legal wage is equivalent to $1.50 a day.
   In a wrenching upheaval, thousands of ex-miners were forced to
abandon the homes on the windy high plains. Among them were Indians
whose ancestors had lived there for millenia. About 75 percent of
Bolivia's people are of Quechua or Aymaya Indian ancestry and about
half the population lives in the countryside.
   Many moved into the swollen shantytowns on the fringes of La Paz
and other major cities. Others descended into the tropical lowlands
and began growing coca, the raw material for cocaine.
   Of a national work force of about 3 million, an estimated
300,000 make their livelihood in some aspect of the cocaine
industry _ growing, processing or smuggling. The business brings in
$200 million to $300 million a year _ equal to about half all legal
export earnings.
   Indeed, the drug profits helped cushion the impact of the
government belt-tightening policies. Some say the country must now
be gently weaned from the illicit activity.
   ``A complete curtailment of cocaine without viable alternatives
could be devastating to the national economy,'' said a Maryknoll
priest, Patrick Henry. He works with addicted and abandoned
children in the city of Cochabamba, the gateway to the country's
principal coca-growing area, the Chapare.
   The government, as well as all three top presidential
candidates, oppose forced eradication of coca farms by burning or
spraying with herbicides, as is being tried in other South American
countries.
   Instead they favor a U.S.-financed plan, now in its third year,
to persuade coca farmers to switch to other crops and to leave the
now-overpopulated Chapare.
   But they also contend that the United States and other wealthy
cocaine-importing countries must put up more money for the program
_ some $300 million to $500 million over a three-year period.
   ``The big problem is getting the developed world to cooperate,''
said Sanchez de Lozada, the presidential candidate of Paz
Estenssoro's conservative Revolutionary Nationalist Movement.
``They seem to prefer to have somebody they can blame the drug
problem on rather than finding a solution.''
   ``If you give us the resources, we have the will,'' he added in
a conversation with foreign reporters.
   The United States spends about $55 million a year on drug
interdiction and crop-switching programs in Bolivia. It provides
more than $100 million a year in aid to Bolivia.
   In all, foreign aid from the industrialized world and
international lending agencies is expected to total $365 million in
loans and donations this year. Government officials recognize that
the assistance is vital to health programs and development projects
aimed at bettering life in South America's poorest country.
   Authorities agree that the country's most desperate need is more
and better-paying jobs. They expect that to result from the
economic growth the country now is enjoying but acknowledge that
the process is a gradual one.
   Among the new private investors are several foreign mining and
petroluem companies. But the country sees a need to reduce its
heavy reliance on mineral production by promoting non-traditional
exports such as soya, lumber, fruit, flowers and alpaca wool.
   In 1992, a natural gas sales contract with Argentina that
provides more than half of the country's export earnings will
expire. Bolivia has begun negotiating with another neighbor,
Brazil, to sell them gas but the arrangements will take several
more years.

   Here are some facts and figures on Bolivia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Bolivia is landlocked in the heart of South America
and is roughly the size of Texas and Arkansas combined. It is is
divided into three distinct geographical regions: the highlands,
the mountainous valley regions and sub-tropical lowlands. Major
cities such as La Paz, Oruro and Potosi are part of the Andes
mountain range. The lowlands include the vast savannas and
impenetrable jungles of the Beni, Pando and Santa Cruz departments,
which are traversed by thousands of miles of rivers that feed into
the Amazon.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Bolivia's 6.9 population is largely made up of
people of Quechua and Aymara Indian origin. Although Spanish is the
official language, Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken in rural
areas and in major cities. In the tropical regions, Guarani and
other native languages are also spoken. The population is largely
Roman Catholic, although Indian farmers maintain a mixture of
Catholic and Indian beliefs that include worship of a goddess of
the earth. The last two decades have seen a significant migration
of Quechua and Aymara farmers to the lowland regions, including
areas that produce sugar cane, coffee and coca leaf, which is
processed into cocaine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Aymara and other Indian cultures, which predate by
several centuries the Inca conquest of Bolivia, established an
elaborate system of government and built the city of Tiwanacu with
its vast irrigated fields and elaborate stone and ceramic figures.
The Incas conquered the highlands and some of the lowland regions
of Bolivia in the 13th century. The Spanish conquerors took over in
1538. Bolivia, which is named after its liberator Simon Bolivar,
became independent from Spain in 1825 and separated itself from
Peru. In a series of wars over the next century, Bolivia lost its
Pacific coast to Chile, part of its Amazon to Brazil and some of
its southern territory to Paraguay.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Bolivia has a free market economy that has begun
to see stability. In 1985, tough austerity measures were used to
control hyper-inflation, which had soared to 23,000 percent.
Inflation has plunged to 15 percent and the government estimates
that the economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 1989. Bolivia seeks
foreign investors interested in mining, petroleum exploration and
agriculture. Bolivia is still heavily dependent, however, on
cocaine trafficking, which brings in an estimated $200 million to
$300 million a year and provides a livelihood to 300,000 Bolivians.
Natural gas, which earned $214 million in exports last year, has
supplanted minerals as the main source of export earnings, which
totalled $600.5 million in 1988. Mineral exports amounted to $196
million in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CULTURE _ Bolivia has a rich and dynamic culture rooted in
its Indian heritage. Aymara and Quechua Indians make exquisite
weavings and outfits and have elaborate rituals and festivals that
date to pre-Colombian times. The rich cultural diversity is
manifest during carnival in the mining city of Oruro and Gran Poder
in La Paz when thousands of dancers wearing elaborate masks and
outfits pay homage to patron saints. Bolivia also has a rich
musical and visual arts tradition.

<DATELINE>ON THE RHINE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heinz-Peter Distel, leathery
hands gripping an iron shipwheel, guides his 1,200-ton live-in
barge downriver in a family tradition nearly as old as the medieval
castles looming on both sides of the mighty Rhine River.
   ``I was born on the water, and I don't really have any desire to
leave it. This is in my blood,'' says Distel, part of a breed of
fiercely independent West Germans who work and live on family-owned
transport barges.
   Distel and his wife, Helga, are the sole owners, operators and
residents of the Stadt Monheim, a workhorse barge that's nearly the
length of a football field and has most of the comforts of a
conventional home.
   The 52-year-old Distel is a man of few words.
   Ensconsed high up in the pilot house next to his multi-band
radio, he keeps his vision firmly fixed on the fast-running river
and steers a steady course through central West Germany.
   Twin diesel engines throb powerfully below, propelling the
vessel at a good clip past famous old castles like the picturesque
Marksburg near Koblenz.
   The Drachenfels, a mountain where the legendary Germanic hero
Siegfried slew a dragon, appears in the distance as the Stadt
Monheim glides north.
   Helga, Distel's 47-year-old wife and sole crewmember, carries a
tray with vegetable soup, wurst and pudding up the outside iron
staircase to her husband from their living quarters on the rear
deck.
   She ducks quickly into the pilot house, helped out by a strong
Rhine wind blowing across the port side.
   Another barge comes into view on the starboard side, and Mrs.
Distel waves enthusiastically to the people on board.
   ``We know them and a lot of other people who work on the
river,'' she said. ``Sometimes we'll put into port with friends and
have a little party. But it could be a month or more before we're
ever with them again.''
   It's just another work day for the Distels, who consented to
take an Associated Press reporter on board for the day on the
stretch in central West Germany.
   The Distels are still enraptured by the Rhine River's landscape
even though it is a normal part of their daily lives.
   But this is clearly not the life for anyone.
   ``It is not what most people would call an easy life _ we're
under way 14 hours a day, sometimes 10 days straight, and we're
never sure when we might be able to take a day off,'' said Mrs.
Distel.
   But the Distels say as long as they're willing to work long
hours, they can make a pretty good living.
   And it's not every family that has the chance to cut across the
heart of Europe week after week, visiting historic cities like
Basel, Mainz and Heidelberg, and crossing into France, Belgium and
the Netherlands as well.
   ``I really enjoy doing this, and I wouldn't trade it for
anything else in the world,'' said Mrs. Distel, who paints Rhine
landscape pictures when she's not busy with chores.
   Fewer and fewer families are able to afford running a barge
business because of skyrocketing costs and stiff competition from
powerful shipping companies and the railroad.
   Some 2,000 family-owned, live-in barges were registered in West
Germany in 1980, but the figure has dropped to about 1,300.
   Distel is a member of one of the most venerable West German
families still operating barges, tracing his forebearers'
river-working roots back to the 16th century.
   Distel was born on a barge, and spent most of his life on river
boats owned by his grandfather and father.
   ``I went to a special boarding school for kids in shipping
families until I was 17,'' Distel said while on the three-day run
from Ludwigshafen in West Germany to Antwerp in Belgium with a load
of liquid fertilizer.
   The Distels' 19-year-old daughter, who has chosen a career in
marketing and lives on land, also attended such a school.
   During his own school years, Distel would join his family on
their boat during holidays and vacation time.
   ``I've never felt at home on land. So when I finished school I
came to my real home _ the Rhine,'' Distel said.
   Distel does a lot of the strenuous mechanical work on his
40-year-old Stadt Monheim _ named after a Rhine River town near
Cologne. And he oversaw the mammoth job a few years ago of
replacing the original engines for smaller but more efficient ones.
   Like other barge families, the Distels own a thoroughly
modernized vessel loaded with domestic conveniences. They even have
a car strapped onto the deck for use when they go into port.
   Their living quarters consist of a carpeted living room, a
complete kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and washing machine, and
a large bedroom.
   Book cases line the walls of the living room, where there is a
sofa and easy chairs, a caged parakeet they call ``Peterle'' and a
color television set.
   Most of the Distels' travels are on the Rhine, but their
contracts with various companies take them up and down other rivers
as well, such as the Neckar and Mosel. They reach Antwerp and other
places via a web of canals leading off the Rhine.
   Living on the river also has its dangerous side, and families
can face financial ruin from running aground and other accidents.
   But Mrs. Distel says they've been fortunate and attributes that
to her husband's navigational skill and understanding of the river.
   ``I could never work for anyone else, because you lose your
independence,'' Distel said. ``I'd much rather be my own man. And I
know where I belong _ on the river.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Fifty years ago on June 6, a group of
neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a
scaled-down field in Williamsport, Pa. They called it the Little
League. Today more than 2.5 million young boys and girls play on
140,000 Little League baseball teams in the United States and 33
foreign countries. But despite its immense popularity, the
organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the Little
League turned out.

League baseball, you are looking at it.
   The Susquehanna River, its very name a poem, winds down from the
green Allegheny hills through a town of 40,000 souls who live in
clapboard houses with porch swings and shade trees, a timeless
scene off a postcard labeled ``America.''
   Move closer. An American flag large enough to cover a small
infield draws your eye to the north bank of the river. It flies
proudly in front of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields,
the international headquarters of Little League, Inc.
   Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year. Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6,
1939, have grandchildren playing in the league today.
   Still, a half-century seems a relatively brief span for any
activity, however appealing, to attain such astonishing growth and
earn such a solid place in the national culture. A Little League
ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities,
villages and suburbs across the land.
   A three-team league of 30 Williamsport boys in 1939 was the
seedbed for what Little League, Inc. today calls the largest sports
organization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on
140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the United States and 33 foreign
countries. If all the Little Leaguers joined hands the line would
stretch from the Susquehanna to the Rockies.
   ``Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,''
says Carl Stotz, who founded the league while working as a clerk in
a lumber yard. ``All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhood
program. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.''
   At 79, Stotz still lives in Williamsport. He is a man with an
incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save
receipts.
   ``It isn't that I enjoy saving things,'' he once explained to
his daughter who complained about the clutter. ``It's just that I
can't bear to throw anything away.''
   He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for the
first Little League season came to $174.63, that the collection
taken up at the first game netted $1.42, that the first boy-sized
catcher's mask, ordered from Chicago and which he still has, cost
$1.67, the first dozen balls $2. The first year's deficit was
$36.72, which Stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did every
year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black.
   Now Little League, Inc. has assets of more than $10 million and
a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges each
of those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $14 each year and earns
millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the
Little League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which Stotz
designed. The business of Little League is unquestionably big
league.
   Stotz's memory of how it all began is vivid.
   One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two
nephews, Jimmy and Harold Gehron, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at
1108 Isabella St. Running backward, he tripped over the jagged
stumps of a cut-down lilac bush and bruised his ankle. His left
ankle.
   ``I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing,
``rubbing my ankle.
   ``I said to the boys, `How would you like to play on a regular
team with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you can
really swing?'
   ``One of them said, `Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _
`who would we play?'
   ``I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.''
   Stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and
went to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers played
softball.
   ``I used folded newspapers for bases, threw the ball to various
positions and had the boys run the bases. We tried different
distances between the bases until I found what I thought would be
right for them, and paced it off. It came close enough to 60 feet
that I rounded it off to that.''
   Through the winter Stotz worked out the details, rules, age
limits and the like, which have remained essentially unchanged. He
called on 57 merchants before he found the first sponsor, Lycoming
Dairy.
   The next spring Little League was born.
   ``When Carl passed out the uniforms, the day before the first
game, it was one of the proudest days of my life,'' recalls Bill
Bair.
   ``It meant it was really going to happen. Some of the guys put
them on right there on the field. Maurice Reader wore his to bed
that night.''
   Bair, who now lives in nearby Montoursville, hit .462 that year
to become Little League's first batting champion.
   When Korea won the Little League World Series 1984, you can
credit Bill Bair in part. Bair and other Little League graduates in
the armed services spread Little League all across the Far East.
Bair's son, Craig, now manages a Little League team in Thailand.
   Stotz recalls that late in June of the first year some fans
berated the umpire until he walked off the field.
   ``It was the first indication,'' said Stotz, ``of the problems
overzealous fans can cause.''
   Frank Rizzo began as a Little League umpire in 1941 and, at 78,
is still at it, conducting the Little League's umpiring school in
Williamsport.
   ``I've seen some ugly things when the parents get too excited,''
he says. ``The kids walk off the field arm-in-arm, but I know of
mothers who would't speak to each other for a month.''
   It gets worse than that.
   When an umpire named Charles Berryhill called a game in
Waynesburg, Pa., on account of darkness, an irate mother hit him
over the head with an umbrella.

   ``Wabbit Twouble,'' ``Bugs Bunny Classics,'' ``The Best of Bugs
Bunny and Friends'' (MGM-UA Home Video)
   
   The fine print on the videocassette jacket of ``Bugs Bunny
Classics'' says ``pre-'50s cartoons.'' To cartoon buffs, that says
it all. These are the great ones, the Warner Bros. Looney
Tunes-Merrie Melodies classics that will keep you in stitches with
clever lines, biting satire and unrivaled cartoon artwork.
   Like Trix, they are definitely not just for kids.
   Of the three collections, top honors go to ``Bugs Bunny
Classics.'' It includes ``Racketeer Rabbit,'' which parodies movie
tough guys Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre. ``Hare Trigger,'' an
early Bugs-Yosemite Sam duel, is high on the hilarity list, as is
``Haredevil Hare,'' in which Bugs defends the honor of Earth
against a little Martian with high-top sneakers named Commander X-2.
   The title ``The Best of Bugs Bunny &amp; Friends,'' is a
considerable exaggeration. It includes the wonderful ``Tweetie
Pie,'' a 1947 incarnation of that not-so-innocent ``wittle bird.''
But two of the seven cartoons contain racial stereotypes of an
African hunter and American Indian that were offensive then and
remain so today.
   As the name implies, ``Wabbit Twouble'' is 54 minutes worth of
Bugs outwitting Elmer Fudd. Especially funny is ``The Old Gray
Hare,'' in which an aging Bugs (``dern this lumbago!'') is still
too much for hapless Elmer.
   But ``Wabbit Twouble'' also illustrates the built-in problem
Bugs' creators had: creating a comic foil smart enough to spar with
the Wascally Wabbit. Over time, Elmer was just too stupid to remain
interesting or funny. Others, such as Yosemite Sam came along, but
in his recent autobiography, voice impressionist Mel Blanc said
Yosemite was pretty tough on his vocal chords.

   ``Memories of Me'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated
PG-13)
   
   ``Memories of Me'' is almost a completely forgettable movie
until its final third, when there's _ finally _ some action to the
drama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years of
estrangement.
   ``Memories'' is Henry Winkler's first outing as a director and
it shows in the movie's pacing. Much of the beginning is plodding
and self-consciously slow. Poignant moments when young Dr. Abbie
Polin (Billy Crystal) reflects on his callous father hang
relentlessly on dead air.
   Crystal co-wrote the film and created a girlfriend (JoBeth
Williams) for himself, whose role in the melodrama-comedy is vague.
At times, her only purpose seems to be to admire Crystal's rear end
or his sexual prowess!
   The plot finally gets going when Crystal, after suffering a mild
heart attack, treks from New York to Los Angeles to resolve the
decades of paternal indifference. Once he's there, Abbie learns his
dad, Abe the King of Hollywood Extras (Alan King), has a terminal
illness.
   They try to win Abe a speaking part in a movie and validate his
oft-repeated claim, ``I am an actor.'' In the process, Abbie comes
to love his curmudgeonly dad, who returns the favor by softening
enough to tell Abbie he loves him, too, and that in his role as
father he was simply miscast.
   It gets a bit cornball after this, but the ending is far more
compelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slow
start.

   ``In a Sentimental Mood'' (Warner Bros.) _ Dr. John
   
   Those who remember Dr. John as ``The Night Tripper'' who brought
a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find
it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy. Nor would
his usual concoctions of Delta blues, rock and honky-tonk lead one
to associate him with such Tin Pan Alley standards as ``More Than
You Know'' or ``Accentuate the Positive.''
   Even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements
heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of
classic old songs.
   But as an accomplished session player, Dr. John, a.k.a. Mac
Rebennack, is nothing if not versatile. So when he turns his
keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental
ballads such as ``Candy'' and ``My Buddy,'' he knows how to create
the right mood.
   Yet it's clear this is not the doctor's specialty. An inner
sleeve note credits Ray Charles for inspiration; the fact is, Ray
does it better.
   Dr. John's seen-it-all-and-then-some vocal style works much
better on the bluesy ``Black Night'' and on ``Makin' Whoopee,'' the
sassy duet with Rickie Lee Jones that leads off the album. Teaming
those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record, and
it would be great to hear more from them.
   The other highlights are the instrumental title cut (a Duke
Ellington number) and a rollicking rendition of Cole Porter's
``Love for Sale,'' both featuring Dr. John's piano playing, his
true forte.

   ``Kings of Boogie'' (GNP Crescendo) _ Savoy Brown
   
   In an age of ``classic'' soft drinks and candy bars, perhaps
Savoy Brown after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title
``Kings of Boogie.'' But as a souvenir of the coronation, this
effort is pretty stale.
   There's plenty of boogie music here, but you've heard it all
before. On any given night, there probably are hundreds of bands in
bars across the country playing this type of music with more
inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on ``Kings of
Boogie.''
   As always, bandleader Kim Simmons is impeccable on guitar. The
rhythm section is solid and vocalist Dave Walker can growl with the
best of them. The trouble is the material: It's tired, cliched and
forgettable.
   Oh yeah. The album's liner notes, gushing about the band's
``integrity,'' seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a
certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking ``Official Savoy
Brown Merchandise.''

   ``A Night to Remember'' (Epic) _ Cyndi Lauper
   
   That is Cyndi Lauper's name on the new album, ``A Night to
Remember.'' And yes, it sure sounds like her. But for all we know,
it could be Paula Abdul. Or Jody Watley. Or Debbie Gibson. Fill in
your own choice.
   Once delightfully distinctive, Lauper's taken a distressing step
backward into the sea of ``wanna-bes'' with this record. The need
for hits has made her music generic.
   The Cyndi on the ``She's So Unusual'' album was a joy to know.
She was a tough, independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes
not afraid, as the song says, to have fun. Not many artists have
the guts to defend masturbation on their first album.
   Where did that Cyndi go? On the first three songs of this new
record, Lauper defines herself through men. There's the man she
craves so much she'll drive all night to sleep with him; the man
she craves so much she feels ``primitive'' urges; the man she
craves so much she can't bear to spend that first night without him.
   The narrator could be anybody. Although Lauper shares
songwriting credit on seven of this record's tunes, all are written
at least in part by professional song doctors _ people such as
Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly who are brought in for artists
desperate for hits.
   Some of the songs are good; these people didn't get their track
record by chance. ``I Drove All Night,'' in particular, builds
nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced Lauper. ``A Night to
Remember'' is another catchy tune. However, both are weighted down
by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements.
   Some songs are too gimmicky. ``Insecurious'' and ``Like a Cat''
are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper.
   None of the tunes, though, really sound like Lauper's.
   Remember, this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her
first starring role in a movie, ``Vibes,'' was a disaster. This
record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist who's lost her
confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big
investment.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Son of Screen Idol Following in Father's Footsteps</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAVE CREEK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Clark Gable, son of the star
Hollywood called King, has decided to follow in the profession of a
father he never knew.
   The 28-year-old Gable is co-starring with James Brolin and
Richard Roundtree in the Western ``Bad Jim,'' produced by Menahem
Golan's new 21st Century Film Corp.
   The movie has been shooting in the desert plains and arroyos
northwest of Phoenix, and so far young Gable has drawn high marks
from his co-stars and director, Clyde Ware.
   ``I think he's got a lot of his father in him,'' Ware said.
``He's never really acted before, he's never wanted to act before.
He's a race driver. Imagine carrying the load of being the King's
son. I think he carries it very well.''
   The resemblance is hard to fathom. John Clark's face is long and
thin, compared to his father's square-jawed look, and his hair is
light brown, while Gable's was dark. Their height is the same, but
the son is slender and wiry. The greatest similarity is in the
voices. Both crackle with no-nonsense authority.
   One recent afternoon before shooting began, Gable sat down
before a frontier saloon amid a clutter of ramshackle movie sets
called Cow Town and submitted to a rare interview.
   ``Submitted'' is an apt word, since Gable does not easily reveal
himself. That is natural after a childhood in which his mother, Kay
Spreckels Gable, strove mightily to keep him out of public view.
   ``I am a private person,'' he admitted, crediting ``a little
help from my wife.'' She is Tracy Yarro, and they have a daughter,
Kayley, 3, and a son, Clark James, 7 months. But how is he going to
cope with the publicity spotlight that's generated as a movie actor?
   ``Real simple,'' he said, ``just as if I'm a rolling billboard
out there in the desert. I'll play it the same way. It's the same
as in racing: It's all advertising and product.'' He is sponsored
by B.F. Goodrich and American Racing Wheels in his racing career.
   Does he enjoy interviews?
   A rare grin: ``Please don't put me on a spot like that. Yes and
no. It depends.''
   John Clark Gable was born in 1960, three months after his father
died of a heart attack at the conclusion of ``The Misfits.'' The
boy spent his first 13 years on the 22-acre Gable ranch in the
middle of Encino. The property has since been subdivided into
luxury estates, and the Gable house is now occupied by indicted
junk-bond king Michael Milken.
   ``I went back there once and it made me sick,'' he said. ``I
drove up the driveway to my old house and was so appalled at what
had been done to it that I turned around and drove away.''
   Kay Gable protected her son from the press and other intruders,
sending him to private schools _ Buckley in West Los Angeles and
Brooks Prep in Andover, Mass.
   ``She didn't like the way people handled interviews, and she
wanted to protect me,'' Gable recalled. ``She was afraid of
possible kidnapping. She always told me that my father told her,
`One actor in the family is enough.'''
   Gable spent a year at Aiglon College in Villars, Switzerland,
then graduated from Santa Monica City College in 1983. His fields
of study included ``art, ceramics, a lot of science, art history.''
Nothing related to the entertainment business.
   During his college years, Gable became engrossed in motor cross
racing, much to his mother's distress (she died in 1983). He has
jolted through the grueling Baja California race for almost 24
hours straight. Twice he has had serious accidents in races; one
required seven hours of surgery. After four years of motor cross he
switched to class-A trucks.
   What's so great about racing?
   ``I just love it, the excitement of it,'' he said. ``There's
nothing like racing across the desert. They used to cross the
desert in covered wagons back in the 1800s. We're just modern-day
cowboys in full-sized pickups now. It's pretty much the same thing;
we just go a little faster and a little harder.
   ``Fear? I have no fear. I have more fear when I get on a horse.''
   Two years ago friends saw him in television interviews about his
racing and suggested John Clark could make it as an actor. He
studied for two years in acting school _ ``a lot of improvisation,
a lot of classroom work, a lot of work on my feet, with other
actors or solo pieces, the basic things you learn in acting
school.''
   Ware submitted a script that Gable didn't like, then he was sold
on ``Bad Jim.'' Now John Clark would like to do more acting _
``especially action and adventure films; I'm not very much into
romance or any of that.''
   John Clark first became aware of his famed father at a home
screening of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``I was 2 years old, and I couldn't sit through the whole movie
at that point in my life,'' he recalled. ``I was kind of
rambunctious at that age.''
   On another occasion he threw a glass of punch at the screen when
he saw his father kissing another woman.
   ``I really didn't know my father,'' he remarked. ``I used to
love to hear my mother tell stories about him. I was very lucky
that I was able to see my father on film _ what he looked like,
acting, talking, moving. I didn't really know much about my dad
except the stories I've heard.''
   Gable hasn't seen his father's 66 films, but he hopes to see
them all some day. His favorites are: ``The Misfits,'' ``San
Francisco,'' ``Test Pilot'' (his very favorite), ``Mogambo,''
``Gone With the Wind'' (``of course''), ``Mutiny on the Bounty''
and ``Soldier of Fortune.''
   He was asked for a capsule portrait of the man who was called
King. His reply:
   ``He was a very rugged, outgoing man. He was very social and
generous to people, but he also had a very private life. He loved
hunting. He loved fishing. He loved fast cars. He loved motorcycles
and horses.''
   That might also sound like a picture of John Clark Gable.
   `Uh-huh,'' he admitted. ``It might run in the blood.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Little Opera Fills the Bowery With Mozart and Puccini</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stage doors sometimes stick, and smoke effects
have gone up in flames. Costumes are homemade or hand-me-downs, and
actors race out the theater's back door, through a parking lot and
past derelicts on the street to make front stage entrances.
   It's all part of high opera in a distinctly low-brow area called
the Bowery, one of New York City's dingier spots.
   With a 24-hour car park on one side, a transient hotel and
punk-rock club on the other, the narrow, four-story Amato Opera
Theatre fills the Bowery with strains of Mozart and Puccini.
   This everyman's opera company is the creation of Tony Amato, who
fell in love with opera as a youngster shortly after emigrating
with his family from Minori, Italy, to the United States.
   But the Amato theater's unprepossessing style is no cover for
amateurish ways. Since Amato launched his opera theater 41 years
ago, 65 alumni have graduated to the Metropolitan Opera, New York
City Opera and other companies in the United States.
   ``He was a beacon for me. There was a place I could go at a very
young age and learn,'' said Neil Shicoff, a lead tenor at the Met.
He went to Amato when he was 19 after being rejected by the
Juilliard School. After three years with the Amato, Juilliard
accepted him.
   ``The learning techniques of how to act were really from Tony,''
the 39-year-old Shicoff recalled in a recent interview. ``How to
stand, how to really look at another singer and how to not lose the
audience when you do that, or how not to sing directly to the side,
into the wings.
   ``It was only when I sang on an international level that I
realized how good Tony was. He really could take somebody from
scratch and teach you stuff which a lot of directors can't do.''
   Attracted by that reputation, Amato's amateur casts of hundreds
trek over after office hours from throughout the city for a chance
to learn opera's heroic and obscure roles, staging and later to
perform full-length operas before tiny audiences. The converted
storehouse seats about 100; folding chairs are set up for sellouts.
   At the Amato, only the scenic designer and musicians are paid;
the Amatos receive rent for the building. An annual grant from the
New York State Council of the Arts for $4,000, ticket sales at $12
each, a handful of contract performances and contributions keep the
shows running. Last year's annual budget was the highest ever,
$100,000. The season usually includes five productions of about 10
performances each.
   ``People don't really do it for money,'' said 24-year-old Mark
Freiman, who made his debut in March as the lead in ``The Marriage
of Figaro.''
   Amato, a short whirlwind of energy, controls almost every aspect
of his company. He chooses the operas, stages the productions,
directs the actors, changes the scenery, conducts the orchestra.
He's the master of ceremonies, announcing winners of raffles for
Amato T-shirts and videotaped operas. During a performance of
``Faust'' several years ago, Amato even put down the baton to
extinguish a fire when a smoke effect went awry.
   ``My theory is that to have good theater, one man has to be in
charge. When you have a stage director, a music director, a scenic
director and a costume director _ too much friction, too much time
wasted. I experienced it many, many years ago. That's why I decided
to do everything myself.
   ``I used to be a singer. I still sing once in a while, in an
emergency,'' said the 68-year-old Amato, who toured the United
States with regional opera companies as a tenor.
   ``Opera in those days was very bad, badly put together, and I
always realized the lack of good theater in it. So when I had a
chance to, I started teaching to earn some extra income. I realized
how much I could give to it.''
   Dubbed the ``two-penny opera'' in one newspaper account of the
theater's history, the Amato seems to pride itself on making the
most of less. His wife, Sally, helps wherever needed, from sewing
costumes to singing last-minute roles. Props are inventive. Dry
oatmeal was used once for snow, but discontinued when hordes of
mice invaded. Sets are reused, carefully patched up so age doesn't
show.
   The orchestra pit is literally that: a cramped, cellar-like area
mostly under the stage with barely enough space for one upright
piano and the usual accompaniment of 10 musicians. The concession
stand is a small table in the back of the room, where Amato's
sister-in-law sells coffee and homemade rum balls and cookies.
   When scenes call for front stage entrances, actors must race out
the theater's back door, through the parking lot, past a varying
assortment of vagrants, alcoholics and drug addicts and in through
the theater's front door.
   Amato moved his theater to the Bowery 29 years ago. ``Instead of
having dope addicts, we had wine addicts,'' Amato said.
   But there's been no trouble, and sometimes he invites his
neighbors of the street in for a show.
   ``I say if you dress clean I'll let you come in, and they do.
You'd be surprised the knowledge (of opera) some of them have, it's
incredible,'' he said.
   The contrast between the art form and the neighborhood is often
startling.
   ``We're always running around with our costumes on. The bums,
they stare at you and sometimes they think they have had too much
to drink,'' Freiman said. ``Usually when you wear your costume no
one says anything because it's New York.''
   But during one opera, which required tie and tails, several men
asked Freiman for money because they thought he was rich.
   ``It was weird,'' Shicoff recalled. ``I would sing a performance
down there and I would feel on top of the world and you would walk
outside and somebody's laying in the gutter. It's a very strange
dichotomy of emotions.''
   Despite its humble stature, the Amato sometimes attracts opera
critics from such publications as The New York Times and The New
Yorker, especially when it puts on operas not often performed
elsewhere. The generally favorable reviews are plastered throughout
the theater.
   ``Unlike some large opera companies, which dazzle the spectator
initially but then sputter, the Amato Opera's production pulls the
listener in very gradually, gaining momentum as it progresses,''
wrote the Times' Tim Page in a review of Offenbach's ``Tales of
Hoffman'' in 1986.
   Amato used to have more grandiose aspirations than his spot on
the Bowery.
   ``Years ago, I believe I had an ambition to get to the
Metropolitan,'' he said. ``But not for the past 20 years, because I
know I could do more here to help the young artists get ahead and
learn the trade.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Reggae's Got Soul and Toots Hibbert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past
decade, but Frederick ``Toots'' Hibbert just keeps playing.
   Hibbert, who has been making music since the early 1960s before
the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his
first LP since 1981, ``Toots in Memphis,' a collection of soul
standards.
   His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been
likened to the late Otis Redding, one of soul's greatest singers.
The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, ``I've Got
Dreams to Remember,'' and ``Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the
rhythm 'n' blues hit, ``Knock on Wood,'' and Al Green's ``Love and
Happiness.''
   ``I always listened to Al Green, Otis and Michael Jackson,
Stevie Wonder,'' Hibbert said. ``We are related somewhat.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist
Teenie Hodges, who helped write ``Love and Happiness,'' and Andrew
Love of the Memphis Horns.
   Many of soul's greatest artists, including Redding, Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin, recorded in Memphis. The idea for
making an album there often had been suggested to Hibbert, and the
singer finally contacted Island Records president Chris Blackwell
to express his interest.
   ``I'm not just a reggae singer,'' Hibbert explained. ``I can
sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my
style.''
   Thanks to young artists such as Ziggy Marley and Maxi Priest,
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those
who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s.
   Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular
are still around. Bob Marley, the music's most celebrated artist,
died of cancer in 1980. Peter Tosh, Marley's onetime bandmate and a
major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. Jimmy
Cliff, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success.
   In the early '60s, Hibbert formed a ska trio, ``The Vikings,''
with Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Mathias. They quickly became one of
Jamaica's most popular acts, with Prince Buster producing and
Hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits, ``Pain in My
Belly,'' ``Little Flea'' and ``Dog War.''
   The group renamed itself the Maytals in 1966 and won that year's
Jamaican Festival Song competition with ``Bam, Bam.'' Hibbert
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its
name in a 1968 song, ``Do the Reggay.''
   ``We were just playing around,'' Hibbert recalled. ``We used to
have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not
looking so great, `She's like a streggae.' That word was there and
one morning I said, `Let's do the `reggae.' I didn't think that the
name would last.''
   Under the production of Leslie Kong, the Maytals entered their
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae
standards: ``Funky Kingston,'' ``54-46 That's My Number'' and
``Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in ``The Harder They Come.''
   But Hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music,
covering the rock 'n' roll oldie ``Louie, Louie,'' and a
surprisingly danceable version of John Denver's ``Take Me Home,
Country Roads.'' Hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who
performed the original song.
   ``When I listened to it first I thought it was Ray Charles and I
always liked Ray Charles' sound,'' he said. ``I have a
country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice
anytime.''
   Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. Bob Marley's
active support for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley led to an
assasination attempt in 1976.
   Priest and ``Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the
late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey. Ziggy Marley's latest
album has several political songs.
   But Hibbert, who broke up with the Maytals in the early '80s,
prefers to concentrate on personal matters. ``I don't write about
politics,'' the singer noted. ``I write about naturality, about
real things that happen to real people.''
   One of Hibbert's most popular songs is ``Love Is Gonna to Let Me
Down,'' a heartfelt ballad.
   ``It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said.
``It can mean anybody, male or female. `Everytime I see your face,
something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love
lets you down, love also never dies.''
   He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a
member of the Rastafarian religious sect. ``Reggae Got Soul'' is a
better way of expressing Hibbert's philosophy.
   ``I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can
sing it,'' he said. ``Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the
music that carries love and good principles with it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Dying Son and a Difficult Book</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With 80 pages of his first novel completed,
Alexander Stuart received some tragic news: His 3-year-old son,
Joe, was dying of cancer.
   Feeling a ``huge rage at the injustice of it,'' Stuart divided
time between the hospital and the typewriter, throwing himself into
his work.
   The book he had started was hardly a sentimental love story.
Stuart wanted to write about the troubles of a seemingly ``normal''
middle-class English family and decided to use the teen-age son's
discovery of an affair between his father and sister as the central
plot.
   Stuart had originally conceived a low-key approach but changed
his mind after learning of his son's illness. Joe Stuart died in
January at age 5.
   ``It actually proved to be the perfect vehicle in a way to
release my feelings, because it pushed me closer to the edge,''
explained Stuart, whose book is called ``The War Zone'' ($16.95,
Doubleday).
   ``I wanted to write a book which would explore incest without
being too disturbing. The more I researched, the more I realized
it's a very destructive process. I don't think anybody could come
out of it without being damaged.
   ``My son's illness allowed me do it head on, to try and take it
all the way. I hope it's dangerous but in a responsible way. I hope
it challenges what you think and feel, but at the same time feels
true.''
   Stuart's wife was pregnant when the writer developed the idea
for ``The War Zone.'' With Stuart about to become a father, he
became curious about the relationships between parents and children.
   ``I was very fascinated by friends and their fathers, and
friends and their daughters and what seemed to be an electric
spark. I would watch the daughters with their fathers, flirting
with them and their friends. I wondered what it would be like to
have a teen-age daughter.''
   The book's narrator, Tom, is an alienated teen-ager enraged with
his father and sister and cynical about the world in general. The
34-year-old Stuart drew on his own disenchantment.
   ``I think it definitely comes out of something I felt at his age
and now. He certainly does experience disillusionment. He's
horrified by what his father is doing. What interested me in Tom's
character was that whole area of exclusion. All of us feel excluded
at some time.''
   Stuart, born in 1955, grew up in the English town of Bexley,
Kent. His childhood had little of the trauma suffered by Tom, but
Stuart learned that several people from his supposedly quiet
hometown eventually committed suicide.
   ``I do feel disillusioned in a sense. It's very hard to maintain
in life the excitement you had at 12, 13 or 14. Why can't it be as
wonderful as it seems to promise at that age? I suppose that's
partly what the book's about.''
   He did have a sister and remembered the shifting alliances when
confronting their parents.
   ``We used to side against them at times. At other times you sort
of chop each other to get out of something. Certainly, as a kid all
of us have played our father against our mother,'' the author said.
   ``It seems to me the passions within the family are
extraordinary to start with. The family is the environment in which
you tend to develop your relationship skills, if you like. The book
takes it one step further.
   He insisted, however, that the family portrayed in ``The War
Zone'' was purely fictional.
   ``Both my parents read the book and are somewhat stunned by it.
But at least they don't recognize themselves in it. Obviously, one
is influenced by one's childhood, but I did work hard in recreating
something fictional from my own experiences and friends I had
spoken to.''
   Film, not writing, was Stuart's first love. The author wrote the
screenplays for ``Ordeal by Innocence'' and Nicholas Roeg's
``Insignificance,'' and sees similarities between the written word
and moving pictures.
   ``I was fascinated by visual language,'' he said. ``I don't see
it as a division. To me, it's all about using the language that's
available. The camera can be used emotionally, like Martin
Scorcese's `Mean Streets.'
   ``When I write I think in terms of the emotion I'd want if it
were in a film, and than translate and get it onto the page.''
   He was struggling financially while writing ``The War Zone,''
but was too distressed about his son to notice.
   ``I had a huge overdraft, a huge mortgage and was really kind of
feeling worried financially,'' Stuart said. ``But once he was ill
the financial problems didn't matter, they became completely
irrelevant. It doesn't mean anything like seeing your son dying
from cancer.''

   Tammy Wynette's life has had as many turmoils as
a country music song lyric.
   She's had five marriages; her daughter, Tina, had meningitis as
an infant; she's had medical and painkiller-dependency problems;
her house burned; 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned
in another fire; and she filed for bankruptcy last fall.
   A settlement was made in March, the bankruptcy is withdrawn and
she's able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11.
   But Wynette isn't trying to change her image as the country
queen of hurt and lonely. ``It's often said I spoke for the wronged
woman,'' she says.
   Her current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride,'' is
cheerful. She is healthy and has been happily married, since 1978,
to George Richey, who manages her career. They met 22 years ago,
when he was writing songs for her with record producer Billy
Sherrill, who gave her the stage name Tammy to go with her middle
name Wynette. She was born Virginia Wynette Pugh.
   ``I think that's one reason our marriage has been good and
lasted,'' Wynette says. ``We were buddies first. We worked well
together. We could talk.
   ``When Richey and I got married, Billy Sherrill said, `There
will be no more sad songs written.' He was right.''
   But she can still sing sad songs. ``I remember how I felt when I
wrote the song or what was happening in my life when I first heard
it and recorded it. I couldn't get the feeling across to them (the
audience) if I didn't go back and put myself in that position.''
   She and Richey wrote only one song on her new album, ``When a
Girl Becomes a Wife,'' for her youngest daughter, Georgette, who
was married in March in Red Bay, Ala. Her older daughters are Gwen,
Jackie and Tina, who was married last year.
   Wynette's new album, ``Next to You,'' her 51st for CBS, does
contain some heartbroken and wronged-woman songs, such as ``You
Left Memories Layin' (All Over the Place)'' and ``Liar's Roses.''
   ``A sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life
that has happened. You can feel part of that song,'' she said.
   She was interviewed while in New York for her first appearance
at the Bottom Line. Wynette is on a national tour these days. She
tours 11 months a year in the United States and Europe, and takes
off three weeks in December. ``I've got a beautiful house in
Nashville and I live on a bus.''
   The blond singer seems to glow with health. ``It feels good to
feel good,'' she said. ``I haven't had any problems since surgery
2{ years ago. I had one operation and formed adhesions, which
caused the rest of the operations. I'm one of those people who form
scar tissue.''
   About filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, protection against
creditors, Wynette said she and her husband had money in the
development of two Florida shopping centers. The first sold and all
went well. When the second sold, she said, the money was dispersed
to the other partners and her bank credit wasn't paid off.
   ``They sent a federal marshal to our house. They were going to
take everything we had and we didn't owe the money,'' she said.
   ``I think they thought we wouldn't want my name dragged through
fighting that. Whether they dragged my name through mud or not, we
had to do it. They wanted $1.2 million. If you don't owe it, why
pay it? We'd worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody
take it. We made a settlement of $450,000 in November and didn't
get the paperwork done until March 9. We paid them and they're out
of our life now.''
   Richey said three bankers were indicted in the case.
   ``We couldn't explain this while we were in litigation,''
Wynette said. ``I had to just say, yes, I'd filed for bankruptcy.
It was horrible to have to go through it. You don't think people
will do that to you. It's over with. That's all that matters now.''
   Paul Richey, her husband's brother, and Ed Bruce, who wrote
``Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,'' wrote the
current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride.''
   ``It's a cute little song,'' Wynette said. ``It starts, `He was
pushing 7 and I was barely 5, when he rode up on his broomstick
horse and said, ``You want a ride?'' It goes on, `He's almost 67; I
admit to 39.' When I've done it on stage, old and young people love
it.''
   Her favorite song written with her husband is ``Till I Can Make
It on My Own.''
   ``George Jones and I had just divorced. The song said exactly
what I was living.'' She and Jones worked together after the
divorce but stopped that several years ago.
   ``He's happy. I'm happy. Our daughter is happy. We had magic
years ago. To try and go back and recapture that would probably be
a mistake. It's probably best we leave it like it is.''

<HEAD>Wildlife Experts Draft Conservation Blueprint For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Russ Mittermeier about his work, and he'll
talk about marketing, the hard sell, tough choices and money _ just
what you might expect from a sales executive or investment
counselor.
   Mittermeier, however, is a wildlife biologist and vice president
for science of the World Wildlife Fund. He's talking about
marketing conservation in countries where people struggle to find
their next meal. He's deciding how to get the most from a limited
pool of conservation dollars.
   His approach is a sign of a new discipline among
conservationists as they try to sharpen the conservation blueprint
for the 1990s.
   ``I think we've got the potential to find the resources to make
conservation work,'' he said. ``We really have to make good
conservation an element of good development.''
   Other conservationists are thinking along similar lines. In
January, the World Resources Institute issued a report titled,
``The Crucial Decade: The 1990s and The Global Environmental
Challenge.''
   ``If efforts to save species and biological diversity are to
succeed, a more coordinated, systematic and aggressive
international effort is needed,'' the report said. ``The 1990s will
be the crucial decade for action on these pressing concerns.''
   Without a major effort, it said, ``irreparable damage will be
done to the world's environment, and the problems will prove
increasingly intractable, expensive and dominated by crises.''
   Mittermeier is trying to save endangered animals. Saving animals
means saving habitat. The most carefully protected animals cannot
survive if they have no place to live.
   So much has been said about the loss of habitat that the mere
recitation of statistics has lost its force. Each year, about
42,000 square miles of tropical forest are lost _ almost enough to
cover the state of New York.
   It's anybody's guess how many plant and animal species are
disappearing.
   In a report titled ``Biodiversity,'' Harvard biologist E.O.
Wilson tweaked the numbers and came up with this: Species are being
lost 1,000 to 10,000 times as fast as they were before human beings
arrived on the scene.
   ``By the turn of the century, much of the remaining tropical
forest is going to be in isolated parks surrounded by
development,'' said Mittermeier. ``There will be very few places
where natural evolutionary processes continue, where traditional
people continue to live traditional lifestyles.''
   Mittermeier and his colleagues have established three lines of
attack to try to limit the damage:
   _They've identified 10 ``threatened hot spots,'' small forested
regions in immediate danger. The hot spots cover two-tenths of 1
percent of the Earth's surface but harbor 27 percent of all
tropical forest plant species.
   _They've targeted 13 countries as ``megadiversity countries,''
for their unusually rich animal and plant life. These countries
contain at least 60 percent of the world's plant and animal species.
   _And they've identified what they call major wilderness areas,
the few places still mostly undisturbed where, if steps are taken
soon, evolution can continue and traditional people can survive.
   The ``threatened hot spots'' idea came from Norman Myers, a
senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund.
   Without emergency aid, the 10 ``hot spots'' are likely to lose
90 percent of their forest cover within the next decade. That would
mean losing almost 7 percent of the Earth's 5 million to 30 million
plant and animal species.
   Apart from Madagascar and New Caledonia, the threatened hot
spots are in South American and Asia. South America's are in the
Choco region of Colombia, western Ecuador, the uplands of western
Amazonia and the Atlantic coast of Brazil.
   Asia's are in the Philippines, northern Borneo, Malaysia and the
eastern Himalayas.
   Many of the species in these areas have already been lost or
will soon be lost, even if the areas are left untouched from now
on, Myers said. The rule of thumb is that for half of the species
to survive, the remaining forest must cover at least 10 percent of
its original range.
   Myers says that is hardly ever the case.
   Mittermeier developed the concept of megadiversity countries.
``As a marketing device, it's tremendously valuable,'' he said. It
can be used in the megadiversity countries to excite the public
about conservation.
   ``It's a source of national pride,'' he said. ``It tells them,
in terms of natural resources, `we're pretty special.' It's an
effective way of selling conservation to them _ and to
foundations.''
   Because these countries contain at least 60 percent and perhaps
even 80 percent of the world's species, they ought to get 60
percent or 70 percent of conservation funds, Mittermeier has
proposed.
   The countries are Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Brazil, Zaire, Madagascar, Indonesia, Australia, India, China and
Malaysia.
   Mittermeier, whose research specialty is primates, said Brazil,
Zaire, Indonesia and Madagascar contain two-thirds of the world's
primate species. ``If we aren't successful in saving primate
species in these countries, we're going to lose a major portion of
the species,'' he said.
   ``We're not writing off the rest of the world. We're saying do
something in every country on Earth. But strategically, when we do
our planning, these countries should get a major chunk of the
interest, a major chunk of the investment.''
   There is some good news in this story: Mittermeier and company
have identified five major wilderness areas that have a good chance
of survival.
   ``These areas are not under immediate threat,'' he said. It
won't require a large investment to save them. ``You just have to
point out to the countries that this is something you should invest
in for the future,'' he said.
   They are in New Guinea, central Zaire, Venezuela south of the
Orinoco River, parts of upper Amazonia, and in a region that cuts
across southern Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana.
   The other bit of good news is that the World Bank, where
Mittermeier has served as manager of a task force on biodiversity,
takes conservation seriously.
   The bank's mission traditionally has been to foster development
in poor countries, which often put it in conflict with
environmentalists. It made an important change in 1986 with the
adoption of a wildlands policy.
   ``Wildlands can often contribute significantly to economic
development,'' the bank said. ``The Bank's policy is therefore to
seek a balance between preserving the environmental values of the
world's more important remaining wildlands and converting some of
them to more intensive, shorter term use.''
   Mittermeier said conservationists should do two things to try to
save remaining forests. The first is to expand the number and size
of protected areas. But that has its limitations.
   ``They are expensive and will compose, at best, only five to 10
percent of the world's land area,'' Mittermeier said.
   The second tactic is to encourage profitable use of the forests
that doesn't destroy them. Researchers recently found, for example,
that harvesting latex, fruit and wood from a managed forest was
three times as profitable as cutting it down to produce pulpwood or
raise crops or cattle, Mittermeier said.
   ``Development inevitably comes back to depending on natural
resources,'' he said, ``and if you don't use natural resources
wisely, your development efforts and your global economy are
eventually going to go down the tube.''

<HEAD>Microscopic Motors Tested at University of Utah Laboratory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB KUESTERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microscopic motors the width of several
human hairs are running at high speed at a university laboratory,
where researchers believe they can drive tiny saws and drills or
dispense medicine inside the human body.
   The devices, called wobble motors, have a tiny hair-like rod
inside the wall of a shaft that runs on electrostatic force instead
of the electromagnetic force used by regular motors.
   One wobble motor that has a diameter of 560 microns has made
some 6 billion revolutions, said Dr. Stephen C. Jacobsen, director
of the University of Utah's Center for Engineering Design.
   A micron is one millionth of a meter; a human hair is 80 microns
thick; tests have started on a wobble motor 200 microns in diameter.
   Other labs have produced micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
of about 100 microns, but the university's wobble motors are the
first to operate for sustained periods _ more than three lifespans
of car engines, said Jacobsen.
   The device is called a wobble motor because the armature wobbles
slightly as it rolls around the inside of the motor. Since it
rolls, instead of sliding as a normal armature turns, friction is
greatly reduced, making it unnecessary to solve the problem of
lubrication, Jacobsen said.
   Speeds of more than 120,000 wobbles per minute have been
achieved by the motor, he said, and the researchers expect speeds
of up to 500,000 wobbles per minute in the near future.
   The rotation produces high torque, which could be harnessed to
tiny saws, knives, claws or other devices to grip, cut, twist or do
other work in a controlled fashion.
   ``We've used it with a micro drill _ using a 0.002-inch bit,''
Jacobsen said.
   The wobble motor marks a significant advance in the race with
Japan and with several other U.S. research institutions in
developing MEMS, said Jacobsen.
   The potential of such devices is enormous, Jacobsen said. They
could be used to operate tiny pumps that would dispense medication
within the body.
   ``They could be put on the end of catheters,'' for removing
deposits in arteries, ``and they can be used to make other small
machines,'' he said. With their ability to go from full speed to
zero in thousandths of a second, they also can be used to direct
light beams.
   They have applications in scientific instruments, measuring
devices, sensors, manipulation of biological materials, artificial
limbs, display terminals, filters and in computer memory.
   Most of the MEMS are manufactured in the same way that
ultra-thin circuits are etched in the production of computer
microcircuit chips.
   The university's wobble motors are manufactured by a number of
techniques, including extrusion of the motor under pressure. This
microinjection molding is done at pressures up to 20,000 pounds per
square inch.
   The technique offers the possibility of producing wobble motors
resembling hair-thin spaghetti, cutting off as much as one needs.
   The university's project has been financed by a grant from the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and by the Systems
Development Foundation.
   Work began six years ago at the university as an outgrowth of
research on the Utah artificial arm and the Utah-MIT dextrous hand,
a robotic limb built to mimic the human hand.
   In addition to micromotors, the researchers also are developing
microscopic actuators, sensors and other micro-system components.

<HEAD>Study Confirms Anti-Aging Effect on Skin, Finds Lower Doses Do Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest and longest study yet on the
anti-aging effects of Retin-A confirms that the acne cream does
smooth wrinkles, but reducing doses apparently reduces its
effectiveness, researchers say.
   ``There is no question that the more you use, the more you
improve,'' said University of Arizona researcher Clayton Owens.
``In those people who used the strongest doses, what we saw was a
decrease in fine wrinkling, in roughness and in uneven coloring.''
   The University of Michigan found a year ago that Retin-A _ a
synthetic form of Vitamin A known as tretinoin, long used to treat
acne _ dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in
a short-term study of about 30 people.
   Since then, nationwide studies have been under way on how well
it works and whether it is safe. The federal government has yet to
approve it for this use, but it's available by prescription from
physicians.
   Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a strong
statement condemning indiscriminate use of Retin-A to treat
wrinkles.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said there is no conclusive
evidence the drug reduces wrinkles. ``Long-term animal studies and
well-controlled clinical trials involving larger numbers of
patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and
benefits,'' he said.
   The Michigan study used a high dose of the drug and patients
suffered significant known side effects of Retin-A, peeling,
burning, redness and overall irritation of the skin.
   A six-month study of more than 300 patients last year at the
University of Arizona, Duke University, New York University and the
University of Minnesota used lower and varying doses of the drug to
learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the
positive anti-aging effects, Owens said.
   Divided into four groups, the 300-plus patients used daily doses
of Retin-A ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of
0.05, to a moderate dose of 0.01, to a weak dose of 0.001, to a
zero-dose in the placebo group. The Michigan study used
concentrations twice as high, at 0.10 strength.
   Nearly 90 percent of patients using the 0.05 dose showed at
least some improvement, with half showing moderate to strong
improvement, said Owens. Those using lower doses showed some
effects of the Retin-A, but the results were much weaker and
``questionable,'' he said.
   The patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were
chosen because they showed moderate, not severe, signs of
sun-damaged skin: mostly fine, but also some coarse wrinkling, also
blotchy coloring and rough texture.
   All of these factors were visibly and statistically rated, as
were the side effects. In addition, the length and depth of
wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions, and skin biopsies
were analyzed microscopically.
   Patients used the Retin-A daily, along with sunscreens and
moisturizers.
   ``The biggest improvement was in the skin pigment, in evening
out the skin's color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots,''
said Owens. ``The next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling _
the cross-hatches below the eye and in the crow's-feet area. After
that, we saw improvement in texture _ in smoothing out rough skin.''
   There was also some improvement in deeper, coarser wrinkles in
some patients, but since that problem was not prevalent in most of
the patients, it was difficult to measure that impact
scientifically, he said.
   Owens also said the side effects of Retin-A were less than
expected.
   ``Most people had mild to moderate side effects _ mostly peeling
and some redness. By and large, the side effects were tolerated
well. Usually, the effects would last a few days, then go away,
then come back for a few days. After a few months, the skin seems
to get used to the drug. Only three or four people had constant
irritation, but nobody had any serious problems.''
   So what is the best dosage of Retin-A to halt the ravages of
time?
   ``I know this will sound like a cop-out,'' Owens answered. ``But
that is something that has to be determined between the patient and
the doctor. People react differently to the stuff. The doctor has
to assess your skin type. He will know when the irritation is too
much, and if you are using enough to get good results. That is why
Retin-A will remain a prescription drug for some time.''

<HEAD>Shuttle Experiment To Use Vacuum To Make Super-Thin Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The space shuttle's robot arm will tow a
10-foot-diameter stainless steel, dish-like ``wake shield'' on four
future missions to research the manufacture of super-thin films in
the vacuum of space.
   Scientists say the shuttle's wake area, similar to the wake left
by a ship in water, is a region of ``ultra vacuum'' that will allow
the formation of ultra-thin, highest-grade semiconductors and
high-temperature superconductors.
   The dish will be built by the University of Houston's Space
Vacuum Epitaxy Center under a $5.5 million NASA grant announced May
16.
   Alex Ignatiev, a physics professor and director of the school's
Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center, said the experiments should be ready
in 30 months and will fly the first of four missions in the fall of
1991.
   He defined epitaxial growth as the formation of a new material
atom by atom, layer by layer, possible only in a perfect or
near-perfect vacuum.
   On the first flight, a crystalline ``wafer'' of poor-quality
gallium arsenide, heated and then evaporated in space, is expected
to yield several thousand atomic layers of a much higher quality
gallium arsenide.
   He said the materials have to potential to make semiconductors
and superconductors that perform five or 10 times faster than
current technology yet use up to 10 percent less power.

<NOTE>New Study Suggests Northwest Hit By `Recent' Quakes</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of hearths and discarded seashells
at old Indian sites suggest huge earthquakes struck the Northwest
in the last 300 to 400 years, far more recently than previously
believed, geologists say.
   Geologists Rick Minor and Wendy Grant presented papers May 9 to
a Geological Society of America convention which correlate sudden,
dramatic changes in land levels to disruptions of Indian
communities.
   Previous evidence suggested the last major quake was 3,000 or
more years ago, but Grant and Minor said carbon dating of hearth
sites and layers of shellfish eaten by coast dwellers show periods
where habitation abruptly ended. These periods can be correlated to
evidence of dramatic drops in land levels followed by a tsunami, a
giant wave associated with large earthquakes, Grant said.
   Scientists caution that carbon dating is imprecise and that the
evidence, while intriguing, is circumstantial.
   Minor said Indian folklore contains no reference to the giant
quakes, he speculated that diseases introduced by European settlers
may have wiped out the tribes and their ancient oral traditions by
the time ethnographers began studying the tribes in the early 1900s.

<NOTE>Scientists Track Genetic Trail to Bristlecone, The `Proto-Pine'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon State University scientists are
learning to track the evolution of a species through genetic
studies of conifers dating back to the oldest living plant _ the
bristlecone pine.
   The bristlecone pine, which can live up to 4,000 years in rocky,
cold terrain, is the oldest on earth and a common ancestor to all
modern pine species, the scientists said they determined.
   ``With genetic techniques, we were able to figure out with a
high degree of confidence which pine species evolved from which,''
said Steven Strauss, an assistant professor of forest science.
   The bristlecone pine probably has been around for most of the
130 million years that pine trees are evident in the fossil record,
and some alive today sprouted about 2,000 B.C., the scientists said.
   Strauss, a plant geneticist, is trying to engineer useful traits
into the genetic makeup of conifers, like the pine.
   Eventually, it may be possible to create trees that grow faster,
taller and more resistant to insects and disease.

<TEXT>
   A baby's birthweight is one of the first details
of a new life that parents share with relatives. But in some Third
World countries, that important detail often tells whether a
newborn will live or die.
   And often that weight goes unknown because the baby is born at
home and few birth attendants have accurate scales.
   The Program for Appropriate Technology in Health has developed a
portable weighing mechanism, Birthweigh, that can be provided
cheaply to poor countries.
   The scale has no numbers; it shows a square of blue if the baby
is heavy enough _ over 2.5 kilos, or about 5.5 pounds _ to survive
without special medical attention, and a yellow one if it isn't.
   Birthweigh is one of several health devices PATH has developed
since it was established in 1976 as the Program for the
Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology.
   The non-profit organizations, today known just as PATH, have
sponsored more than 500 health programs in more than 30 nations,
world, including birth control, immunization campaigns, and
information for people who can't read.
   Family planning work led PIACT to realize that birth control was
just a small part of what was needed to improve the lives of the
Third World poor. This led to the creation of PATH in 1980.
   Birth control is still what PATH does most. It started condom
production in China, prepared materials for vasectomy programs in
Bangladesh, and provided ``Copper-T'' interuterine devices to
Brazilian women.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides 40
percent of PATH's funds, prohibits it from using money for abortion
or abortion-related work.
   Other funds come from the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), private foundations, and foreign aid from Canada,
Australia and other countries. The organization's annual budget is
about $15 million.
   Few American babies die of diarrhea, but in poor countries
that's not the case. PATH launched the sale in Indonesia and other
countries of an inexpensive rehydration tablet that prevents babies
from dehydrating to death.

   An unusually large surge in income tax
payments helped produce a record $41.45 billion government budget
surplus in April, three times the surplus posted in April 1988, the
Treasury Department said.
   The April surplus was fattened by a $68.53 billion bonanza in
individual income tax receipts, up from the $53.33 billion
collected in April 1988.
   It was the largest monthly surplus on record, surpassing the
previous high of $38.9 billion posted in April 1987 and far ahead
of last April's $13.77 billion surplus, Treasury officials said.

   Congress and the Bush administration, once
intent on rushing to the rescue of savings and loan depositors,
have paused to wage an ardent battle over a seemingly arcane
accounting question.
   Should the savings and loan bailout be on-budget or off-budget?
   One side _ composed principally of House Democrats _ wants to
include bailout spending in the budget but give it a special
exemption from the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, to avoid the
law's automatic spending cuts in the overall budget.
   The other side _ the Republican administration _ is arguing for
an off-budget plan that would borrow $50 billion for the bailout
without counting it toward the deficit.
   A third variation _ pushed by Senate Democrats _ includes the
spending in the budget but loads all of it into the 1989 fiscal
year ending Sept. 30. That indirectly evades Gramm-Rudman because
the deadlines that could have triggered spending cuts for this year
already have expired.
   The terminology of the debate is obscure and the arguments
confusing to nearly everyone but a government accountant.
Occasionally the debaters throw in a jibe about dishonest
accounting or the breakdown of budget discipline.
   To the taxpayer, it doesn't seem to matter that much. All of the
sides, after all, simply are proposing different ways of getting
around the Gramm-Rudman law and no matter what plan is eventually
adopted, the public ends up picking up most of the tab, upwards of
$300 billion over 30 years.
   But to the debaters, it matters a lot. Congressional Democrats
think their position is important enough to risk being blamed for
delaying S&amp;L legislation and allowing the crisis to get worse.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is threatening to recommend
a veto of any bill with on-budget financing, inviting Democrats to
tag the administration with a similar obstructionist label.
   Publicly, the arguments run something like this.
   Democrats: Our plan is cheaper. It allows the government to
borrow at a lower cost. And, it's more honest because all of the
S&amp;L spending will show up in the deficit.
   Republicans: Your plan destroys any spending discipline imposed
by Gramm-Rudman. If adopted, Congress will be tempted to evade
Gramm-Rudman to pay for any costly problem and that threat will
scare the financial markets into driving up all interest rates,
negating any savings produced by the on-budget plan.
   But, the ardor of both sides has very little to do those
arguments and very much to do with the constant dance of politics
that surrounds the Republican effort to avoid getting blamed for
any future tax increase and the Democratic desire to block further
spending cuts.
   George Bush got elected to the presidency on his ``Read my lips,
no new taxes'' pledge and Democrats would dearly love to force him
to mouth different words.
   The administration and Congress reached a relatively easy budget
accord for 1990, avoiding both taxes and painful spending cuts. But
that will become more difficult and the hardball will become harder
as the 1992 election draws closer.
   Democrats know there's an advantage to their plan beyond any
savings it might produce. Even with the threat of automatic
spending cuts removed, an on-budget S&amp;L plan would embarrass Bush
and increase the pressure on him to abandon his tax pledge.
   The Senate proposal would add $50 billion to the 1989 deficit,
ballooning it within range of the all-time record of $221 billion
set in 1986. Not an auspicious start for Bush.
   The House method, approved last Thursday by the Ways and Means
Committee, adds only about $10 billion to the 1989 deficit but it
inflates 1990 red ink by about $25 billion and the 1991 budget gap
by about $15 billion, destroying any hope of maintaining an
illusion of progress on the deficit.
   The maneuvering between Congress and the administration has
deteriorated now into a game of chicken, with each side trying to
blame the other for holding up the S&amp;L rescue and hoping in the end
that neither side will be willing to scuttle the rescue over the
budget question.
   The next hurdle is the full House. Chances are good that an
on-budget plan could pass there in early June. Then comes a
conference committee between the House and Senate, where the Senate
delegation will be led by Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle,
D-Mich., an on-budget advocate.
   Assuming the conference committee approves an on-budget plan,
one last and major hurdle remains. Both the House and Senate would
have to separately approve any conference legislation. And, because
the bill will by necessity change the 1989 budget adopted by
Congress, the Senate must pass the funding part of it by 60 votes.
   There are 55 Democrats in the Senate, so Democrats would have to
hold all of their own votes and peel off five Republicans. Thus, it
will likely fall to Senate Republicans to save the administration
from having to choose between making good on its veto threat or
publicly backing down.

   The stock market pressed ahead today, extending
its six-month-old rally as the dollar climbed in foreign exchange
and U.S. interest rates fell.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which broke 2,500 on
Friday for the first time since the 1987 crash, rose 6.78 to
2,507.88 in the first half hour today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 732 up, 314
down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 33.74 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets today. That
prompted strength in the American credit markets.
   Prices of Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, gained as much as $10 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   That, in turn, encouraged buying of stocks. Falling rates mean
less competition for stocks from interest-bearing securities.
   In addition, analysts say, they reduce the perceived chances
that the economy will have to go through a recession.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up ] at 35}; General Electric, up ] at 54\; Merck, up {
at 72~, and American Express, up ] at 33~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.66 to 179.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .16 at 353.67.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 30.98 points
to 2,501.10, extending its gain for the week to 71.40 points.
   The last time the average closed above 2,500 was Oct. 13, 1987,
when it stood at 2,508.16 six days before Black Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,015 up, 519 down and 456 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 242.41 million shares, up from 177.48

   The board of Holly Farms Inc. has approved
a sweetened $1.38 billion buyout bid from ConAgra Inc. more than a
month after Holly Farms shareholders turned down an earlier
agreement with the rival poultry producer.
   But Tyson Foods Inc., which has been trying to take over Holly
Farms since October, today extended its $63.50-a-share offer.
   Tyson's tender offer will expire on Tuesday at 5 p.m. EDT. Tyson
said it had received tenders of about 8.9 million shares of Holly
Farms common stock by the close of business Friday, which was the
previous deadline.
   ConAgra's new $74.81-a-share stock swap proposal to acquire
Memphis-based Holly Farms is worth a total of $1.38 billion at
current stock prices.
   That is significantly higher than a $1.1 billion proposal turned
down at a Holly Farms shareholders meeting April 14 and higher than
Tyson's all-cash offer, which comes to $1.15 billion.
   Under the new agreement, each of Holly Farms' 18.4 million
outstanding shares would be exchanged for 2.1 ConAgra shares.
Conagra stock closed at $35.62{ a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Friday, meaning Holly Farms shareholders would
receive stock worth $74.81 per share.
   Holly Farms closed at $62.62{ on the NYSE on Friday.
   ``We're not through trying to compete for the company,'' James
Blair, Tyson's general counsel, said in an interview in New York
Sunday.
   Blair said Tyson would consider its options and see how
investors react to the new agreement. He also noted that litigation
connected with the takeover battle continues in courts in Delaware,
and said Tyson would await the outcome of the lawsuits before
deciding what it would do.
   Holly Farms management has consistently shunned Tyson's bids,
although they have been higher than previous ConAgra proposals.
ConAgra first bid for Holly Farms in November.
   After shareholderse rejected the deal with Omaha, Neb.-based
ConAgra, Holly Farms reopened bidding. Tyson has charged the
auction process was unfair, and Blair said Sunday his company was
trying to ``find a way that we could compete on a level playing
field and compete fairly.''
   A Delaware Chancery Court judge last week agreed that the
bidding procedures were unfair to Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson, but
said there were no legal grounds to halt the auction.
   Under the previous Holly Farms-ConAgra agreement, Holly Farms
agreed to sell ConAgra certain of its assets if the proposed buyout
fell through. However, the agreement approved by the Holly Farms
board late Saturday night removed that provision, known as a
``lock-up'' agreement.
   The newest offer is subject to approval of the Holly Farms
shareholders, which were lobbied heavily by Tyson before the last
vote.
   Holly Farms vice president Ted Bailey said the company hoped to
have another shareholder vote by the end of July.
   Bailey said the new agreement also allows Holly Farms to
terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer. Holly Farms
agreed to pay ConAgra a fee of $15 million plus actual expenses if
the agreement fails.
   Tyson has objected to that fee agreement. Blair said Sunday
Holly Farms shareholders were being forced to vote for the
agreement, or have millions of dollars taken away from the firm.

today, pausing to test the winds at its highest levels in more than
a year and a half.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which broke 2,500 on
Friday for the first time since the 1987 crash, slipped back 5.50
to 2,495.60 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New

   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.85 million shares at
midmorning.
   The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets today. That
prompted strength in the American credit markets.
   Prices of Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, gained as much as $10 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean
less competition for stocks from interest-bearing securities.
   In addition, analysts say, they reduce the perceived chances
that the economy will have to go through a recession.
   But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in
its rally since last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038.
They said some traders moved today to cash in on those gains.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States this week plunged by 34 to total 737, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported today.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas was the big loser
with its rig count dropping by 23, the company said.
   Last week, the count had climbed for the second straight week,
increasing by seven to total 771. A year ago, the count was 892.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Others major oil producing states didn't suffer as big a loss as
Texas. California, which had five more rigs this week, was the only
state to see an increase.
   Colorado, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas all lost
a rig each. Michigan was down by two and Wyoming lost six.

   A federal bankruptcy judge today gave Eastern
Airlines another day to consider rival buyout offers for its
Northeast shuttle business.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland adjourned until Tuesday
a hearing at which attorneys for Miami-based Eastern, its unions
and its major creditors were to meet to discuss competing offers
for the shuttle by America West Airlines and developer Donald Trump.
   Eastern and a committee representing its major creditors sought
the additional time so they could continue evaluating the bids.
   Last week, court officials labeled as inadequate buyout
proposals for Eastern submitted by two investor groups; Lifland
approved the idea of selling the airline's prized Northeast
shuttle; and Eastern's own plan to sell $1.8 billion in assets and
reorganize as a smaller carrier gained momentum.
   On Wednesday, Lifland gave Eastern permission to lease 14 Boeing
727-200s to Pan Am Corp. for $57.9 million over three years as part
of its restructuring plan. Eastern had signed a tentative agreement
with Pan Am to lease the jets for $96.6 million over five years.
   Eastern has announced similar agreements with other carriers in
recent weeks, but the Pan Am deal was the first approved by the
bankruptcy court.
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors
since March 9, five days after the start of a paralyzing strike by
its Machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of
its assets, including the shuttle service.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for
Eastern, said last week there were no ``real live offers'' to buy
the entire carrier. He challenged the prospective suitors to risk
at least $100 million of their own cash for any purchase.
   Two investor groups, one headed by Chicago commodities trader
Joseph Ritchie and the other led by former Piedmont Airlines
chairman William Howard, have submitted formal bids.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez may try to use the state's $17 billion
pension fund to back a buyout by the Ritchie or Howard group, in an
effort to protect jobs provided by the airline, according to
newspaper reports Sunday.
   The Miami Herald and the Palm Beach Post reported that a state
investment of at least $50 million was being considered, given the
proper guarantees against loss.
   At the time the strike began, Eastern employed about 30,000
workers, including 12,000 in Florida.
   Lifland, meanwhile, said Eastern had provided valid reasons for
its plan to sell the New York-Washington-Boston shuttle. Eastern
already has an agreement to sell the shuttle to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million, but last week Lifland gave the airline
until today to consider a higher bid by America West Airlines.
   Joel Zweibel, the attorney representing Eastern's major
creditors, said they supported a prompt sale of the shuttle.
   The growing likelihood of a shuttle sale, coupled with the
apparent lack of sufficient buyout offers for the whole airline,
bolster Eastern's proposed plan to cut its size and sell another
$1.4 billion or so in assets separately, some observers believe.
   Phoenix-based America West has offered to pay $415 million for
the shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s in a total package
worth $751 million.
   Trump's agreement with Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. expires
May 27. Under their contract, the developer would receive $8
million from Eastern if the shuttle deal collapses.
   America West has said it would not employ Eastern workers if it
purchased the shuttle, while Trump has recognized the Eastern
unions as representatives for employees of his shuttle.
   On Thursday, pilots union leaders at Eastern reversed their
earlier position and said 170 Eastern pilots could work for the
shuttle if it is sold to Trump.

<HEAD>Warner Says Pact With Shareholder Clears Path for Merger with Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. said today it settled
a longstanding dispute with its largest shareholder, clearing
another potential obstacle to the entertainment company's planned
$18 billion merger with Time Inc.
   The shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc., joined Time and
Warner in announcing the settlement that the companies said would
permit the Time merger with Warner to proceed ``without any delay
or adjustment.''
   The merger would create the world's largest media and
entertainment concern, with $10 billion in assets.
   Warner and Chris-Craft had entered an agreement in 1984 in which
they acquired stakes in each other in what was seen as a defensive
manuever by Warner to avoid a hostile takeover.
   Warner bought about 42.5 percent of Chris-Craft's broadcasting
subsidiary, BHC Inc., while Chris-Craft bought a stake in Warner
that now amounts to about 17 percent. Warner agreed to refrain from
acquiring a television station or making make certain changes in
control while the pact with Chris-Craft was in effect.
   But in the years since the pact was signed, relations soured
between Warner and Chris-Craft and there was some concern it could
delay the proposed Warner merger with Time.
   Earlier this month, Warner sued Chris-Craft, seeking an order
that would have compelled Chris-Craft to resolve any objections to
the merger. That litigation was resolved under the settlement,
Warner spokesman Geoffrey Holmes said.
   Under the settlement, Warner said it will offer to sell its
shares in BHC to third parties. Chris-Craft would have the right of
first refusal to purchase Warner's interest in BHC or require
Warner to spin off its interest in BHC to Time Warner shareholders
after the merger.
   Warner is ending its right of first refusal on the Warner shares
held by Chris-Craft as part of the agreement.
   ``We are delighted that despite our earlier differences, the
relationship between WCI and Chris-Craft is ending on a
constructive and amicable basis and in the best interests of all
the shareholders and the concerned parties,'' the chairmen and
chief executives of both companies, Steven J. Ross of Warner and
Herbert J. Siegel of Chris-Craft, said in a joint statement.
   Siegel was quoted as saying ``Time Warner will be the premier
media and entertainment company in the world, and I wish it well.''
   Siegel was said to be unavailable for comment. Upon the merger,
BHC will be Time-Warner's largest shareholder, owning about 11
percent of Time Warner stock.

   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the drop in prices
based largely on weather factors.
   There was precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas.
And the National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day forecast starting
Thursday calls for normal or above-normal rainfall for most areas.
   The strong dollar also was a drag on the market. Most affected
are soybeans futures. Foreign demand for U.S. soybeans has dropped
with the dollar's rise and some countries are turning to Brazil for
supplies.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's announcement over the
weekend that he may allow farmer-owned grain reserves to come to
market this summer and fall caused only a minor stir among corn
futures traders.
   ``If it were not for other news it would have been a major
factor on the market,'' said Frank Kouba, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was 4{ cents to 5} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.95\ a bushel; corn was 6\ to 7{
cents lower with July at $2.65{ a bushel; oats were 5 cents lower
with July at $1.79\ a bushel; soybeans were 17{ cents to 21} cents
lower with July at $7.01{ cents a bushel.
   Livestock prices were lower and pork prices mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .38 cent lower with June at 70.45
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .23 cent higher
with May at 77 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with June at 48.75 cents a pound; pork bellies were .10 cent
lower to .82 cent higher with May at 35.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock prices settled mixed and pork prices higher on Friday.

   Compaq Computer Corp. today unveiled its new
desktop personal computer, which the company billed as the world's
most powerful and expandable.
   The three 33-megahertz COMPAQ DESKPRO 386@33 models are designed
for applications including computer-aided design, financial
modeling and software development.
   They also can be used as ``fie servers'' or common information
centers for offices that use other less powerful machines at
individual work stations.
   Compaq said the new computer model features a streamlined
ergonomic system unit design that provides eight expansion slots
and room for five storage devices for a maximum of 1.3 gigabytes of
internal memory storage, which the Houston-based company said
exceeds that of any other desktop personal computer now available.
   It uses the COMPAQ Flex Architecture that combines Intel's most
advanced 386 processor, the new 33-megahertz Intel 386.
   The new Compaq series of three models range in price from nearly
$10,500 to almost $18,000. Worldwide shipments will begin this
month, with deliveries in June.
   Compaq is a major manufacturer of desktop, portable and laptop
personal computers.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies At Higher Level After Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with central bank intervention.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar steadied at higher levels in Europe
late Monday after central banks intervened to push the U.S.
currency lower.
   Gold prices fell as much as $6.50 an ounce in morning trading.
   The dollar surged in the first hour of European trading and
continued to gain momentum as it broke through several important
resistance points.
   After peaking in midday dealings, the dollar settled in a fairly
narrow range before a wave of central bank intervention pushed the
currency lower late in the session.
   With the U.S. Federal Reserve reportedly intervening in concert
with several major European central banks, the dollar slipped
temporarily back toward the end of the day, but quickly recouped
some of its losses.
   The Deutsche Bundesbank, following its recent pattern, abstained
from the intervention.
   The Bank of Italy confirmed it participated in a concerted
effort to push the dollar lower as did the Bank of Belgium.
   The British and Swiss central banks also participated, dealers
said.
   But dealers said they expected the impact of the dollar sales to
be fleeting.
   In Rome, one trader attributed Monday's surge to panic-buying
based on the market's perception that the Group of Seven
industrialized nations cannot agree on policies to stabilize
currency rates.
   ``The market is very violent and rather irrational,'' said
another trader.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5815 late in the
afternoon, compared with $1.5750 at midmorning and $1.6190 late
Friday.
   Other dollar rates at late afternoon, compared with late rates
on Friday, and with midmorning rates in parentheses included:
2.0075 (2.0135) West German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7925 (1.7985)
Swiss francs, up from 1.7583; 6.7895 (6.8140) French francs, up
from 6.6700; 2.2640 (2.2598) Dutch guilders, up from 2.2210;
1,455.75 (1,462.50) Italian lire, up from 1,435.00; and, 1.1955
(1.1935) Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose despite sizeable Bank of Japan
intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time
the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.55 yen.
   The dollar's rise hit precious metals sharply.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $361.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $365.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $360 compared with $365.25
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.01 to close at a bid of
$361.21.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.07 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.35.

<HEAD>New Words For Old Hymns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ideology is not rigid. It is not dogma. Sooner
or later it must accommodate reality, a process seldom undertaken
without difficulty and controversy.
   That observation was made several years ago by Prof. George
Lodge in ``The American Disease,'' a book about the transformation
of American capitalism, but it fits neatly with what is occurring
in China.
   Values may persist from generation to generation, but ideology
must accommodate change, Lodge said. Sometimes it doesn't; outmoded
ideology tends to linger, while people and institutions depart from
it in pragmatic ways.
   ``Eventually, we can no longer practice what we preach, and we
are not yet able to preach what we practice,'' said Lodge, who
teaches at Harvard Business School.
   The result: An ideological schizophrenia. New practices bring
forth a new ideology to justify itself, but loyalty to old ways
discourages articulation. A legitimacy gap develops. The old hymns
are still sung, but practices change.
   As the gap widens, two conflicting pressures converge, one
seeking to force errant institutions back into conformity with the
old theology and the other seeking more forceful expression of the
new ideology.
   What China and the entire socialist world are experiencing is
probably nothing new when viewed in this context, except perhaps in
the sharpness of the convergence. How do you erect monuments to
Marx and ignore him too?
   Lodge's book, written in 1984, was an attempt to describe how
the two great political ideologies of individualism and
communitarianism interact in a changing America, one that casually
identifies itself as capitalistic.
   But, as he and others have pointed out, raw individualism in the
United States has been muted by the necessities of community
interests, and now in China and other socialist nations,
individualism forces communism to evolve.
   In the United States, change was anticipated and institutions
erected to make change peaceful. And in a century of slow but
constant change, capitalism has evolved into something vastly
different from what it was.
   Thirty-eight years ago, William I. Nichols, editor of ``This
Week'' magazine, wrote an article called ``Wanted: A New Name for
`Capitalism.''' He felt that in too many people's minds, especially
the minds of foreigners, ``it stand for the primitive economic
system of the nineteenth century.''
   How, he asked, shall we describe this system _ ``imperfect, but
always improving, and always capable of further improvement _ where
men move forward together, working together, building together,
producing always more and more and sharing together the rewards of
their increased production?''
   As told by Frederick Lewis Allen in his social history, ``The
Big Change,'' Nichols had heard various suggestions, such as ``the
new capitalism'' or ``democratic capitalism,'' ``economic
democracy,'' ``industrial democracy,'' ``distributism,''
``mutualism,'' and ``productivism.''
   Could there be a more descriptive name, he wondered, and so he
asked his readers. He got 15,000 responses. ``Never in my whole
editorial experience,'' said Nichol, ``have I touched so live a
nerve.''
   But, just as a China experimenting with individualism may
continue to sing the hymns of communism, the United States is still
referred to as capitalist America.

<TEXT>
   The White House, in an apparent coordinated
effort with the Federal Reserve Board, today moved to try to halt
the surge of the dollar's value abroad, declaring that a further
rise could ``undermine international efforts to reduce global trade
imbalances.''
   The statement, the first time the White House has commented
directly on the dollar since President Bush took office, appeared
to be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the Federal
Reserve in international currency markets, traders and analysts
said.
   And it followed hectic trading in European markets, during which
the Fed and counterpart central banks of Japan, Britain, West
Germany and other European nations reportedly were making heavy
sales of dollars.
   Selling dollars can help to drive their price down against other
major currencies.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc.,
said the Fed began selling off dollars ``about the time of the
statement. It was calculated to have a combined impact.
Unfortunately, the market is shrugging it off.''
   Today's White House statement was clearly designed to invite
international action to halt the dollar's rise, apparently
including heavier intervention by the Federal Reserve and other
central banks to stabilize the currency.
   A statement read by deputy White House press secretary Roman
Popadiuk said the climbing dollar ``is a matter of concern'' that
``has also prompted questioning of the administration's commitment
to the process of economic policy coordination'' among the Group of
Seven major industrial democracies.
   It was a reference to United States, Britain, Japan, France,
West Germany, Italy and Canada, who have jointly vowed to take
concerted efforts to stabilize currencies through a variety of
steps, including direct intervention in exchange markets by central
banks and adjustments in interest rates.
   ``The administration remains fully committed to this process. If
the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies is
sustained for a prolonged period or extended, it could undermine
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances,'' the
White House statement said.
   ``Accordingly, we will continue our efforts to strengthen
underlying policies that promote the adjustment of external
imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as agreed''
by the seven nations, the statement said.
   Although the statement appeared to represent an administration
call for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to do more to
stabilize the dollar, Popadiuk refused to elaborate on it, claiming
its spoke for itself.
   ``The president and the secretary of the treasury remain the
administration's sole spokesmen on the dollar and exchange rate
policy,'' he said.
   The dollar's surge against other major currencies has threatened
to undue recent improvements in the U.S. trade deficit. A stronger
dollar makes imported good less expensive in U.S. markets,
aggravating the deficit.
   Recent intervention by central banks _ buying and selling of
dollars directly _ has failed to stem the rise of the currency.
   Even an increase in a key interest rate last month by the West
Germany's central bank _ a move that would usually help weaken the
dollar _ failed to have much impact on the dollar's rise.

<HEAD>London Shares End Sharply Lower on Interest Rate Fears</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with closing prices, edits throughout.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plunged on London's Stock Exchange
Monday, amid heightened fears that European interest rates might
have to rise to halt the dollar's latest surge.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 35.7
points, or 1.6 percent, lower at 2,169.0, after losing as much as
41.1 points in the afternoon. At its best, the index was up 5
points at the opening.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 33.9 points lower at
1,803.6. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 19.04 points to
finish at 1,233.20.
   Volume was moderate, with 614.4 million shares changing hands,
down from Friday's 856.8 million shares.
   Besides the interest rate worries, dealers and analysts agreed
that the market's strong advance last week, which added 69 points
to the 100-share index, was based more on hope than economic
fundamentals.
   Touching off Monday's plunge was the dollar's rise above 2 West
German marks. This in turn boosted British money market interest
rates, as market participants reasoned that only rate hikes in
Europe and Japan would be sufficient to counter the U.S. currency's
strength.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Well Above 2 Marks in Europe, Gold Falls Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar surged in hectic European trading
Monday, but ended well below its session peaks as profit-taking
slowed the currency's rapid advance.
   Heavy, repeated, central-bank intervention had little impact,
dealers said.
   Gold prices, hurt by the strong dollar, fell more than $5 an
ounce.
   The dollar pushed through the 2-West German mark level early in
the European day, for the first time since December 1986. That
prompted a wave of new buying that took the U.S. currency up to a
session high of around 2.0190 marks.
   The dollar rose nearly 4 cents against the British pound and
more than 3 yen.
   Heavy overnight intervention by the Bank of Japan, which some
dealers estimated sold $1.5 billion for yen, had little impact on
the dollar's strength, as did intervention by the U.S. Federal
Reserve and European central banks later in the day, dealers said.
   The Fed came in a second time in the afternoon, again with
little impact, they said. The Bank of England reportedly intervened
four times, with the first round apparently the heaviest, dealers
said.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's move below its peaks to
profit-taking rather than the impact of intervention.
   In London, the dollar rose to its highest level since August
1987. It cost $1.5810 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6190 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
2.0088 West German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7922 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7583; 6.7990 French francs, up from 6.6700; 2.2640 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2210; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,435.00;
and 1.1956 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose despite sizeable Bank of Japan
intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time
the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.05 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $360.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $365.75. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $359.80 an ounce, compared with $365.25 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.01 to close at a bid $361.21
an ounce.
   Silver prices fell in London to a late bid price of $5.14 a troy
ounce from $5.35 Friday.

<HEAD>Weather, Strong Dollar Drive Down Grain, Soybean Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors reacted to
weather forecasts and the continued rise in the value of the dollar.
   There was precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas
that were suffering from dryness. In addition, the National Weather
Service's 6- to 10-day forecast starting Thursday calls for normal
or above-normal rainfall for most areas.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said tarding remainmed in a narrow range after a drop at
the opening.
   ``But the sentiment was so negative, we couldn't mount a
rally,'' he said.
   Adding to the market's woes is the strength of the dollar, which
analysts say is likely to curtail export of grains.
   Particularly affected by the rising dollar are soybean futures.
Foreign demand for U.S. soybeans has dropped with the dollar's
rise, with some countries turning to Brazil for their supplies.
   ``The momentum in the market is on the down side,'' Karlin said,
adding that despite the low prices, no one is coming in to buy.
``There is a real deflationary sentiment in all the markets.''
   At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 7\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94{ a bushel; corn was 5{ cents
to 9{ cents lower with July at $2.66\ a bushel; oats were 7} cents
to 9\ cents a bushel with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 25\
cents to 28} cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at
$6.93 a bushel.

<HEAD>Brady Says Dollar Investments Against Backdrop of Unsettling Events</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Dollar-Gold Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International turmoil that has sparked demand
for the U.S. dollar as a safe investment haven is a key factor in
the currency's recent surge in foreign exchange, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said Monday.
   In an interview with The Milwaukee Journal, Brady said massive
buying that pushed the dollar to a 19-month high Monday in Tokyo
had to be viewed in terms of world unrest.
   ``You have a million Chinese rioting in the streets,'' he said.
``You have NATO in an unsettled state of affairs. You have, in
Japan, lack of clear definition of leadership really for the first
time since the second World War. So it doesn't surprise me that
people pause for a moment and want to put their money in a country
where the people have settled their leadership question.''
   Brady was in Milwaukee mainly to speak to about 750 business
people and educators at the Baird-Manegold Lecture Series at the
Pfister Hotel, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
School of Business Administration and Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Inc.
   The dollar has soared in foreign exchange during recent weeks
despite waves of dollar-selling for government central banks. The
dollar on Monday traded at levels not seen since December 1986
against the West German mark and since October 1987 against the
Japanese yen.
   The White House on Monday, in an apparent coordinated effort
with the Federal Reserve Board, issued a statement in Washington
declaring that a further rise could ``undermine international
efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.''
   The statement, the first time the White House has commented
directly on the dollar since President Bush took office, appeared
to be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the Federal
Reserve in international currency markets, traders and analysts
said.
   Brady also indicated that recent jumps in inflation stemmed
partly from one-time factors such as higher energy prices due to
the Alaska oil spill and higher food prices caused by last year's
drought.
   ``The figures I look at, without energy and food, are pretty
calm,'' Brady said.
   In remarks prepared for the luncheon, Brady said that for the
United States to sustain and strengthen its position as a world
economic leader in the next century, the government must play a
role in coordinating economic policies with major trading partners,
in working to abolish barriers to free trade and in reducing the
cost of capital to corporations.
   Efforts to coordinate economic policies with trading partners
helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit last year by $34 billion to
about $127 billion, Brady stated.

   The dollar surged Monday, smashing the 2-mark
level for the first time in 2{ years and hitting a 1{-year high vs.
the yen despite repeated central-bank selling and a White House
plea to depress the U.S. currency.
   The rally eased interest rates in the credit markets and helped
cause a huge drop in commodity prices. Gold in particular was hurt,
falling $3 to a late bid of $364.50 a troy ounce, Republic National
Bank of New York reported. The White House issued a statement on
the dollar, its first since President Bush took office, warning
that a further increase in the currency could ``undermine
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.''
   The statement was in conjuction with repeated dollar-selling
efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and several
European central banks. The dollar eased slightly from its highest
levels, but currency analysts attributed that to speculators
cashing profits on the dollar's persistent rally.
   Currency analysts said the market perceives weakness between the
United States and its six key trading partners, known as the Group
of Seven, in foreign-exchange policies, despite official statements
to the contrary. Dealers said that was a key element behind the
dollar's strong gains Monday.
   Supporting that sentiment was a story in Monday's New York Times
that said some U.S. officials would prefer to rely less heavily on
intervention and shift to a more flexible dollar policy.
   In addition, West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde he thought
recent interventions have proven ineffective and that his country
could live with the firmer dollar. The Bundesbank was conspiciously
absent from Monday's intervention.
   ``The market seems to be focusing on disarray in the G-7,'' said
Marc Chandler, a currency analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   However, some analysts contend there's little the G-7 can do
right now to re-direct the dollar, unless major economic policy
changes are made.
   ``I think they (G-7 officials) are encountering a situation not
unlike the situation confronting the Chinese government,'' said
David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc. in New
York.
   ``They have this huge public sentiment out there that is being
expressed in ways not to their liking but there's not much they can
do about it.''
   The United States could depress the dollar by easing credit
policies, but that could undermine its inflation-fighting efforts,
analysts said. High U.S. interest rates, in comparison to those
overseas, make investments like bonds more attractive to
foreigners, thereby increasing the need to convert their currencies
to dollars.
   Also supporting the dollar are growing inflation abroad and
political uncertainty in West Germany and Japan, analysts said. The
unrest in China also was having a positive effect on the dollar,
they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar soared despite sizeable Bank of Japan
intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time
the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. It was
quoted at 142.05 yen in London, and 142.05 yen in New York, up from
139.05 Friday.
   In London, the dollar rose to its highest level since August
1987. It cost $1.5810 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6190 late
Friday. Sterling fetched $1.5755 in New York, down from $1.6120.
   The dollar also pushed through the 2-West German mark level for
the first time since December 1986.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday, included:
2.01175 West German marks, up from 1.9770; 1.7935 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7635; 1.20125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19115; 6.8115
French francs, up from 6.6905; and 1,456.50 Italian lire, up from
1,439.00.
   Dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday: 2.0088 West
German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7922 Swiss francs, up from 1.7583;
6.7990 French francs, up from 6.6700; 2.2640 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.2210; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,435.00; and 1.1956
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $363.20 a troy ounce from $365.70 Friday.
   Gold fell in London to $360.75 an ounce compared with $365.75
Friday, and in Zurich to $359.80 an ounce from $365.25. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold fell $6.01 to close at a bid $361.21 an ounce.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $5.106 a troy ounce from $5.229.
Silver dropped in London to $5.14 an ounce from $5.35 Friday.

<TEXT>
   A Florida investor has acquired a 5.1 percent
non-voting stake in the limited partnership that owns the Boston
Celtics, according to a securities filing made public Monday.
   David Rhodin Murphey III, president of Tampa-based Murphey
Capital Inc., disclosed that he has bought 326,100 units in the
Celtics limited partnership.
   Murphey has been purchasing the shares over several months and
his holdings recently topped 5 percent of the partnership's
outstanding units, requiring disclosure to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The Celtics are a limited partnership traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. The units closed at $13.62{, unchanged from
Friday's close.
   Three Boston investors, Donald F. Gaston, Alan Cohen and Paul
Dupee, purchased the team in 1983. When the Celtics went public in
1986, the three retained a 60 percent share, according to Joseph
DiLorenzo, Celtics vice president for finance.
   ``There are no voting rights associated with those units. He
just finds it a nice investment,'' said DiLorenzo.
   Murphey was away from his office and could not be reached for
comment Monday, according to his secretary.

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 222.25 million shares.
   The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets Monday. That
prompted strength in the American credit markets.
   Prices of Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, gained as much as $10 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean
less competition for stocks from interest-bearing securities.
   In addition, analysts say, they reduce the perceived chances
that the economy will have to go through a recession.
   But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in
its rally since last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038.
They said some traders moved today to cash in on those gains.
   Avon Products led the active list and rose 2] to 34| on
conjecture that the company, which recently fended off a takeover
bid by Amway Corp., might become a target for other offers.
   Compaq Computer, which introduced a new high-power desktop
personal computer, climbed 3[ to 87[. International Business
Machines, faced with that competitive development, dropped 1\ to
109~.
   American Family fell 1 to 16. The company said it was looking
for second-quarter operating earnings per share to be flat with the
comparable period last year, and projected lower results for the
full year than analysts had been estimating.
   Precious metals issues were conspicuously weak, with prices of
gold and other commodities falling. Amax Gold dropped ~ to 11 and
Freeport-McMoRan Gold { to 10].
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $4.28 billion, or 0.14
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .42 to 179.34.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .33 to 369.09, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .74 at 321.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .27 to 441.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 352.98, off .85.

<HEAD>Pepsi Signs NBA MVP Magic Johnson for Commercials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOMERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. said Monday it had signed
Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, the National Basketball Association's
Most Valuable Player for 1989, to appear in its soft drink
advertising and promotions.
   Pepsi said it signed Johnson, who plays for the Los Angeles
Lakers, to a three-year contract to appear in a series of
television, radio and print ads as well as in promotions and
personal appearances. No terms were disclosed.
   The announcement came the same day the NBA announced Johnson
edged Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls for its MVP award. Jordan
already has a commercial contract with Pepsi rival, Coca-Cola Co.
   The first Pepsi commercials featuring Johnson _ who in 1979 was
featured in an ad campaign for rival soft drink Seven-Up _ are
expected to be produced and aired later this summer.
   The soft drink companies frequently have turned to sports
figures for advertising personalities.
   Coca-Cola Co., for instance, has featured hockey star Wayne
Gretzky and players from all 28 National Football League teams in
recent soft drink ads.
   NBA stars Jordan, Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons and
Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks have appeared in commercials
for Coca-Cola products. Coca-Cola also announced last January it
had been selected as the exclusive soft drink of the NBA.
   Its 1979 commercial featuring the football star Mean Joe Greene
tossing a jersey to a youngster who gave him a Coke after a tough
game remains one of the industry's best remembered commercials.
   Basketball star Larry Bird has appeared in local ads for Pepsi
in his home state of Indiana. Yachtsman Dennis Conner and football
stars Joe Montana and Dan Marino also have appeared in ads for
Pepsi products.
   But Pepsi abruptly dropped heavyweight boxing champion Mike
Tyson from its Diet Pepsi advertising last summer after Tyson's
much-publicized marital breakup and personal problems.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices finished mostly lower
in moderate trading Monday amid OPEC-related concerns.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a last-minute buying binge
drove the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, to $20.93, up 33 cents from Friday's close.
The June contract, which traded as low as $20.10 during the
session, expired at the close of trading.
   Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later in the year
were down across the board.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for delivery in June
fell 1.29 cents to 63.90 cents a gallon, while June heating oil
fell 1.08 cents to 46.98 cents a gallon. Other contracts also
closed the session lower.
   Analysts said worries about OPEC dominated trading in the crude
market ahead of the cartel's planned June 5 meeting.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said lower crude prices reflected concerns that
various members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are producing above their self-imposed output quotas.
   An unconfirmed report that Kuwait would increase production
unilaterally if the cartel didn't agree to raise its target level
sparked some early selling, Beutel said.
   ``The reports said that Kuwait was willing to flood the market
or increase production because it wants an increase in its quota,''
he said.
   Another report that Saudi Arabia would ask for a $15 a barrel
floor on crude prices at the June meeting also fueled selling
activity, said Jim Steel, energy analyst for Refco Inc.
   ``It's just pre-meeting posturing, just a negotiating tactic,''
said Steel, ``but the Saudi statement moved the market.''
   Energy brokers said the continued slide in gasoline futures
reflected traders' concern that the market was overbought and that
product inventories remained higher than last year.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting investor reaction to wet-weather
forecasts and the relentless rise in the dollar's value.
   On other markets, precious metals continued their slide, copper
fell sharply; livestock and meat prices were mixed and energy
futures were off.
   Grain and soybean prices dropped largely in reaction to to
precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas and the
National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day forecast starting Thursday
that calls for normal or above-normal rainfall for most areas.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 7\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.94\ a bushel; corn was 5} cents to 9{ cents
lower with July at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 7} cents to 9\ cents
lower with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 25{ cents to 28{
cents lower with July at $6.93\ a bushel.
   ``There were a lot of fund and commission sells,'' said Joel
Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
``After the initial drop at the opening, trading was in a narrow
range. But the sentiment was so negative, we couldn't mount a
rally.''
   Adding to the market's woes was the strength of the dollar,
which analysts say is likely to curtail export of grains.
   Particularly affected by the rising dollar are soybeans futures.
Foreign demand for U.S. soybeans has dropped with the dollar's
rise, with some countries turning to Brazil for their supplies.
   ``The momentum in the market is on the down side,'' Karlin said,
adding that despite the low prices, no one is coming in to buy.
``There is a real deflationary sentiment in all the markets.''
   Gold and silver continued their slide on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   ``There nothing new to say about them,'' said William O'Neill,
an analyst for Elders Futures Inc. in New York. ``They remain under
pressure from the dollar.''
   The dollar's increasing attractiveness has caused many investors
to sell their positions in gold and silver.
   Gold was $2.90 to $5.40 lower with June at $363.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 12.3 cents to 15.8 cents lower with May at $5.106 a troy
ounce.
   Copper weakened on the New York Mercantile Exchange, partly
because of excessive supplies, O'Neill said.
   ``Copper has been on a down trend for the past few weeks,'' he
said. ``Today's close was very negative, adding another level of
technical weakness to the market.''
   Copper was 3.25 cents to 6.65 cents lower with May at $1.113 a
pound.
   Livestock prices were mixed, and pork futures fell on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Frozen pork bellies prices dropped because of uncertainty over
the Agriculture Department's monthly report on the amount of
bellies in storage. But the number, released after the close of
trading, was lower than expected at 145.3 million pounds.
   Live hog futures rose on word of higher cash prices.
   Feeder cattle prices rose in the wake of sharply lower grain
futures and the possibility of less expensive feed grain in the
future. Live cattle prices were lower due a weak cash market.
   Live cattle were .28 cent to .65 cent lower with June at 70.42 a
pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .40 cent higher with May at
77 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .33 cent higher with
June at 49.05 cents a pound; pork bellies were 1.20 cents to 1.45
cents lower with May at 34.80 cents a pound.
   Energy futures were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 13 cents lower to 33 cents
higher with June at $20.93 a barrel; heating oil was 1.07 cents to
1.14 cents lower with June at 46.98 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.01 cents to 1.46 cents lower with June at 63.90 a
gallon.

<HEAD>Army To Give Beretta Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army announced Monday it would award its
next major handgun contract to the Italian arms maker Beretta,
saying a congressionally ordered repeat competition had not
produced a better candidate.
   The service, in a prepared statement, said only two gunmakers
had taken advantage of the congressional order to enter 9mm guns in
the new competition _ Smith &amp; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass.,
and Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. of Southport, Conn.
   ``The performance of the Beretta USA M9 pistol was significantly
better than either of the competing weapons,'' the Army said in
summarizing the results. ``During the testing, both of the other
candidate weapons failed some of the mandatory requirements.''
   Beretta's victory means the company is in line for an immediate
contract option order for almost 57,000 pistols worth $9.9 million.
That order will bring to almost 378,000 the number of pistols
ordered by the Army.
   Over the next several years, however, new orders are expected to
swell the orders to more than 500,000 total, according to the Army.
   Assuming congressional leaders accept the test results, Monday's
announcement would end a five-year battle over the Army's decision
to turn to a foreign company for the handgun that is replacing the
venerable Colt .45 pistol.
   Testing of replacements began in 1984. Of the original eight
competitors, four were eliminated _ including Smith &amp; Wesson _ and
two others withdrew. The Army then selected Beretta for the work in
April 1985, touching off protests from Capitol Hill.
   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,
Md., is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi Beretta SpA.
   The Massachusetts delegation, in particular, went to bat for
Smith &amp; Wesson and in 1987 the House Appropriations Committee told
the Army it would have to stage a new competition before awarding
additional contracts.
   The Army grudgingly complied, issuing a request for interested
bidders in May 1988. As the competition began, the prospects of
another winner appeared to improve for a time because of
well-publicized problems with cracking metal slides on the Beretta
pistol.
   But Monday, the Army said ``the demonstrated performance'' of
the Beretta pistol during the competition ``and the failure of the
two other candidates to meet the minimum performance requirements''
made its choice easy.
   The service refused to spell out which standards the Smith &amp;
Wesson and Sturm, Ruger pistols had failed to meet. But the guns
were being measured on everything from the design of the magazine
and trigger guard to corrosion protection; accuracy; reliability;
firing pin energy; safety mechanisms, and ability to withstand
various climatic conditions.

<HEAD>Tyson Sues To Block Latest Holly Farms-ConAgra Deal; Extends Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods extended its $63.50 a share
tender offer to acquire Holly Farms Inc. on Monday and then filed
suit to block the company's latest deal with rival suitor ConAgra
Inc.
   Under a new agreement announced Sunday, ConAgra, of Omaha, Neb.,
would acquire Memphis-based Holly Farms in a $74.81-a-share stock
swap that values the company at about $1.38 billion.
   The bid tops the $1.1 billion ConAgra agreement that Holly Farms
shareholders rejected April 14 and the current all cash offer from
Springdale-based Tyson, which values Holly Farms at about $1.15
billion.
   Tyson extended its offer until 5 p.m. Tuesday.
   Under the proposed ConAgra-Holly Farms agreement, each of Holly
Farms' 18.4 million outstanding shares would be exchanged for 2.1
ConAgra shares.
   Conagra stock closed at $33.62{ a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Monday, down from $2. Holly Farms closed
at $67.12{ a share, up $4.50.
   Tyson chief counsel Jim Blair said Monday that the new Holly
Farms agreement with ConAgra was unfair and his company filed suit
in Delaware Chancery Court to block it.
   Blair said in a telephone interview from New York that the suit
asks the court to block Holly Farms from completing any merger with
ConAgra ``until such time as all the impediments that now keep us
from now being able to compete on a fair and equal basis are
eliminated.''
   Holly Farms has been rebuffing Tyson takeover proposals since
last October. After shareholders rejected its initial deal with
ConAgra, Holly Farms reopened bidding for the compan by Tyson has
claimed the auction process was unfair.
   Last week, a Delaware Chancery Court judge agreed that the
bidding procedures were unfair to Tyson but said there were no
legal grounds to halt the auction.
   In a news release Monday, Tyson chairman Don Tyson said he was
surprised that Holly Farms' proceeded with the auction process over
the weekend, considering the judge's criticism of the process.
   ``We are considering all of our alternatives and have not made
any decisions as to what we will do,'' Tyson said.
   Under the previous Holly Farms-ConAgra agreement, Holly Farms
agreed to sell ConAgra certain prize assets if the proposed buyout
fell through. However, the agreement approved by the Holly Farms
board late Saturday night removed that provision, known as a
``lockup'' agreement.
   The newest offer is subject to approval by Holly Farms
shareholders. Holly Farms vice president Ted Bailey said the
company hoped to have another shareholder vote by the end of July.
   Bailey said the new agreement also allows Holly Farms to
terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer. Holly Farms
agreed to pay ConAgra a fee of $15 million plus actual expenses if
the latest agreement falls through.

   The publishers of Entrepreneur Magazine said
Monday they intend to begin publishing a magazine designed for
women who are starting their own businesses.
   The magazine will be called Entrepreneurial Woman which will
debut with an issue in June and appear once every two months
starting in February.
   ``This is a business magazine for women,'' said Clare Thain,
publisher and president of the Irvine, Calif.-based magazine
concern. ``There is a great distinction between this magazine and
publications like Working Woman and Savvy, which are lifestyle
magazines for women who work.''
   The magazine will provide practical advice on how to start a
business and keep it running, much as the magazine Entrepreneur has
provided.
   But Thain said Entrepreneurial Woman will consistently address
issues of relevance to women, such as how to obtain financing and
how to balance business with family responsibilities as well as
stories on women role models.
   The first issue, for instance, has stories on cars suited to
women's entreprenuerial lifestyles, the prospects for the
infant-products industry and the only woman to run a record label.
   Thain said he is convinced there is a market for such a magazine
because one in four subscribers to Entrepreneur are women and
government statistics indicate four out of five new business owners
are women.
   He said his two magazines will not carry the same stories and as
a result should not dilute the original magazine's circulation.
   Entrepreneur has a circulation rate base of 300,000 effective in
July. Entrepreneurial Woman will have a rate base of 200,000.

   A surge in the dollar and an improved outlook
for inflation propelled bond prices sharply higher and drove
interest rates downward Monday.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13-16 point, or
nearly $12 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.59
percent, the lowest closing yield since March 1988, and was down
from 8.70 percent on Friday. Bond prices and yields move in
opposite directions.
   The dollar broke an important psychological barrier, 2 West
German marks, and hit a 1{-year high against the Japanese yen
despite repeated intervention by central banks and a plea from the
White House to depress the U.S. currency.
   The dollar's surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodity
prices, and that in turn increased bond traders' hopes that
inflation would slow down and the economy would cool off, analysts
said.
   When the economy is slow, the Federal Reserve Board is less
likely to tighten credit, which raises interest rates and sends
bond prices lower.
   Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., said money that had flowed out of bonds as
interest rates rose was changing direction and moving back into
Treasury securities.
   ``People are realizng the economy is slowing down,'' he said.
``People are underinvested in bonds.''
   Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., a money market research firm, said he expected
bond prices to continue to move higher because ``There's a lot of
people who want to get on the bandwagon.''
   ``We've probably seen the high (interest) rates for this
business cycle,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments were up between 3-16 point and 5-16 point,
intermediate maturities were up between ] point and 13-16 point and
long-term issues advanced ~ point, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, jumped 6.40 to 1,154.97.
   In corporate trading, industrials also were higher. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, gained 1.86 to 314.01.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 13-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.41 percent from 7.44 percent late Friday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, slipped to 8.60
percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 8.32 percent. Yields
on six-month bills dropped to 8.76 percent as the discount fell 7
basis points to 8.30 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.76
as the discount declined 9 basis points to 8.13 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was 911-16 percent, up from 9| percent on Friday.

   Interco Inc. said Monday it has agreed to sell
furniture dealer Ethan Allen Inc. to Green Mountain Holding Corp.
for about $388 million in the latest part of its restructuring.
   Green Mountain is a new company formed by senior Ethan Allen
managers and outside investors led by Castle Harlan Inc.
   Officials said Ethan Allen dealers and the Ethan Allen employees
profit sharing plan will invest in the transaction.
   In addition to the sale price, Interco said it will receive
warrants to purchase up to 8 percent of the common stock of the new
corporation during a five-year period.
   The sale is part of the Interco's restructuring program, which
it adopted last year to defend against a hostile takeover attempt.
   In December, the company sold Londontown Corp. to Elderberg
Acquisition Corp. for $178 million and earlier this month it
announced a definitive agreement to sell its Central Hardware Co.
subsidiary to an entity formed by Salomon Brothers Holding Co. for
about $245 million.
   Interco said it would retain its Converse and Florsheim footwear
manufacturers and Browyhill and Lane furniture and home furnishers
as its four core businesses.
   In the Ethan Allen deal, senior debt is being provided by
Chemical Bank and subordinated debt is being provided by Kidder
Peabody Group Inc. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The deal includes $357 million in cash, real estate assets and
the assumption by the purchaser of about $23.5 million in existing
debt and capitalized leases.

   Condominiums, shopping malls and office buildings
may go on the block as the government disposes of assets from
failing savings and loans, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
L. William Seidman said Monday.
   The agency eventually could control between $300 billion and
$500 billion in failing thrifts' assets and sell off between $50
billion and $100 billion in non-performing assets, such as
repossessed property, Seidman said.
   The Bush administration has proposed creating the Resolution
Trust Corp. as part of its $157 billion S&amp;L bailout plan, he said.
   ``It (RTC) will be in the sole business of restructuring all
those S&amp;Ls,'' Seidman told reporters before addressing the Economic
Club of Detroit. ``That means it will probably have to restructure
the institutions so the private sector can buy them.''
   Taxpayers will pay most of the cost of the bailout plan, which
involves closing or merging more than 500 failed institutions.
   ``What the government did was hand its credit card to a bunch of
institutions and said, `Here, you can borrow on our credit' _
that's what deposit insurance is,'' he said. ``Now that the people
who lent them the money want the money back, the government either
pays it or the deposit insurance system fails.
   ``Since the government can't allow the deposit insurance system
to fail, the taxpayers will have to pay.''
   Under the plan introduced in February, 219 insolvent S&amp;Ls have
been placed under FDIC conservatorship and another 60 have been
targeted for takeover by the agency, which will guarantee
depositors' assets.

   Lane will be succeeded as head of the Oldsmobile Division by J.
Michael Losh, general manager of the company's Pontiac Division.
Succeeding Losh will be John G. Middlebrook, now GM's vice
president for marketing and the product planning staff.
   The appointments are effective June 1, and a successor to
Middlebrook will be announced later, the company said.
   Pontiac generally is seen as the performance-oriented division
of the nation's largest automaker. Oldsmobile has had a reputation
of an upscale, conservative line of cars and GM recently has been
loading its cars with a wide variety of technical and electronic
developments.
   Lane, 59, who has headed the Oldsmobile Division since 1985,
started with the corporation in 1953 as a clerk in Oldsmobile's
Chicago office. He worked mainly in sales in the Oldsmobile and
Pontiac divisions.
   Losh, 43, has been head of the Pontiac Division since 1984.
Before that, he worked in GM's treasurer's office and at GM
affiliates in Mexico and Brazil.
   Middlebrook, 48, was named to his current post in 1987 after
working in product planning and sales jobs in the corporation.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruehauf Corp. reported Monday $241.7 million in
first- quarter losses, mostly in estimated losses from the sales of
its trailer and marine divisions.
   Freuhauf, the trucking and automitive parts maker that was sold
to Varity Corp. earlier this month, said the one-time loss for the
two divisions was $236 million.
   Without the loss from the sales, the company reported losses of
$5.7 million in the first three months of the year, compared with
$16.4 million in losses in the same 1988 period.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $332.9 million from $257.8
million in the first three months of last year.
   Fruehauf in March said a subsidiary of Terex Corp. had bought
the company's trailer and maritime operations for about $232.5
million. The rest of Fruehauf was sold to Varity for $436 million
and 55.5 million shares of Varity stock.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Sharply Higher, Share Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar opened sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange plunged.
   The dollar started trading at 142.05 yen, up 1.60 yen from
Monday's close of 140.45 yen. It was the highest opening since Oct.
27, 1987, when the currency opened at 142.10 yen.
   Traders said the currency's jump in Tokyo followed its overnight
gain in New York.
   ``The dollar started remarkably higher but trading is quiet
right now,'' said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo. ``Buying and
selling of the currency has been mixed so far in Tokyo.''
   He said speculative investors' dollar-buying has resulted in the
U.S. unit's recent surge.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the market to halt
the dollar's further rise. The central bank does not inform the
public of its monetary activities.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 65.9 points the previous day, quickly lost
319.99 points, or 0.94 percent, to fall to 33,747.87 within the
first 15 minutes of morning trading.
   Dealers said prices were lower almost across the board.
   An analyst at Nomura Securities said the plunge was largely due
to the yen's sharp drop.
   Other dealers said expectations for the possible official
discount rate hike by the Bank of Japan also discouraged market
players.
   Market analysts and media reports have speculated that the bank
will raise the rate soon, in part to combat the U.S. dollar's
excessive rise against the yen. The central bank has made no
official announcements.

<HEAD>Technological Advances Pose Threat to Protectionism, Fed Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Monday protectionism in world trade will become increasingly
difficult to sustain as technological advances continue and the
goods being traded get physically smaller.
   Greenspan, speaking at the annual dinner of the Japan Society,
said that as technology has progressed, economic growth has shifted
toward analytical advances rather than producing an increased
physical volume of goods.
   Once-bulky radios now are powered by pocket-sized transistor
packs, metal beverage cans are thinner than they once were, tiny
fiber optics are being used in place of tons of copper, and new
buildings use less concrete, glass and steel than they once did,
Greenspan said in citing a few examples.
   This ``marked downsizing of economic output'' has made it easier
for goods and services to move across national borders _ and
creates a dilemma for countries that want to restrict trade, he
said.
   ``The extraordinary downsizing of goods will make protectionism
increasingly difficult to sustain in the years ahead, in the same
sense that repressive national governments will have difficulty in
blocking the satellite-transmitted flow of ideas to their people,''
Greenspan said.
   The Fed chairman said downsizing also could help relieve
inflationary bottlenecks in the production process, as additional
supplies from other world producers become more readily and quickly
available to fill shortages.
   ``As we progress toward general downsizing of economic output,
worldwide production and inventory controls become far more
feasible and inflationary dislocations less likely,'' Greenspan
said.
   He said that while a major world economic disruption could
quickly bring back earlier protectionist barriers, ``technology is
irreversible. The downsizing of goods will continue.
   ``As a consequence, the ability to suppress worldwide trade will
become progressively more difficult in the decades ahead,'' he said.
   Greenspan cautioned that while the world trading system
generally has become more open since the end of World War II, ``we
also have seen some significant steps backward.''
   ``We do not now have as liberal a trade and marketing
environment as we will require if we are to continue to reap the
benefits of specialization, downsizing and technological change,''
he said.
   Greenspan said the coordinated efforts of the seven major
industrialized nations, which now hold annual economic summit
meetings, should help hold back protectionism.
   ``This process is bound to expand and become ever more pervasive
as the cross-border trade in goods and services grows as a
proportion of world domestic demand,'' he said.
   Greenspan was introduced at the dinner at a Manhattan hotel by
his predecessor as Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, a member of the
Japan Society's board.
   The Japan Society describes itself as a non-profit organization
dedicated to cultural, educational and political affairs.

<HEAD>Delta Plans Expanded Fleet, More Overseas Service by 2000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines will spend about $12 billion to
expand its fleet and increase overseas markets by the year 2000,
the company's chief executive officer said Monday.
   Delta plans to add more than 300 planes to its active fleet of
396 planes, Hollis L. Harris told a travel industry conference.
   Harris said most of Delta's planned expansion is in the European
and Pacific markets and is needed because of expected increases in
air travel.
   The Federal Aviation Administration predicts that by 2000, the
number of air passengers will increase to 761 million annually from
455 million in 1988.
   Harris said the Eastern Airlines strike has helped Atlanta-based
Delta but has had a mixed effect on the airline industry.
   He said he empathizes with Eastern workers but would like to see
the reorganization plan by Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, work
so the strikers could regain their jobs.

   An oil company executive said Monday the
Exxon Valdez oil spill was the catalyst for gasoline price
increases around the country that would have occurred anyway by
mid-summer.
   With worldwide oil production down and crude oil prices up since
November, gasoline prices in the United States were bound to go up,
said Tom Burns, manager of the economic department of Chevron USA.
   Since the first of the year, retail markets had been resisting
upward pressure on gasoline prices, Burns said.
   However, he said, the ``massive uncertainty'' surrounding the
continued flow of oil from Alaska after the Exxon Valdez ran
aground March 24 in Prince William Sound opened the way for price
increases.
   Burns was one of several oil executives who attended a meeting
of top justice officials from seven states and representatives of
Chevron and Mobil Oil called by Oregon Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer.
   Earlier Monday, an economist said the loss of the oil from the
Exxon Valdez could not be blamed for rising gasoline prices because
West Cost refineries kept up production despite a brief drop in
crude oil shipments from Alaska.
   ``It did not have the impact in the production of gasoline,''
Keith Leffler of the University of Washington said.
   Leffler said his research indicated gasoline price increases
were linked to rising ``refinery margins,'' or increases in the
difference between the prices refineries pay for crude oil and the
prices they charge for finished products.
   Other oil companies were invited to the meeting. Shell Oil,
Atlantic-Richfield and Exxon, whose Exxon Valdez tanker caused the
spill, agreed to private meetings later in the week at Frohnmayer's
office in Salem.
   Attorneys general from Washington, Oregon, Idaho and North
Dakota attended the meeting, along with top deputy attorneys
general from California, Alaska and Indiana.
   The meeting preceded the summer driving season, which begins
this weekend.
   Leffler was hired by Oregon and other Western states to analyze
gasoline price increases after prices shot up between mid-March and
mid-April by an average of 20.1 cents in Portland, 16.9 cents in
Seattle and 18.6 cents in Boise, Idaho.
   The tanker spilled 10.9 million gallons of crude oil, and
restrictions imposed by the U.S. Coast Guard curtailed shipments of
Alaskan crude oil for nearly two weeks afterwards.
   However, Leffler said, despite the ``loss'' or late delivery of
546 million gallons of crude, gasoline production remained steady,
with only a slight dip in the week after the accident.
   The economist said crude oil prices and retail gasoline prices
both jumped right after the accident. Uncertainty over how the
spill would affect supplies of crude oil probably was behind the
increases, Leffler said.
   Crude oil prices then dropped as the international oil market
adjusted to the dip in Alaskan supplies, Leffler said. Dealer
margins, up right after the spill, also dropped, but the price of
gasoline kept going up, he said.
   What went up, and did not come back down, were the refinery
margins, Leffler said.
   In the midst of ``massive uncertainty'' over whether gasoline
supplies would fall, Leffler said, refineries were able to increase
their margins.
   ``You and I see that reflected in the price we pay at the
pump,'' he said.
   Leffler told the state officials that he was unable to say
whether the refinery margins, which still were going up six weeks
after the spill, were justified.
